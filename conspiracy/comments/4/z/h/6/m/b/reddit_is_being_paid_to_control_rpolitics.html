    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. Having worked for an online PR firm for a number of years, I know first-hand how much digital deception exists to counter the truth or construct fictional realities. Makes sense that the government has organized the practice in order to discredit, promote misinformation, and direct public opinion on all matters. Still, it scares the shit out of me in ways that other media and propaganda has not. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame that social media and the Internet in general make their job so easy.  For years I used Tor for these reasons but I started to distrust it too so I jumped ship. I have to say despite doubts about Tor at least I could go online and not be distracted by my shopping history or algorythym selected headlines based on my profile and intended to manipulate my thoughts. Spooky shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My post citing Mike Rowe&#39;s article about the media and politicians talking down on trump voters, calling them &quot;uneducated white males&quot; was deleted from r/politics yesterday.  I was told my post had nothing to do with politics!  There is your current state of Reddit </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you, this is an old account I use occasionally because it got gold multiple times. It let me bypass a lot of the bullshit &quot;maybe this is a bot&quot; filters. For the first time in months of using this account I was locked out to only being able to post every 7 minutes in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I was also suspended there for the first time ever. Thats why I decided to make this post. Its just ridiculously over the time.</p>

<p>If we let Reddit get away with this they will consider it a valid source of monetizing the site and they&#39;ll seek it out. Next election it will be 10x worse after they learn from this and establish the right relationships.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t joking by the way, who wants to start a new site?</p>

<p>Everyone tried to leave to voat.co but it was promoted when racist subs were banned here so the core group there was a kind of hateful group that turned off many people. I want to create a new site, with limited moderator power and open logging, maybe funded entirely by donations. Keep it quiet, work out the details, then launch a massive promotion campaign. Any other developers interested?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree many of the mods here are sucks, but there&#39;s a need for some alert mods to run off trolls and keep idiots from detailing good discussion. However, I resent censoring on this site and have personally experienced it a number of times. When somebody takes the time to write a meaningful relevant post, they should not be censored because some mod&#39;s politics or perspective doesn&#39;t align with theirs. </p>

<p>The biggest strength Reddit has going is it&#39;s users. I&#39;m a few subs that I frequent, there are great communities with intelligent, interesting, and open minded readers who make logging in worth my time. Overall, Reddit has pretty cool people sharing provocative posts or simply providing a much needed laugh. The rest of the rigid rules, the dickhead just out of college know it alls, mod bullying and strong arm control can screw off. </p>

<p>It would be great to start a new site but that&#39;s hard work and a lot of time. There is always the option of voicing dissatisfaction in large enough numbers that the Gods would be hard pressed to ignore it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been happening for years. Any mainstream website you use is heavily moderated by military/government organisations. Do people think propaganda stopped being produced after the cold war or something? Its amazing to me the amount of people who find the reality of political shills to be so unbelievable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just them being paid. The whole CTR thing is a cover for the hijacked military takeover. REDDIT = GOOGLE = CIA = FBI = TWITTER = USA = ISRAEL = GLOBALISTS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the large subs are garbage. <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is the fly in the ointment, but it will ultimately be no better. Some of the smaller subs are still worthwhile, but otherwise reddit continues downward...</p>
