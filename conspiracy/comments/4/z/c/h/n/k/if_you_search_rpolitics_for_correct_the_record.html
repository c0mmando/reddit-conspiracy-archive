        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No matter what your political alignments, or who you&#39;re voting for, this is a major issue that the Reddit admins and mods will not address. Ellen Pao received far more attention than this, yet look at the state of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, for example. Essentially the vast majority of threads are anti Trump, and are often posted by accounts which were created a very short while ago. The probability of their not being even ONE thread or comment in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> that mentions Correct the Record in the past month or so, is impossible. Yet, literally any mention of it has been scrubbed altogether, similar to districts where candidates receive zero votes during an election. It&#39;s so extreme it&#39;s impossible. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&#39;ve removed some usernames so this post can&#39;t be flagged for witch hunting. Some recent accounts have obvious names, equating Trump to Hitler in all caps, or with capitalized &quot;C T R&quot; in their names. Two accounts which posted high ranking material this morning, bothing ending in &quot;Ariel&quot; and stylized the same, were created 23 hours ago, posting similar material. <strong>Note: Please do not vote or touch these accounts. This is not a witch hunt. I do not think this qualifies as such, though, because these are all obviously fake accounts not run by individuals, but organizations. On any given day, on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, you can find tons of similar accounts yourself. These are just some of many.</strong></p>

<p>In those threads, the short-lived nature of these accounts, and their obvious shilling, is never addressed. Instead, some of the top comments are also by similar accounts. One account for example, which aimlessly goes along with posting a generic anti Trump comment, is 21 days old with 100k comment karma. </p>

<p>One group posts in mass, while another group&#39;s aim is to dominate top comments. This isn&#39;t about politics for me, but this tactic as a whole. And what&#39;s most concerning is how transparent and nonchalant it is. The tactics used are the very same ones found in <a href="/r/HailCorporate">/r/HailCorporate</a>. </p>

<p>We should aim to have topics like this reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> once in a while, so that there is a higher level of awareness. Similar to <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, but minus the childish attention whoring. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly why they pose the third-party candidates as spoilers and publicize so many two-way polls.</p>

<p>If the average American citizen acted in their best interests, the two main parties would be the wacko spoilers.  In fact, they pretty much already are. </p>

<p>Politics is broken, everyone knows it, and only few know how to fix it.  We need to break the bi-partisan dominance.  I don&#39;t foresee an honest Democrat or Republican ever again.  What&#39;s the point, when we&#39;ve already proven we don&#39;t care?</p>

<p>But if the message driven into your head is a 1v1 race with no outside chances or a &quot;spoiler&quot;, you&#39;re getting played.  Is it that tough to put together that the same people running the media are the establishment candidate&#39;s top donors?  Is it that tough to put together that the corporations are driving your thoughts far, far away from an actual politician?  One who can fight within the system to regain control?  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want us to get back control.  They just keep feeding us these hilarious things that Trump is saying and doing as some wild distraction from the one true issue in this election: selecting a representative of Americans.  Someone who will bring NEW issues to politics; preferably campaign finance, term limits, paper ballots, fighting voter suppression, replacement of the Electoral College, etc...</p>

<p>Yes, and the admins refuse to change that even though it is obviously corrupt. Therefore, the admins are obviously corrupt and we should leave. There are plenty of alternatives, but people refuse to use them. Voat.co is one, but any time it&#39;s mentioned, it&#39;s criticized for being full of racists (IIRC). Well, if more non-racists start using it, we will drown out the racists.</p>

It&#39;s a monetization platform designed solely around the ability to influence individual and public opinion through manipulation of apparent acceptance via multiple anonymized accounts. Some people aren&#39;t going to pick up on it, not necessarily because they are stupid or willfully ignorant (though there are certainly a fair share of those), but also due to issues with individual affinity for pattern recognition, short and medium term memory, cognitive deficits, resolvability of multiple incongruent events over a long time frame over multiple accounts and subreddits...</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of validity as to why some people don&#39;t pick up on it. Thankfully enough realize it, then talk about it, that it provides an initial push for more and more users to start questioning what they see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You, we, do. It&#39;s like... Ok, think of older generation online multiplayer games, like Halo, or COD. Sure, you <em>might</em> find someone on there, but chances are you wont find the interaction rate appealing. Personally, I like being able to jump from one game to another, at odd hours, whenever... So I would be beyond frustrated just waiting in the hopes that enough people happen to group together and play when I could go for one of the newer versions and find a match consistently.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not exactly like that, but I think it&#39;s similar enough to be applicable. You do have other options, you&#39;ve just conditioned yourself / been conditioned to direct your attention and interest in one of a few places. Ever find yourself closing the app or page, then going straight back to it thinking, &quot;huh, wonder what&#39;s new&quot;? That&#39;s a pretty good sign that it&#39;s become ingrained. Try to give it a break.</p>

<p>Or get in fights with people online until you&#39;re just bored / exhausted rehashing the same things over and over again to the point that you just ignore it, whichever works :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other guy literally just said that Voat is a thing.  Go to 4Chan, Go to Voat.  Go to 8chan.  There&#39;s a reason you won&#39;t go to those places, though.  Because you ultimately like Reddit because it&#39;s pretty user friendly and because of that, everyone is here.  The problem with everyone being in the same place is that it&#39;s going to be very mainstream and be a target for monetization and everything else.  It&#39;s a double edged sword.  I personally like to focus on the positives of Reddit and just avoid the places I don&#39;t like.  Why call for a Reddit revolution?  Just so everyone can mass exodus to another site and do the same shit all over again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s confirmation bias. If you think trump is Hitler then anything bad about him is true anything good is false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one&#39;s first feeling, &#39;Thank God, even they aren&#39;t quite so bad as that,&#39; or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies are as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally we shall insist on seeing everything -- God and our friends and ourselves included -- as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred. - C.S. Lewis</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is Hitler; Hitler was actually moderate and toned-down during his initial rise. He didn&#39;t sound like a buffoon who spewed the first thing that popped into his head. He actually sounded like a normal politician if you read his early stuff.</p>

<p>How do people not see that it&#39;s 99% anti trump, and all the comments are the same sarcastic jokes about trump. Are people that blind?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People have pointed out humans are social beings and go with the flow. Peer pressure, essentially.</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s the thing - these people <em>are</em> blind. Not many of them do want to do research or form their own opinion. Not many want to do the &quot;difficult&quot; job of thinking out solutions for various problems and aligning with the views of a candidate. Example: Was downvoted yesterday in that Bill Nye calls out CNN video thread because I asked if Bill&#39;s idea to &quot;completely go renewable immediately&quot; was well thought out economically as well. &quot;NO WE DO IT NOW&quot;. &quot;But, what about the jobs of X people going to be fucked by this?&quot; &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW I DISAGREE WITH BAD POINTS AND ACT ANGRY AS FUCK IN MY REPLIES!&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m exaggerating a bit, but I swear, people make up their minds so fucking fast it amazes me. No thinking about the consequences of an action, DO IT FUCKING NOW.</p>

<p>They see media biased headlines of &quot;TRUMP SAID THIS&quot;, and while he did, the connotation of the article always treats it as a negative and many times is taken WAY out of context. A good example is the &quot;TRUMP SAID HE CAN GET 95% OF THE BLACK VOTE&quot;, and the comments at the top <em>all</em> acted as if he was a bumbling idiot.</p>

<p>I read down some more and one person who read the article goes, &quot;He was speaking about the 2020 Election as if he was elected this year. It was hyperbole...&quot;</p>

<p>Many of the times you can read the headline and get something <em>completely</em> different than the actual article. The article wasn&#39;t even anti-Trump IIRC, it was just reporting on the fact he said he can get 95% of the black vote come next election because he&#39;s going to do such a good job as president. Don&#39;t care if you think it&#39;s false or whatever, it&#39;s just a statement.</p>

<p>Essentially, they&#39;re blinded by their own ignorance IMO. They legitimately think they&#39;re an <em>overwhelming majority</em> and go with the hivemind. They think CTR exists, but it&#39;s only like one or two accounts, not a lot.</p>

<p>The entire sub is fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re: real /pol-esque people both online and in real life: I&#39;ve noticed in recent years that when lockstep liberals are confronted with ideas or facts that conflict with their worldview (programming) rather than respond calmly or rationally, they scoff, become exasperated and condescending and instead of coming back with a counter-argument, just act bewildered and angry that you don&#39;t see things like they (and most everyone else they talk to) do. </p>

<p>Because these memes have become ingrained and are the accepted lines of thinking and because most of these people operate in an echo chamber, they start to turn into children when you challenge them and often resort to name calling or get overly emotional. Their response is basically &quot;THIS IS THE ACCEPTED WAY THAT WE THINK BECAUSE WE ARE ENLIGHTENED AND IF YOU DON&#39;T THINK THIS WAY YOU&#39;RE AN IDIOT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY TRUMP IS JUST LIKE HITLER&quot;</p>

<p>Hell, the replies to my post and interactions with politics I&#39;ve had with friends just shows me you&#39;re 100% right. It&#39;s no longer rational thought, it&#39;s quite literally &quot;feels before reals.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked my friend why he doesn&#39;t like Trump and he said the Mexicans are rapists thing. I explained it wasn&#39;t true and showed him the speech.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I dunno. C&#39;mon dude, he said it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he didn&#39;t - I just showed you the video&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever, I still don&#39;t like the guy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t have a reason really just don&#39;t like him&quot;</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just with what candidate they support, it&#39;s with the policies they agree with too - I asked another friend about healthcare options being 100% mandatory in all companies in the US.</p>

<p>I asked them if they knew the effects of it, and then just said &quot;Yeah it should happen it happens in Europe&quot;</p>

<p>Europe has high small business prices and this change will fuck over the mom and pop shops that can&#39;t afford to pay for healthcare plans for their employees. Hell, it&#39;ll fuck over the summer-job type of places that you find all over America. Literally, this change should only affect large companies. After explaining this to them, their response?</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t care, they should all have it. Not talking about it, just how I feel&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a bit of a rant, but I&#39;m in the demographic that demonizes Trump without knowing shit about him. There&#39;s no &quot;rational&quot; thought I&#39;ve come to realize in my interactions, just blind hate without regard to consequences.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem I have with your logic - basically anyone who has an opinion that differs from you is going to be either a sheep or a CTR shill.  There can be no in between, because if they had done the research like you, who is clearly the smartest person ever, then they would come to the same conclusions as you.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory - the reason that it seems like so many are opposed to trump is not a conspiracy.  A shitload of people are simply opposed to trump.  I argue that it&#39;s because a lot of people have done their research and come to the conclusion that he&#39;s a buffoon and don&#39;t want him leading the country.  They may even be people that think Hillary is crooked and refuse to vote for her, but still think a Trump presidency is an even worse proposition.  By proxy, they&#39;re just uninformed, brainwashed, Hillary supporters to people like you because you&#39;re seeing it as such a binary issue.</p>

<p>This topic is about the people who blindly spew out untrue &quot;facts&quot; against Trump in the line of &quot;HE SAID ALL MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS&quot;. Even Tim fucking Kaine is guilty of this. Really?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying people aren&#39;t opposed to him and neither are the people in here, fucking hell, thought you&#39;d understand this in this topic. We&#39;re saying there are people who fucking really are paid by CorrectTheRecord to post anti-Trump/pro-Hillary articles on Reddit, by the PAC&#39;s own fucking admission. They&#39;re doing the same thing that you see pointed out in the OP and in r/HailCorporate. They inflate the comments to add on their &quot;anti-Trump&quot; stuff, and then the regular users take over from there. A shitload of people CAN be opposed to Trump, and there&#39;s also a pretty good fucking amount of people who are PAID to be opposed to Trump. </p>

<p>I gotta admit, I actually at one point was questioning my own opinions about Trump because I was worried of the idea of being caught up in the media bias, but I ultimately wasn&#39;t able to change my mind on the topic.  He&#39;s a fucking buffoon.  He&#39;s that douche bag in high school that publicly belittled you for not wearing name brand clothing.  I don&#39;t want someone like that running the country.  I wish people would be more honest instead of trying to bend the truth about about him, because it&#39;s irrelevant.  I think at the base of it all, most people don&#39;t like him because he&#39;s a buffoon.  There&#39;s no way you can bring out facts to refute this, it&#39;s just a judgment call.  We could avoid so much debate if anti-trump people would just call him a buffoon and leave it at that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a distinct difference here between &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;research&quot;. I&#39;m not saying people can&#39;t dislike him, and I&#39;m not saying there are no legitimate reasons to dislike him. What I AM saying is that peer pressure is an actual thing, and it can be abused by anyone willing to do what you see happening in r/HailCorporate, and IMO in r/politics. Top comments are posted with an opinion, fake replies agreeing are posted, and then real users buy in and post. Sure, some of those users can be real replying - but you can not deny there are most likely people who are falling for peer pressure in these sorts of places, just agreeing to be on the &quot;popular side&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, I said there&#39;s a difference between feelings and research. You can <em>feel</em> Trump is saying he hates Mexicans when he claims that illegal Mexican aliens crossing our borders are criminals. But that&#39;s <em>not</em> what he&#39;s saying. He&#39;s saying <em>illegal aliens crossing our borders are criminals</em>. That&#39;s it. Later on in your post, you say you &quot;feel&quot; he&#39;s a buffoon and that I can&#39;t refute this. No, I can&#39;t refute what you <em>feel</em>. But I don&#39;t care about what you feel, that&#39;s where the meme &quot;feels before reals&quot; comes from.</p>

<p>Look, not gonna try to convince you to go back and change your view, but if you&#39;re going to vote against him because &quot;he&#39;s a buffoon&quot; from what you found, at least have something else to back it up with. Not one person in a legit debate is going to let that happen. </p>

<p>&quot;Why do you not like Trump?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s a buffoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel that way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, but <em>why</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, here&#39;s one reason why. <em>insert reason</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>That sounds much worse and unhelpful compared to:</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you not like Trump?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because <em>reason</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not coming off like a jerk and you&#39;re <em>explaining yourself</em>. If they argue back and you don&#39;t want to argue, instead of explaining why, just say, &quot;I&#39;d rather not talk about it, thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>I dunno, rambled a bit but I think I answered your initial question and whatever the second paragraph was about.</p>

<p>EDIT: &gt; We could avoid so much debate if anti-trump people would just call him a buffoon and leave it at that.</p>

<p>Debate is good. We want debate and not elections based on &quot;WELL X IS A BUFFOON&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s the entire point - why do I have to explain to you why I don&#39;t like someone?</p>

<p>Me - &quot;I don&#39;t want to date the girl you set me up with.&quot;</p>

<p>You - &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Because she&#39;s a buffoon.&quot;</p>

<p>You - &quot;How is she a buffoon?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;She did x, y and z&quot;.</p>

<p>You - &quot;None of things constitute being a buffoon to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;Well, they do to me.  Why don&#39;t you date her?&quot;</p>

<p>You - &quot;I want to.&quot;</p>

<p>Me - &quot;You totally should, I aint mad.&quot;</p>

<p>Because we all know this is how the conversation actually goes.  You&#39;re not just going to allow me to say &#39;because x,y,z&#39;.  You then want to debate every single one of these topics, which I can almost guarantee will never be &quot;Ah, I totally agree with you here, Trump is a buffoon.&quot;.  You&#39;ll just find a way to shrug it off to stick to your initial point that he&#39;s not a buffoon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can guarantee you&#39;ll never respond with, &quot;Ah I changed my mind on Trump!&quot;</p>

<p>The reason for debate is to show people why we disagree on certain issues, and we can clear up misconceptions.</p>

<p>Example: I like a girl, but to you, she&#39;s an asshole cause she walks a certain way.</p>

<p>After a debate, I tell you, &quot;She walks like that cause she&#39;s more comfortable&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe that might change your mind.</p>

<p>Debate is useful between parties who want to budge, and I guess in your case, your mind is totally made up.</p>

<p>If not, head on over to r/AskThe_Donald or r/AskTrumpSupporters if you wanna clear some stuff up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m sure your mind is totally not made up.  You&#39;ve reached the conclusion that Trump is the best candidate off of pure logic and reason and can easily change your mind if someone presented the right evidence that he&#39;s not the best candidate?  Totally believe this.</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;ve changed my mind on a lot of stuff about Trump.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s racist.  I don&#39;t think he wants to ban all Mexicans or Arabs.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s Hitler.  I&#39;ve yet to be able to change my mind on Trump being a buffoon, though.</p>

<p>Trump keeps saying stupid things while Clinton says damn near nothing at all, though. You can&#39;t be surprised when who keeps going off on twitter gets reported on more frequently. </p>

Also why all media that isn&#39;t conservative is &quot;liberal&quot; media and composes 90%+ of the media out there.

    <div class="md"><p>R/conspiracy is not a safe space, I was referring to politically  conservative subreddits that permanently ban people for having opposing views. I have a tremendous amount of respect for this subreddit and it&#39;s moderators because I consider myself a skeptic and I used to come here a lot to rationally argue against numerous theories espoused on this subreddit. I don&#39;t believe I have ever been banned here. This subreddit allows open rational discourse unlike so many. </p>

<p>Given the context of this post I don&#39;t think I am reading too much into your comment. You and the post are saying that r/politics is NOT full of legitimate, left leaning, Hillary supporters and that they are all or mostly shills. The more realistic conclusion is that they are legitimate users just like how most media outlets are legitimate news outlets and not some vast liberal conspiracy(&quot;liberal media&quot;). They both draw strong parallels with one another in that the majority views are being written off as disingenuous when they aren&#39;t. </p>

It doesn&#39;t take that many people to snuff out dissenting opinions. Just going into new threads and watching how quickly anti-Clinton statements are ridiculed and downvoted make it pretty clear. I know that Reddit leans left, but a month ago, the same sub was tearing Hillary apart. Now all of a sudden nobody has anything bad to say and they just want to shit on Trump, and leave Hillary out of the convo. Well, there are people saying bad things about Hillary, but it gets downvoted to shit and ridiculed unless it&#39;s here or r/Hillaryforprison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes sense that a bunch of Sanders supporters have joined the Clinton/Democratic presidential side which would account for this dramatic shift. Sanders supporters/progressives should support the Democratic nominee as Sanders himself told his supporters to do. If you look at the comments upvoted you will still see a lot of begrudging Clinton support and anti DNC comments. If you were a Sanders supporter you would probably downvote arguments and comments made by Trump supporters due to Sanders supporters most likely disagreeing with them. This shift is better explained by natural changes than deliberate efforts from the Clinton campaign. </p>

<p>I am not a racist or an Islamophobe, I am infact a true die hard liberal and former Bernie Sanders supporter turned green. To accuse me of being such things is really quite sad and pathetic. But this is what Hillary supporters do. Anyone that&#39;s not on board with her corrupt agenda and terrible track record is accused of being something they&#39;re not: sexist, racist, or in this case Islamophobic (that&#39;s a new one).  Oh, or a Bernie Bro, which the shills still use for some reason.  You see, they can&#39;t defend their own candidates horrible track record and blatant corruption so they have to attack others and even outright lie about other candidates track records.  This is what they did to Bernie and his supporters and this is what they&#39;re doing to Jill Stein and her supporters now. </p>

<p>I suspect you are lying because of your screen name, lack of evidence for this, and the fact your account is mysteriously a two day old account and only anti Hillary comments. This wouldn&#39;t be hard to prove. </p>

<p>A &quot;die hard&quot; liberal wouldn&#39;t throw away their vote by voting Stein, which is the equivalent of voting for Trump. I suggest you learn how to think objectively if you actually care. Stein has zero chance of winning, so for every one vote that otherwise would have went to  Hillary, it increases their difference between her and Trump by 1. For every two liberals who don&#39;t vote for Hillary, that is the equivalent of one full vote for Trump making the vote difference between them two votes. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how any &quot;die hard&quot; liberal can mindlessly  contribute to the creation of a Conservative Supreme Court in this way. Nothing would be worse for progressive policy than to have conservative for the next two decades(this next president could appoint 2-3 Justices).</p>

<p>If people are still calling you a Bernie bro it is probably because you are being hard headed and in denial of what is the best course of action to realize progressive policy ends like overturning Citizens United for example. The best course of action is obviously not throwing away your vote by voting third party. </p>

<p>Her &quot;corrupt agenda&quot; was BASICALLY the same as Sanders&#39; before he even decided to run, she didn&#39;t have to move left on much. Her horrible &quot;track record&quot; surely isn&#39;t her voting record or policy initiatives which are incrediblly progressive, of which many Bernie bros are in denial of till this day. They voted the same while in the Senate on most issues. </p>

<p>I recommend you get your head out of the sand and educate yourself on the importance of the Supreme Court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post fits the shill handbook perfectly.  Let me make this very clear so you can understand.  <strong>I don&#39;t care if you think I&#39;m lying and I don&#39;t have to prove anything to a random stranger on the internet.</strong> Judging from your comment history it is blatantly obvious to me that you are paid to make these idiotic comments.  My account is 2 days old because my main account with over 10k karma was perma banned for implying that someone like yourself was a shill.  Let&#39;s go over your points now. </p>

<p>&quot;A &quot;die hard&quot; liberal wouldn&#39;t throw away their vote by voting Stein, which is the equivalent of voting for Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>A &quot;die hard&quot; liberal is more likely to vote for Jill Stein because her policy positions line up closer to Bernie Sanders. A vote for Stein is not a vote for Trump. A vote for Stein is a vote for Stein.</p>

<p>&quot; I suggest you learn how to think objectively if you actually care. &quot;</p>

<p>I suggest you do some actual research into your candidate for once. </p>

<p>&quot;Stein has zero chance of winning, so for every one vote that otherwise would have went to Hillary, it increases their difference between her and Trump by 1.&quot;</p>

<p>The people that are voting for Stein would have never voted for Clinton anyway, so it doesn&#39;t increase or decrease her chances. The fact that this race is so close should tell you that your candidate is terrible.  </p>

<p>&quot; For every two liberals who don&#39;t vote for Hillary, that is the equivalent of one full vote for Trump making the vote difference between them two votes.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s not a liberal so I don&#39;t fault others for voting for a true liberal.  If Hillary loses that is her fault, she&#39;s not even reaching out to progressives.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t get how any &quot;die hard&quot; liberal can mindlessly contribute to the creation of a Conservative Supreme Court in this way. Nothing would be worse for progressive policy than to have conservative for the next two decades(this next president could appoint 2-3 Justices).&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how any rational human being could vote for Clinton after seeing that the primary was rigged against Sanders.  I&#39;m not going to vote for someone when they are not the legitimate nominee.  Plus she has huge corruption scandals going on in the background that if exposed could sink her campaign. </p>

<p>&quot;If people are still calling you a Bernie bro it is probably because you are being hard headed and in denial of what is the best course of action&quot;</p>

<p>You sound like a programmed robot. Voting for Clinton is in no way the best course of action.  If Trump wins, maybe next time the Democrats will put a real liberal on the ticket. </p>

<p>&quot;Her &quot;corrupt agenda&quot; was BASICALLY the same as Sanders&#39; before he even decided to run, she didn&#39;t have to move left on much. &quot;</p>

<p>Her &quot;corrupt agenda&quot; is in no way shape or form the same as Sanders and to suggest that is absolutely hilarious.  Her corrupt agenda is gaining as much capital as possible into the Clinton foundation to buy off power people and even place them in power all across the globe. </p>

<p>Ah yes, let&#39;s talk about her voting record. She has nearly flip-flopped on every single issue. Clinton goes where the wind blows politically. She is not a leader but a follower. Bernie Sanders is a true leader because he actually holds his positions and doesn&#39;t change them. </p>

<p>&quot;I recommend you get your head out of the sand and educate yourself on the importance of the Supreme Court.&quot;</p>

<p>I recommend that you go screw yourself. I&#39;m tired of getting into shitty arguments with robots.  </p>

<p>Did you seriously just link me the dailykos? Jesus</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s even funnier is he usually makes posts just like yours calling his main account out from an alt and then tries to get people banned because people are curious or say something that triggers his psychosis.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not a shill. He&#39;s just a fucking pyscho, I have interacted with him and his multiple accounts before. He threatened to report me to the admins and swears he is getting my account banned. I replied to one of his Alts with a comment and he pm&#39;d me saying he baited me.  I&#39;ll post a screen cap of the exchange if you want. </p>

<p>He uses sock puppet accounts to get around bans, and has even gotten a couple modded in subs that he is adamantly against politically, just so he can be a fucking doucher.</p>

<p>Seems shill-ey, but is really just a cancerous presence on Reddit, I&#39;ve had him tagged since before the election cycle began because he is such a massive twat.</p>

<p>Ps if this is you on another alt; fuck you asswipe.  </p>

<p>Guy also posts in web/tech security related subs while having a bot autopost in the subs where he buggers the mods.</p>

<p>And I can garruntee  he sees this and starts reporting you and any that discuss him.</p>

<p>The worst part of this cancerous retard is that he posts on non related subs political shit. I don&#39;t mind if he keeps his shilling to the hillary sub but he tries to spread his bullshit everywhere which is why he is a literal cancer.</p>

<p>Clinton is firmly in the tradition of a secretive, trans-party interventionist government that goes back at least as far as the early 80s and the Iran-Contra situation. Relative to that tradition, CTR infiltration would be a trivial propaganda effort.. <em>That&#39;s</em> not paranoia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think all the talk about CTR&#39;s influence on Reddit was crazy, but I&#39;ve been starting to think otherwise, and this solidifies it. How is it even possible people are so pro-Clinton on that subreddit? </p>

<p>If you look at <a href="/r/Hillaryclinton">/r/Hillaryclinton</a>, the subscribers are pretty low, and every link on there has barely any comments. Even less that <a href="/r/garyjohnson">/r/garyjohnson</a>. Then if you head over to<a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>. Way more subscribers, and the comment section is always extremely active.</p>

<p>If Reddit&#39;s Trump supports are obviously way more outspoken that Hillary&#39;s, then how can <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> be so over run with pro-clinton opinions. It makes sense when you consider CTR though. Of course they&#39;re not gonna be active on the Hillary sub Reddit, that&#39;s just a waste of money, preaching to the choir. Plus, there&#39;s nobody to oppose, since it&#39;s moderated to keep anti Hillary sentiments from being posted. </p>

<p>It also makes sense when you notice there&#39;s no Gary Johnson support on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, at all. Like, none. They&#39;re keeping his name out of there. Libertarian is usually closer to Republicans, but GJ is more moderate than most libertarians, and would definitely draw in votes from Dems who aren&#39;t happy with Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Classic echo-chamber. Humans are very social creatures and we tend to cluster together. I don&#39;t think this is a great example, and I&#39;ll give another, but if you&#39;ve ever lived overseas, you&#39;ll find eventually you start hanging out with more expats like yourself and you might even hang out with people you wouldn&#39;t under normal circumstances because you have a common bond. Alienation or becoming the outsider makes people more wary and likely to stay in a comfort zone. So Lots of pro-hillary people are going to congregate together just like the Donald sub. Every time you post something about how great trump is and how bad crooked Hillary is, you&#39;re gonna get smothered in validation and good feelings. All these people agree with me! You&#39;re ALWAYS going to come back because this is a safe space for you where you can talk to likeminded people. A great example is liberal college campuses, I came from one and I saw it first hand. Hell I was part of it until my fourth year when I started actually doing studies and reviewing decades of data showing certain trends and notions propagated in the media were blatantly false. The greatest thing I learned from college is how to see another point of view, and whether you agree with it or not, try to engage in a civil discussion. It&#39;s really hard sometimes and I can be totally guilty of being a dick, though I really don&#39;t like acting like that, all that anger and hate is baggage and it&#39;s not necessary. But it&#39;s out there, I&#39;ll see people rationally discussing why they support trump and people why they do not and it&#39;s really nice to see that take place. It feels really good to talk to someone who disagrees with you and you can hear their side and step into their shoes for a minute. But that requires a likeminded individual. Someone stuck in the echo-chamber isn&#39;t likely to be nice to you when you disagree and this absolutely applies to both sides of the spectrum EASILY. The trouble comes when you leave your echo-chamber and you&#39;re confronted by all these other people you haven&#39;t ever talked to before who have a wide spectrum of views. So when you post a view that in the Donald would receive praise, the blowback you feel is immense. The longer you stay in an echo-chamber, the more extreme your views become and the more stubborn you become in willing to accept, &quot;hey maybe I am just wrong.&quot; Echo-chambers are terribly toxic places to be. This sub is an echo-chamber. And it&#39;s perfectly fine to browse through, hell here I am right now, and often times I don&#39;t agree with what I see, but sometimes I do. I almost always get down voted though because I put forth a different view that the echo-chamber doesn&#39;t like. If you start to only associate with those people, your views don&#39;t grow. It&#39;s intellectually stifling I would venture to say.</p>

<p>But anyway, back to why there are more pro-clinton views, I think CTR plays a role though not as great as is posited here. Hillary is just more moderate than Trump. Trump appeals most heavily to evangelicals and far right wing people. He&#39;s a demagogue, relying on fear to garner support. The founding fathers were really afraid of Demagogues, for the sole reason that it&#39;s so easy to amass a following doing that. They&#39;re dangerous to democracy. </p>

<p>Even though I don&#39;t like Hillary and will not be voting for her, I&#39;ll sometimes find myself defending her because of something put forward that is non-sense and I&#39;ll even think to myself, &quot;why the hell am I even defending Hillary!?&quot; I&#39;ll certainly be voting for Johnson myself, but I&#39;ve been seeing more of Johnson on Reddit than when I first decided I would vote for him. </p>

I&#39;m a pacifist and I would never advocate for anything of the sort. Why don&#39;t they just make it a rule that they&#39;ll ban for any reason they want, then cite that rule when they want to ban a dissenter? When they gaslight like this, they&#39;re basically just admitting to the banned user that they&#39;re full of shit when it would be VERY easy for them to be honest and intellectually consistent just by adding a rule that they&#39;ll ban you if they don&#39;t like the content of your post. </p>

<p>Yep. HRC people always lambaste Stein for being &quot;anti-vaxx&quot; when Stein just said that vaccines need to be regulated and consistently monitored to ensure that they keep working, not that we shouldn&#39;t get vaccinated. </p>

<p>Well no shit, because there was a close primary run between Clinton and Sanders in the beginning. Reddit&#39;s demographic fits very well with Sanders so it is not surprising that during the primary race the focus in the main political subs would be more anti-Clinton. </p>

<p>Now Sanders is out and his supporters are obviously going to lose/shift their focus. And as the general election comes closer and closer that shift is towards keeping Trump out of the WH. Without the pro-Sanders voice being the dominant one the anti-Trump one is rising up. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that the vast majority of reddit users are Bernie supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly made CTR newsworthy this month? I&#39;m a little confused by your standards of newsworthiness. Suggesting that no one mentioned a topic that&#39;s been addressed hundreds of times over is maybe just proof that the topic has been thoroughly burned out, but for whatever reason you&#39;re insisting that it&#39;s proof of a conspiracy. Then you go on to talk about all the same aspects of CTR that have been addressed literally hundreds of times before, as if it&#39;s news. Maybe the problem isn&#39;t the sub, maybe the problem is you&#39;re late to the party. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you guys not be so dense? CTR isn&#39;t the issue because CTR isn&#39;t the only company doing anything. I&#39;ve been posting about this for months. <strong>Every single major political party</strong> and tons of major corporations use paid accounts, via interns or CTR like companies to control conversations. </p>

<p>I posted about this in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4k79cu/the_chinese_government_is_fabricating_almost_490m/d3d3wxm"> months ago.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/paid-internet-shill-shadowy-groups-manipulate-internet-opinion-debate/1147073/">http://consciouslifenews.com/paid-internet-shill-shadowy-groups-manipulate-internet-opinion-debate/1147073/</a></p>

<p>We know the left uses CTR, but we only knew that because reddit hates HRC. Most Sanders supporters didn&#39;t understand that Revolution Marketing handled a ton of their online organization, including live accounts. </p>

<p>The GOP has been doing this for years (see commenters on Yahoo, CNN, and of course, Fox), and the Russians are doing it on US sites. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america?utm_term=.ij1LVkJyp3#.ae1O4ANjY8">https://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america?utm_term=.ij1LVkJyp3#.ae1O4ANjY8</a></p>

<p>The Chinese have been doing it so long and so publicly that there is a name for it: wumao, which roughly translates to 50 Center, as they get paid 50 cents RMB per post. </p>

<p>Stop running around with the &quot;Hillary is trying to change the online narrative&quot; and realize she is just following suit. This is far worse and much further along than you think... just keep going and bring attention to the fact that more than a few people in the conversation are paid to be there in hopes of changing minds. </p>

<p>It is anti Trump, but even many Sanders supporters would take a stand against Trump, he has incredibly high unfavourable ratings amongst the youth and due to Reddit&#39;s demographics this is reflected in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> after Bernie officially and completely dropped out and endorsed Hillary.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders either jumped ship (following the endorsement, either due to partisanship (democrats should win) or because Hillary is the last remaining candidate that can win that reflects their views), or they remained but now are outnumbered. You really dont see many Bernie supporters only previous Bernie supporters since there isnt much to talk about in many of the threads regarding Bernie. We do crawl out in force whenever a Bernie related thread rises up (eg. that healthcare one recently). Or a Bernie related anti Clinton one rises up (eg. that CF article by the Associated Press).</p>

<p>Many of the more active Bernies moved onto PoliticalRevolution. But the majority I think end up supporting Hillary by default as the last progressive with a realistic chance at winning (sorry Stein). Pragmatism vs idealism, and many are taking the pragmatic approach and supporting Hillary. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has always leaned left, you didnt see pro romney shit there last election either. This is more or less a return to the status quo as the Bernie fever dies down/changes to the politicalrevolution</p>

<p>You&#39;re surprised that usernames are being created within the last few months that directly relate the biggest topics of discussions on Reddit within the last few months?</p>

<p>That&#39;s like being surprised there&#39;s a large number of Rocket League related usernames after the release of Rocket League.</p>

<p>What I find most ironic is that <strong>you&#39;re</strong> account is literally 7 months old. When your account was 1 month old, your entire comment history exclusively consisted of 1 post in <a href="/r/HomeTheatre">/r/HomeTheatre</a> and every single other comment was in <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a>. Maybe you&#39;re a retired shill account?</p>

<p>I found 8 accounts that are less than a few hours old in the same thread you&#39;re talking about. Maybe I just missed the other one or their comment was removed? Anywho, sure enough, these 8 accounts are less than a few hours old and all only had 1-2 comments in their comment history.

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, what exactly do people hate about CTR? I&#39;m not trying to be a naysayer or anything I&#39;m genuinely curious as to why people are so upset about it.</p>

<p>As I see it, it is no different than what political parties have been doing for decades with boots on the ground and other campaigning efforts. It&#39;s 2016, of course political parties are going to engage with citizens online. Of course those political parties are going to spread their message and seek to minimize misinformation about their candidate. </p>

<p>I can totally understand if you disagree with the CTR message if that disagreement is on substance but to be against them in principle confuses me. Are you against people making phone calls or holding community engagements  to talk about their candidate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post fits the shill handbook perfectly.  Let me make this very clear so you can understand.  <strong>I don&#39;t care if you think I&#39;m lying and I don&#39;t have to prove anything to a random stranger on the internet.</strong> Judging from your comment history it is blatantly obvious to me that you are paid to make these idiotic comments.  My account is 2 days old because my main account with over 10k karma was perma banned for implying that someone like yourself was a shill.  Let&#39;s go over your points now. </p>

<p>&quot;A &quot;die hard&quot; liberal wouldn&#39;t throw away their vote by voting Stein, which is the equivalent of voting for Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>A &quot;die hard&quot; liberal is more likely to vote for Jill Stein because her policy positions line up closer to Bernie Sanders. A vote for Stein is not a vote for Trump. A vote for Stein is a vote for Stein.</p>

<p>&quot; I suggest you learn how to think objectively if you actually care. &quot;</p>

<p>I suggest you do some actual research into your candidate for once. </p>

<p>&quot;Stein has zero chance of winning, so for every one vote that otherwise would have went to Hillary, it increases their difference between her and Trump by 1.&quot;</p>

<p>The people that are voting for Stein would have never voted for Clinton anyway, so it doesn&#39;t increase or decrease her chances. The fact that this race is so close should tell you that your candidate is terrible.  </p>

<p>&quot; For every two liberals who don&#39;t vote for Hillary, that is the equivalent of one full vote for Trump making the vote difference between them two votes.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s not a liberal so I don&#39;t fault others for voting for a true liberal.  If Hillary loses that is her fault, she&#39;s not even reaching out to progressives.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t get how any &quot;die hard&quot; liberal can mindlessly contribute to the creation of a Conservative Supreme Court in this way. Nothing would be worse for progressive policy than to have conservative for the next two decades(this next president could appoint 2-3 Justices).&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how any rational human being could vote for Clinton after seeing that the primary was rigged against Sanders.  I&#39;m not going to vote for someone when they are not the legitimate nominee.  Plus she has huge corruption scandals going on in the background that if exposed could sink her campaign. </p>

<p>&quot;If people are still calling you a Bernie bro it is probably because you are being hard headed and in denial of what is the best course of action&quot;</p>

<p>You sound like a programmed robot. Voting for Clinton is in no way the best course of action.  If Trump wins, maybe next time the Democrats will put a real liberal on the ticket. </p>

<p>&quot;Her &quot;corrupt agenda&quot; was BASICALLY the same as Sanders&#39; before he even decided to run, she didn&#39;t have to move left on much. &quot;</p>

<p>Her &quot;corrupt agenda&quot; is in no way shape or form the same as Sanders and to suggest that is absolutely hilarious.  Her corrupt agenda is gaining as much capital as possible into the Clinton foundation to buy off power people and even place them in power all across the globe. </p>

<p>Ah yes, let&#39;s talk about her voting record. She has nearly flip-flopped on every single issue. Clinton goes where the wind blows politically. She is not a leader but a follower. Bernie Sanders is a true leader because he actually holds his positions and doesn&#39;t change them. </p>

<p>&quot;I recommend you get your head out of the sand and educate yourself on the importance of the Supreme Court.&quot;</p>

<p>I recommend that you go screw yourself. I&#39;m tired of getting into shitty arguments with robots.  </p>

<p>Did you seriously just link me the dailykos? Jesus</p>
