Essentially a self-sufficient and self-sustainable community based around the idea of green living, and furthering the scientific fields of study.  Just before ground is set to be broken, Disney suddenly dies and his vision for a community of tomorrow is quickly turned into a grab for money and nothing like what he planned.  Would it be reasonable to suspect that this was planned by his corporate sponsors, and perhaps the Government as a whole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The following is text from Ford&#39;s writings &quot;The International Jew&quot;.  Keep in mind this was in the 1920&#39;s. Any of it sound familiar today?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The changes which the Jews have made in the theater, and which any half-observant theatergoer can 
verify with his own eyes, are four in number. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, they have elaborated the mechanical side, making human talent and genius less necessary. 
They have made the stage &quot;realistic&quot; instead of interpretative. The great actors needed very little 
machinery; the men and women on the pay rolls of the Jewish managers are helpless without the 
machinery. The outstanding fact about the vast majority of present-day performances of any pretension is 
that the mechanical part dwarfs and obscures the acting, however good. And this is the reason: knowing 
that good actors are growing scarce, knowing that the Jewish policy is death to talent, knowing perhaps 
most keenly of all that good actors constitute a running charge on his revenue, the Jewish producer 
prefers to put his faith and his money in wood, canvas, paint, cloth and tinsel of which scenery and 
costumes are made. Wood and paint never show contempt for his sordid ideals and his betrayal of his 
trust. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And thus we have when we go to the theater today, bursts of color, ruffles of lace and linen, 
waving lines and dazzling effects of light and motion — but no ideas, a great many stage employees, but 
very few actors. There are drills and dances without end, but no drama. </p>
