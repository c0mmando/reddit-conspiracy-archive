<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not trolling, I&#39;m a liberal who thinks that it has more to do with power than party and the fight shouldn&#39;t be left vs. right; it should be bottom vs. top. Even if we don&#39;t agree on the method that works best, we still want the same thing; which is to have our country grow and prosper, make sure our families are secure and safe.</p>

<p>By focusing so much on the left or liberals (which are now more conservative than liberal any more.) you discredit yourselves by making it look like a witch hunt. It&#39;s easy to disregard, dismiss, and marginalize your posts when you only go after one group.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2: I don&#39;t know how many of you are going to see this; but I have never had such an enjoyable and civil conversation with people who are (I imagine) on the other side of the political spectrum as I am. After today, I would venture to say this is the most reasonable/mature group I have come across on Reddit. (And we - myself included - are supposed to be the unreasonable crackpots.)</strong></p>

<p>I see you have never read anything about McCarthy, you have likely never heard of the Venona Documents, don&#39;t have a clue about Soviet infiltration into not only the State Department and the government, but also the media, or otherwise have any clue about the reality at the time.</p>

<p>Sure, I guess if you ignore her entire political record, as well as her decades of warmongering and threats to &quot;annihilate&quot; Iran, her gloating over the murder of the Gaddafi, her support for drone bombing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me clarify. </p>

<p>I do not think Trump is a warmonger in any way at all.</p>

<p>But he has also shown that he is prone to shooting from the hip, which on the international stage is going to get you into a war. </p>

<p>i would be less concerned if he were at least a reader. Shit, even Bush II was a reader. When asked about his reading habits, Trumps said, “I read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time,”</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was talking about, he doesn&#39;t appear to have curiosity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;d like to throw some objectivity into the mix here: </p>

<p>This article is kind of crappy - but it&#39;s an excellent example of something I&#39;ve noticed for a while now. It sort of plays down the dnc wrongdoings &amp; jumps on Putin for &quot;using information as a weapon&quot; narrative. The problem with that is, we Americans <em>need</em> to know this stuff. I have watched &amp; read many of Putin&#39;s recent statements &amp; I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s trying to incite anything outside of an attempt to make the American public see what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Furthermore, hacking groups with &quot;bear&quot; in their names don&#39;t prove a thing. That&#39;s so ridiculously, comically obvious, it would be pretty gullible to make assumptions based on that title. I will go with Russian sympathizers there, but really - it tells us almost nothing. It could still be anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Also, payments from the Ukraine to campaign staff for work on Ukrainian campaigns is pretty legit. This is a deflection tactic to draw attention away from Hillary&#39;s foreign donors. </p>

<p>I could go on ripping this article, but you get my point. It&#39;s slanted, biased and filled with <em>propagandized cadence</em>, which is something we&#39;d all do well to learn to recognize. </p>

<p>I am by no means a Trump supporter, nor Hillary, so please don&#39;t think I&#39;m giving you blowback for your op or even this article. I am just really tired of this halfway-editorialized-style of reporting. The fact is - we actually could use a Potus who is willing to work with Russia. </p>

<p>Maybe I too, am pickin&#39; up what Putin&#39;s throwing down these days. As off as that sounds, he seems the most sane of any voice out there atm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with part of what you are saying. :-)</p>

<p>The Democratic party is now, essentially, what the Republican party was in the 80&#39;s. And the Republican party has just gone off the rails. (And I am through with having a Republican-Lite party represent me.)</p>

<p>As for the part I don&#39;t agree with...I have never met a liberal that wants to open the borders and live under the UN. Seriously, I would love to meet these &quot;Liberals&quot; and ask them what the hell they are thinking. No, I&#39;m serious, can you hook me up with their info? I have never met a liberal that thought that was  a good idea...or even considered it for that matter.</p>

<p>Plus there is a lot of misinformation about our stances; guns being the first one that comes to mind. </p>

<p>e.g. Liberals like guns to. I love shooting with my dad and if someone is breaking into your house I think you have the right to put as large a hole in them as you like. I just think that if you need more than a 6 round (Or reasonably sized) clip to do it, you need to go practice more.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about guns is hunting. Unless you need the meat for your family; there is no reason to go hunting anymore. (And if we could get some natural predators back into the ecosystem; we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about deer overpopulation.) Guns should be for shooting targets and anyone stupid enough to break into your house.</p>

<p>You strike me as a moderate.</p>

<p>I live in a liberal town and many people believe we need to get rid of the notion of national sovereignty; guns need to be banned; the government should provide for everything a person could need (free housing/ free insurance/ free drug rehab, etc., etc.) </p>

<p>Then you have the &quot;progressives&quot; who literally want to force people who live in the suburbs to sell their homes to &quot;person of color&quot;, so we have forced and complete integration (Oddly, these are often the same folks complaining about gentrification of the cities) and believe that the government should buy up as much property (particularly lake property) as possible to remove it from private ownership. </p>

<p>And where are these people?! I have never met them in my life and I live in Southern California; and have lived in Oregon and Washington as well.</p>

<p>Maybe there are fringe liberals that thing that way, but you will not find a mainstream liberal or progressive that thinks that way. Try listening to Thom Hartmann sometime. (Just once.) He is hands down the smartest talk show host I have ever heard; and I think he is center mass on where liberals are today. </p>

I can think of 2 major Trump links to the Bush Family &amp; terrorism (not going to name them, stupid partisan fucks).  Is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lazy or just propaganda?</p>

<p>The answer is both.  Even the propagandists can&#39;t be bothered to read about the &#39;90s or think outside their hate bubble.  It&#39;s just <em>repetition</em>.  Which is the key to advertising ... and mind-control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with part of what you are saying. :-)</p>

<p>The Democratic party is now, essentially, what the Republican party was in the 80&#39;s. And the Republican party has just gone off the rails. (And I am through with having a Republican-Lite party represent me.)</p>

<p>As for the part I don&#39;t agree with...I have never met a liberal that wants to open the borders and live under the UN. Seriously, I would love to meet these &quot;Liberals&quot; and ask them what the hell they are thinking. No, I&#39;m serious, can you hook me up with their info? I have never met a liberal that thought that was  a good idea...or even considered it for that matter.</p>

<p>Plus there is a lot of misinformation about our stances; guns being the first one that comes to mind. </p>

<p>e.g. Liberals like guns to. I love shooting with my dad and if someone is breaking into your house I think you have the right to put as large a hole in them as you like. I just think that if you need more than a 6 round (Or reasonably sized) clip to do it, you need to go practice more.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about guns is hunting. Unless you need the meat for your family; there is no reason to go hunting anymore. (And if we could get some natural predators back into the ecosystem; we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about deer overpopulation.) Guns should be for shooting targets and anyone stupid enough to break into your house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t know. From my bleeding-heart-commie-pinko-liberal perspective, Conservative leaders these days seem to be more pro-corporatism wrapped in nationalism as a cover. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Clinton will burn in hell for signing NAFTA and there are other things Democrats have done over the years I really don&#39;t like. But they at least represent my social stances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you are the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company or get all your income from capital gains or have $10MM in the bank; then you and everyone you know is &quot;the bottom&quot; I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>But even the top 10% don&#39;t need the same protections as the bottom 90%. They can write a check and have a face to face conversation with the politician of their choosing. I don&#39;t have that kind of access; and I would be shocked if you did. </p>

<p>And yes; there are crooked people in every section of society. But I would rather have 1,000 or 10,000 welfare cheats than 1 crooked multi-national. (BTW, neither Reagan nor his people were able to ever produce one &quot;Welfare Queen&quot; that he referenced in his campaign speeches. It was a fabricated myth.) Companies today are offshoring billions in taxable revenue. Which is costing us god knows how much, so that missing tax revenue is being offset by the middle class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies, I was looking for a source for you quickly and only skimmed that one briefly.</p>

<p>Why do you think it has to be a deflection tactic? Couldn&#39;t it be the two issues are not mutually exclusive? They could both be dirty and compromised in their own unique ways. </p>

<p>AND...I&#39;m not supporting Hillary either, I know she is crooked. The only thing I think she has over Trump is I think she has a temperament that is less prone to getting us into a war. (And that&#39;s not enough for me to vote for her.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me clarify. </p>

<p>I do not think Trump is a warmonger in any way at all.</p>

<p>But he has also shown that he is prone to shooting from the hip, which on the international stage is going to get you into a war. </p>

<p>i would be less concerned if he were at least a reader. Shit, even Bush II was a reader. When asked about his reading habits, Trumps said, “I read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time,”</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was talking about, he doesn&#39;t appear to have curiosity. </p>

<p>You may disagree with my conclusion 100%; but do you at least see how I got to that conclusion?</p>
