       It's all in the title. I'm no Hillary fan but it seems that there is an exceedingly large amount of stories about her; but very little with, for example, Trump's Russian connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I'm not trolling, I'm a liberal who thinks that it has more to do with power than party and the fight shouldn't be left vs. right; it should be bottom vs. top. Even if we don't agree on the method that works best, we still want the same thing; which is to have our country grow and prosper, make sure our families are secure and safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       By focusing so much on the left or liberals (which are now more conservative than liberal any more.) you discredit yourselves by making it look like a witch hunt. It's easy to disregard, dismiss, and marginalize your posts when you only go after one group.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT 2: I don't know how many of you are going to see this; but I have never had such an enjoyable and civil conversation with people who are (I imagine) on the other side of the political spectrum as I am. After today, I would venture to say this is the most reasonable/mature group I have come across on Reddit. (And we - myself included - are supposed to be the unreasonable crackpots.)

       It is a deliberate program to entirely discredit the notion that we must continuously and constantly question our government and other leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving it a right slant is a natural outcome of the original anti-bolshevik conspirators, followed by the McCarthy gang, then the Birchers, now the Republican Party.

       It is laughable because the conservatives have had  most of the control for most of our History.

       Unless you are the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company or get all your income from capital gains or have $10MM in the bank; then you and everyone you know is "the bottom" I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even the top 10% don't need the same protections as the bottom 90%. They can write a check and have a face to face conversation with the politician of their choosing. I don't have that kind of access; and I would be shocked if you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes; there are crooked people in every section of society. But I would rather have 1,000 or 10,000 welfare cheats than 1 crooked multi-national. (BTW, neither Reagan nor his people were able to ever produce one "Welfare Queen" that he referenced in his campaign speeches. It was a fabricated myth.) Companies today are offshoring billions in taxable revenue. Which is costing us god knows how much, so that missing tax revenue is being offset by the middle class.

       That's all true - which is why I can't understand why anyone would support liberals, the left, the Democrats - or Hillary Clinton - considering they ALL support the "1%" agenda - mass immigration, globalism, multiculturalism, anti-nationalism, and cheap labor.

       And Republicans have destroyed unions, supported NAFTA more than Democrats (In the House, NAFTA passed 234-200; 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voted in favor of it. The Senate approved NAFTA 61-38, with the backing of 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats.), and generally been in the pocket of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.

       I see you have never read anything about McCarthy, you have likely never heard of the Venona Documents, don't have a clue about Soviet infiltration into not only the State Department and the government, but also the media, or otherwise have any clue about the reality at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess you saw that pro-Communist movie and have heard lurid stories about a "Red Scare" - told to you by the Communists that got caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with that.

       EDIT: And I have to disagree; although I'm not voting for her, I think Hillary is less likely to get us into a war than Trump. He doesn't seem to have any real sense of curiosity about the world.

       Sure, I guess if you ignore her entire political record, as well as her decades of warmongering and threats to "annihilate" Iran, her gloating over the murder of the Gaddafi, her support for drone bombing.

       Ok, let me clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think Trump is a warmonger in any way at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he has also shown that he is prone to shooting from the hip, which on the international stage is going to get you into a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       i would be less concerned if he were at least a reader. Shit, even Bush II was a reader. When asked about his reading habits, Trumps said, “I read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time,”
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I was talking about, he doesn't appear to have curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may disagree with my conclusion 100%; but do you at least see how I got to that conclusion?

       Ok, I'd like to throw some objectivity into the mix here:
      </p>
      <p>
       This article is kind of crappy - but it's an excellent example of something I've noticed for a while now. It sort of plays down the dnc wrongdoings &amp; jumps on Putin for "using information as a weapon" narrative. The problem with that is, we Americans
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to know this stuff. I have watched &amp; read many of Putin's recent statements &amp; I don't feel like he's trying to incite anything outside of an attempt to make the American public see what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, hacking groups with "bear" in their names don't prove a thing. That's so ridiculously, comically obvious, it would be pretty gullible to make assumptions based on that title. I will go with Russian sympathizers there, but really - it tells us almost nothing. It could still be anyone, anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, payments from the Ukraine to campaign staff for work on Ukrainian campaigns is pretty legit. This is a deflection tactic to draw attention away from Hillary's foreign donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on ripping this article, but you get my point. It's slanted, biased and filled with
       <em>
        propagandized cadence
       </em>
       , which is something we'd all do well to learn to recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am by no means a Trump supporter, nor Hillary, so please don't think I'm giving you blowback for your op or even this article. I am just really tired of this halfway-editorialized-style of reporting. The fact is - we actually could use a Potus who is willing to work with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I too, am pickin' up what Putin's throwing down these days. As off as that sounds, he seems the most sane of any voice out there atm.

       Why do you think it has to be a deflection tactic? Couldn't it be the two issues are not mutually exclusive? They could both be dirty and compromised in their own unique ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND...I'm not supporting Hillary either, I know she is crooked. The only thing I think she has over Trump is I think she has a temperament that is less prone to getting us into a war. (And that's not enough for me to vote for her.)

       Of course they're both dirty - that's beyond question. However, you cannot seriously say Hillary is less prone to war if you look at her record.

       And don't apologize for your source - it's fairly standard.

       Because, like I said, it's
       <strong>

       . It's editorial content posing as news. It's subtle inflections to divert your attention from the facts, while injecting an agenda in an almost imperceptible way.

       Blaming the Russians? Really? We're doing that again? It's almost like when nothing else works, we wanna drag out the old stand-byes. Still, it does nothing to dissuade critical thinkers from the observation of the criminal behavior of the dnc.

       Part of it is due to the fact that the ultimate end-game of the global banking cabal is a world without borders or national sovereignty and control over society. Conservatives tend to be big on preserving the nation-state. Unfortunately, libertarians are often considered "right," much that any critique of government exercising power over the individual (aside from some of the left's pet social issues) is perceived as "rightist."

       i don't know. From my bleeding-heart-commie-pinko-liberal perspective, Conservative leaders these days seem to be more pro-corporatism wrapped in nationalism as a cover. Don't get me wrong, Clinton will burn in hell for signing NAFTA and there are other things Democrats have done over the years I really don't like. But they at least represent my social stances.

       We don't have "conservative leaders" if you are referring to politicians...we have republican leaders who pander to a diminishing conservative base.

       Both parties support globalism and corporatism and are owned by the oligarchs who dominate every industry (big banks; big pharma; the 3 national insurers; etc.).

       Oh, that's easy. If you believe Governments are staging terror attacks, and killing their own people for propaganda, invading countries under false pretenses, working on behalf of international oligarchs to undermine national sovereignty, and establish a global prison planet, you tend to become in favor of Limited Government.

       There is no real difference between the parties. And if you don't think we are at war in Syria and Libya "under false pretenses" you haven't been paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most liberals I know are all in favor of open borders and throwing out the constitution and living under one big happy UN flag of world peace.

      <p>
       [edit: to be clear--there is no real difference between the political parties in the US. There is certainly a difference in lib/conservative viewpoint. However, these ideologies have been co-opted by the parties and are simply used to sell the same product...e.g. "free trade"/"open borders for poor starving refugees"

       I agree with part of what you are saying. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democratic party is now, essentially, what the Republican party was in the 80's. And the Republican party has just gone off the rails. (And I am through with having a Republican-Lite party represent me.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the part I don't agree with...I have never met a liberal that wants to open the borders and live under the UN. Seriously, I would love to meet these "Liberals" and ask them what the hell they are thinking. No, I'm serious, can you hook me up with their info? I have never met a liberal that thought that was  a good idea...or even considered it for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus there is a lot of misinformation about our stances; guns being the first one that comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. Liberals like guns to. I love shooting with my dad and if someone is breaking into your house I think you have the right to put as large a hole in them as you like. I just think that if you need more than a 6 round (Or reasonably sized) clip to do it, you need to go practice more.  The only thing I don't like about guns is hunting. Unless you need the meat for your family; there is no reason to go hunting anymore. (And if we could get some natural predators back into the ecosystem; we wouldn't have to worry about deer overpopulation.) Guns should be for shooting targets and anyone stupid enough to break into your house.

       I live in a liberal town and many people believe we need to get rid of the notion of national sovereignty; guns need to be banned; the government should provide for everything a person could need (free housing/ free insurance/ free drug rehab, etc., etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the "progressives" who literally want to force people who live in the suburbs to sell their homes to "person of color", so we have forced and complete integration (Oddly, these are often the same folks complaining about gentrification of the cities) and believe that the government should buy up as much property (particularly lake property) as possible to remove it from private ownership.

       Nope, I'm considered hard left by most people's standards. Which is why it makes me crazy when conservative talking heads misrepresent liberal ideology.

       And where are these people?! I have never met them in my life and I live in Southern California; and have lived in Oregon and Washington as well.

       Maybe there are fringe liberals that thing that way, but you will not find a mainstream liberal or progressive that thinks that way. Try listening to Thom Hartmann sometime. (Just once.) He is hands down the smartest talk show host I have ever heard; and I think he is center mass on where liberals are today.

       EDIT: OH! Don't misunderstand me. I am saying the Democratic party and it's leadership has shifted right. I would like to believe that the population as a whole has shifted left.

       See, that's the thing; there isn't really a liberal slant in the media. A study was done...I don't know how many years ago...that showed conservatives considered any story that didn't have a pro-conservative slant to be liberal; even stories that were completely neutral.  When you realize that; then of course it looks like there is a liberal bias because you are counting liberal slanted stories and neutral slanted stories as anti-conservative and liberal.
      </p>

       Trust me, looking from this side of things there are a shit-ton of things the media in general ignores that makes it look pro-conservative.

       Such studies are always flawed because they are dependent upon what the base-line is--which is established by the researchers. And the bias is not just in the way a story is presented, its WHICH stories get chosen.  That itself is dependent upon one's worldview and what one considers important.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a more recent example, just look at all the controversy over the Koch brothers funding politicians. You never hear anything about Soros or his agenda...crickets on the wikileaks dump on him---and that is because most journalists agree with his agenda and think he is doing "good" whilst the Koch bros are evil capitalists corrupting the system.

       I'm not going to disagree that the Koch brothers get more coverage. But Soros does still get a lot of coverage himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just searching reddit for "Soros" and then "Koch" gets 6521 returns for Soros and 10611 returns for Koch. That is a lot of coverage for both.

       I can think of 4 major Hillary scandals that get no mention here (not going to name them, stupid partisan fucks).  I can think of 2 major Trump links to the Bush Family &amp; terrorism (not going to name them, stupid partisan fucks).  Is

       lazy or just propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is both.  Even the propagandists can't be bothered to read about the '90s or think outside their hate bubble.  It's just
       <em>
        repetition
       </em>
       .  Which is the key to advertising ... and mind-control.

       I agree with part of what you are saying. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democratic party is now, essentially, what the Republican party was in the 80's. And the Republican party has just gone off the rails. (And I am through with having a Republican-Lite party represent me.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the part I don't agree with...I have never met a liberal that wants to open the borders and live under the UN. Seriously, I would love to meet these "Liberals" and ask them what the hell they are thinking. No, I'm serious, can you hook me up with their info? I have never met a liberal that thought that was  a good idea...or even considered it for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus there is a lot of misinformation about our stances; guns being the first one that comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. Liberals like guns to. I love shooting with my dad and if someone is breaking into your house I think you have the right to put as large a hole in them as you like. I just think that if you need more than a 6 round (Or reasonably sized) clip to do it, you need to go practice more.  The only thing I don't like about guns is hunting. Unless you need the meat for your family; there is no reason to go hunting anymore. (And if we could get some natural predators back into the ecosystem; we wouldn't have to worry about deer overpopulation.) Guns should be for shooting targets and anyone stupid enough to break into your house.

       i don't know. From my bleeding-heart-commie-pinko-liberal perspective, Conservative leaders these days seem to be more pro-corporatism wrapped in nationalism as a cover. Don't get me wrong, Clinton will burn in hell for signing NAFTA and there are other things Democrats have done over the years I really don't like. But they at least represent my social stances.

       Unless you are the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company or get all your income from capital gains or have $10MM in the bank; then you and everyone you know is "the bottom" I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even the top 10% don't need the same protections as the bottom 90%. They can write a check and have a face to face conversation with the politician of their choosing. I don't have that kind of access; and I would be shocked if you did.

       And yes; there are crooked people in every section of society. But I would rather have 1,000 or 10,000 welfare cheats than 1 crooked multi-national. (BTW, neither Reagan nor his people were able to ever produce one "Welfare Queen" that he referenced in his campaign speeches. It was a fabricated myth.) Companies today are offshoring billions in taxable revenue. Which is costing us god knows how much, so that missing tax revenue is being offset by the middle class.

       My apologies, I was looking for a source for you quickly and only skimmed that one briefly.

       Why do you think it has to be a deflection tactic? Couldn't it be the two issues are not mutually exclusive? They could both be dirty and compromised in their own unique ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND...I'm not supporting Hillary either, I know she is crooked. The only thing I think she has over Trump is I think she has a temperament that is less prone to getting us into a war. (And that's not enough for me to vote for her.)

       Ok, let me clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think Trump is a warmonger in any way at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he has also shown that he is prone to shooting from the hip, which on the international stage is going to get you into a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       i would be less concerned if he were at least a reader. Shit, even Bush II was a reader. When asked about his reading habits, Trumps said, “I read passages, I read areas, chapters, I don’t have the time,”
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I was talking about, he doesn't appear to have curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may disagree with my conclusion 100%; but do you at least see how I got to that conclusion?
