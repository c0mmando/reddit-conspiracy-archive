        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/phosphate-giant-mosaic-agrees-to-pay-2-billion-over-mishandling-of/2247897">Mosaic, the world&#39;s largest phosphate company</a> was fined $2 billion in 2015 for the improper storage and disposal of 60 billion pounds of hazardous waste from phosphoric and sulfuric acid production.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703954004576090290720390356">In January 2011, the WSJ reported that Cargill would be selling its stake in Mosaic valued at $24.3 billion.</a></p>

<p>They state:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deal...is largely being driven by the 2006 death of Margaret A. Cargill. Margaret Cargill&#39;s trustees <strong>intend to sell their Mosaic shares over 4½ years</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which would be by July 2015. Let’s ignore the fact that they try to lay the deal on a 17% Cargill stakeholder who died 5 years earlier. That doesn’t make sense, and sounds like a random excuse at best. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.twincities.com/2007/10/09/mosaic-stake-blooms-for-cargill/">http://www.twincities.com/2007/10/09/mosaic-stake-blooms-for-cargill/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cargill created Mosaic in 2004, when it bought a <strong>struggling fertilizer maker that had crushing debts</strong> but lucrative properties. Then it used those assets and its own extensive fertilizer holdings to launch a new public company, christened Mosaic.</p>

<p>But back then, the fertilizer business stunk. Now, it smells like money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in 2004...Mosaic shares were valued at $15. But Cargill paid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deal represents a huge return on Cargill&#39;s seven-year-old investment in Mosaic. Cargill management created Mosaic in early 2004 by combining $1.7 billion of its fertilizer assets with IMC Global Inc., then a struggling fertilizer company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$1.7 billion. And then launched publicly at $15 per share.</p>

<p>And their value 75 months later? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cargill owns 286 million shares, or about 64%, of Mosaic, giving its stake a value of roughly $24.3 billion based on Mosaic&#39;s stock price of $85.07 in 4 p.m. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is going public usual for Cargill?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cargill.com/company/history/">http://www.cargill.com/company/history/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cargill has a long, rich heritage, starting with W. W. Cargill&#39;s first grain storage facility on the American frontier in 1865. The company has grown to become one of the largest, <strong>privately-owned businesses</strong>, providing food, agricultural, risk management, financial, and industrial products and services around the globe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from the above linked WSJ article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mosaic transaction would be the latest move by the tight-lipped company to reward its owners while steering clear of the one option that has always been forbidden: going public. Cargill&#39;s managers have long argued that staying private helps their ability to navigate in volatile commodity markets without having to cope with Wall Street&#39;s short-term expectations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And wikipedia (which fails to mention the $2 billion fine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Launched October 25, 2004, Mosaic was formed by a merger between IMC Global, a fertilizer company formed in 1909, and Cargill&#39;s crop nutrition division.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we have a notorious “tight-lipped” company, that has remained so by being private. It buys up a “struggling” fertilizer producer and takes it public. Going public is something Cargill never did. In 6 years and 3 months, it turns $1.7 billion into $24.3 billion. </p>

<p>Those stock take 4.5 years to sell. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/mosaic-buyback-idUSL1N0JO0MG20131209">In 2013 we learn</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dec 9 U.S. fertilizer company Mosaic Co said on Monday that it would buy back about 10 percent of its outstanding stock in a roughly $2 billion purchase from the Margaret A. Cargill Foundation and the Anne Ray Charitable Trust over the next eight months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And by the time the fine is announced, all stock has been sold to the “public”, which couldn’t have happened if Cargill followed it’s usual practice of keeping its companies private.</p>

<p>So, how did Mosaic go from a “struggling fertilizer maker that had crushing debts” to earning the Cargills $22.6 billion in under 7 years?</p>

<p>While most articles don’t even mention the fine, unless it’s a specific search, we find that <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/10/20/fluoridation-company-fined-2-billion.aspx">the EPA started investigating Mosaic in 2005</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In October 2015, the company agreed to a $2 billion settlement with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection over a <strong>10-year battle</strong> over hazardous waste disposal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, within a year of going public, the EPA was already battling them on hazardous waste storage and disposal.</p>

<p>And that is how a “struggling fertilizer maker with crushing debt” earned the Cargills $22 billion. They ignored the standards that others were subjected to regarding their hazardous waste and then sold out with enough time to avoid the fines and the price drop associated with them. Something they only could have done if Mosaic was a publicly traded company. And the timing so conveniently allowed them to wash their hands it&#39;s almost as if they had foreknowledge (of several years) of when the fine would be announced.</p>
