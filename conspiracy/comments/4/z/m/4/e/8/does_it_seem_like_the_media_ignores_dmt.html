       I've noticed that a lot of media &amp; websites ignore DMT completely. How is the worlds "most powerful psychedelic" not a interesting topic? 9 times out of 10 when i mention DMT to someone they have no fucking idea what it is... It's a drug pretty much everything produces btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't mention DMT.

       S.W.I.M made DMT once. S.W.I.M loved it. S.W.I.M would recommend it for anyone with peace in their hearts, a good head about them, and the desire to grow spiritually.
      </p>
      <p>
       S.W.I.M wanted me to mention that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is there a conspiracy here? Or is DMT just a rare drug. Perhaps due to it's complicated refining process which I do not know anything about. S.W.I.M might. Pretty sure he lives over at the DMT Nexus -

       I watched the doc DMT: The Spirit Molecule on Netflix not that long ago and it definitely piqued my interest.  The scientist overseeing the study of DMT experiences did not come out feeling they could be fully explained by science.

       I smoked dmt and communicated with majestic interdimensional creatures three times. It was pretty wavy blad. I agree that it's a very special substance, and its ostensible integration into widespread forms of life also substantiates what you're positing. But then again when has the media ever had an opinion regarding a substance that's rational and trustworthy?

       you sure you are not a disinformant?
      </p>
      <p>
       DMT is compared as the gold of psychedelics.
      </p>
      <p>
       while they also try to control all the real metal gold in the world by constantly raising gold prices. and also inflation, simultaniously.
      </p>
      <p>
       thus encouraging people to sell up their reserve gold in individual possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       not to mention that processed gold jewelry you wear, cost a lot more than investment gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       not sure what they do with all the metalic gold. but they most likely have hold of them all by now. since they also control all gold mines in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume they just try to control everything of value. thus, gold, the precious metal they lost previously to china in the antiquity, through silk road trades.
      </p>
      <p>
       not sure if gold is trully that irreplaceable in certain aspects. it's probably just some stupid metal.

       are you stupid or backing up a lie?

      <p>
       he said he is scared of DMT while everyone who tried DMT never reported negative experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       he makes no sense and tried to scare the others into trying DMT.

       which part is the brainer part for you? he also speaks about the berenstein conspiracy, which is IMO garbage. and about some swedish techno band?

       What if time travel is real and that is what caused the switch. Perhaps those who are more awake are less affected by changes in the timeline. Not to say you can travel back in time with some machine - what if it were you could simply shift your consciousness back to a previous point.

       I think it's so uncommon that it's not a problem so they feel they can ignore it. Or if they did mention it, the bobbleheads would be like 'i've heard it's some really strong acid, har harhar'  Or some other cheech and chong type thing that normies say with a knowledge of 0 often repeat.

       I've done drugs, I'm drug positive, 420/920 friendly but I've never ever seen or known anyone who has even come into contact with dmt.  Like TMckenna has said, you either need to become a chemist or extract it from ayahuasca like plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way, though, they do mention it--in that on a technicality, psychedelic mushrooms' psilocybin are closely related to DMT

       What is 920? First time i've seen the reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, good point. People are too naive to experience certain things. My grandparents are the first to tell you how bad 420 is, yet have they ever tried it? Nope. I will say this, there are a lot of bad people who smoke pot. Drugs amplify things, if you are a shitty person drugs will probably just make you even more shitty. If you are a good person, drugs (not meth, crack, heroin etc obviously) may help you mature into an even better person. But you have to have the mindset of "I want to grow into a better person by using this drug"

       I think it's literally more than our culture can handle. Our culture can not handle the truth, and this is a very radical truth. People just mentally overload when you start talking about what happens on DMT. It is not compatible with their version of the universe, so their internalized cultural mindset rejects the idea out-of-hand.

       You got me curious. I've had acid-like trips on weed, my brain just works that way. It's sensitive to the psycho-active ingredient that is THC I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everyone I know that smokes just ordinary dope don't react like I do to it. I literally get stoned and sit there and my mind races, use to get stuck in a thought process and tune out everything else. Got too paranoid from it though, lacking moderation and being the irresponsible smoker I was, I had to quit. I've been to the hospital a few times due to the paranoia, stress and 'waking up' to the world around me.

       Yeah, that would probably be true, if such a thing were to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of that zeropoint stuff is just harvesting latent electromagnetic energy and doesn't actually generate all that much more power than a solar panel, from what I understand. Actually generating more energy than you put in to a system is impossible though because of the second law of thermodynamics, which says that a closed system's entropy always increases. Doesn't explain how things had so much extropy/organization at the start of the universe, but as the world behaves now we move in a direction of increasing entropy so you cannot "summon" energy other than gathering what is already there.

       Look up what happens when you put to metal plates reallly close together but not touching. They can literally obverse energy popping in and out of existence. There's no void, only ether.

       Yeah, they want to join which creates a force. That is not a source of infinite energy any more than a stretched out spring is! You can only generate the force once, then you have to set it back up which takes more energy than you got out of it. It's not a source of energy, unless we discovered some naturally occurring source where two plates were already set up in this way over and over,
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       we could set up a way to harvest this energy, but I don't see such a natural arrangement existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like you get energy from a big stone rolling down a hill, but you can only roll it down once before you have to set it up again.

       True or not, that's kind of aside from the point. You cannot harvest energy over and over from the same hill, which is all that 2-plates thing shows

       a hill is aside the point.  I would say this, perhaps the secret is just in collecting ambient energy in the most efficient and smallest design.

       the medicine is very powerful and sacred. First being shared in the Amazon as a chemical dmt-Maoi brewed by the ancients and referred to as grandmother... Maybe just by me, idk. Stuff is great but ultra important you brew it or atleast help brew it.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 Me O dmt is another form of dmt that can be smoked. It comes from the Colorado river road. The toad secrets dmt as a predator repellent. Dogs often try to chew them and the owners freak out because the dog is tripping balls convulsing on the ground with foam coming out of it's mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter the case it is important you know who and where the dmt is coming from and the right time and place finds you, don't try and force it.

       It was shared long before indigenous populations migrated to the Americas via the Bering Strait.  DMT was a part of ancient cultures from the beginning right up to the Dark Ages.  At that point it was lost to all except the elect few.  Now its back.

       First off, don't use SWIM.  It doesnt do anything for you legally.  Its also very grating on folks who frequent psychonaut forums.

       I am one who "got the message, so i hung up the phone" as they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've met enough entities, seen enough beauty, goodness and evil to convince me the world and the spirit realm connected to it is under siege.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be much more pleasant over there, it taught me so much.  The last few times ive tried to go, i have to abort.  The evil spirits are always waiting right on the other side to do more battle with me.

       My last experience (just after my 'Factory of the Souls' post) was a full on prophetic indictment of our culture of greed and corruption.  The last vision was of the puppetmaster that controls it all.  Utterly terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, anyone interested in DMT should look deeper into 'The Grand Elixir'.  We're not talking about South American indigenous peoples.  We're talking about the Acacia Nilotis, "from a single grain of this primal matter becomes a projection into infinity".
      </p>
      <p>
       Egyptians, Sumerians, Zoroastrians, FREEMASONS, hebrews, muslims, "We once possessed this gift.  We abused it, and it was lost.  But it still exists in the hands of the elect of God".

       Personally I don't believe a dmt trip is a look outward into another realm. I believe it's more of a look inward, a preview of our subconscious unbound by our bodies.

       Careful with it. It's powerful shit. It's really not necessary either. Learn how to de-calcify your pineal gland (clean diet clean water slightly aware of body pH),   then, drop your beliefs about consciousness and what is possible, use your consciousness to travel and communicate. It's best to be fully in control, rather than the cannon shot that DMT is. No control, no precision, no chance for objective confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a nice rollercoaster ride, like other poster said make sure you have peace in your heart, at least as much as you think you do. Prepare for an experience that is outside your frame of reference (even if you have done the other psychs) . I wouldn't expect some kind of enlightenment experience, maybe if you have done 90% of the work
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned from DMT-Nexus back in the day, always extract your own, it's important, definitely don't force it. Remember it's only training wheels.

       I had also not heard of it until a few years ago. My cousin does tye dyes and toured with the Dead so I've gotten to know about the Rainbow Family, getting "fingerprinted", not to mention this mysterious psychedelic described as 100 hits of acid in 10 minutes. Said reality fell crashing away in huge columns 360 degrees until he was in a room with every religions supreme leader/God. What I found really interesting was the correlation with DMT trip levels and the Tibetan Book of the Dead's Bardos. With enough practice some Tibetan Monks can meditate efficiently enough to experience the same trip as DMT, although much longer than 10 minutes, if they like. Mechanical elves will often emerge from the kaleidoscoped fractals hijacking ones vision, from what I've read online. Thought for sure DMT would find me on Shakedown Street in Chicago last summer though the doses were so nice didn't look that hard.
