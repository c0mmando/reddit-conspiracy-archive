<p>And that&#39;s just the democrats! I&#39;m sure the republicans are just as bad if not worse, but it seems harder to find information on. Here&#39;s another list: <a href="http://american3rdposition.com/?p=12767">http://american3rdposition.com/?p=12767</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an explanation of how this used to not be allowed, then the law was changed, and also points out many big-name dual citizenship holders in the Bush and Clinton administrations: <a href="http://www.viewzone.com/dualcitizen.html">http://www.viewzone.com/dualcitizen.html</a></p>

<p>Why is this allowed? It is not allowed for regular US citizens to have dual citizenship, is it? </p>

<p>I think this type of thing is allowed because &quot;Israel first&quot; Zionists essentially own our government, which is because the Rothschilds own the central banking system and have money creation powers and they promote Zionism. So you play by their rules, or you don&#39;t get big money access. This is why most industry monopolies are headed by Zionists. It&#39;s not a random chance thing that the tops of most all industries are super gung-ho about Israel. This is also why they get the most aid, and why they have the biggest lobbying groups. </p>

<p>And to be clear, I&#39;m not talking about Jews, half of whom <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/the-true-crisis-of-zionism-silent-majority-of-us-jews-have-never-supported-it/">reject zionism.</a> I&#39;m talking about the ideological belief system, that says the Israeli government deserves to own Mt. Zion, aka that Palestine needs to be removed and regional security for Israel needs to be ensured in the middle east. Obama is a Zionist, Biden is a Zionist. Bush is a Zionist. So is Hillary, and Trump, as their AIPAC speeches showed quite clearly. </p>

<p>These big bankers need to stop being able to pull everyone&#39;s strings, but that won&#39;t stop until people realize their money creation abilities are based on legal narratives that come from false hopes and the false appearance of authority. The government should be able to create its own money, not borrow from a private bank in a debt-based money creation system where there will always, mathematically, be more debt owed than money exists, which gives them power over the government because they are the debt collectors.  </p>

<p>The whole thing is an absurd farce to anyone who sees the truth of it. </p>

<p>&quot;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot; - Henry Ford</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh okay, thank you for that information. I don&#39;t know why I had the impression it was illegal. </p>

<p>edit: According to the last article I posted in the OP, it seems like the 1940 Nationality act did make you give up foreign citizenship to vote, but by the 1960s it was found invalid due to court rulings. So there was a ~20 year period (WW2 through the anti-communist Cold War era) where this was essentially the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which ideology of Zionism are we talking about here? The actual ideology of Zionism,which is the Jewish right to the creation and development of a homeland, or the definition you&#39;ve most likely made up? Or are you going by your horribly written mondoweiss op Ed that arbitrarily interchanges ethnicity and nationality, and uses terms like indigenous Arabs, which is a contradictory statement. You&#39;re right, you can be Jew and a Zionist, or you can be a Jew and not a Zionist, but by any definition you can&#39;t be anti-Zionist without holding the belief that Jews do no deserve a homeland. That by no means makes you antiemetic, which I&#39;m sure you would accuse me of asserting you were. It just means that you believe that Jewish people as an ethnic group do not have the right, nor should they ask for it, to have a homeland. So if you are anti-Zionist you shouldn&#39;t be bitching about Israelis in your country. They&#39;re just giving you what you want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what you&#39;ve been doing the whole time during this conversation. Prior to 1948, Palestine was under full British control. After the partion plan in 48, half of it the mandate of British Palestine was CREATED as the nation of Palestine. A nation that was to live alongside the nation of Israel. Through the years, Palestine was invaded by Jordan and Egypt and subsequently taken over. For decades Gaza and the West Bank were under Egyptiand and Jordanian control. This is all historical fact. I challenge you to be find me a factual source of land stolen by Israelis since 1948 that wasn&#39;t first taken over and annexed by the Government of a neighboring country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and I&#39;ve never said it was, but your assertion that Israels presence in the occupied territories is somehow exclusionism.
