<p>Here&#39;s a satellite about a million miles away that takes 10-20 full photos of Earth per day, the DSCOVR::EPIC::Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera: <a href="http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/">http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a></p>

<p>Before you ask why there are no stars in the photos: The Earth lit by the sun is much brighter than the stars within the same field of view. Same reason why you see far fewer stars during a full moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be a little careful what you question.  Combining multiple, single color images is how EVERY digital camera works, including th one in your phone.  The one in your pocket has an array of red, blue and green sensors, which it exposes to the light.  It then takes the information from all three sets of sensors and composites them together to make the conventional images we see.  Many of the better sattellites have  much wider range of colors (sometimes outside the visual spectrum) and combines them in much the same way.</p>

<p>The idea that three images were stiched together makes perfect sense, as most of our visual technology is based on combining the three primary, additive colors.</p>

Exposure time for each of the 10 narrowband channels (317, 325, 340, 388, 443, 552, 680, 688, 764 and 779 nm) is about 40 ms, and the camera will produce 2048×2048 pixel images, but to increase number of downloadable images to 10 per hour the resolution will be averaged to 1024×1024 on board. The final resolution will be 25 km/pixel (16 mi/pixel).[23]</p>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s dedicating bands to a new capture, but they&#39;re all taken at the same moment from the same field of view from the same instrument. It&#39;s a &quot;composite&quot; in the sense that spectral bands have a dedicated image layer, but one band wouldn&#39;t make much sense as an image. It&#39;s like if your phone took separate images for red, green, and blue and put them together for your photo (which it kinda does).</p>

<p>In the meaning you&#39;re pushing simply arranging the pixels of a phone camera photo is a &quot;composite&quot; so this debate makes little sense to me. Unless you&#39;re using &quot;composite&quot; in the sense that an image is stitched together from parts of the Earth... which, as explained several times, isn&#39;t the case with DSCOVR EPIC. <strong>DE has the entire Earth within every image.</strong></p>

<p>Do you understand why this is more effective at capturing an image than pointing your iPhone at the Earth from space?</p>

<p>A pixel for every 16 sq miles. Created by overlaying up to ten photos. And then some user who happens to find an issue with all topics on this sub equating that to a &quot;full photo&quot;. Your act is absurd. As absurd as putting an iPhone camera as a satellite camera.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not reductio ad absurdum to ask you if you understand why an instrument that captures a wider range of bands than your DSLR is preferred to take photos in space of objects hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s overlaying 10 spectral bands to create an image. See, this way you can adjust the bands like how you can adjust contrast and brightness on your camera. Except this thing is dealing with much, much more information to create an image.</p>

<p>If you could, I&#39;d like to you to literally say that you understand that each spectral band of each image has the entire Earth within its frame. Could you say that for me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re losing me here, friend. How is what you&#39;re doing reductio ad absurdum?</p>

<p>Calling it a &quot;composite&quot; is like saying that the green and red and blue of your iPhone photos are &quot;composited&quot; together. But in this case, we&#39;re talking about a much wider range than RGB. I mean, isn&#39;t all digital imaging a &quot;composite&quot; by this standard?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t a composite photo be forensically analyzed? I can make one today and throw it in a tool as blunt as fotoforensics.com and it would be able to tell. You lost me on that one.</p>

<p>I used the term &quot;protect myself&quot; as in &quot;protect myself from you claiming that I literally said it&#39;s a composite&quot; which you did anyway. But at least it&#39;s clear it wasn&#39;t intellectually honest.</p>

<p>Again, if you could, I&#39;d like to you to literally say that you understand that each spectral band of each image has the entire Earth within its frame. Could you say that for me?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>is kind of odd. You chose NASA as your source. NASA calls it a composite. Acknowledging that your source calls it a composite requires you to &quot;protect yourself&quot;?</p>

<p>Saying they might as well use my old iPhone camera is a reductio ad absurdum. I see how I&#39;m losing you. You fail to see NASA calling it a composite and you fail to note what is the reductio ad absurdum.</p>

<p>A composite made up of 10 overplayed photos can&#39;t be forensically analyzed without the 10 source photos, which NASA doesn&#39;t release.</p>

<p>If any issues can be shown, they can be blamed on it being a composite.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An DSCOVR EPIC image is comprised of ten spectral bands, not ten photos in the sense of light photos like your phone camera. In any case, you surely could analyze a photo made of ten photos composited. It would be in the EXIF data, for one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how using a reductio ad absurdum in that sense helps your end of this debate. It kind of makes you seem non-serious about the issue.</p>

<p>Ok, block me I guess. It&#39;s hardly necessary, but go nuts.</p>

<p>If you could, and this is the third time I&#39;ve requested this, could you literally say that you understand the fact that each spectral band used to create an image has the entire Earth within its frame?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see you say it, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Now can you say it&#39;s odd that only composite photos of the earth exist?</p>

<p>Can you say that by only allowing composite photos, that some information is being protected?</p>

<p>Can you say that NASA itself calls it a composite photo and doesn&#39;t release the source photos?</p>

<p>Can you say that a 1 pixel per 16 sq. miles makes it rather useless?</p>

<p>To answer your question, it makes no sense to limit a satellite&#39;s instruments to just the spectrum visible to humans when we can capture data from ranges beyond that.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ll complain similarly that it uses spectral bands beyond human sight to capture images.</p>
