       Outside enjoying the weather, looking at the stars, only to realize they are definitely not all stars. 30% of what I'm seeing in the sky tonight is moving. I'm not the only one I have witnesses to confirm this as well as internet searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       These ARE NOT satellites so don't bother commenting if that's your answer. The movement of these "stars" is reminiscint to that of ants. They look like fucking insects skittering around in the sky. What the FUCK are they.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this often and some nights there is more activity than others. These are NOT airplanes or jets or blimps, I repeat that the movement is more like that of an insect than anything else I can think of. Obviously giant bright insects don't infest the sky ( or do they????!! /s) so what the fuck are these moving lights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surveillance craft? Alien airships? 
Just sucks when you look at a beautiful starry night to realize that most of what you're seeing isn't even supposed to be there

       I was compelled to go outside and look at the stars because it's a clear night where I live and also because I read your post 10mins after you sent it, however I didn't see any movement. Maybe it's because we live in different areas of the country, or maybe it's because this thread was posted by a user who has stated in multiple threads on
       <a href="/r/thetruthishere">

       UPDATE you guys I had to go in the house because it got freaky. I talked to them more directly and told them to move in circles and go left and right etc and they fucking did. Aside from nearly peeing my pants and having an uncomfortable adrenaline rush combined with anxiety it was pretty neat. BUT I don't wish to communicate that directly with something I know NOTHING about. ''Twas fun though &gt;.&lt;

       No I told one that if it knew I saw it to move in a quick circle and it immediately did. Then I pointed to another one and said "I know you're not a star, move to my left" and it shot to my left and I then told it to move to my right and it zipped to the right.

       There's no way they were all lasers. Also the neighbor situation is not possible due to my location. The people I was with confirmed what I was seeing and a laser was never offered up as an option from any of the eyewitness

       I am on the west coast and i have a small patch of sky I can see.  While I see tons of satellites on a nightly basis ive not seen one yet to stop and maneuver a different direction.  If you stare at a star long enough it will jiggle, this is just an optical illusion.  You need to get a video to back up your claims, then folks will take you seriously.  I'd love to see it myself, though it would freak me out!

       I'm not saying these lights

       intelligently guided or ET-based, however.  I'm just saying that I wouldn't be surprised if they'd been around for quite some time.

       I think that's what has me so fascinated; do humans create the moving lights or other extraterrestrial beings? I want it to be the other because if that's caused by humans then it's likely government surveillance or war-type crafts just waiting for the next command. 
I'll be looking up again tonight!

       Finally someone else has noticed this! I live in Chicago and have witnessed too.  I've pointed this out to a couple of people and they've given me a bunch of scientific reasons as to why or slack no in between.

       The movement is almost shaky yet a bit eerie like they're jittering. I have never seen anything like this until the last few months- I almost get the vibe that it's like an omen or a sign that were off balance and alignment.

       The first time I pointed it out I got a whole lot of useless lectures about satellites; they were trying so hard to grasp at any explanation other than the fact that it's simply unexplainable.
Thanks for commenting, glad others see it! I wonder if they're visible internationally or just in our specific areas?

       Same! A lot of talk about gasses and angles even a few "to the naked eye" excuses. However, I often times bounce things like this off an elder from the ojibwe tribe that I've become friends with and he too has noticed this. We both agree it seems as if things are/going to be shaken up hence the jittery movements.

       I've seen some in formations of 3 and they all moved in time with each other.  I just can't shake the uneasy feeling of not knowing if that's a man-made aircraft or some alien type fucking with us. I think I'd rather it be an "alien" spacecraft type because why the eff would the government have such intelligence like that above of our heads? Unsettling.

       I also noticed this during the Perseid meteor shower. In addition to the insane shooting stars and explosions in the sky, I saw constant stars jittering, blinking, moving in concert with each other. It also looks like they communicate with each other.
