We have solar panels and battery diagrams which are hidden behind government red tape for being too good, and these guys are putting 3000 people to work to make a more efficient battery... I&#39;m sure they will make one which is better then the limited efficiency the government allows before censoring it... So will they lose all that work?!
I&#39;d really be interested in a real world answer or some sort of theory with thought behind it.
How does a real company with a research dept. NOT get screwed by a government who hides patents of great tech?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, a group of students, paying their tuition fees to study at MIT under Donald Sadoway, developed a cheap battery that he called &quot;The missing link to renewable energy&quot;. He said in March 2012 that it was ready for mass production.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sddb0Khx0yA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sddb0Khx0yA</a></p>

<p>Bill Gates bought it up and it has yet to reach market, or even get any attention, unlike Tesla&#39;s failed battery which was hyped sky high only to quickly be dismissed.</p>

<p>The technology is &quot;disruptive&quot;. It interferes with all the intermediate tech. It&#39;s like iPhone going straight to iPhone 7 without getting all the profits for the 1-6s. </p>

<p>Is the government complicit? Yes. But more so are the agendas they are being pushed so that the government can push further controls.</p>

<p>Bill Gates is a slimy shit who cares about power, not money. He wishes to dictate the future through the concept of resource scarcity. He is part of a large group of people doing the same. </p>

<p>They cannot allow resources that invalidate the idea of resource scarcity to become commonly available.</p>

<p>The same is true for thorium, hemp and other technologies. The government reinforces the prevention of the dissemination of these technologies as it reasserts their position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Source on Bill Gates buying the company? All I can find is that he&#39;s one of many investors (the US government being another FYI) not the owner. They&#39;re also hoping to release commercial batteries at the end of 2017...it&#39;s top of the list on <a href="http://www.ambri.com/news/">http://www.ambri.com/news/</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hemp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Useless for things like paper. About 100% of trees can be pulped to make paper, hemp is about 50% and it&#39;s also more expensive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thorium</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really don&#39;t get the obsession reddit has with Thorium, like it&#39;s an interesting avenue to explore for energy generation but what benefits is there in comparison to classical reactors that use plutonium / Uranium? Why not just go all in with Gen lV reactors which already have experimental reactors up and running (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-800_reactor">BN-800</a>) or are at least under construction or are being planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uranium has about 30-40 years of known reserves at current use. Thorium, the US currently has enough stockpiled to meet our entire energy needs for a thousand years.</p>

<p>Thorium is already stockpiled as a nuclear waste by-product of mining for rare earths. We already mine, transport and store it.</p>

<p>The dangers of nuclear weapons don&#39;t exist with thorium. India had a working design for thorium, so why not give it a try?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Useless for things like paper. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But great for things like 3D printing material, hempcrete for building better homes than we currently see built, and for plastics like zeoform. These are examples of products than can be made from the waste byproduct of growing grain. That is, it doesn&#39;t lead to competition between food and bio-products; you can get both at the same time.</p>

<p>You can also get the CBDs from the same product. So, you are getting medicine, industrial, commercial and food products from the same crop. </p>

<p>Hemp is a high yielding crop. The &quot;waste&quot; is around 2.4 tonnes per acre. That&#39;s enough to build a 2000 ft<sup>2</sup> house out of hempcrete that is carbon neutral, highly fire resistant, insulating, long lasting, non off-gassing, breathes (self regulates humidity), and is rot and told resistant. It is what one British museum decided to house their archives in to prevent high energy costs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re also hoping to release commercial batteries at the end of 2017...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they are. Only 5.5 years after being said it was ready for mass production. Kind of like how India was pursuing thorium...until it was ready. Then, it was determined that it wouldn&#39;t be the optimal use of indigenous energy resources; i.e. they would make less on it than other forms of energy and they shut it down.</p>

<p>As for the source on Gates owning the company, you just said he and others are the investors. An investor is an owner. He is a powerful and influential one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Engineer here.  I don&#39;t know specifics about projects that have been quashed, but I can shed some light on the lofty promises of some of this tech:</p>

<p>What often happens is: x engineer has a project with lofty goals that is based on y scientific evidence.</p>

<p>He then drums up buzz about this using the media in order to fund-raise.</p>

<p>He then gets money for the project, and then discovers either A) He isn&#39;t smart enough to get to project to work, or B) It was never going to work.</p>

<p>Sometimes these projects do get bought up, but often the projects simply were not profitable on a large scale, or just not feasible (i.e. requires some very rare/hard to make material).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe for a second that companies are buying up these projects and keeping them secret, because some OTHER engineer would have remade the design, and put it to market.  Also the potential for profit on a game changing design is too alluring to pass up - even if you are as rich as bill gates.</p>

<p>I think we are just seeing tons of failed projects and people not familiar with the process think there is some conspiracy whereas its simply failure.</p>

<p>Also, its not like people are proud of their failures.  So you&#39;ll rarely, if ever, see news about X project failing.  You&#39;ll just never hear from it again when it does fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be extremely risky to hide it.</p>

<p>Imagine you design a better battery  worthy of a patent. Assuming you used popular science and materials it&#39;s conceivable that someone else in the future may stumble upon your design. The only way to legally protect your idea is to share it with world and patent it.</p>

<p>Even if you are the profit maker on the existing batteries you would simply &quot;sit&quot; on your patent and only make 100 per year and sell them a million a piece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Electrical engineer here with a reality check. Batteries (that are market available today) are very simple things. Unless there&#39;s a huge revelation in physics about another method of storing/converting energy, we&#39;ll likely only be able to see small incremental changes to how good our batteries are. i.e. So long as we&#39;re storing energy through chemical processes, there is a very finite limit to how much energy we can store. If we do see new batteries, they won&#39;t be THAT much better than what&#39;s out there.</p>

<p>Also, 3000 engineers are not something you can just &quot;enlist&quot;. It&#39;ll likely take multiple years just to hire a team that size (which is a size unheard of for a team solely consisting of engineers). Assuming you&#39;re properly interviewing each one, you would have already burnt through your $1.4b budget paying people to conduct interviews. Not to mention you&#39;ll probably have engineers tearing out each others&#39; throats if you put too many of them in the same room. &quot;Too many chefs spoil the stew&quot; or whatever that saying is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could but you would just charge capacitors with the battery and deliver the energy with the capacitors. Capacitors are not designed for energy storage, but to quickly supply little amounts of energy to maintain voltage (and a few other things, but they are mostly used for this).  But with just a battery you couldn&#39;t. There just for diffrent applications, you can cut stuff with a spoon but a knife is better, you can eat soup with a knife but a spoon is better.</p>
