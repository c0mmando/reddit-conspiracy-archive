       Think of the East and West (NWO's) like mafia families. Working together for business but both vying to be the dominant family. This has been going on for thousands of years.

       Putin is not playing the game right. He should be making his country hate Americans, but the fool is pointing at the American government and our corrupt political system.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further a plan where he is in collusion, it would be much more effective to isolate his people from the West. I've got a lot of friends in software who are from both Russia and the former USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know too much about Russian society, and dialogue is too free to make his stance compatible with the Hegelian dialectic. China, on the other hand... is an easier sell. It could be that Russia is out of the loop, and China and the West are colluding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only know a few Chinese people, and it appears that they have their press locked down. They are quite insular, and that would fit the narrative quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USSR looks like it may have been in collusion with the west in a Strategy of Tension, but that might have broken down when the wall fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia could be a country that is trying to recover from being in the grips of the international movers, just as we are. Glasnost and perestroika seem to be against the global agenda, in the way they occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll keep my eyes open, though :)

       Russia, China and the U.S. are in fact in bed together as members of the Bank for International Settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their central bank Presidents meet up one night every 2 months to discuss what will happen to us all, next. Their power is that they control all of the money. There is no greater power than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's proof of their being 'in bed' together.
      </p>
      <p>
       As members of the BIS they are not real competitors against their fellow members.

       See I was arguing with someone who said they would never depopulate because it would hurt profits but the point is these people own money....Profit is irrelevant

       It amazes me what they get away with. Labeling people as conspiracy theorists just kills any attempt to question offical storys. That has been there best anti-truth weapon to date. And everyone laughs when really the people they are laughing at CT's with are the real villians.

       They will never die off. They seem to live forever and I bet they have already filled a good few positions with supporters of their cause. Plus when they die someone is always waiting to replace them.

       They definately are, I have lost count of how many of them have told us they want us dead and a global order. We just need to take them with us. Global tyrants infecting every country.

       I dont personally believe in clones and reptiles. I also dont believe in alien abuductions because I know the government can simulate alien abuductions and have been able to for many decades. So I personally hold them accountable. I was interested in the fact steven hawkins is still alive though considering his condition? Perhaps it is his money, or maybe a clone or double?

       the alien thing they play up feels artificial altho we could have had our dna actually tampered with like two separate events ... sometimes i think what we think are aliens are perhaps us time traveling back in the future where that could be possible in context but still just a could be ... i think that they could be manipulating us to be open to some hollagraphic event they pass off as aliens but still separate from the fact that space is the place and awfully big at that so ... yeah i think we are not the only life planet  i do think clones exist  i think that explains why all these folks havent died already altho organ transplants may be their thing with stem cells and such that they keep for themselves to themselves ...

       They have almost perfected mind control. Watch a DAARPA talk on mind matters. They can already put memorys in our brains and we would believe them to be real. Imagine when they match that with radio frequencys. They could convince us to believe whatever they chose. They even spoke of being able to take brainactivity from criminals and psychopaths and look for it in children. The man who spoke about it even suggested doing something about that child might be something to consider......
      </p>

       Clones are definately possible. I heard a rosswell conspiracy that was incredibly convincing even though it was a bit out there. Thats strangefor me because I usually stick to critical thinking conspiracys as opposed to belief and speculation. But it was a very convincing explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also heard the alien life returning theory. I believe they have anti grav from nazis. I think the idea has merit and it would be a brillant idea as most people, especially UFO'ers would fall for it. Then they can rule the world through these "benevolent" aliens.

       I dont personally believe in clones and reptiles. I also dont believe in alien abuductions because I know the government can simulate alien abuductions and have been able to for many decades. So I personally hold them accountable. I was interested in the fact steven hawkins is still alive though considering his condition? Perhaps it is his money, or maybe a clone or double?
