    <div class="md"><p>But why hasn&#39;t anyone ever crossed this ice wall barrier? No photos? Nothing...There is a story about admiral byrd finding inner earth, but no stories about someone finding the edge of the flat earth...</p>

<p>This map even shows that if earth was flat that there is still some curvature to the plane...How does that work? Wouldn&#39;t there be the same factor of the calculation of the horizon and the curvature? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the Earth is flat, but they are definitely lying about things. Why? Because knowledge is power. What&#39;s really interesting that I got out of the FE theory is all the occult/mystery/majick schools behind all of our sciences,math,philosophies, etc etc. All the people behind them were a part of these groups. Also, the Church is the one who pushed the Heliocentric model. One should ask, why the change in tune?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no Earth. This is all a virtual reality simulation. Like in world of warcraft. It doesn&#39;t fucking matter if the earth is flat or round. It doesn&#39;t fucking exist. It&#39;s all just information. 0s and 1s. Look at World of Warcraft, does that planet exist? Who cares if the earth is flat or round. You can travel the entire conciousness system through your own consciousness, hundreds of realities, historical database, probable future database. All of consciousness is at your finger tips. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is flat OR round. As long as the data is calculated roughly the same way 
IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER. 
IT&#39;S A SIMULATION!! 
WHAT MATTERS IS YOUR LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLUTION!!

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here goes.</p>

<p>The flat earth implies a creator and as such we then have to take in account certain biblical aspects regarding Lucifer and the falen angels. Now Lucifer wanted to remake the world that the creator created. Unlike the creator, the angelic class did not have the power to create, but they could influence those that could.</p>

<p>So other than the creator, man also has the ability to create, thus we were made in the image of the creator.</p>

<p>So skip ahead, Lucifer is cast into the pit along with those that joined his rebellion. There are also demons which are the disembodied spirits of the nephlin (book of Enoch stuff).</p>

<p>Now they could not directly interfere with man but could still influence man especially if the man was willing to play host to the entity. So in order to change that the creator created the Catholic church (roman pagens masquerading as Christians) embraced the heliospheric concept and pushed it, not mainstream science of the day. It audio made the bible inaccurate and the creator fallible.</p>

<p>Skip ahead about five hundred years and man was finally able to go to the reaches of space and the most extreme point in Antarctica ( Google US and USSR nukes shot in space and Admiral Richard Byrd).  </p>

<p>So now they discover there is a fermament, it it&#39;s a dome and the edge is antarctica. That have to fake moon landings, space missions etc (NASA is a money hole for hiding how they funded DUMBS and the network of underground tunnels).</p>

<p>Nobody is allowed to explore Antarctica for a reason. </p>

<p>Now imagine the powers that be having to tell the world they&#39;ve been lying to them for the past five hundred years, knew the truth but continues the lie. And the lie is that reality and our world, the universe and our place in it involves planets, galaxies, and we are nothing but an insignificant speck in it.</p>

<p>Thus the world created by the creator is changed into that by influence of evil via man&#39;s ability to create.</p>

<p>Seems like you&#39;d want to keep that a very big secret indeed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s more intricate than that but just a basic summery of my research into it.</p>
