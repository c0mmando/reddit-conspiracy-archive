        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever wonder why nothing seems to improve in the USA?  Israel is a fifth column.  Just before Obama exits, the largest foreign aid deal will be completed. </p>

<p>&quot;... the administration was prepared to increase the existing military aid package for Israel, worth nearly $30 billion, and sign a new one <strong>“that would constitute the largest pledge of military assistance to any country in U.S. history.”</strong>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/world/middleeast/us-increase-military-aid-israel.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/world/middleeast/us-increase-military-aid-israel.html</a></p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it long past time Israel took care of itself instead of being a parasite on this nation?  They&#39;ve got a rumored 300+ nukes, and the 3rd largest Air Force thanks to Dov Zakheim.  Perhaps they would be less aggressive to their neighbors if the USA wasn&#39;t fighting its battles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because &quot;Israel first&quot; Zionists essentially own our government, which is because the Rothschilds own the central banking system and have money creation powers and they promote Zionism. So you play by their rules, or you don&#39;t get big money access. This is why most industry monopolies are headed by Zionists. It&#39;s not a random chance thing that the tops of most all industries are super gung-ho about Israel. Why they get the most aid, why they have the biggest lobbying groups. </p>

<p>And to be clear, I&#39;m not talking about Jews, half of whom <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2012/09/the-true-crisis-of-zionism-silent-majority-of-us-jews-have-never-supported-it/">reject zionism.</a> I&#39;m talking about the ideological belief system, that says the Israeli government deserves to own Mt. Zion, aka that Palestine needs to be removed and regional security for Israel needs to be ensured in the middle east. Obama is a Zionist, Biden is a Zionist. Bush is a Zionist. So is Hillary, and Trump, as their AIPAC speeches showed quite clearly. </p>

<p>These big bankers need to stop being able to pull everyone&#39;s strings, but that won&#39;t stop until people realize their money creation abilities are based on legal narratives that come from false hopes and the false appearance of authority. The government should be able to create its own money, not borrow from a private bank in a debt-based money creation system where there will always, mathematically, be more debt owed than money exists. </p>

<p>The whole thing is an absurd farce to anyone who sees the truth of it. </p>

<p>&quot;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot; - Henry Ford</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Balfour Declaration was a letter dated 2 November 1917 from the United Kingdom&#39;s Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. It read:</p>

<p>His Majesty&#39;s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I commented on the Balfour Declaration and that image a few weeks ago in my lead up to &quot;9/11 happened because of Israel&quot;. It was fun researching all that since I learned a ton of world history which I had no idea about.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another big piece of the puzzle which is about the invasion of Lebanon by Israel:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you could say the millions of dollars that go to every country that the U.S gives aid to could be used instead to fix domestic issues, but cutting off foreign aid is the first step to cutting off trade, which is not how you remain a world hegemony. The U.S total foreign aid package is $35 billion annually. Which last year was still less than a percent of total GDP. So while Israel receives the most foreign aid, at about 8/10ths of a percent, in the grand scheme the foreign aid argument pertaining to Israel or even the rest of the world has no real ramifications in terms of how it impacts U.S politicians inability to appropriately fund infrastructure growth and healthcare, and education. They till have about 17.8 trillion to work with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel has far more to offer than any other country, especially given its population of 8 million than any other country in terms of technology. Specifically, like I said, in desalination tech. They are also leaders in military technology, with a focus on missile defense. So they offer a lot in terms of attack defense, and the ability to have safe drinking water, two massive commodities. As far as I know they are the world leaders by a large margin in that technology. If you couple that with the fact that almost all the aid gets put back into the U.S economy, Israel offers the U.S the most financial return per capita of all the foreign aid it distributes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay as was previously stated: your total annual cost is $6.20 annually. That figure was reached by taking the latest full term GDP calculation of 17.9 trillion. This number has been established to be 3 billion annually of which about 13% is aloud to be spent on non US resources, specifically goods, according to OPs own article referenced. So you have 17.9 trillion in annual GDP, then you have 3 billion in Israeli aid. divided by the number of tax paying Americans, which I calculated for times sake to be 76% of the population or 318 million people. So 3 billion annually divided by 318 million. So there you have about $9.50 total, but as stated only a portion of that is not funneled back into the U.S economy and ultimately your tax returns. It&#39;s around 13% but for arguments sake I made it 30% because why not? We&#39;ve got almost $10.00 here and that&#39;s a pretty decent sized meal at Burger King every year! After the 30% stolen from you by the filthy zionists you come to the number of $6.20 per year. So: the total figure &quot;stolen&quot; from each U.S citizen by the entire country of Israel; which includes all citizens, whether they be Jew, Muslim, or Christian; all politicians is:</p>

<p>$6.20. Equivalent to a few of those delicious whoppers, a heavily taxed pack of smokes, or a couple gallons of gas. </p>

<p>Now for the Palestinian leaders: I will focus more on President Abbas here because there is no argument that Hamas steals essentially all of its aid. So in concession of that, I will only use 100 million of the 500 million in aid and for arguments sake divide that by 100. This now shows that Abbas is receiving a fifth of the total aid given by the U.S, and then divides it equally amongst 100 other members of Fatah. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf">https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/where-does-all-that-aid-for-palestinians-go-1453669813">http://www.wsj.com/articles/where-does-all-that-aid-for-palestinians-go-1453669813</a></p>

<p>The TLDR of those articles, which are very objective in their information provided shows in the West Bank alone. The GDP is, rounding up because why not: $5.00, but the aid they receive should translate to $15.00, this time rounding down for funsies. Both of these articles present a puzzled dilemma: where is that $10.00 that should be there per capita? The answer is... In the pockets of Abbas and his Fatah cronies. So let&#39;s do more math. I said 100 million is what he gets, and he is &quot;misplacing&quot; $10.00 per person. That&#39;s easy math. That&#39;s a total of $10 million &quot;lost&quot; or as I see it, stolen annually. Now because I said he divides that equally with 100 other people, more easy math: 100 thousand. Abbas steals and puts in his own pocket $100 thousand from U.S tax payers annually. This is one man, calculated at the most conservative and favorable estimates for you. This isn&#39;t factoring the most likely millions he steals from foreign aid worldwide. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s the math. You have: you have an entire country of 8 million people stealing from you a grand total of $6.20 per person annually. And you have a single man who is supposed to be the leader of his country, which is greatly suffering, stealing $100 thousand from American taxpayers as a whole annually. So to re equate that to a person to person basis; Americans give President Abbas about $99,994 than they do to every Israeli citizen annually, while stealing $10.00 from every Palestinian daily, which equates to $3650 per Palestinian, per year. </p>

<p>The final figure here is: the Israelis collectively steal 3 billion a year, or $6.20 per U.S taxpayer. President Abbas alone steals $100 thousands from American Taxpayers per year, and $3650 per Palestinian per year. So I say again, and the numbers and facts back me up; more of your money goes into Palestinian politicians pockets than it does into Israelis by a margin of $99,994.00 per person. </p>

Both sides are at fault, and your argument is fundamentally circular in nature because as long as you ASSUME aid is justified, you will not question whether removal of aid will in essence create a scenario where both sides stop living on doles and work with each other to find a solution. 
I do not have sides on this, but the killings must stop, and both sides have blood on their hands</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of the way our tax code is written. A majority of the top charities in the US have a political agenda that is keeping this system intact, which is basically laundering what would otherwise be tax revenue, but is instead replaced with a bonus &quot;care package&quot; that essentially triples it to split between the various parties.  I think this speaks of an even larger issue with our tax code and political system and the blessed ignorance of the American people.

    <div class="md"><p>You have an interesting view of things here. According to your own article. Israel gets 30 billion in aid, of which only 13% can be used outside of spending the money on U.S goods. This is an easy way to stimulate the economy from U.S politicians point of view. I would say Israel is far from a parasite, they have provided the entire world with numerous technologies, including desalination processes that could save California from becoming unliveable. Aside from that, even with the increased aid, which again only 13% of which is allowed in outside spending according to your own article. So if the U.S GDP did not increase at all from its total of $17.9 trillion in 2015, that $30 billion aid package would be less that a quarter of a percent of the U.S total GDP. Which is a drop in the bucket if there ever was one. </p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons to dislike the way Israeli politicians run their Government; there are a lot of domestic and foreign policy issues in Israel that are abhorrent; but the argument that Israel is a leach like welfare state to the U.S is a silly argument to make. Unless you&#39;re that much of a Jew that you care that your $10 annually is going into Israel.</p>

<p>EDIT: I did the math here. And assuming everyone over the age of 18, which is 76% of the population of 343 million according to the last census, was a tax payer, the total cost in money that Israel is given that isn&#39;t funneled back into the U.S over the decade long agreement is $62 per person. It would cost you $6.2 annually, and $62 total in money you won&#39;t be getting back in your tax return. </p>

A quarter of a percent is a lot when you&#39;re talking about the GDP of an entire nation. It will be used to buy US arms, which will further entrench the military-industrial complex and render our economy even more dependent on it, which plays right in to the plans of warmongers. </p>

<p>To reply to other comment. I&#39;m not apologizing for anything. Unfortunately arms sales are a great economic booster, politicians see that as a way to increase Capitol worldwide, including in Palestine, not just in Israel. And as the article YOU posted says, only a third of that aid package goes towards military spending, most of which is going towards missile defense systems. So in your strange reality where the U.S cuts off funding to Israel, and do to their inability to shoot down thousands of rockets being aimed at them you can blame yourself and people like you for the thousands upon thousands of Palestinians who die because Israel would have to take a more aggressive and deadly approach to the projectiles being rained down on them. </p>

<p>The second point, does the U.S need Israeli technology. You wouldn&#39;t have your cell phone or half your other electronics without Israel. To narrow down a broad subject though, I&#39;ll focus on the desalination technology Israel has and has shared with the U.S. It is pretty well known that with global warming, coupled with several other factors that fresh water is becoming the biggest commodity in the world. Even though it already was/is, it will never be more important as fresh water resources grow sparce and salt water sources increase. As far as I know Israel is the world leader in making salt water drinkable water. If we can find other avenues I&#39;m not opposed to using them. The U.S has already shown the need for this tech though and the benefits derived from it on its own soil. For all we know Israel could provide countries worldwide the tech to have a reliable source of water with that technology and cutting off aid would hinder or completely halt the progress of it. So in a twisted way, by the U.S cutting aid from Israel, they are really harming the entire world population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there is. Despite the inhumane treatment by the Government of the Palestinians, Israel gives the U.S massive amounts back in the forms of trade, technology, education, and if need be, military support. If the U.S decides it wants boots on the ground to fight ISIS in Syria ever, they&#39;re going to be Israeli boots, not American ones. In strictly financial terms, investing in Israel is by far the best investment the U.S can make when talking about foreign investment. No other country that size in the world could even come close to matching the return the U.S gets from Israel. India sees that as well, which is why they have tried to invest so heavily and build a strong relationship with them so much. so does Russia, so does China. Notice the common theme there? All countries jockeying for hegemony. Dislike it all you want but investing in Israel is not only smart, it is empirically profitable and beneficially from many angles. So hate Israel all you want for the abundance of other reasons available, but in terms of being a financial hinderence or &quot;leach&quot; all the facts prove otherwise. </p>

<p>I want to edit this post and say this: it really is tragic that Countries are not held more accountable for the atrocities they commit, but the sad way of the world now is that every decision every world leader makes today is a fiscal decision. It&#39;s the reason Obama gave more aid to Israel despite their blatant and inhumane treatment of Palestinians, it&#39;s the reason that Russia is dropping random bombs all over Syria and trying to annex the Crimea, and it&#39;s the Palestinian Government exploits their entire population and perpetuates the death and suffering of their own people. It all comes to maximizing the money you can make for yourself. In a perfect world every nation would be held responsible for the injustices they commit, but at that point every nation in the world would be throwing stones at glass houses. </p>
