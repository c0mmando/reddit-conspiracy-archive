<p>Yet they exist nonetheless - just like the constitution doesn&#39;t make provisions for so many maladies that are going on in this country that shouldn&#39;t be, but still very much are.</p>

<p>Agreed, but try looking around you and tell me if this country has not been absolutely inundated in that very type of nefarious secrecy.</p>

<p>So, then, it&#39;s all just a means to an end?  Problem with that is, whose Constitution gets secretly defended?  The one where somebody shoots JFK because JFK threatened to tear the spooks into a million pieces, or failed to kill Castro like Big Business &amp; Allen Dulles believed represented freedom?</p>

<p>What’s just a means to an end?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem with that is, whose Constitution gets secretly defended?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Cramer, currently it’s a nefarious constitution that’s getting secretly defended and has been pushed forward in this country.  He said that president Dwight D. Eisenhower created a secret military branch (A) to combat the group pushing forward this nefarious constitution (Group B).  Group A was composed of people who swore an oath to the constitution and who are vehemently opposed to Group B’s secrecy and subversion of the constitution itself.  Of course one can say that Group A can’t be trusted either, but considering that Eisenhower composed A of elite Marines that were at least <em>in theory</em> VERY constitutionally-bound and loyal, I would imagine that this group is about as trustworthy and constitution bound as you can get, and they’re at least more trustworthy than Group B.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  It’s been Group B’s constitution that’s been secretly and not so secretly defended for quite a while.  Captain Cramer says that he actually has legal and constitutional authority under the bill that Eisenhower signed into law to disclose the ET information he’s disclosing because he’s part of a secret cadre of elite individuals who swore and oath to the constitution of the U.S., and that constitution (because of the actions of Group B) has been almost entirely subverted and undermined.</p>

<p>If they are, they would have reached out to us on this sub and cst I imagine.  I mean if they&#39;ve just dismissed those of us here as stupid cranks not worthy of their help, then they might as well not be the good guys imo.  Because their intelligence so far has proved to be crap.  And we&#39;ve done good research here also, and what has come of that?  </p>

<p>What&#39;s come of the whole saudis being sued by 911 victims?  Did we forget about that?  </p>

<p>What about panama papers?</p>

<p>Pedos in our government?</p>

<p>Our list of confirmed conspiracies where we showed clearly many examples of human experiementation and illegal deployment of biological agents on the ameircan people even this year!</p>

<p>We presented several points of evidence that the swiss are poisoning our food and stealing water.  What&#39;s come of that?  Arrests?  Did the fda recall all those chocolates or did they let them run for easter?  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve pointed out that the continuity of operations plan is still in effect and the our laws are either wholly invalid (yes they are) OR there is &#39;secret law&#39; at play (also invalid -- violates public sovereignty); have they looked into how that might have affected hillary and comey&#39;s ability to evade legal conviction?</p>

<p>I mean if we posted about arkansas blood scandal and one of us here even ressurrected the damn movie, and they saw it and there weren&#39;t immediate arrests or assassinations or something to come of it, well then the short answer is no: there are no good guys around.  </p>

<p>What’s just a means to an end?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem with that is, whose Constitution gets secretly defended?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Cramer, currently it’s a nefarious constitution that’s getting secretly defended and has been pushed forward in this country.  He said that president Dwight D. Eisenhower created a secret military branch (A) to combat the group pushing forward this nefarious constitution (Group B).  Group A was composed of people who swore an oath to the constitution and who are vehemently opposed to Group B’s secrecy and subversion of the constitution itself.  Of course one can say that Group A can’t be trusted either, but considering that Eisenhower composed A of elite Marines that were at least <em>in theory</em> VERY constitutionally-bound and loyal, I would imagine that this group is about as trustworthy and constitution bound as you can get, and they’re at least more trustworthy than Group B.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  It’s been Group B’s constitution that’s been secretly and not so secretly defended for quite a while.  Captain Cramer says that he actually has legal and constitutional authority under the bill that Eisenhower signed into law to disclose the ET information he’s disclosing because he’s part of a secret cadre of elite individuals who swore and oath to the constitution of the U.S., and that constitution (because of the actions of Group B) has been almost entirely subverted and undermined.</p>
