<blockquote>
<p>nah, it&#39;s just a media operation. look at this thread - everybody knows it was &#39;mirror mirror on the wall&#39;, not &#39;magic mirror on the wall&#39;.</p>

<p>it&#39;s pretty simple: release it to theaters as &#39;mirror mirror&#39;. burn it into the public consciousness. nobody had video recorders until the late &#39;80s, so there won&#39;t be a permanent record that&#39;s not controlled by the media company (disney, in this case). then when you finally release to home (for the first time in 1994) just edit the audio to &#39;magic mirror&#39;. mindfuck ensues. and a buncha folks now question their own memory. very handy for controlling the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experienced my first Mandela Effect in the mid-00s, which was years before the term &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; even existed. I experienced several more between that time period and the summer of 2015 (a period of nearly ten years), which is when I first encountered the term.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;ve experienced reality glitches, synchronicities, and other strange phenomenon throughout my entire life. And it&#39;s for this reason that I don&#39;t believe the Mandela Effect is a psy-op. &quot;Psy-op&quot; simply doesn&#39;t explain all of the other weird things I&#39;ve experienced in my life. &quot;Psy-op&quot; doesn&#39;t explain why I was experiencing Mandela Effects years before there was even a term for it.</p>

<p>Because nobody asked for specifics until now. Your original question was &quot;Any thoughts?&quot; <em>not</em> &quot;Can you give specific examples?&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at your comment history, you seem interested in the one regarding Nelson&#39;s Mandela death. Well, I can&#39;t comment on that one because I remember his death in 2013. The only high-profile death Mandela Effect that I&#39;ve experienced is Billy Graham&#39;s funeral.</p>

<p>Remember the recent deaths of Prince and David Bowie? Well, Billy Graham&#39;s death was like that. It was unavoidable--non-stop media tributes, the election candidates weighed in, Bill Clinton attended the funeral, the funeral was on every single TV network, etc. It was impossible to avoid the Billy Graham death coverage, and believe me, I tried at the time because I hated the guy.</p>

<p>I remember Billy Graham dying in 2000. I genuinely thought he was dead until I read in 2015 that he was still alive. I hadn&#39;t heard a peep about him either in the media or in real life in the 15 years that he was supposed to be dead.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not thinking of Ruth Graham&#39;s 2007 death. Why the hell would Bill Clinton show up to her funeral as the current President? Why would every single TV network televise her funeral?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I <em>do</em> vividly remember his funeral. And so do many other people right down to details like Bill Clinton showing up to the funeral and it being televised on all of the TV networks. Why do a bunch of internet strangers from across the world have the same exact memory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the kind response. Sadly, these angry trolls are common in Mandela Effect discussions. A lot of people feel threatened by the idea that reality, or at least your perception of reality, can change in unexpected ways, so they respond with attacks.

    <div class="md"><p>In order for these &quot;memories&quot; to be the least bit genuine, you would have to run into people who also remember a much more violent collapse of the apartheid South African regime, a more violent end to the Cold War, and a more turbulent pre-9/11 1990s.</p>

<p>Many of these people would likely be coming from a reality where 9/11 never even happened.</p>

<p>Consider this much as well; why are Mandela and the Reverend Billy Graham the only world figures who these ME people claim to remember dying?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t there people who remember alternate events that would be equally significant; like the outcome of a presidential election or the breakup of the Soviet bloc? </p>

<p>Dude, have you even looked into the theory? Methinks you haven&#39;t. You should also look into Quantum entanglement. People like you make me laugh. They talk shit about certain things, yet they&#39;ve never actually look into them, themselves. Only get info from what others tell them. Look into it.. Not snopes, but actually look into it.

<p>People have, and the consensus is that it was BerenStein bears, not BerenStain bears. It just gets downvoted to hell. Curious..... I speak German, BTW. Stein is different than Stain. Shteen !== Stain. That would be Shtine and Stain doesn&#39;t even make sense, in German....</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that kinda the point? If the effect is real then things have changed…there would be no way to &quot;prove&quot; anything. Kinda makes it the perfect psyop…you are, after all, just testing people&#39;s memories and we all know how incredibly fallible memories are.</p>

<p>I remember Billy Graham dying in 2000. I genuinely thought he was dead until I read in 2015 that he was still alive. I hadn&#39;t heard a peep about him either in the media or in real life in the 15 years that he was supposed to be dead.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not thinking of Ruth Graham&#39;s 2007 death. Why the hell would Bill Clinton show up to her funeral as the current President? Why would every single TV network televise her funeral?</p>

<p>Surely an event on par with Prince and David Bowie would be something one would vividly remember.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> vividly remember his funeral. And so do many other people right down to details like Bill Clinton showing up to the funeral and it being televised on all of the TV networks. Why do a bunch of internet strangers from across the world have the same exact memory?</p>
