       I think this might have something to do with trying to fuck with people's heads ahead of the election.

       </p>
       <p>
        it's pretty simple: release it to theaters as 'mirror mirror'. burn it into the public consciousness. nobody had video recorders until the late '80s, so there won't be a permanent record that's not controlled by the media company (disney, in this case). then when you finally release to home (for the first time in 1994) just edit the audio to 'magic mirror'. mindfuck ensues. and a buncha folks now question their own memory. very handy for controlling the population.

       I experienced my first Mandela Effect in the mid-00s, which was years before the term "Mandela Effect" even existed. I experienced several more between that time period and the summer of 2015 (a period of nearly ten years), which is when I first encountered the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I've experienced reality glitches, synchronicities, and other strange phenomenon throughout my entire life. And it's for this reason that I don't believe the Mandela Effect is a psy-op. "Psy-op" simply doesn't explain all of the other weird things I've experienced in my life. "Psy-op" doesn't explain why I was experiencing Mandela Effects years before there was even a term for it.

       Because nobody asked for specifics until now. Your original question was "Any thoughts?"

       Looking at your comment history, you seem interested in the one regarding Nelson's Mandela death. Well, I can't comment on that one because I remember his death in 2013. The only high-profile death Mandela Effect that I've experienced is Billy Graham's funeral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the recent deaths of Prince and David Bowie? Well, Billy Graham's death was like that. It was unavoidable--non-stop media tributes, the election candidates weighed in, Bill Clinton attended the funeral, the funeral was on every single TV network, etc. It was impossible to avoid the Billy Graham death coverage, and believe me, I tried at the time because I hated the guy.

       Do you remember noticing Billy Graham alive and well a short time after you supposedly remember his funeral happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what year do you remember Graham dying in? 
Surely an event on par with Prince and David Bowie would be something one would vividly remember.

       I remember Billy Graham dying in 2000. I genuinely thought he was dead until I read in 2015 that he was still alive. I hadn't heard a peep about him either in the media or in real life in the 15 years that he was supposed to be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I'm not thinking of Ruth Graham's 2007 death. Why the hell would Bill Clinton show up to her funeral as the current President? Why would every single TV network televise her funeral?
      </p>

      <p>
       I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       vividly remember his funeral. And so do many other people right down to details like Bill Clinton showing up to the funeral and it being televised on all of the TV networks. Why do a bunch of internet strangers from across the world have the same exact memory?

       I did "put up". I gave you a detailed example. I linked to multiple reports of people who share the same memory.
       <em>

       are the one who refuses to accept it, and frankly, that's not my problem. I did my part.

       Amen brother. Whoever said you were redundantly mouthing off is a troll and is clearly a moron. He sounds like he feels entitled to an explanation from you. Like you came here to convince him or something. I believe you. I had a boss who said the same thing about that guy dying. I also exp these effects. I remember berenstein and 4 people in jfks motorcade and I sure as hell remember them saying "of the world" at the end of "we are the champions" by queen. Its not there anymore. I also remember a book called the hungry hungry caterpillar. Now its the very hungry caterpillar. This is just to name a few but I dont think this can be blamed on "faulty memory" like all these bozos seem to think

       Thank you for the kind response. Sadly, these angry trolls are common in Mandela Effect discussions. A lot of people feel threatened by the idea that reality, or at least your perception of reality, can change in unexpected ways, so they respond with attacks. It's like a bizarre "Flight or Fight" response that I'm not even sure they have conscious control over.

       In order for these "memories" to be the least bit genuine, you would have to run into people who also remember a much more violent collapse of the apartheid South African regime, a more violent end to the Cold War, and a more turbulent pre-9/11 1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these people would likely be coming from a reality where 9/11 never even happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this much as well; why are Mandela and the Reverend Billy Graham the only world figures who these ME people claim to remember dying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't there people who remember alternate events that would be equally significant; like the outcome of a presidential election or the breakup of the Soviet bloc?

       Anyone who remembered Mandela dying in the 1980s would be living a completely different life today from the rest of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collapse of the apartheid regime in South Africa, for example, would have been much more violent than it was with Mandela's survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more violent South African revolution would have then created numerous butterflies that would make reality in an alternate 2016 completely unrecognizable to the rest of us.

      <p>
       Maybe 9/11 wouldn't have happened?

       Dude, have you even looked into the theory? Methinks you haven't. You should also look into Quantum entanglement. People like you make me laugh. They talk shit about certain things, yet they've never actually look into them, themselves. Only get info from what others tell them. Look into it.. Not snopes, but actually look into it. If you want to post here, you need to do a little more work than what you tell your friends in the local starbucks....lmao.

       You sound like you don't know history. If you did, then you would realize that such an earth shattering event as Mandela's death in the 1980s would have resulted in a completely different world from the one that we live in today.

       People have, and the consensus is that it was BerenStein bears, not BerenStain bears. It just gets downvoted to hell. Curious..... I speak German, BTW. Stein is different than Stain. Shteen !== Stain. That would be Shtine and Stain doesn't even make sense, in German....

       Any of these people who claim that Mandela died in the 1980s would also be claiming that they remember things a lot more wild than that happening in their lifetime!
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned in another thread; would the Soviet Union still exist to these people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did 9/11 happen in their universe? Is Saddam Hussein still in power whenever they follow world news?
      </p>
      <p>
       Were the Star Wars prequels never made? 
Was Lord Of The Rings ever turned into a feature length movie trilogy?
      </p>
      <p>
       The historical butterflies that an early Mandela death would have created would have been way too found for "Mandela Effect" believers to ignore.

       FYI, I've been looking over the thread on and off for the better part of the last week and a half.

       There's no denying that there are a lot of weird and unexplainable phenomena happening in the world around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just find it impossible to believe that these people who claim they remember Mandela dying in the 80s also aren't going on to say "..... and then South Africa burned to the ground after news of Mandela's death at Robben Island spread around."
      </p>

       There would be a lot more historical butterflies to account for if they really did come from an alternate timeline from our own.

       How many times do I have to say this: YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO THE DAMN THEORY? It's not about what you are talking about. It's parallel dimensions. It doesn't mean if x didn't happen y would exist. That is not the point. Jesus Christ. At least look into what the fuck you are talking about..... Don't be daft.. You clearly are, for one reason or another....

       Isn't that kinda the point? If the effect is real then things have changed…there would be no way to "prove" anything. Kinda makes it the perfect psyop…you are, after all, just testing people's memories and we all know how incredibly fallible memories are.

       Frankly I would write off the entire theory were it not for the fact that I have a distinct memory of Jaws love interest, Dolly, in Moonraker wearing braces. But again, my memory could be faulty.

        Do you remember noticing Billy Graham alive and well a short time after you supposedly remember his funeral happening?

      <p>
       I remember Billy Graham dying in 2000. I genuinely thought he was dead until I read in 2015 that he was still alive. I hadn't heard a peep about him either in the media or in real life in the 15 years that he was supposed to be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I'm not thinking of Ruth Graham's 2007 death. Why the hell would Bill Clinton show up to her funeral as the current President? Why would every single TV network televise her funeral?

       I
       <em>

       vividly remember his funeral. And so do many other people right down to details like Bill Clinton showing up to the funeral and it being televised on all of the TV networks. Why do a bunch of internet strangers from across the world have the same exact memory?
