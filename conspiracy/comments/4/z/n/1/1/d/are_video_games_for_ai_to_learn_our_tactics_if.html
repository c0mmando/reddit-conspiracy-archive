       People behave differently in games than in actual combat tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, you'd be a lot more careless in a game, given you're not actually getting hurt and if you make a mistake you can just start again.

       I know plenty of people that play video games and are what society considers 'alphas'. A large portion of military members and vets are big into CoD and other war games. Go ahead and try to call a combat vet a beta to their face.

       I have and will continue to. They are cowards. They are not Alphas. After the first punch thrown, and a jab to the stomach, we get a beer and usually become friends. Alphas are not what you think they are. They are leaders, not reactionaries....

       Really RobertELee, Why? I don't get it, does it make you feel good? Do you get a kick out of it? Is that how you think and live? Is it something that you can't help but do? Help me understand to help you comprehend that that is the reason of your demise. Can't you see? It's killing you and your country, your people, your race. No room in bunker for you when you come running to Mexico, maybe.

       Well, again, considering I have no way to verify what you say, I'll keep my opinions to myself.  I'm not a huge fan of talking out of my ass.

      <p>
       Also, do you think you should lump all combat vets into that category?  You do realize that many of them had no idea what they were signing up for, being flooded by propaganda their whole lives or they don't have any useful skills so just go military where they're assigned a combat MOS.  Also, many combat vets know exactly why they were told to do what they did, but not until after the fact.  Don't forget, after 9/11, people were crying for war.  Begging for it.  It wasn't until a couple years into the war that people saw it for what it was-- a power and oil grab.

       See, this is me. Personal responsibility. I have no emotions for vets who were brainwashed, nor do I have any for the general population. I can talk more about myself, and experiences. But, I wont. I made my bed, now I deal with it. Ignorance is no excuse. Do I have compassion? Yes, I do. Which is why I talk to my fellow brother and sisters. Personal responsibility and what you've done with that, is most important. Modern soldiers are pussies, along with cops. Take a firefighter for example, he is actually trying to selflessly trying to help people... The others are doing it for the wrong reasons. Will I call a vet a coward to his face? Yes. I've done it. Mainly why I don't talk to my father any more...

       Think about it, they need A.I. to quickly learn, they have youtube videos teaching it, why not games. It would be a great way to make it learn stuff faster. To learn about scenarios and things like that.

       or something similar
      </p>
      <p>
       sorry i'm not biting, why? some people don't react in games like they do irl, and then you have to look at the programming aspect, wouldn't it be seen in open-source games or open-source engines
      </p>
      <p>
       hell..some developers and publishers flop just making the game do what they said it'd do, if not go on over to NoMan'sSky sub-reddit and see the fight between loyal fanbois and people demanding for what the game falsely advertised
      </p>
      <p>
       it just looks like a clusterfuck of a mess from a programming perspective, like where would you feed the MASSIVE INFO into? a MASSIVE hidden database for all game makers? so should i have gotten an email in the past for the small games i've coded and put out there? to join some creepy club...
      </p>
      <p>
       logistically this would just fall apart, you have too many hackers sniffing packets inbound and outbound to not notice this, hell they've found out about SmartPhones, SmartTVs, etc spying on you, i doubt this would be able to get away without any scrutiny for example if your bandwidth was just acting shit overnight you'd want to know why
      </p>
      <p>
       sadly the games are there for a reason though, to keep us all happy and wrapped up in our little virtual worlds, it pushes us to virtual life, so that we'll be ok with them making virtual numbers on a screen our money and not some physical in your wallet bill, so then you're more easily influenced, controlled, and kept complacent

       Yeah, no, not for me at least. As a human, all I do when faced with a difficult enemy is: find the flaw in the AI: Exploit. No opposition in reality is going to just give up looking for you after a short time, or routinely pop their heads out of cover, or do any of the same predictable things. I've talked to my gaming friends about this often, about how every new COD, FEAR, Battlefield, whatever is going to have a NEW SOPHISTICATED AI that will really learn and think and blah blah blah. Find the flaw, exploit, win. Not something I could use in real life.

       Technically we are A.I. ourselves so no matter what we do we are destined to fight each other, forever, that sucks. I think everything we do we can use in real life. Video games are a tool, a cool tool.

       I get it and all, but moving to areas that aren't quite intended to be reached (jumping on the hard to reach ledges, or moves that require, to a greater extent, human timing and judgement) that I know the AI can't understand how to reach, is something I regularly do when highly outmatched like in Fallout, or running in circles avoiding armored enemies, just isn't something one could attempt in reality and come out successfully. Same goes for stealth tactics in games.
