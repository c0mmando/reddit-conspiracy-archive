        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I watched the movie The Good Shepherd, and it portrayed Skull and Bones as a Yale society made up of upper class Catholics, and they even had a Catholic Priest or Bishop lead prayer at the Skull and Bones dinner gatherings at their retreat.</p>

<p>Then they portrayed the CIA being founded when an older, unspecified man, who they mentioned was Catholic, recruited Matt Damon&#39;s character, a Skull and Bones member and a Catholic, and another character who I also believe was Catholic, to be part of the CIA, or maybe it was the OSS at that time. Matt Damon&#39;s second in command character, played by John Turtorro, also mentions he went to Saint Ignatius school, Ignatius being the founder of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Then by the end of the film, the older man who had been in charge and recruited them died, and Matt Damon&#39;s (Catholic) character was given his own wing in the CIA, while the other guy (also Catholic I believe) was put in charge entirely.</p>

<p>Is this an accurate portrayal that the CIA was started by a Catholic and then handed down to two Catholics, who were recruited out of Skull and Bones which was also presented as largely Catholic? Or is this inaccurate? I believe it was based on a book so if it is accurate, I am curious how this fits with the idea that elite Jews are in charge of the conspiracy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Greed&quot; is universal. You are sometimes greedy. I&#39;m sometimes greedy. Everyone is sometimes greedy - not just the elites, but even the poor.</p>

<p>So, complaining that the &quot;elite&quot; is &quot;greedy&quot; - therefore, you can ignore race, religion, creed, ethnicity - and everything else that makes us human - is just sloppy, feel-good, wishful thinking on your part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you keep trying to identify the &quot;group&quot; they belong too</p>

<p>You keep trying to identify the &quot;group&quot; they belong too - but you want to muddy the waters, by trying to obscure the reality, and simply point to them as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;immoral.&quot;</p>

<p>And, of course, posture as more &quot;moral&quot; than the nefarious &quot;elites.&quot;</p>

<p>But of course, these elites think that YOU are greedy. Why do you care that they are so rich - what, are you greedy?</p>

<p>Except you&#39;re wrong. &quot;They&quot; are not &quot;one group&quot; with &quot;one cause.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither.</p>

<p>The CIA was started by WASPs and they immediately recruited a lot of Jews and a few Catholics. Skull &amp; Bones is a WASP institution.</p>

<p>The OSS, the forerunner to the CIA, was started by an FDR employee who was a double agent for the British.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Skull and Bones as a Yale society made up of upper class Catholics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you even WATCH the movie? One of the best scenes was about how the WASPy CIA didn&#39;t really accept Catholics.</p>

<p>No wonder this sub is so confused about so many things - the Black Pope is run by the Freemasons and the Jewish Illuminati lizard people.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl_9ayxs69A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl_9ayxs69A</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s another scene where the Congressmen specifically mentions how they are recruiting &quot;only a few Catholics, and that&#39;s because I&#39;m a Catholic.&quot; It&#39;s a major theme in the movie.</p>

<p>WASP stands for &quot;White Anglo-Saxon Protestant&quot; - what used to be called an &quot;American.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it was mostly WASPS? Interesting. But that scene you linked doesn&#39;t mention Catholic. Pesci says he is an Italian. He does say &quot;we have our Church,&quot; but that can just mean Italians have Catholicism. So he could be saying &quot;What do you <em>American</em> (Catholics or whoever) have?&quot;</p>

<p>Certainly when the congressman setting the whole thing up was Catholic, doesn&#39;t that mean the guy at the top of it was Catholic? Was Damon&#39;s character Catholic or Protestant? What&#39;s the name of his character anyway?</p>

<p>And what about the guy who ends up being the head of the whole thing at the end? I think that&#39;s the guy whose sister Damon&#39;s character married. I think it&#39;s also the same guy that pissed on Damon&#39;s character, but some of them looked similar. Was that character Allen Dulles? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just don&#39;t get the references. When Pesci says &quot;Italians&quot; and &quot;Irish&quot; - he is referring to the Irish and Italian immigrant Catholics, the so-called &quot;northern ethnics.&quot;</p>

<p>When Pesci says &quot;you people&quot; to the CIA agent, he meant &quot;WASP.&quot;</p>

<p>The scenes of the CIA agent at Yale university were nothing but one WASP reference after another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t know anything about &quot;northern ethnics&quot; or any of the pre-1960s stuff. I was born early 1990s so I am just trying my best to figure these things out, most of which happened long before I was born. At least when you live through things you get to see the mainstream media coverage and then you can extrapolate &quot;well they said this and this, and they&#39;re full of shit, so it&#39;s probably like this.&quot; But not having lived through most of it, I really have no idea. The first I ever heard of the &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; was watching that movie lol. I mean I&#39;d heard the term a few times but never knew it had to do with Cuba or what it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you getting upvoted for attacking me by saying I&#39;m lying. This is my opinion.  And you have yours.  You also aren&#39;t getting that I&#39;m partly agreeing with you.  Freemasons are the WASPs</p>

<p>People are upvoting you because they don&#39;t really understand these things either, it&#39;s just that they upvote people who adhom better.  So you&#39;ll always win.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in winning, I&#39;m interested in explaining my point of view, which I believe to be correct, based on research.</p>
