       I watched the movie The Good Shepherd, and it portrayed Skull and Bones as a Yale society made up of upper class Catholics, and they even had a Catholic Priest or Bishop lead prayer at the Skull and Bones dinner gatherings at their retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they portrayed the CIA being founded when an older, unspecified man, who they mentioned was Catholic, recruited Matt Damon's character, a Skull and Bones member and a Catholic, and another character who I also believe was Catholic, to be part of the CIA, or maybe it was the OSS at that time. Matt Damon's second in command character, played by John Turtorro, also mentions he went to Saint Ignatius school, Ignatius being the founder of the Jesuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then by the end of the film, the older man who had been in charge and recruited them died, and Matt Damon's (Catholic) character was given his own wing in the CIA, while the other guy (also Catholic I believe) was put in charge entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this an accurate portrayal that the CIA was started by a Catholic and then handed down to two Catholics, who were recruited out of Skull and Bones which was also presented as largely Catholic? Or is this inaccurate? I believe it was based on a book so if it is accurate, I am curious how this fits with the idea that elite Jews are in charge of the conspiracy?

       Thanks for the link. Is the Corbett Report good alt media or potential disinfo? I'll try to watch it tomorrow. For now the short version: was he Catholic, Jewish, or what? Was he in charge of himself and his creation, the CIA, or did others control him?

       I apologize for the topic move, but when I read  your, all roads lead to Rome, I remembered the other charge; all roads lead to Jewish bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all roads lead to greed for power as made available via great wealth and there is no religious barrier or litmus  test for greed.

       It's lazy nonsense like this that prevents people from understanding the problem. It takes work to understand distinctions, so just lump everyone together into some giant "them."

       they are lumped together as one giant them. Its not Jews or Catholics or Freemasons or Bonesman or any one single group, its greed and greed doesnt care about your race or religion. Trump's daughter changed her religion to marry a rothschild. You're assumption that its one or the other is moronic.

       lol. i highly doubt im ineffective. At the top, the only thing that matters is how you can perpetuate the cause. The problem is while you keep trying to identify the "group" they belong too, they keep on trucking, because they are an amalgam of groups all charged with 1 cause.

       "Greed" is universal. You are sometimes greedy. I'm sometimes greedy. Everyone is sometimes greedy - not just the elites, but even the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, complaining that the "elite" is "greedy" - therefore, you can ignore race, religion, creed, ethnicity - and everything else that makes us human - is just sloppy, feel-good, wishful thinking on your part.

      <p>
       You keep trying to identify the "group" they belong too - but you want to muddy the waters, by trying to obscure the reality, and simply point to them as "bad" or "immoral."
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, posture as more "moral" than the nefarious "elites."
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course, these elites think that YOU are greedy. Why do you care that they are so rich - what, are you greedy?

       I agree that Greed is universal and that everyone is sometimes greedy. I dont believe that Elites are greedy, but a portion of them are and they work and spend time amassing more power. Do you think if a WASP sees a European Jesuit or African Tribalist or even a backwoods American Southerner can help them that they will avoid them because they are separatist? C'mon, you can't be that dense.

       Neither.

       The CIA was started by WASPs and they immediately recruited a lot of Jews and a few Catholics. Skull &amp; Bones is a WASP institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OSS, the forerunner to the CIA, was started by an FDR employee who was a double agent for the British.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Skull and Bones as a Yale society made up of upper class Catholics
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Did you even WATCH the movie? One of the best scenes was about how the WASPy CIA didn't really accept Catholics.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder this sub is so confused about so many things - the Black Pope is run by the Freemasons and the Jewish Illuminati lizard people.

       The most famous scene in the movie, with Joe Pesci of course.
      </p>

      <p>
       There's another scene where the Congressmen specifically mentions how they are recruiting "only a few Catholics, and that's because I'm a Catholic." It's a major theme in the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       WASP stands for "White Anglo-Saxon Protestant" - what used to be called an "American."

       So it was mostly WASPS? Interesting. But that scene you linked doesn't mention Catholic. Pesci says he is an Italian. He does say "we have our Church," but that can just mean Italians have Catholicism. So he could be saying "What do you
       <em>
        American
       </em>
       (Catholics or whoever) have?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly when the congressman setting the whole thing up was Catholic, doesn't that mean the guy at the top of it was Catholic? Was Damon's character Catholic or Protestant? What's the name of his character anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about the guy who ends up being the head of the whole thing at the end? I think that's the guy whose sister Damon's character married. I think it's also the same guy that pissed on Damon's character, but some of them looked similar. Was that character Allen Dulles?

      <p>
       I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just don't get the references. When Pesci says "Italians" and "Irish" - he is referring to the Irish and Italian immigrant Catholics, the so-called "northern ethnics."
      </p>
      <p>
       When Pesci says "you people" to the CIA agent, he meant "WASP."
      </p>
      <p>
       The scenes of the CIA agent at Yale university were nothing but one WASP reference after another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you just have to be aware of pre-1960s American culture to understand the references.

       Yeah I don't know anything about "northern ethnics" or any of the pre-1960s stuff. I was born early 1990s so I am just trying my best to figure these things out, most of which happened long before I was born. At least when you live through things you get to see the mainstream media coverage and then you can extrapolate "well they said this and this, and they're full of shit, so it's probably like this." But not having lived through most of it, I really have no idea. The first I ever heard of the "Bay of Pigs" was watching that movie lol. I mean I'd heard the term a few times but never knew it had to do with Cuba or what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I am playing major catch-up here. All the help is appreciated.

       If you are so full of knowledge then drop something believable otherwise you are conjecturing.  It turns out--yes--the jesuits are part of this thing and so are the freemasons. And as of pope francis--both a jesuit AND a freemason--has retracted the 'no catholics' rule to become a member of freemasonry as one of the first things he did, undoing

       You can come back and say something but I'm already done here so I recommend you don't waste your breath.  I know where you're coming from and it's this 'big jewish conspiracy' thing.  There is evidence for that as well.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that picture is very incomplete.

       Why are you getting upvoted for attacking me by saying I'm lying. This is my opinion.  And you have yours.  You also aren't getting that I'm partly agreeing with you.  Freemasons are the WASPs

       People are upvoting you because they don't really understand these things either, it's just that they upvote people who adhom better.  So you'll always win.
