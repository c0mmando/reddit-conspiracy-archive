<p>They both suck.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a story about North Korea and the media there only publishing propaganda. Kim Jung is 6ft tall, N Korea won gold medals, all kinds of bullshit. The people there believe it because that is what they are told.</p>

<p>How are we any different?  The media will spin and concoct false narratives and the public eats it up. How many mass shootings have we seen as they are happening and they talk about multiple gunmen?  Then suddenly it&#39;s the lone nut and all is forgotten. If you mention the multiple gunmen people look at you like you are crazy. </p>

<p>Who knows who is in the lead in the polls. I kind of think this whole thing is already decided unless it is a landslide they will steal it. </p>

<p>I live on Texas, they are now saying may go blue.  I know maybe a handful of people who will vote Hillary. The majority think she is a vile human being who they could never vote for. The only way Texas goes blue is fraud </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is on her side.  It&#39;s so painfully obvious, I&#39;m surprised more people don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>We know Hillary would rig the election to beat Bernie, why don&#39;t people see that the best rig ever is to win by controlling both sides?   I just can&#39;t believe anyone who thinks Trump has any real care for the little guy.</p>

<p>Do you know how many people he has sued or buried to get to where he is?  He sues people who also have the last name Trump (no relation) and want to start a business using their OWN LAST NAME.</p>

<p>He has colluded with fat cat Christie to take MILLIONS of dollars from NJ tax payers.  Again and again and again, he shows his true colors - GIVE ME MORE MONEY AND FAME.</p>

<p>What&#39;s a good way to do that?  Well, to get paid by someone to break up the republicans and to make himself even more famous.  You just wait and see.  Trump will lose or concede and by the time that happens, it&#39;ll be too late for anyone to face Hillary.</p>

<p>Then comes the books, the tv shows, maybe a movie, all of it to make more Trump money.</p>

<p>If you think he&#39;s above any of that, you haven&#39;t been paying attention at all during your lifetime.</p>

I have way more to lose than to gain by opposing the system.  Just like me, most people are waiting for... something.  Maybe a strong force to step forward, but most will just stay back and watch.  It&#39;s safer.  That&#39;s how we got to this place anyway.</p>

<p>This is how it ends...  Not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with total complacency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the opposite - why would Trump slam her so hard at every opportunity, calling out all types of corruption and lies, if he was &#39;on her side&#39;?  If he was on her side, he&#39;d play the game closer to the &#39;standard&#39; fashion, kinda like Bernie - say a few things, but ultimately use kiddie gloves.</p>

<p>Also, why bring in Trump?  A clinton victory would be much smoother with someone like Cruz as the nominee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it doesn&#39;t need to look real to 80-90% of the population.  Look at the media, we know that&#39;s BS, but enough people buy it.</p>

<p>Trump is opening up so many cans of worms that the establishment has to ignore or respond to, he is doing more harm to them than if he were &#39;playing ball&#39;.  Trump is playing and slamming the media, a huge part of the establishment.  He is against war with Russia, which media and establishment are pushing towards.  He has helped many people become discreetly aware of the wide range of issues we have, whether he is genuine or not.</p>

<p>You&#39;re grasping at straws if you think Trump is working with Clinton.</p>

<p><strong>Controlled Opposition</strong> is when a deliberate attempt is made to either create an opposing effort to any existing power base, or, to obtain control of any opposition to one&#39;s own efforts. Some protest movements are actually being led by government or corporate agents.</p>
