<p>New shit coming out every day about her pay-for-play behavior (weapons to Bahrain after a donation and meeting is the tip of the iceberg from today&#39;s morning roundup!), and <em>this</em> is why you think she can&#39;t be president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I disagree with you, but generally speaking the health of your soon to be president would truly matter in a democratic state. Since we are far from those ideals her health is being used as a media scapegoat to not talk about her corruption, and instead talk about something that everyone wants to discuss because if we were in a democracy and if we truly voted in the president and vice president then their health matters. But since we both know democracy is just a name under which tyranny occurs it is just being used as a distraction from the serious issues that face us today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It matters, but it&#39;s being used as a distraction from the bigger issues. The news talks about Clinton&#39;s health, Clinton comes out and debunks, and everyone goes, &quot;Oh, okay, everything&#39;s fine.&quot;</p>

<p>People need to start wondering why &quot;conservative&quot; media is spending so much on this disinformation that ultimately only serves Clinton vs. committing actual journalism related to actual crimes committed. Everyone&#39;s being trolled.</p>

<p>(Like, seriously - everyone&#39;s talking about a fucking pickle jar &quot;pop&quot; instead of Judicial Watch&#39;s damning email release yesterday. It&#39;s embarrassing.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s both clearly corrupt AND clearly ill. People are justified in being upset at her over both obvious problems, as either problem should be disqualifying and she should never have run in the first place with these issues hanging over her. It is appropriate to have topics like this one discussing her health alongside the other ones where we can discuss all the criminal corruption. Discouraging discussion of this topic in an appropriate dedicated thread isn&#39;t going to do anyone any good. It&#39;s not as if someone set up a topic to discuss corruption and someone else came in to try to change the topic to her illness! </p>

<p>If people were discussing how terrible the wars in the middle east are, would you go up to them and tell them to stop discussing that problem because there are starving children in Africa? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who gives a shit about &quot;conservative&quot; media? That has nothing to do with anything. The fucking thread is about JIMMY KIMMEL for pete&#39;s sake! If you wanna whine about conservative media, maybe you should start a separate topic about that. Instead, you&#39;re just attempting to dissuade people from discussing a topic which is legitimately worth discussing while in a thread that op dedicated specifically to that topic.

<p>The evidence of Clinton&#39;s crimes is voluminous, the stuff about her being frail is disinfo bullshit meant to help slide her into office.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to stop people&#39;s conversation, talk about what you want - but I&#39;m trying to let y&#39;all know that you guys and gals falling for Breitbart&#39;s psyop are actually <em>helping</em> Clinton.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brent Scowcroft</li>
</ul>

<p>Scowcroft was Vice Chairman (and co-founder) of Kissinger Associates, Inc. He has had a long association with Henry Kissinger, having served as his assistant when Kissinger was the National Security Adviser under Richard Nixon, from 1969.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is co-chair, along with Joseph Nye, of the Aspen Strategy Group. He is a member of the Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, a board member of The Center for Strategic and International Studies, and The Atlantic Council of the United States.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hank Paulson</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>He joined Goldman Sachs in 1974, working in the firm&#39;s Chicago office under James P. Gorter, covering large industrial companies in the Midwest.[10] He became a partner in 1982. From 1983 until 1988, Paulson led the Investment Banking group for the Midwest Region, and became managing partner of the Chicago office in 1988. From 1990 to November 1994, he was co-head of Investment Banking, then Chief Operating Officer from December 1994 to June 1998,[11] eventually succeeding Jon Corzine as chief executive. His compensation package, according to reports, was $37 million in 2005, and $16.4 million projected for 2006.[12] His net worth has been estimated at over $700 million.[12]</p>

<p>In September 19, 2008, Paulson called for the U.S. government to use hundreds of billions of Treasury dollars to help financial firms clean up nonperforming mortgages threatening the liquidity of those firms.[36] Because of his leadership and public appearances on this issue, the press labeled these measures the &quot;Paulson financial rescue plan&quot; or simply the Paulson Plan</p>

<p>The Goldman Sachs benefit from the AIG bailout was recently estimated as US$12.9 billion and GS was the largest recipient of the public funds from AIG.[41] Creating the collateralized debt obligations (CDO&#39;s) forming the basis of the current crisis was an active part of Goldman Sach&#39;s business during Paulson&#39;s tenure as CEO. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Meg Whitman</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Goldman Sachs, whose executives donated $100,000 to the Whitman campaign, manages a part of Whitman&#39;s fortune. As CEO of eBay, Whitman earned approximately $1.78 million resulting from a practice known as spinning whereby executives who did business with Goldman Sachs could reap profits by getting early deals before the public on hot IPOs offered by the bank. Whitman later resigned from the Goldman Sachs board after some expressed concern over her receiving shares from Goldman. In commenting on Whitman’s resignation from the Goldman board, eBay spokesman Henry Gomez told the Wall Street Journal at the time that, &quot;If we wanted to use Goldman&#39;s services, she doesn&#39;t want there to be even the slightest perception of any conflict. She&#39;s doing this because she thinks quite highly of the firm.&quot;[94] While Whitman was on Goldman’s board, she served on the compensation committee, which approved multimillion-dollar bonus packages for then-CEO Henry Paulson and his top aides. Public domain documents reveal that Whitman has a multimillion-dollar stake in 21 investment funds managed by Goldman.</p>
