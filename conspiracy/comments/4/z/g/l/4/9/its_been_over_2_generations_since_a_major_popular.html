        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As I come to think of it ... Apart from the Tea Party rallies in the US, which were mainly conducted by members of prior generations, not one single big societal or nation wide revolt springs to mind. Spain had some fairly big leftist circle jerk gatherings, Brazil had a larger one to get rid of an extremely corrupt president, Occupy was a joke ... A little racial tension here and there, but otherwise the system seems to have perfectioned a form of control mechanism that&#39;s more than enough to undermine and prematurely derail anything ... </p>

<p>All I see around me is utter demoralization, apathy, degeneracy, decay or a radical embrace of servitude to a system that has become progressively abusive on every account. </p>

<p>You literally can&#39;t even head out for trivial, every day stuff any more without being inmersed in despondency, breathe this heavy smog of passive aggression everywhere or having to bear the insults of the downright wilfull stupidity people engage in as a form of substitute behaviour. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m making a lot of sense. The middle class seems dead to me and common sense along with it. It&#39;s all about the ego and instant gratification at all costs. Everyone seems to think in terms of haves and have nots and is either ashamed of not being part of the 0.1% or trying to pass himself off for someone he&#39;s not in the most obnoxious and ridiculous ways. </p>

<p>This place doesn&#39;t feel like home anymore ... and 
I&#39;m not talking about the US or Canada either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are enslaved to the spectacle. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why the pyramid and Egyptian iconography is common in the west and featured on the USD. It&#39;s because the Egyptian royalty used large public works projects not only to demonstrate their power and wealth, but (little known to most people), used those monuments to waste valuable resources to keep the people from using those resources and manpower to gain independence. It is much the same today with all the senseless consumer attractions, wars, Olympics, and elections. The elite need to be able to control surplus labor and resources, otherwise they risk losing control over parts of society. </p>

<p>So when you see the Washington Monument, or the all-seeing eye on top of the pyramid on the dollar, it&#39;s a subtle inside joke of the powers that be, eluding to the spectacle and it&#39;s power over people, and it&#39;s ability to enslave them to the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How well informed was the American populace during the Revolutionary War? What percentage of the country actually took a stand? I&#39;ve seen numbers like 3-5%. </p>

<p>There are ALWAYS sheep. It ever was so. &quot;There is nothing new under the sun.&quot; </p>

<p>For every 9 Millennials who is timid, weak and unaware, I can bet there is at least one who has discovered things via the Internet that I was never aware of in my youth. </p>

<p>There is a human spirit, a quest for knowledge and enlightenment that has NEVER faded from some living souls on this planet in recorded time and probably before. </p>

<p>Now, whether this takes place in America, is another story. If you love America -- or at least the ideal of America -- as I do, there is real concern that the country may not be the leader in the Next Wave but instead the opposition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the biggest consideration that keeps rolling around my head. So much dependency on power for our everyday lives.  Think about all the systems that use electricity. How many Americans are prepared to deal without any electricity for more than a week? Elderly dependent on oxygen machines, refrigerators -food spoilage, most appliances are energy dependent, phones, computers, the entire modern communication grid for the masses; It would be absolutely catastrophic.  You&#39;d just have to hope to have enough fly swatters on hand to deal with the decomposition and spoilage.</p>

<p>It reminds me of Jim James song &quot;State of the Art&quot;, which talks about technology and asks if it has made us better human beings, and the song&#39;s clarity fades and crackles as he is singing about the power going out. </p>

<p>Occupy, Tea Party, etc. are inklings of what&#39;s to come, I suspect. Of course, they were infiltrated quickly and destroyed from within. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there were people who said the British Empire could never be broken away from, either. </p>

<p>Previously i would have agreed with you, but today technology allows for such a top-run structure too easily. With total surveillance they can disappear the right people before any uprising even really gets going. Just look at how hillary&#39;s opponents keep dropping dead.</p>

<p>You are using the most imprecise terms possible, so of course anything that could fit you can safely exclude as not an uprising, not the west, not major, not popular or not within 2 generations.</p>

<p>Brexit would be an uprising you are looking for but easy to change what you mean exactly to exclude it, just like any other example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You use Brasil as your example, Not Egypt?  Civil Rights was not an uprising? Riots in 60&#39;s were uprisings but Brasil had uprisings recently?  Brasil&#39;s impeachment of Dilma was not an uprising of any sort, it was a political coup done by powerful corrupt politicians with the backing of their sole major news network.. Brasil was not an uprising, their were protests over bus fares and mega events but the street protest against Dilma were mostly after the impeachment was in motion by political elites, 65% of which were part of the &quot; Car wash&quot; investigation.  The protest over bus fares in 2013 and the impeachment of Dilma in 2016 are vastly different animals.</p>

<p>Uprising are grassroots level, not conducted my politicians</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit a high paying tech job and moved out to a rural area. Its been fascinating to watch society from this perspective. When I first moved here it was winter, as summer came the population exploded with tourism. I&#39;ve gone back into the city recently for work and it is like a mad house, crazier than I have ever seen a place and I&#39;ve lived all over the country. This is one of the &quot;economically prosperous&quot; cities in the US. There is definitely something coming to a head real soon in the US at least.</p>

<p>If anyone is fed up with it I recommend moving to a rural area. There are still places out there that haven&#39;t gone crazy. In fact the large city I live near now, not the &quot;economically prosperous&quot; one that is further away, people say its like the 70s in the US used to be and I get it. There are no computers anywhere, people are still out walking around hanging out, live music, blue collar jobs, etc. Oh and there is good work out in these places if you have a skill, you just have to look hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely see what OP is talking about. There is a sense of paralysis that is pervasive. It&#39;s so subtle and vague as to evade discussion or even acknowledgement in most people. But it is everywhere. Reminds me of that line from the poem The Second Coming:
&quot;The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.&quot; -WB Yeats</p>

<p>But there is a part of me, perhaps an irrationally optimistic, wishful thinking part of me, that wonders if all really is as lost as it seems to be. Specifically, I feel like within the elite power structure, there must be an awareness of how bad everything has gotten. And that wishful thinking side of me just finds it a little hard to believe that ALL of the top echelon of society are okay with it. Is it possible that, in very hushed tones behind closed doors, in physical space and not cyberspace, some of these deep insiders are discussing how to truly get our system back to some semblance of justice, morality, equality, etc., and to wrest it from the cold, bony hands of these reptilians (I use that word figuratively) who seem to be running the show unopposed? What do you guys think about the possibility that we have powerful people legitimately fighting for us from the inside of this rotten empire?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible but I&#39;d imagine the system is such that any time someone in power starts to display some sign of humanity or conscience, they are probably immediately marginalized or removed, or simply ignored. </p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s room at the top they are telling you still, but first you must learn to smile as you kill.&quot;</p>

<p>So there&#39;s probably those people in government, but in order to keep whatever influence they might have they are forced to keep silent and/or go along with the prevailing evil/corruption in certain conspicuous ways, lest they be revealed as not being on board with the &quot;plan.&quot;  Sanders&#39; Clinton endorsement is probably a good example of that.</p>

<p>There must be some that recognize that if justice, morality, and equality are not preserved then they themselves will be subject to injustices by those more powerful.  Even with all of their riches, they are not all powerful.  A just society is the best way for many of them to preserve what they have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Occupy movement also kind of imploded from some of its own problems. I&#39;m not saying there wasn&#39;t outside resistance and even sabotage, because there definitely was, but I think that major protest movements nowadays are lacking some of the focus, organization and clarity of purpose that past movements had. This has a lot to do with the general climate of ignorance, stratification, distraction, etc. which is bred by the powers that be and their little minions in the mainstream media. People are pissed, and rightfully so. They can sense that everything is fucked up, and that there are people who are deliberately hurting and setting back our society for their own personal gain, but they have a hard time uniting and articulating (or maybe agreeing on) specifically what the problems are, and what specific steps should be taken to address them. Some of the protesters, when interviewed, were unable to form a clear statement of purpose. Again, I don&#39;t discount or downplay the role that the fucking crooked, dishonest, manipulative mainstream media played in playing up this perception, but I do think there was some reality to the perception as well.</p>
