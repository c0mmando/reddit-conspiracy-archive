       The Fresno County Sheriff has officially ruled Police Accountability activist, John Lang's death a suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       He set his own house on fire, then stabbed himself in the abdomen and back and then waited to die... This is the narrative they would have you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's make his story undeniably famous.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT4:  I called and reached out to the Fresno County Coroner's office for a statement.  They informed me that the Head Coroner in charge of Lang's case is on vacation for 2 weeks.  They then pointed me towards the Fresno County Sheriff Public Information Officer saying he'd be able to provide more information to the public.  I reached out to him and left a message.  I would encourage as many of you to call and leave him a message asking for him to make a public statement to the media... let him know that there is a huge interest in this case and we want answers.  His information is public knowledge via the Fresno Sheriff website so I see no issue posting his professional contact info here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tony Botti
Public Information Officer
(559) 600-8137
(559) 977-0379

        Tony.Botti@fresnosheriff.org
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Please keep it professional and respectful... we aren't looking to bully anyone but we want them to take an official stance and provide the public with a well documented narrative for their decision.  It takes 3mins... call him/email him.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT5: Local reporter that Lang reached out to, Corin Hoggard, now reporting that there were no stab wounds in the back and that it was misinformation from the beginning...

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT6:  Just got off the phone with Tony Botti.  Official stance is as follows:  3 superficial stab wounds to chest, nonfatal.  There never were wounds to the back... Cause of death: smoke inhalation and soot.  High levels of Carbon Monoxide found in his system.  Fresno PD to hold press conference today.

       Is this fucking real life? I mean the guy was obviously a little on the crazy side, but he provided
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCTMl9Ncxd-jhZ81s4z3XA6w">
        video proof
       </a>
       of the police surveilling his house multiple times. The manner in which he died was very gruesome and he was obviously murdered... And he predicted all of it. How the fuck did they rule his death a suicide? This makes me sick and this needs to be on the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 1: this guy Corin Hoggard's statement on social media sounds like a load of bullshit. He is claiming Lang was never stabbed in the back and that he watched the interview tape by a police officer as proof of this. It just doesn't make any sense.

       I absolutely agree... I'm hoping they make an official statement.  Saying it was a suicide is one thing, I want to hear how they logically justify it.

       If you want to make it look like you were murdered, stabbing yourself in the back is not a bad ploy, before you deliver the killing stab to your abdomen as the house is burning around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The questions that needs to be answered are, was he holding the knife? Did the knife have only his fingerprints on it? How far was the knife from his body? What was the angle of the stab wounds to the back, and is it possible they could have been self-inflicted?

       That doesn't make sense. You think he was playing the long game by killing himself and trying to frame the police with the upper back stab wounds?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not go kill the cops instead of yourself? Maybe he is just really passive aggressive?

       If you really want to put this on the front page you would need to spend some money doing it.
       <br/>
       Not that I recommend buying upvotes, I don't.
       <br/>
       If they want to play by those rules we can also play by theirs.
       <br/>
       How come it's "forbidden" to buy upvotes and yet companies worldwide buy the front page of reddit every day?
       <br/>
       Ah, don't fuck me...

       This system has been bought and sold a long time ago.

       Maybe someone should set up a website/link to a website that tracks all the upvotes and downvotes from here and displays any discrepancy. If there is a discrepancy we have black on white evidence of reddit tampering with the site, if not we might want to see a doctor about possible paranoia.

       Sure they can do whatever they want, but I think it does matter that the large majority of users are unaware of it. If they knew they could put pressure on the site to change or at least make an informed decision about if they want to stick around. We might see an upheaval similar to the one that got Pao fired.

       Honestly it's been mentioned in askreddit threads a couple times so i think a lot of users know about it. And nah, you didn't come off as any of those things and it's actually a really neat idea, I think people just thought like "yeah we already know man" and downvoted you. you seemed pretty nice from your comment

       Was there any other discussion about how the Google Maps street view image of his house was taken during April 2015, the same time when the surveillance van was photographed across the street. I don't know how Google goes about photographing, but is that a possible explanation for the van?

       I trust the FBi helluva lot more than the CIA. But every alphabet agency and lawenforcement departments have the corrupt groups. There has to be honest people in the FBI. We could make a white house petition, even if it doesnt gain hundred of thousand of signs... It would attract local news stations and maybe that may make an impact.

       Seriously. This is so true. My uncle has been in the state pen for over 15 years, for clicking one FBI link.... They even searched his comp, he never did/looked at even of this before or even thought of it, until the FBI was pushing it into his face like how they turn non radical muslims into radicals to bust them.... So fucking corrupt, they ruined his life and many others who wouldnt even dare get involved in that sick shit. But one of the FBI people were messaging in somehow, and got him to click on the link and convinced him to do it, no bullshit. (Would never have even thought about it, but because he was on all sorts of drugs... The FBI fucked up his life and made him do something he didnt even want to do)

       a similar thing happened to a friend of mine.  he had an IRC server set up so people could upload and download movies.  well, the FBI uploaded a kiddie porn movie onto it, then came to his house and arrested him and took his computer.  it was proven in court that he never even opened the movie, much less watched it.  but because it was on his computer he went to jail for distributing kiddie porn.  never mind the fact that the FBI put it on his computer, he had it on his computer so he went to prision for 15 years and is still there now.  its complete bullshit.

       Yep that pretty much mirrors what happened to my Unc.... Its sickening, I bet the FBI gets off from it. Theres no way they can distribute without ever looking at it once, every time they send the link they see a little of it, theres no other way. And how the FBI got the vid, I dont even wanna know. But they are ruining innocent lives. They should be going after the people who make the vids, the ones who distribute them, the ones who are apart of the CP rings.... Not innocent people that they trick into doing something they didnt even wanna do. 
And honestly I dont know what all happened, I was 12-13 maybe 14 at the time. I didnt understand alot of it, I thought he got popped for drugs. I finally found out the truth from my Ma... But again, didnt give me alot of details. Just that his comp was clean, he never left the house, just sat in his rooms doing blow and playing dreamcast... He used to be a very hardworker, made the best damn pizza I have ever tasted. All I know is somehow a FBI man found him online or something along the sorts... and messaged him (Either Email or IrC.) Got to be "friends with him", and talked about this and that. Then the FBI man (or men) convinced him to look at CP... He wouldve never done it otherwise. He got 15+ years in the fed pen upstate.... Just for the FBI betraying him, and convincing him to click the link. As soon as he clicked it they tracked his IP and raided his house... He lived at my Gma, and took care of her because Gpa passed away from Lou Gherics disease, a horrible disease that I would not wish upon my worse enemy.... He was in a bad place, turned to harsher drugs from it... and the FBI exploited his situation.... And got him arrested for something he wouldve never done otherwise. I really want to bring attention to the media/citizens of America of how corrupt and devilish the FbI is.... 15 years?? In the fed pen?? For the FBI exploiting his depression?? Fuck them, I will never let go of this grudge they placed upon me.... I will make their corruption known, just not sure how yet...

       has been making efforts to re-establish the common law juries of, by, and for the People that we were always supposed to have, and which are required by law.  They train for free, online, and will have

       As John Lang's death is 'a bunch of empty conspiracy theory', and 'the Constitution is just a piece of paper'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nice thing about calling something nonsense is that it enables people to dismiss it without actually thinking or learning about it, perpetuating the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, they could
       <a href="http://nationallibertyalliance.org/civicscourse">
        learn the law
       </a>
       and find that it is the law as We'd built it - not what's currently in practice.  As Mr. Lang discovered firsthand.
      </p>

       The Supreme Court wrote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...at the Revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people; and they are truly the sovereigns of the country, but they are sovereigns without subjects...with none to govern but themselves; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citizens, and as joint tenants in the sovereignty.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Discouraging people from learning the law isn't exactly a viable position.

       I went to Fresno police departments Facebook page and spouted the message of his murder.mi saw a couple people doing the same. Their page was filled with female officers showing kids their cool police cars and trying to make themselves out as heroes. Social media is a powerful weapon, and it's purpose is to expose and protest. It is not effective if all people post on is about themselves and their petty problems or what food they ate that day. Protest and yell. We should be mad as hell, and we shouldn't take it any more god damn it.

       I live in Fresno. I'm not sure if anyone really knows about the circumstances of this further than being a house fire. I only discovered the back story browsing reddit. Fresno police were weak until the early 90's, then federal grant money poured in. When that was used up traffic tickets and dui conviction sky rocketed seeming to keep the budget filled. The police here are bullies.

       I imagine it will garner a more radioactive approach. No one on the "Blue" side of things wants to put their own livelihood on the line to expose anything. I assume because if they're wrong they'll be ostracized for doing "their job". So rather than finding out what happened they'd rather listen to what they are told and not go beyond the surface to look for any truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't get how anyone could come to this conclusion logically. I'm waiting for the article where they expose their "suspicion" that he was mentally unstable and did this to himself just to "spark outrage".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think on some level "they" want this to be public enough so that the dissenters that feel the need to act, now have a more realistic reality to look at. It ties into this other article I read about how people obviously act different when they are reminded everything they're doing digitally is being tracked and recorded an compiled. This to me is the same concept, show someone who publicly raised suspicions and felt persecuted for it. Culminating in his death is the ultimate cautionary tale to the rest of "us"(dissenters).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Please stick your neck out investigate, but understand there is nothing you can do to stop 'us' if we come for you"
      </p>
      <p>
       but I digress, this is a tragedy of unforeseen consequences in my opinion.

       follow ups from other activists into the murder show same behavior from local police that concerned John Lang.

       This is insane.  Top to bottom side to side - this is absolutely crazy.  Certainly enough evidence to prompt normal thinking people to call BS.  Sad that the people responsible for protecting us do not seem to be normal thinking people.

       Well they're led by Chief Jerry Dyer who is a known pedophile that raped a 16 year old. I've lived in Fresno my whole life and in general Fresno PD officers are pretty chill because they see crazy shit unlike neighboring city Clovis which sees far less crime. HOWEVER there are quite a few notorious Fresno PD officers that you do NOT want to come in contact with.

       I called the coroner's office and the person in charge of his case is "on vacation for 2 weeks."  However they did point me towards the Fresno County Sheriff PR officer.  I did reach out to him for a statement and I'm awaiting a returned call.

       Couple genuine questions, just reading this all for the first time, couple things jumped out at me that strike me as off and wondering if there is an explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       First why did he name his neighbor and a coworker as also being part of the people with the police that would kill him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also is there any proof other than him saying that the charges against him concerning child pornography are trumped up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Only reason I ask, is charges of child pornography are a big frickin' deal and people have committed suicide for way less. Also not very smart to plan out framing a suicide and then stab them in the back, but if you say knew you were going down for something as heinous as child pornography and decided to commit suicide would it be all that surprising to try to frame those people you have beef with and try to take them down too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk just an idea cause something about adding the guy from work and his neighbor just struck me as odd unless there is something else I missed that would explain why they were named?

       As far as the neighbor is concerned, he had suspicions that the neighbor may have been a police informant placed their by FPD to surveil him.  He later confirmed that the neighbor was a registered sex offender and believed that possibly part of lowering or working off his charges included becoming a police informant.

       So this happens a dozen times a decade, for the last few hundred years. When we have evidence, actual evidence of complete systematic corruption, it is withheld. Time to withhold your jobs, PD. Time to retrain veterans, give them jobs with benefits and a purpose. Sorry blue line sniffers, suck the long dick of karma

       Thanks for this update.  Interesting how much misinformation occurred and that it took almost 2 months for them to come out and make it right...

       Fuck censorship!  When I first read his story I was sick for days!  Now I can't even see it again to share information with friends!  Honestly what happened to him was what skyrockted my inquiries towards conspiracies.  I have always been interested and open minded but that was just straight up, evil shit and now unless you've seen his whole documentation already, you won't.  Fuck that!  His story deserves to be heard.

       Someone should find out the name of the medical examiner or coroner who decided a person who was stabbed in the upper back was a suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through all this ordeal now you have one definitley involved corrupt person as opposed to a vauge accusation against the whole Dept. The coroner is the key.

       I'm not sure what a "gnu" is, how this temporary concern contributes to my luck, or exactly what I ought to be grateful for.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is sort of my point though. This doesn't seem to  contribute to anything. This story popped up a couple months ago, and after a brief surge of curiosity, it died. 
No protests, little participation in any petitions, and no national coverage.
Now the official story is that after begging for help from anyone who would listen, Lang stabbed himself in the back and set his house on fire. 
What's next? Nothing.

       I live in Clovis. In my experience the local CHP are assholes. But the Kern County sherrif deputies are sketchy as fuck. Although they see plenty of gnarly shit. In my experience Fresno PD is not good. Clovis PD is bored. Fresno County Sherrif deputies are WAYYYY too gung ho. The mountain towns are sketchy. Oakhurst and Mariposa are fucking BAD police departments.

       He has 2 of the newest comments. Just thought I'd post this in case anyone is interested. The article Focuses on Fresno Police and the Beware software they use.

       Any updates on this story? Is it really just going to end as a suicide ruling? The guy was found stabbed multiple times in a house set on fire. The fact that this was ruled as a suicide is just insane.
