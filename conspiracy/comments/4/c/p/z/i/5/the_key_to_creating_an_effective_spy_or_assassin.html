        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>George Estabrooks was a Harvard University graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, chairman of the Department of Psychology at Colgate University and an authority on hypnosis during World War II. He is known for hypnoprogramming U.S. government agents during World War II.</p>

<p>&quot;During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I’ll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a &#39;normal&#39; working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member. All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can hypnotize a man -- without his knowledge or consent -- into committing treason against the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is hypnosis dangerous? It can be. Under certain circumstances, it is dangerous in the extreme. It has even been known to lead to murder. Given the right combination of hypnotist and subject, hypnosis can be a lethal weapon.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A military training program tried to hypnotize me. Didn&#39;t work on me, but I could see how it could have. For many others in the program it did work. I played along and watched the process unfold.</p>

<p>I would say the the majority of the population can be easily indoctrinated or hypnotized. I think my ability to resist came from a general mistrust of authority deeply ingrained subconsciously at a young age.</p>

<p>I can certainly understand <a href="/u/10cb">/u/10cb</a> &#39;s sentiment. I felt the same way for a while.</p>

<p>Thinking requires a great deal of work, so many people are fine letting someone else do their thinking. It took many years of refection to see that most people want to feel like they are a part of something. What that something is actually doing is less important than the community around them. If there is a furor for the group, the hypnosis and indoctrination will be largely effective.</p>

<p>The cycles of our society, the way we are made to work by the clock, is itself a hypnotic process. One that almost none of us are immune to, or at the least must play along with. Until we can rise together.</p>

<p>We must understand that life within most societies is a gigantic hypnotic-indoctrination process, maybe even all societies, some just have well intentioned ends.</p>

<p>Expand your definition of hypnosis a bit and you&#39;ll see just how effective it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of it was listening to rhetoric of a live person, while having video or animation running in the background. Basically a lot like news on TV, only more grandiose. The only real difference was that there was obviously multiple layers of subliminal messages in the background. Some more obvious than others. Certainly some that got to me temporarily that I didn&#39;t know were even there until I was able to access those memories much later on in life.</p>

<p>Most of it had to do with desensitization to killing and death. Others had to do with what I suspect were desired targets and locations of weapons weapons caches to carry out the missions, unarmed combat techniques, advanced field medicine, improvised weapons construction and uses, foreign language training (Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, Russian), false information about our families both good and bad.</p>

<p>Sleep deprivation. Strange audio playing all night. Various forms of torture experience and training. And of course lots and lots of shots, daily.</p>

<p>Other than that it was regular boot camp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no reason this all couldn&#39;t happen there, or any base, I suppose. But I&#39;m unable to give any account to confirm or deny that.</p>

<p>In my case, this took place in the San Diego area. We were transported in buses often. MCRD to different parts of Camp Pendleton That&#39;s all I can really speak to. Which is also part of the normal training pattern. </p>

<p>There is no way to really tell these experimental groups from the regular ones. Maybe you could look for platoons that have few to no overweight people in them. But that&#39;s probably a poor indicator. Overweight recruits tend to drop out of the regular platoons for a bit while they lean out. There are remediation platoons for all manner of issues. I met people who&#39;ve been in boot camp for over a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, but I don&#39;t believe it.  I was hypnotized once - or rather, they tried to hypnotize me.  It just doesn&#39;t work.  I can&#39;t even imagine how it WOULD work.  Relax, do some visualizations, count, and presto chango, two personalities?  Maybe if you combined hypnotism with really powerful psychotropic drugs.  But you can&#39;t really predict how someone will react to drugs.  It would be a mess to eve try this stuff.  You&#39;d have to plan to lose most of your test subjects to even get one that worked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another document dated 10 Feb 1954 describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: “Miss [deleted] was instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep). Failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to ‘kill’ [deleted]. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted], and then proceeded to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.” (CIA Mori ID 190691, 2/10/54)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to a hypnotherapist before too, but I never really got put under like these subjects were. I&#39;ve seen footage of truly hypnotized people submerged in ice baths, impervious to the pain.
You&#39;re certainly entitled to your opinion though, of course. </p>
