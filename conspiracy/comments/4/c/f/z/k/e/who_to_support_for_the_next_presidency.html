    <div class="md"><p>My comment was somewhat flippant but anyone who has awoken and broken through the fog will know that the election is going to go the way that the powers that be want them to regardless of what we vote. </p>

<p>Just some on the fly examples of things that would actually be meaningful, would be educating your friends and family about what reality really is, teach them that the mainstream media is nothing but the matrix movie come to life, get them started on YouTube videos on the dozens of false flag attacks that have been carried out by around country, enlighten them about all of the natural disasters occurring around the world coupled with the massive Geo engineering...</p>

<p>In my eyes any of those things would be 10 times more worth the energy than placing a vote for a candidate that isn&#39;t really in charge of anything anyways.  </p>

<p>Wow! You know what? This is my first actual post on reddit and what an amazing first conversation outside the people I know and grew up with!!! Your perception of everything you just said is unmistakably the most accurate depiction of what I have come to know of. How beautiful each individual mind thinks and yet, here we are not knowing who the other is. There&#39;s absolutely no way a robot could construe or pretend to manipulate this conversation as a &quot;human&quot; thought. I pray we do not ever have that singularity moment. Nobody would begin to understand the implications of such an event. &quot;Or maybe they would with it being the singularity event and all.&quot; Look up Tim Kennedy, I pray he is doing the work he says he is about the whole lavoy finnicum and Oregon state police coverup along with many others like &quot;master the human domain&quot;. This is in all honesty a brain- washing tactic. It&#39;s to get us use to seeing these drills so that we do not perceive it, as actual martial law and are then lived in reality. I&#39;m awake my fellow patron. We have got to fight for one another, not against one another!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;no choice&#39; / &quot;makes no differece&quot; -- you&#39;re talkng about are the establishment candidates.  Hillary versus non-Trump Republican.  Trump is probably a huge liar and narcissist and psychopath and will be the &#39;no difference&#39; guy also.</p>

<p>Yet, there has not been a candidate like Sanders in 5 decades.  He defies everything about the establishment and wants to severely punish the federal reserve and the crony capitalists that raped, ruined and pillaged this country and stole from you and from me; then mind-controlled us to get mad at each other and hate the poor.  So you&#39;re saying &#39;nothing ever changes&#39; but you&#39;ve actually not tried anything different.  Sanders is <em>that different thing to try</em>.  </p>

<p>I swear to fuck, if people don&#39;t elect Sanders, then they are too stupid to live and will deserve the totalitarianism they will get.  If we elect Sanders and he doesn&#39;t do what he says, THEN you get to revolt as hard as you want and I&#39;ll help.  If they assassinate him it will be like 9/11 times a thousand and you can expect that there will be no place on earth, even to their little nestle-ey mountain village in BERN to hide from us.
