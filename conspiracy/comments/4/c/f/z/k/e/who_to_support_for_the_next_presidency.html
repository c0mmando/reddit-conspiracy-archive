       It is obvious that the American people are fed up with politics and our legislatures filling their own pockets. But when it gets to a point that no such candidate is suitable for the American people, what should we do?

       My comment was somewhat flippant but anyone who has awoken and broken through the fog will know that the election is going to go the way that the powers that be want them to regardless of what we vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some on the fly examples of things that would actually be meaningful, would be educating your friends and family about what reality really is, teach them that the mainstream media is nothing but the matrix movie come to life, get them started on YouTube videos on the dozens of false flag attacks that have been carried out by around country, enlighten them about all of the natural disasters occurring around the world coupled with the massive Geo engineering...
      </p>
      <p>
       In my eyes any of those things would be 10 times more worth the energy than placing a vote for a candidate that isn't really in charge of anything anyways.

       See I can somewhat agree with you on that level. Local elections and politics are nowhere near as corrupted and fucked from top to bottom like national level politics are. Of course it varies by area but as a whole, voting for the offices in your local area may actually have some positive impact.

       Very good points. That was in all honesty my opinion, but the powers that be would love nothing more than to keep us educators dumbed down. Ever since Snowden, every person with a brain knows to censor themselves so that they are not a nail sticking up if you get my drift.

       I definitely do. Especially with Reddit. What many people still call bots or shills are in all actuality almost full blown AI at this point on a global scale. Sure you can go to certain sites all over the Internet and buy votes and opinions for this site where there is literal humans sitting at computers typing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that stuff is tiddlywinks compared to the sophisticated and heavily classified AI the American intelligence community is using on us/the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the past few years I always knew that when artificial intelligence was advanced enough and able to be scaled up enough that the fight for 99% of the human lives on earth were doomed. Now that the entire collective conscious of the Internet is almost completely accessible by the military-industrial complex, they now have the tools to
shape any and every facet of it with very minimal human effort. It's fucking horrifying when you really think about it. And a sky net type scenario isn't all that far after that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if you have discovered the truth about the jade helm exercises yet, but it's one that does not get discussed nearly enough for what the implications of it are going to be in the near future. And unfortunately I probably got put on about five lists for what I have just written now. But at the same time if enough of us keep popping up like whack a mole's spreading truth, it will make their mind fuck on us happen at least a bit slower overall, and even then that is only if we have not crossed the singularity yet. If and when that happens I think it's pretty official the human race as we know it is done, if we survive at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it isn't the machines that take over, it will be the extreme climate manipulation or a few of the other outrageous things the elite have been doing to all of us lowly commoners. A lot of them have complete annihilation as the endgame so it's just a matter of time with what ends up being the catalyst to take us all out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boy, what an encouraging post I've written there.../s. I wish it wasn't true I mean why the hell do people think that any of us would want to believe any of this is true. Well it is, and I'll choose to live in reality no matter how bad it sucks, thanks!

       Wow! You know what? This is my first actual post on reddit and what an amazing first conversation outside the people I know and grew up with!!! Your perception of everything you just said is unmistakably the most accurate depiction of what I have come to know of. How beautiful each individual mind thinks and yet, here we are not knowing who the other is. There's absolutely no way a robot could construe or pretend to manipulate this conversation as a "human" thought. I pray we do not ever have that singularity moment. Nobody would begin to understand the implications of such an event. "Or maybe they would with it being the singularity event and all." Look up Tim Kennedy, I pray he is doing the work he says he is about the whole lavoy finnicum and Oregon state police coverup along with many others like "master the human domain". This is in all honesty a brain- washing tactic. It's to get us use to seeing these drills so that we do not perceive it, as actual martial law and are then lived in reality. I'm awake my fellow patron. We have got to fight for one another, not against one another!

       The 'no choice' / "makes no differece" -- you're talkng about are the establishment candidates.  Hillary versus non-Trump Republican.  Trump is probably a huge liar and narcissist and psychopath and will be the 'no difference' guy also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, there has not been a candidate like Sanders in 5 decades.  He defies everything about the establishment and wants to severely punish the federal reserve and the crony capitalists that raped, ruined and pillaged this country and stole from you and from me; then mind-controlled us to get mad at each other and hate the poor.  So you're saying 'nothing ever changes' but you've actually not tried anything different.  Sanders is
       <em>
        that different thing to try
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear to fuck, if people don't elect Sanders, then they are too stupid to live and will deserve the totalitarianism they will get.  If we elect Sanders and he doesn't do what he says, THEN you get to revolt as hard as you want and I'll help.  If they assassinate him it will be like 9/11 times a thousand and you can expect that there will be no place on earth, even to their little nestle-ey mountain village in BERN to hide from us.  (you've been warned)

       That is a bad idea, sir.  You need to vote even if symbolically because we might have a supreme court case that reverses anything we don't like....a reversal of the reversal.

       Actually, just the opposite is true. By voting, one gives their implicit approval of both the system and the outcome... and any results that follow. It is the voters that have no right to complain when things go wrong.

       If Clinton and Trump become the candidates I believe it would be the ideal time to push people who identify as disenfranchised Democrats and Republicans to separate themselves from the establishment and vote third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election really would be the only time a third party will have an opportunity like this that I know of. I think Jill Stein even said something along those lines during an interview with Corbett a month or so ago.

       I hope everyone knows about the third party becoming available later this year. Jill Stein is the only person I hear of However, you do hear spurts of nominees like Ted Nugent, john mcafee, and many others. It's almost a full-time job/impossible just to see and delve into who stands for what without getting into misconstrued information about a possible future candidate's background. And yeah, you do all this work and yet it's only one vote for someone who knows absolutely nothing about. #David against Goliath
