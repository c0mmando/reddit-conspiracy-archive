        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even though I have outgrown the phase in which I listened to his program I still stumble onto his clips and stories. So I see a lot of people claiming him to be disinformation agent of some sort which seems entirely possible given that he seems more of a caricature of a conspiracy theorist than an actual person. That being said I benefitted from learning certain things he&#39;s talked about and he helped me see more of what&#39;s up than I would have without him. So my question is; if he was controlled opposition isn&#39;t he doing more harm to &quot;them&quot; by discussing certain issues that many would have never been aware of if not for him. What benefit would be to whatever organization controls him? I would think anyone that brings that many people into a better understanding of their government and its acts is doing more good than whatever his true objectives are. Someone please explain to me why and for what objective he could be an agent provocateur. Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying its impossible that Jones had a mole in his organization...because he&#39;s hyperintelligent and way smarter and sneakier than the CIA? </p>

<p>OK!</p>

<p>btw I think Jones is very intelligent, I&#39;m not saying that. But I am saying that I don&#39;t buy the argument that it&#39;s not possible that he didn&#39;t know someone on his staff was former spook .  They are spies for a reason and that reason is they are good at keeping secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mole in his organization PLUS his refusal to discuss the real culprits?  Sure, that sounds perfectly reasonable if you&#39;re an apologist.  He didnt treat it as if that were the case.  How did he handle it again?  </p>

<p>Jones is an actor.  Playing an unbelievable role, primarily for the benefit of his employer, the &quot;globalists.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t take much to discover this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo - he is basically a honeypot for those who see the conspiracies and might figure out who the puppet master is. Jones dishes the dirt but puts the blame on people like &quot;Satanists&quot;, instead of the real group pulling all the strings.</p>

<p>On top of that, his demeanor and mannerisms make it easy to label those conspiracy theorists nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to his radio show religiously around the 2004 - 2007 time frame. His mantra then was &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot;. He implicated a lot of figures within US government without ever muttering the word Israel. Once it started to take hold within the 9/11 truth movement that Israel was the main perpetrator, people would phone in and try to talk to him about it. He would get belligerent and act like a total asshole towards the caller. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t long after episodes like that it became clear what Alex Jones really was. Other high profile truthers started calling him out for being a Zionist gate keeper. It was becoming obvious as more and more videos about him came out exposing him for what he was. Even his sidekick Paul Watson has become somewhat of a neocon...it&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is a Gatekeeper for Israel because he directs his audience away from talking about Israels involvement in 9/11. He will not allow the conversation to pass through &quot;that gate&quot;. His big mantra 10 years ago was &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot;. He was  naming a lot of people within US government who he believed to be complicit...everybody except the zionists, neocons and Israeli dual citizens that were actually involved.</p>

If you have better messages you want to convey to the world on a daily basis, then start your OWN podcast! Why is it everyone else&#39;s job to create a platform for you to critique.

    <div class="md"><p>Because as soon as his turncoat membership is exposed (or even just questioned by a large number of listeners), they lose EVERYTHING they so heavily invested in.  He clearly has to walk a tightrope in releasing a lot of valid information.  This keeps people listening.  For the remainder, he can release disinfo, or he can redirect the blame from his employers.  </p>

<p>So, you haven&#39;t noticed that he REFUSES to ever identify who his &quot;globalists&quot; bogieman really is.  It doesn&#39;t take much to understand why that is.</p>
