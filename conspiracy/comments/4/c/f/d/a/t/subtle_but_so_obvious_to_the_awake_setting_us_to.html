       I could look to any book for RFID information, but you recommend a 2000 year old "paste-n-pray" field book written by sheep herders. What version of the Bible will show me that tiny radio frequency transponders are the "mark of the Beast" claimed in Revelation. Even the Catholic church doesn't support the idea that Revelation must be interpreted, or was anything beyond a 'vision.' They certainly don't claim that it is a book of prophecy, anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are using subjective truth and trying to push it onto us as objective truth. Expect resistance. We don't have the same delusions as you, therefore your 'truth' is not 'the truth,' or 'our truth.'

       How do you define worship? Is it merely thought, about an idea or a subject? Does it require some physical aspect, such as chanting, kneeling, or singing?
      </p>

       How does one define what 'the beast and his image' is in modern day society? Is it just materialism? Is it people turning away from religion?

       Depending on how you define worship, what makes an idea, or object, into a 'god?'

        Who says gold is more valuable than sand
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would go with lithium, but not sand. Sand is a term, like fish, used to describe a 'common object,' that under closer scrutiny, is anything but common. There are so many types of sand, some with gold in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But gold, is an elemental metal. It's the nitrogen of metals, gently holding on to other chemicals, being ever careful not to actually mess with any of them. Additionally, it's quite rare. And we use it in the production of many products. I filter my tea with gold (1%).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where many deduce the value of gold. A basic equation for it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Usefulness * Rarity = Value.
      </p>

      <p>
       That would be awesome, but I doubt we will find a method that will allow us to convert, say, 2 tons of sand into some amount of lithium that will provide more power than what was used to perform the conversion. Because if we could do that, we could fly to the moon for fun.

      <p>
       What's sad about an example equation for how the value of gold is calculated? It's not precise, but it's accurate. It's a fundamental concept of supply and demand. Just replace Usefulness with Demand.

      <p>
       That's a lot of 'theys,' but I get what you are saying. For some resources, they are literally limited. Rhodium, palladium, platinum, gold, helium, etc. They are rare, useful, (in demand) and therefore, valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that the moon is entirely made of golden lithium, just 2km below the surface, and they've been keeping that from us. It's possible, but not very likely. I certainly won't waste time sending Ben Affleck to the moon to drill for me.

        They say oil is high valued because we have none right?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It depends on where you live. There's a sizable amount of oil underneath me. Quite a bit more to the south. But it's cheaper to use our expats in Saudi Arabia to ship the royalty's oil to us (That clusterfuck is for another time.) In actuality, we (the US) do have sizable oil in reserve, but the exact figures for it are obfuscated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never believed oil is rare. I think at one time, it was, and to some extent is, costly to refine. I think that so many industries depend on oil products, that, in many cases, don't have readily available substitutes. The oil industry has a largely captive market, and they're going to screw that market out of every dime they can. That's "good capitalistic business" to some.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's even admitted that they use speculation to define market prices/caps, aka hearsay in a courtroom; Not evidence. But that's how the beheaded chicken stumbles. We try to move to a better energy solution, just to watch the feds fuck over startups in order to keep the Oil monopolies in play. It's an ongoing battle.

       I certainly did, but they don't want functional adults coming out of any public education system. Hell, it wasn't even designed for that. Corporations were the first to declare that such a system was needed, and they were the one's funding it before the fed stepped in again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public education system is designed to create consumerist children that are unable to properly live, without constant assistance from the state. That's its current form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, I realized such while still in HS. I was one of the few that was able to make that system bend to my interests (tort states are cool) and give me more than it ever intended to.

      <p>
       If you are asking me to listen to my conscience, then I can assure you that I do. At the moment it tells me: "This is a waste of your time. You should be programming." but I don't let it make my decisions for me. I still apply my own logic and reasoning to each situation as they emerge, just like most of us do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admire your passion, but I feel it is misplaced. Tell us about the harm to our privacy if we allow ourselves to be chipped. Talk about the issues of how such a chip could even be used in a secure manner for identification or authentication. To me the argument is right in line with biometrics, which is a wonderful way to replace a username in an authentication system. But it's a terrible way to replace a password, as so many implementations try to do. Your fingerprint, left carelessly about your environment, is the worst kind of password one could have, one known by a casual observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same way, RFID is great for identifying a product quickly, assuming that the RFID chip was properly installed, and it matches the actual product. RFIDs as a method of identifying individuals will work, but there are so many problems with it. I could block my signal with modifications that never touch the chip itself. I could place equipment in a glove that would make my RFID read as if it were someone else's. Could I become someone else by simply cloning their RFID? If so, can you say rampant crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       And perhaps that's the goal, and the point you are trying to get across. But please, remove it from its religious aspects. It's literally the stumbling block in your argument, as I see it.

       RFID has been in use for a very long time already. We have been using it to track people in office buildings since the early 2000's. RFID  is also used to track tools and inventory in places where debris is highly controlled and the transactions are automated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the technology that you should be worried about but how people intend to use the technology. RFID could easily have the same qualities of NFC. But you are so stuck on the "RFID" term that you would disqualify NFC.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words... Technology isn't inherently evil. You can't attribute one specific type of technology as being the harbinger of some religious apocalypse.

       The issue with prophecy is that it can be misconstrued to mean different things to different people. You and 100 other people can read a line or versus of prophecy and each of you will have your own interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you to use biblical prophecy as evidence to your argument displays your lack of understanding. During the time of the plague people would have considered the disease to have been the mark of the devil. Others have used this term to burn individuals and accuse them of witchcraft later in history.
      </p>

       Today you are interpreting these words to demonize technology you are in fear of. You aren't any different from the zealots of the ages past.

         For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye?
        </p>
        <p>
         As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand. [Interesting correlation there between Simon Magus and the terminology of 'make him stand.']
        </p>
        <p>
         So then each of us will give an account of himself to God. Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.

       To be honest we're already carriyng chips around everywhere we go. It tracks where you are, who you are, who you're talking to, what you're interested in and it also has a microphone to listen to what you're doing. Oh yeah the mobile phone... I don't think planting chips into anyone is going to work... It's to obvious.

       I understand what you're trying to do, I know you want to help, but you seem a little misguided... Science has governed that you cannot do all these things with a simple RFID chip, I don't know where you're getting your information from. You have to start providing evidence if you want people to take you seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using God and religion as an example for evidence will not get you very far. There is no hard evidence that a God exists or that any religion is nothing more than a dream somebody had thousands of years ago. For all we know Christianity could have been created by one man on an accidental mushroom trip 50,000 years ago. It certainly seems that far-fetched to me.

       I could be wrong here, but RFID technology doesn't seem to have the scalability for the internet of things.  The "chip" you're going to get is a lot more complex than simple RFID.

       You are right. They are using them in a lot of hotel policies. That last one I worked at as head of security, officers were told to tag there RFID buttons with the back of there phones to show they where at that location. They have to do way more good before being accepted though.

I discriminate against everyone that is not in my social circle, as well, because I prefer discussions with my friends &amp; family. But not always, hence, reddit.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That sounds like living morally, to me. What is 'right action' can sometimes be difficult to ascertain, but as long as you are making your own decisions, and realize that, there's no harm in believing you are rewarded for being 'right' or 'moral.' I don't believe there is an intrinsic reward to such. I think society has to provide it at the individual level. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a broken down vehicle on the side of the highway. They have their emergency flashers on, and I can tell that it is a family. I'm in no rush, so I pull over and try to help them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that they just needed a working jack. I let them borrow mine, and they are able to swap to a spare tire, and go about their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never ask their names. They never ask mine. They thank me for my assistance, and we part ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a deity makes a mark in a book, at that point. All I can say for sure is, that family is probably more likely to assist someone else in that same situation. I have no proof, because we're dealing with the collective free will of that family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they stop the next time they see a similar situation. Perhaps they are able to help someone out. Perhaps they fall for a ruse and the whole family gets buried in the desert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming the latter case, did they make the right decision when they chose to stop and help others? Did I?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>

      <p>
       I'm well versed in the Bible, and am familiar with the passages you reference. The path is not wide and easy. You can find similar sentiment from the Tao Te Ching and other books removed from the teachings of Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you should know that what man believes to be 'the truth' may not be, as the wisdom of man is not comparable to the wisdom of god (what might be better termed, 'special knowledge.')
      </p>
      <p>
       So which truth is 'the truth?' We can't honestly tell, or this would all be so much easier. The claim is that the Spooky Ghost will work his ways into a person's heart, where the 'truth' is revealed to them. It all depends on the flavor of Christianity, but the basic idea is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this is a distributed delusion that receives verification from believer and non-believer, alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They don't believe in my truth... because the Spirit has not revealed it to them, yet..." or
      </p>
      <p>
       "They believe in my truth, and WTF is Mackabees? Praying for the dead to enter the kingdom from purgatory... wtf? They don't believe in my truth because Satan is deceiving them."
      </p>
      <p>
       Either side can use these tactics all day, and accomplish nothing. So I ask, what's the point of having all the religion on top of the message?

       Asking questions in church is what started my 'enlightenment.' Eventually their answers were held together by their interpretation of 'god's word' while admitting that such an ability was beyond them.

       That's like getting a new car from a dealership, and going home with a bucket of parts. From those parts I built the 'hotrod of disbelief' in my mind, and I've been unable to be convinced since then.

       It's basically noble to try to lead others out of a perceived path to harm. I don't fault you for that at all. I just don't believe that any objective truth needs an attachment to religion.

       No offense or not bashing the topic or claim. But that is literally what people use to discredit conspiracy theories "oh did you see it on a youtube video?". Just saying...I personally think its fine, but you say a perfect example and then just say go search for it yourself.

       Yes, that is definitely the current evolution of a word that means 'deceiver.' Do you know where that word comes from, or how it came to use in that form?

       But it's impossible to fully communicate it to someone else, isn't it. You can talk about it, describe it to others, but you can't encapsulate the whole of it to anyone else. What was it? A divine encounter?

         For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye?
        </p>
        <p>
         As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him. Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand. [Interesting correlation there between Simon Magus and the terminology of 'make him stand.']
        </p>
        <p>
         So then each of us will give an account of himself to God. Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.
