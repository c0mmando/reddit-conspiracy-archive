    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even subtle anymore. Think about binaural beats and that level of audio, how the brain interprets intermittent left/right channel audio, how the brain interprets processed audio (delays/echoes, reverb, distortion, compression, etc.) and then begin to realize that a lot of high end pop studios (Katy Perry, et al.) have the top of the line equipment when it comes to signal processing. </p>

<p>You really think they don&#39;t know how to make the music affect your brain? </p>

<p>The end result could simply be to get you to get &quot;addicted&quot; to their music, or it could be more sinister. I don&#39;t know, but what I do know is that those processes have an effect on the brain in different ways to put your brain into different states; states such as alpha, beta, delta and theta. </p>

<p>Much like hypnosis, once your brain is in an altered state it&#39;s much more easily suggestible and influenced, and thus if there&#39;s any subliminal message in the music it can go right past the consious barrier into the subconscious where it then runs as a program -- again I don&#39;t know what conclusions, maybe it&#39;s buy more stuff, you&#39;re not good enough unless you make more money, work harder, be a slave. Those are mostly in jest, but the reality is music is a driving force for many people. How many people listen to music regularly?</p>

<p>Came here to say this, some people notice and some people can not. But at this point they barely try to hide it. </p>

<p>Music videos are the worst offenders in this situation now. That is where they place a lot of symbolic programming and subliminal messages. At least that is what I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>binaural beats i believe have to be listenned to unobstructed by other sounds for long periods of time to work. so in other words, not compatible with pop. you have to do something like put a 50 hz sine wave inone ear, and 55 hz sine wave in the other ear to get 5 hz in the middle. if you have anything going on on top of that, it would cancel out the effect. also, most pop music has traditionally been made with the bass below a certain frequency (100 hz maybe?) in mono because records wouldnt track correctly with the stereo panned bass. </p>

<p>The needle would jump out of the vinyl tracks. Not an issue CD lasers or mp3 decoders have to struggle with. </p>

<p>The other reason you still usually don&#39;t pan your bass sounds much is because low frequencies are much harder to localize for the ear than high frequency noises. </p>

<p>You can also use a normal track and run it through a filter to achieve the same effect, it doesn&#39;t have to be a sine curve. (Cooledit 2000 had such a function, and Paulstretch can do it too). </p>

<p>&lt;/pedantery&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they do this. Music producers are very clever, they can sell shite by the millions using various tricks. Another one for example is using riffs/melodies that are perfect for mobile phone speakers as everyone has one. I&#39;ve been on buses where some teenagers at the back have been playing &quot;music&quot; on their phones and its clearly audible throughout the whole bus because the notes are optimised for them. I asked my friend who&#39;s currently doing a degree in pop music production and he confirmed this and even listed off a load of examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with the Laurel Canyon conspiracies? The LA/west coast music scene was basically started by a bunch of CIA/military brats. Kept a lot of people in a haze for a decade or so, and then many of the originals died of drug overdoses.</p>

<p>Zappa was at the heart of a lot of it. His house in the canyon was called &quot;The Cabin&quot; where he had huge parties/orgies. The name &quot;Cabin&quot; is silly, because it was this HUGE house. 2000sf 3 story living room type place.</p>

<p>This one really hit me hard. I loved a lot of that music (even though I am younger) but now see how it was used maliciously.</p>

I often have the insipid TV on for a poor choice of background noise. There is some $&amp;@?ing dating site commercial that makes the same damn tone I get when I get texts from my kids. I immediately jump for the phone. I even changed there text chimes but it&#39;s too late, that damn commercial has me permanently programmed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brings me to the age old question: 
Does life imitate art or does art imitate life?</p>

<p>I ask that because, maybe instead of manipulating the audience etc, the core elements / functions of music is actually a &#39;translation&#39; process by which the subtle is brought out into the foreground more comprehensively.     </p>

<p>Ask yourself what music is in a nutshell.. Just frequencies being collected/concentrated together and (depending on processing) honed via format/source. </p>

<p>But music is literally not contained as we are interpreting variables to perception/tuning of almost infinite patterns that are constantly (without barrier) affecting reality and literally transforming the world at a macro level.   </p>

<p>TLDR: Your body is a tuning fork. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the oldest tricks in the book sorta speak.
But lately they have become more bold. There are some who aren&#39;t even trying to hide the &quot;magic&quot;</p>
