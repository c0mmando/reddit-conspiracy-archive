       It's not even subtle anymore. Think about binaural beats and that level of audio, how the brain interprets intermittent left/right channel audio, how the brain interprets processed audio (delays/echoes, reverb, distortion, compression, etc.) and then begin to realize that a lot of high end pop studios (Katy Perry, et al.) have the top of the line equipment when it comes to signal processing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really think they don't know how to make the music affect your brain?
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result could simply be to get you to get "addicted" to their music, or it could be more sinister. I don't know, but what I do know is that those processes have an effect on the brain in different ways to put your brain into different states; states such as alpha, beta, delta and theta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like hypnosis, once your brain is in an altered state it's much more easily suggestible and influenced, and thus if there's any subliminal message in the music it can go right past the consious barrier into the subconscious where it then runs as a program -- again I don't know what conclusions, maybe it's buy more stuff, you're not good enough unless you make more money, work harder, be a slave. Those are mostly in jest, but the reality is music is a driving force for many people. How many people listen to music regularly?

       Came here to say this, some people notice and some people can not. But at this point they barely try to hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music videos are the worst offenders in this situation now. That is where they place a lot of symbolic programming and subliminal messages. At least that is what I think.

       binaural beats i believe have to be listenned to unobstructed by other sounds for long periods of time to work. so in other words, not compatible with pop. you have to do something like put a 50 hz sine wave inone ear, and 55 hz sine wave in the other ear to get 5 hz in the middle. if you have anything going on on top of that, it would cancel out the effect. also, most pop music has traditionally been made with the bass below a certain frequency (100 hz maybe?) in mono because records wouldnt track correctly with the stereo panned bass.

       The needle would jump out of the vinyl tracks. Not an issue CD lasers or mp3 decoders have to struggle with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other reason you still usually don't pan your bass sounds much is because low frequencies are much harder to localize for the ear than high frequency noises.

       You can also use a normal track and run it through a filter to achieve the same effect, it doesn't have to be a sine curve. (Cooledit 2000 had such a function, and Paulstretch can do it too).

       Anyone else hallucinate phone alerts? Ill feel vibrations when nothing happened, hear my phone beep or vibrated like I got a message, and the weirdest one, I had my phone in my back left pocket I felt a vibration in my front right pocket (where my phone would usually be). Checked and I had a messsge.

       Yeah, they do this. Music producers are very clever, they can sell shite by the millions using various tricks. Another one for example is using riffs/melodies that are perfect for mobile phone speakers as everyone has one. I've been on buses where some teenagers at the back have been playing "music" on their phones and its clearly audible throughout the whole bus because the notes are optimised for them. I asked my friend who's currently doing a degree in pop music production and he confirmed this and even listed off a load of examples.

       I've noticed the ring tone thing in tv commercials, also.

       I have also noticed that every time a commercial uses one, my dad automatically checks his cell phone.

       It's to make the viewer identify with the situation or character in that moment.  So when it happens, immediately ask yourself why they would want you to identify with what's going on.  Oh, a terrorists cell just went off and you thought it was yours?  Guess what that makes you?  That's right, a subvert.  Agent Ressler's?  That's right, you're a lawful authoritariton now

       You mention chord progressions.
       <br/>
       They are not the only way to manipulate music.
       <br/>
       The beat is another avenue of manipulation.
       <br/>
       These days, the 'Amen Break' is a very popular beat that is being used in the hip hop world of music.

       The no talent "Hick Hop" country is loaded with subliminals. The stations are playing the National Anthem three or more times a day. Most of the song are glorifying getting drunk and doing Stupid Shit, beer commercials that mention the actual brand, red neck 'Murica mentality and uneducated views of the world.

       to psychopathologize people in a pavlovian association with hyperviolence, and it was severely downvoted as were all the comments.  CLearly it struck a nerve with authoritarians---as it was VERY much intended.  EDIT: The best example (had to look this up) will be this summers 'suicide squad' and 'hardcore henry'...it's the line 'nothing really matters to me'...but it could also be the chord progression thing mentioned.

       Are you familiar with the Laurel Canyon conspiracies? The LA/west coast music scene was basically started by a bunch of CIA/military brats. Kept a lot of people in a haze for a decade or so, and then many of the originals died of drug overdoses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zappa was at the heart of a lot of it. His house in the canyon was called "The Cabin" where he had huge parties/orgies. The name "Cabin" is silly, because it was this HUGE house. 2000sf 3 story living room type place.
      </p>
      <p>
       This one really hit me hard. I loved a lot of that music (even though I am younger) but now see how it was used maliciously.

       I do not listen to the more modern music but I can tell you how this audible suggestion stuff can jar me out of whatever I'm ever doing. I often have the insipid TV on for a poor choice of background noise. There is some $&amp;@?ing dating site commercial that makes the same damn tone I get when I get texts from my kids. I immediately jump for the phone. I even changed there text chimes but it's too late, that damn commercial has me permanently programmed

       Same with police sirens in songs, radio ads, or television commercials.  They use the fight or flight response tobdraw in your full attention to whatever's being said.  Now, whether that works or not probably depends on the person; some will get irritated, some will buy into it.  Fight or flight, respectively.

       One thing I hate most of all is watching conspiracy related videos and at the beginning there's barking dogs, sirens, remote gunfire, helicopter noise, screaming babies, etc.   I use this now as a metric of whether its legit or not.  Because there is no need for the fear porn, and in fact, if you use fear porn I'm not going to take you seriously ever, because of the pavlovian association attempt.  Who doesn't overuse fear porn?

       Brings me to the age old question: 
Does life imitate art or does art imitate life?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask that because, maybe instead of manipulating the audience etc, the core elements / functions of music is actually a 'translation' process by which the subtle is brought out into the foreground more comprehensively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself what music is in a nutshell.. Just frequencies being collected/concentrated together and (depending on processing) honed via format/source.
      </p>
      <p>
       But music is literally not contained as we are interpreting variables to perception/tuning of almost infinite patterns that are constantly (without barrier) affecting reality and literally transforming the world at a macro level.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Your body is a tuning fork.

       In the future beats music scene, it is not uncommon to use sounds from anything (including phones, computers, programs) in production.  It is not used maliciously.

       You are describing musical 'hooks'  which work by involving the listener in the composition.    Using temporal geometry one can map and appropriate these hooks.     Ask me if you'd like more detail.

       I had posted in another thread regarding the Eagles of Death Metal, how they're from the Cali desert, etc etc.. a simple rock n roll band, how could they be used for evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       After thinking about all the shit that goes on in the desert, and some of the shit Jesse Hughes has been spouting off.. Could they be controlled?  I'd like to think not, but you never know.

       It's not so subtle. 
music itself is mind control.  repetition. patterns.
You can't be neutral when there is a pattern. 
And if you are not neutral then you are pulled from your center.
You sway from side to side.
You become belligerent.

       is this even a conspiracy still?

       It's one of the oldest tricks in the book sorta speak.
But lately they have become more bold. There are some who aren't even trying to hide the "magic"
      </p>
      <p>
       Like this track for example

        G-eazy - I Mean it

       EDM producers/DJs drop lots of these in their songs/mixes to mess with people. It isn't a conspiracy, just some trolling.
