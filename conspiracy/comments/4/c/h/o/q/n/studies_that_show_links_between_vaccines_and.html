       A study published in the journal Annals of Epidemiology has shown that giving the Hepatitis B vaccine to newborn baby boys could triple the risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder compared to boys who were not vaccinated as neonates. The research was conducted at Stony Brook University Medical Center, NY.

       A study published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry by researchers at the Neural Dynamics Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia determined that Aluminum, a highly neurotoxic metal and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant may be a significant contributing factor to the rising prevalence of ASD in the Western World. They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age. The studies also show that children from countries with the highest ASD appear to have a much higher exposure to Aluminum from vaccines. The study points out that several prominent milestones of brain development coincide with major vaccination periods for infants. These include the onset of synaptogenesis (birth), maximal growth velocity of the hippocampus and the onset of amygdala maturation. Furthermore, major developmental transition in many bio-behavioural symptoms such as sleep, temperature regulation, respiration and brain wave patterns, all of which are regulated by the neuroendocrine network. Many of these aspects of brain function are known to be impaired in autism, such as sleeping and brain wave patterns.

       According to the FDA, vaccines represent a special category of drugs as they are generally given to healthy individuals. Further according to the FDA, “this places significant emphasis on their vaccine safety”. While the FDA does set an upper limit for Aluminum in vaccines at no more that 850/mg/dose, it is important to note that this amount was selected empirically from data showing that Aluminum in such amounts enhanced the antigenicity of the vaccine, rather than from existing safety. Given that the scientific evidence appears to indicate that vaccine safety is not as firmly established as often believed, it would seem ill advised to exclude paediatric vaccinations as a possible cause of adverse long-term neurodevelopment outcomes , including those associated with autism.

       A study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A: Current Issues by the Department of Economics and Finance at the University of New York shows how researchers suspect one or more environmental triggers are needed to develop autism, regardless of whether individuals have a genetic predisposition or not. They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations. They determined that the higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher the prevalence of autism. A 1 % increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having autism. The results suggest that vaccines may be linked to autism and encourages more in depth study before continually administering these vaccines.

       A study published in the Journal of Toxicology by the Department of Neurosurgery at The Methodist Neurological Institute in Houston has shown that ASD is a disorder caused by a problem in brain development. They looked at B-cells and their sensitivity levels to thimerosal, a commonly used additive in many vaccines. They determined that ASD patients have a heightened sensitivity to thimerosal which would restrict cell proliferation that is typically found after vaccination. The research shows that individuals who have this hypersensitivity to thimerosal could make them highly susceptible to toxins like thimerosal, and that individuals with a mild mitochondrial defect may be affected by thimerosal. The fact that ASD patients’ B cells exhibit hypersensitivity to thimerosal tells us something.

       A study published in the Journal of Biomedical Sciences determined that the autoimmunity to the central nervous system may play a causal role in autism. Researchers discovered that because many autistic children harbour elevated levels of measles antibodies, they should conduct a serological study of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and myelin basic protein (MBP) autoantibodies. They used serum samples of 125 autistic children and 92 controlled children. Their analysis showed a significant increase in the level of MMR antibodies in autistic children. The study concludes that the autistic children had an inappropriate or abnormal antibody response to MMR. The study determined that autism could be a result from an atypical measles infection that produces neurological symptoms in some children. The source of this virus could be a variant of MV, or it could be the MMR vaccine.

       Study published in the Annals of Clinical Psychiatry suggests that Autism is likely triggered by a virus, and that measles virus (MV and/or MMR vaccine) might be a very good candidate. It supports the hypothesis that a virus-dincued autoimmune response may play a causal role in autism.

       A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition determined that an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and decreased capacity for methylation may contribute to the development and clinical manifestation of autism. It’s well known that viral infections cause increased oxidative stress. Research suggests that metals, including those found in many vaccines are directly involved in increasing oxidative stress.

       A study published by the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Northeastern University, Boston determined that a novel growth factor signalling pathway that regulates methionine synthase(MS) activity and thereby modulates methylation reactions. The potent inhibition of this pathway by ethanol, lead, mercury, aluminum and thimerosal suggests that it may be an important target of neurodevelopmental toxins.

       A study published in the Journal of Child Neurology examined the question of what is leading to the apparent increase in autism. They expressed that if there is any link between autism and mercury, it is crucial that the first reports of the question are not falsely stating that no link occurs. Researchers determined that a significant relation does exist between the blood levels of mercury and the diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.

       A study published in the Journal of Child Neurology noted that autistic spectrum disorders can be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Researchers determined that children who have mitochondrial-related dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism might be more prone to undergo autistic regression between 18 and 30 months of age if they also have infections or immunizations at the same time.

       A study conducted by Massachusetts General Hospital at the Centre for Morphometric Analysis by the department of Paediatric Neurology illustrates how autistic brains have a growth spurt shortly after birth and then slow in growth a few short years later. Researchers have determined that neuroinflammation appears to be present in autistic brain tissue from childhood through adulthood. The study excerpt reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       Oxidative stress, brain inflammation and microgliosis have been much documented in association with toxic exposures including various heavy metals. The awareness that the brain as well as medical conditions of children with autism may be conditioned by chronic biomedical abnormalities such as inflammation opens the possibility that meaningful biomedical interventions may be possible well past the window of maximal neuroplasticity in early childhood because the basis for assuming that all deficits can be attributed to fixed early developmental alterations in net.

       A study conducted by the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Arkansas determined that thimerosal-induced cytotoxicity was associated with the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in both cell lines. The study outlines how many vaccines have been neurotoxic, especially to the developing brain. Depletion of GSH is commonly associated with autism. Although thimerosal has been removed from most children’s vaccines, it is still present in flu vaccines given to pregnant women, the elderly and to children in developing countries.

       A study published in the Public Library of Science (PLOS) determined that elevation in peripheral oxidative stress is consistent with, and may contribute to more severe functional impairments in the ASD group. We know that oxidative stress is triggered by heavy metals, like the ones contained in multiple vaccines.

       A study conducted by the University of Texas Health Science Center by the Department of Family and Community Medicine determined that for each 1,000 Ib of environmentally released mercury, there was a 43% increase in the rate of special education services and a 61% increase in the rate of autism. Researchers emphasized that further research was needed regarding the association between environmentally released mercury and developmental disorders such as autism.

       A study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health determined that mercury exposure can induce immune, sensory, neurological, motor and behavioural dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with ASDs. Based upon differential diagnoses, 8 of 9 patients examined were exposed to significant mercury from Thimerosal-containing vaccine preparations during their fetal/infant developmental periods. These previously normal developing children suffered mercury encephalopathies that manifested with clinical symptoms consistent with regressive ASDs. Evidence for mercury intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis as contributing to some regressive ASDs.

       A study conducted by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine showed that Macaques are commonly used in pre-clinical vaccine safety testing. Collective Evolution does not support animals testing, we feel there is a large amount of evidence and research that already indicated the links to vaccines in which some animals have been used to illustrate. The objective of this study was to compare early infant cognition and behaviour with amygdala size and opioid binding in rhesus macaques receiving the recommended childhood vaccines. The animal model, which examines for the first time, behavioural, functional and neuromorphometric consequences of the childhood vaccine regimen, mimics certain neurological abnormalities of autism. These findings raise important safety issues while providing a potential model for examining aspects of causation and disease pathogenesis in acquired disorders of behaviour and development.

Impaired resistance may predispose to vaccine injury in autism.

       Question:  If you can source this many anti-vaccination (very, very impressive list btw,) how many could you find that show/suggest there is no correlation between autism and vaccines?

      <p>
       And if there are more of them, are all of them tainted/corrupt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what's your opinion on the child or adult that doesn't present autism in the modern age.  Could the thimerosol/aluminum etcpresent symptoms other than just autism in the long term (ADHD, depression and other supposed naturally occuring, 'genetically disposition induced' brain disorders)

       1.This is not a game of who gets more points wins. This is about being 100% safe. If 100 studies show there is not connection, say between autism and vaccines, but a new study comes out that says there is, what has to be done is INDEPENDENT verification has to immediately take place. That study has to be replicated, then peer reviewed, read
       <strong>
        Not done by the company that has the patent on the vaccine
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens today is a study, or say 20 as I listed, show that there is a connection and they are not refuted, they are buried. "Look at all these studies (nearly all done by parties funded or have an interest in the company that produces the vaccine) that show you are wrong. No further investigation needed."
      </p>
      <p>
       2.Of course not everyone is corrupt. You do not control a populous by letting everyone in on it, you control a populous by controlling the narrative. Chomsky talks about it in the Propaganda Model relating to the media, but the same thing is applied to science.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The propaganda model is a conceptual model in political economy advanced by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky to explain how propaganda and systemic biases function in mass media. The model seeks to explain how populations are manipulated and how consent for economic, social and political policies is "manufactured" in the public mind due to this propaganda. The theory posits that the way in which news is structured (e.g. through advertising, concentration of media ownership, government sourcing) creates an inherent conflict of interest which acts as propaganda for undemocratic forces."

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3.Everybody that gets a vaccine doesn't get autism. Some people are more susceptible than others. As was shown by the CDC Whistleblower's statement.  In this case it was African American boys.

       Excellent response.  You seem like a bright researcher/individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you understand I was playing the devil's advocate as my brother usually does when I talk to him about such studies you presented, and the foolish societal narrative that has people think "anti-vaxxers" are the stupidest breed to walk the earth.  That was the first red flag that got me interested.

       Thanks man, I give zero fucks about what people's prejudices are. Letting facts lead us where they may is how we get to the truth, but sometimes new facts change the truth. Dogmas like "all vaccines are safe" belong in the realm of religion...

       No.. The question is, have YOU read the new research papers at all? Worldwide, proven that vaccines have ZERO correlations with autism? Have you actually went through it? You'd see perfectly well why those old researches are NOT relevant anymore and that the very beginning of the "autism caused by vaccines" was a hoax by the very doctor who started spreading such lies.

       Research. Don't be satisfied with old "research" papers and claims without any actual laboratory-tested evidence.

       They have debunked the papers posted by OP?  At the minimum it'd probably be much more difficult to round up all of the papers which eliminate the claims in all of them.

       <strong>
        you

       should be the one to be ready to post the papers (not produced or funded by the pharm complex) which satisfy your claim that the OP's research is completely misleading.

      <p>
       I can try and do so ... although I think your claim is frivolous/empty.  But regardless, it'll be quite an endeavor and not "one google search" (your attempt at calling me lazy)  It should include a matrix/spreadsheet of all the papers posted by OP and the paper which refutes the "vaccination is not completely safe claim"

       One does not to "debunk" a science research paper, only provide evidence that suggest the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you're even using the word "debunk" suggests that you smell conspiracy all over this thing. Or you simply don't understand the correct and appropriate terminology for serious researches versus the articles that OP has posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. Literally ONE Google search will give you a WHOLE page with NEW research that has shown that the autism claim is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously - do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science doesn't focus on debunking each others' claims. It focuses on pushing forward and doing new discoveries that, automatically, refute the previous claims. The refuting itself is not the main focus, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when finding research that may suggest a small risk of autism (though no direct link actually exists), the benefits still WAY WAY WAY outweigh their risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your child is in much greater danger NOT taking the vaccines, than by taking it.

       I'm not saying I haven't read many studies which suggest there is no correlation between autism and vaccines.  What's more interesting, and the reason I use "debunk" is because OP linked to many studies which show the opposite, either through regression or analyzing/comparing antigens in the autistic and non-autistic whom received vaccinations.  So we are presented with two conflicting sides of the scientific story.  What now?  Believe in authority, majority and the scientific process, thereby concluding that because there are more "pro vaccination" that they are thereby right,
       <strong>
        and ignore the research/papers which don't suit your choice?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your opinion? (being sure to take into account the obvious conflict of interest that exists in this heated domain of science.)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Even when finding research that may suggest a small risk of autism (though no direct link actually exists), the benefits still WAY WAY WAY outweigh their risks.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The benefits, based on my research are far overblown, certainly in a first world (clean-ish water source) sanitary country, and the known negatives hidden under the rug.  I fear more negatives exist within the heretofore unknown (or not well understood) complexities of the overall human body, but specifically the neurological and immune system.

       I hope you don't use Penn and Teller to decide on issues.  "Bullshit" is gate-keeping bullshit.  Now, why are OP's source's shady?  Can you enlighten me as to how you've came to this decision?
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask me which one makes more sense?  Honestly?  That vaccines aren't required for keeping sanitary, healthy, 1st world countries safe, and that the proven harm and potential for harm (through currently unknown vectors) outweighs the supposed risk.  In no way should they be mandatory.  This makes sense to me.  Now what makes sense to you?  I hope you haven't fallen prey to the media's fear-mongering that if we fall below "herd mentality" we risk our entire country or civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch an actual doctor who isn't afraid to stand up and speak about this topic from a perspective I am sure you are unfamiliar with.  This is where I began questioning the status quo and looking into it more by the way:

       Maybe 1-2 hours is too long considering your ridiculous 1:30s long video propaganda .  But I sincerely hope you'll give it a chance.  I think you'll understand me, and the logical anti-vaccination (and not pro-vaccination) argument better.  So please try to watch it if you have time.

       Read any scientific test results on vaccines.. Seriously, ANY research. Because the autism claim is not even once backed up by actual lab tests, only claims and pseudo connections between sick child and vaccine they received (of course not taking all the thousands of other factors that may have been involved). So yes, this is exactly how proof works - you look up research, you read it and you go "oh of course, how could I have been so stupid?"

       [A recycled comment I wrote for a really old thread — before realizing the thread was too old to post to. (Posting it here so it doesn't go to waste.)]
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI: (1) there's between 12.5 and 25 micrograms of ethyl-Hg in a CURRENT anual flu shot. The most widely advocated infant–food (methyl-Hg) saftey standard is 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. And — despite alot of pronouncements to the contrary — injected ethyl-Hg is probably around 2-3 times more harmful to the brain long-term than ingested methyl-Hg; because it creates 2-3 times more Hg(2+) in the brain — and Hg(2+) is more lethal, provokes more brain inflammation, and has a 3 to 10+ times longer half-life in the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Because thimerosal is just one source — and overall environmental/pollution Hg levels have continued to mount — blood levels of mercury have been relatively constant; i.e. it appears to be completely lost on 'simple searchers' like yourself, but the whole "it can't be Hg because thimerosal's been removed" argument is really, really stupid when Coal fired power (and "healthy"* tuna, salmon, etc) levels have continued to escalate — keeping overall blood levels at a relative constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Oh, and btw: In 1990 (the beginning of the epidemic climb in autism rates) not only did thimerosal–vaccine levels escalate but — importantly — we began to systematically funnel heavy-metals away from our rivers, lakes and oceans, and straight into our food-chain — via sewage treatment plants, and ”biosolds” sludge fertilzer. And this practice also escalated — in-line with autism rates  — and continues to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) And I could go on and on, about "recycled mercury" loopholes — in water-based paint... and how the supposed Hg "phase-out" from paint ended-up a total Congressional con-job... And how water-based paint sourced "recycled-mercury" paint-wastewater has itself been recycled straight into the foodchain, via that same biosolids fertilzer... And how these  "recycled-Hg" paint trends are likely a perfect counterbalance to the thimerosal phase-out, after '01 — on account of building booms and, a massive commercial shift to water-based paint supremacy — which continues to this day...
      </p>
      <p>
       *oh, and btw: the big push towards consuming at least two servings of "healthy" omega 3 rich fish each week — whose Hg levels are now, in some cases, starting to make that 0.1/kg/day level look like a typo — is another point completely lost on the groupthunk–sheeple gang.

         Recent studies have shown that all the previous claims from the 90's and early 2000's are scientifically false - because no actual scientific research was done to prove its claim.
        </p>
       </li>

         2011 - IOM (Institute of Medicine) proved it.

       <li>
        <p>
         2013 - a CDC study further proved it.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And at the bottom you have many other scientific researches on the topic that ALL AGREE in that autism is NOT caused by vaccines.

       The thimerosal (and other substances like mercury) debate resolved from further recent studies in the past 5 years:

       Conclusion: Any kind of health risk to a child is VERY VERY low (except for autism, because vaccines don't cause autism to begin with). In fact, the damage you are doing to your child is FAR greater if you do NOT vaccinate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a list of benefits and reasons why you absolutely should and must vaccinate your child, unless you want to expose your child to great danger later in life:

       Trouble is, Benny, average overall Hg-blood levels have been relatively constant (despite thimerosal's on going phase-out) — because industrial, commercial and environmental sources have continued to escalate.

       Addendum: So yes. It's high-time to let the air out of most of the conspiracy and vax debates.

       I understand what you're saying, and as much as certain risks are constantly being fought - the fact remains that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks BY FAR. Meaning that no matter how you look at it, it will still be immoral to a much greater extent if you don't vaccinate your child versus if you do.

       Ofcourse I do.

       But I also think it's telling — and a bit baffling — that people on both sides of this thing continue to try to make it about vaccines — rather than mercury (fish + coal pollution, + dental amalgams, + sewage sludge fertilizer, + thimerosal...), and heavy metals in general (Hg, arsenic, lead, and cadmium.)
      </p>
      <p>
       i.e. I don't understand how or why people allow themselves to be dragged into a debate about the pros and cons of inocculation. (Let alone one that has gone on for 15 bloody years.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they're all totally missing the point. (On both sides.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile environmental Hg pollution continues to escalate; to the point where white tuna levels are now high enough for a single sandwich to put most small children over the 0.1 micrograms/kg/day Hg–safety max for a couple of weeks(!).
      </p>
      <p>
       And pregnant women (and the elderly) are still being told that it's just as good for them as it was 300 years ago — i.e. before we burned a few billion tons of coal(!).

       I'm not sure why you say that, especially given the breadth of research posted in this thread.  What's your game, Benny?

      <p>
       Now, it is my belief some percentage of anti-vaxxers may be stupid and believing without proof (or subject to one of many rhetorical fallacies,)
       <strong>
        but that doesn't mean there isn't real research
       </strong>
       (meaning, there is research, that they might be ignorant of) which proves their stance more logical (or worth investigating) than some judgmental, arrogant, smiley, buffoon like you thinks.  Literally.

       No.. The question is, have YOU read the new research papers at all? Worldwide, proven that vaccines have ZERO correlations with autism? Have you actually went through it? You'd see perfectly well why those old researches are NOT relevant anymore and that the very beginning of the "autism caused by vaccines" was a hoax by the very doctor who started spreading such lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research. Don't be satisfied with old "research" papers and claims without any actual laboratory-tested evidence.

       [A recycled comment I wrote for a really old thread — before realizing the thread was too old to post to. (Posting it here so it doesn't go to waste.)]
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI: (1) there's between 12.5 and 25 micrograms of ethyl-Hg in a CURRENT anual flu shot. The most widely advocated infant–food (methyl-Hg) saftey standard is 0.1 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day. And — despite alot of pronouncements to the contrary — injected ethyl-Hg is probably around 2-3 times more harmful to the brain long-term than ingested methyl-Hg; because it creates 2-3 times more Hg(2+) in the brain — and Hg(2+) is more lethal, provokes more brain inflammation, and has a 3 to 10+ times longer half-life in the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Because thimerosal is just one source — and overall environmental/pollution Hg levels have continued to mount — blood levels of mercury have been relatively constant; i.e. it appears to be completely lost on 'simple searchers' like yourself, but the whole "it can't be Hg because thimerosal's been removed" argument is really, really stupid when Coal fired power (and "healthy"* tuna, salmon, etc) levels have continued to escalate — keeping overall blood levels at a relative constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Oh, and btw: In 1990 (the beginning of the epidemic climb in autism rates) not only did thimerosal–vaccine levels escalate but — importantly — we began to systematically funnel heavy-metals away from our rivers, lakes and oceans, and straight into our food-chain — via sewage treatment plants, and ”biosolds” sludge fertilzer. And this practice also escalated — in-line with autism rates  — and continues to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) And I could go on and on, about "recycled mercury" loopholes — in water-based paint... and how the supposed Hg "phase-out" from paint ended-up a total Congressional con-job... And how water-based paint sourced "recycled-mercury" paint-wastewater has itself been recycled straight into the foodchain, via that same biosolids fertilzer... And how these  "recycled-Hg" paint trends are likely a perfect counterbalance to the thimerosal phase-out, after '01 — on account of building booms and, a massive commercial shift to water-based paint supremacy — which continues to this day...
      </p>
      <p>
       *oh, and btw: the big push towards consuming at least two servings of "healthy" omega 3 rich fish each week — whose Hg levels are now, in some cases, starting to make that 0.1/kg/day level look like a typo — is another point completely lost on the groupthunk–sheeple gang.
