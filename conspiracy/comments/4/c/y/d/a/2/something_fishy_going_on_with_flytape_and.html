       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       : As most of you probably know by now, this was an April Fools prank. I sincerely apologize to anyone who found this to be in poor taste. I was in on this since ~10PM EST March 31, though apparently it's origins predate that. If anyone was offended or otherwise not amused by this, please respond to this post and I will try to get back to you, or PM me. For what it's worth, this is the first AF prank I've been a part of that has really fooled anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot definitively tell you that JCP and Flytape are different people, though I've interacted with each of them separately and truly believe them to be different people. This is April 2
       <a href="/u/CelineHagbard">
        /u/CelineHagbard
       </a>
       speaking .The post by Flytape to C_S_T and subsequent post by JCP was planned in advance, with my knowledge, and my participation in this thread was intended to deceive for the purposes of the prank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not being privy to the original discussions regarding this prank, I cannot be sure of its intentions. From what I was presented with, it was genuinely an attempt at humor. I sincerely hope all of you who might have been fooled can appreciate that I did not mean this in any nefarious or ill-intentioned manner, but rather as an April Fools prank that may have gotten out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, if I have offended any of you, I do sincerely apologize. The following text is the original self.text of this post:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So full disclosure, I mod a sub with
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon
       </a>
       over at
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       , but I feel like I have to speak up somewhere about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier today,
       <a href="/u/Flytape">
        /u/Flytape
       </a>
       made a post over in
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       . It seemed really suspicious, as the Flytape talked and signed off on the post like JCP. I saved a
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160401162055/https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4cwgfi/its_important_to_prepare_for_whats_coming/">
        wayback archive
       </a>
       of the thread for proof, in case I needed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure enough, a little bit later, that post was taken down, and
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon
       </a>
       made the
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4cwjvh/its_important_to_prepare_for_whats_coming/">
        exact same post
       </a>
       ! It also seems like he's trying to monetize the little sub that we built up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting this to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       has been a mod here for a while, and
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon
       </a>
       was just recently added as a mod. Is Flytape up to his old shit again, this time packing the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mod team with his own alts?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could have made my own alt to post this, and if my suspicions are correct, I do expect JCP to remove me as a mod of
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       , but I think it's important that this accusation be made publicly from a user who has participated on both subs for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope I'm wrong about all this, but what do you guys think?

       What the fuck...??  This is really weird because flytape and JCP actually started a modmail conversation in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       the other day about "joining" the two subs in an effort to drive traffic.  They even discussed adding flytape to the mod team of C_S_T.  It seemed a little off but I didn't think much of it at the time, now I'm thinking that it's probably related.

       Please for the love of Christ, don't let this happen. Flytape shouldn't even by a fucking mod HERE. I can't understand why you people have let him run his fucking mouth all this time. He's been removed THREE TIMES from THIS SUB as mod, not to mention the other controversial shit he's done. How can you possibly think it's a good idea to have him around?

       Nothing lol. The majority of the mods here are buddies that talk to each other daily. They aren't going to break up their little clique. Like I said, Flytape has been demodded multiple times for legitimate reasons and then reinstated by some miracle. Check out the threads about it if you can find them, users were FURIOUS, but nobody can do shit because mods = gods. This is "their" forum, NOT "ours." Their rules. Not ours.

       I believe there is an automod set up to remove certain websites, but don't quote me on that because there's quite a few subs like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that, despite being a CONSPIRACY sub, their filter is harsh on new accounts- and as someone who frequently makes new accounts, this is a pain so I don't even bother submitting here.

       reddit itself removes certain websites - that's sitewide.  We always approve any posts we see from banned domains and are one of the only subs that do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the new account filter is only a couple of days to limit trolling, you would be amazed at how many people just create brand new accounts and shitpost.

       The automod only removes one site, worldnewsdailyreport.com, as every article from that publication is satire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The automod also auto-approves a bunch of sites from the reddit-wide spam filter, such as infowars
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       approves comments from shadowbanned users who wish to continue using their account after being banned by the site-wide admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the new user account filter, it is an extremely low threshold that is primarily used to stop trolls from hate subreddits like TMOR and conspiritard from flooding the queue after a ban. There have been attempts to increase the age limit to 2 weeks+, but those have been rejected by the mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to ae911truth, although there has been some questionable behavior by that group in the past with regards to monetary conflict of interest and one of our former mods, no one has been banned for posting any content related to that group. In fact, many of the current mods are staunch defenders of that group and would be instantly made aware of any such actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, the moderation philosophy of the subreddit is rooted in a respect for the organic curation of content and the free flow of information; although there has been some push back against this ethos as of late, the overwhelming majority of mods are here to ensure the subreddit is not ripped away from its roots.

       I've said it before and I'll say it again. Just like the mods of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       , and many other subreddits; the mods of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are COMPROMISED. Not JUST Flytape, but most of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've all been given a look at how they compromise a subreddit. They build up trust amongst a community, and then start leaking into other subreddits where they "build trust" as well. Next thing you know, they're combined, or the mods in question take over "since they care so much about the subreddit, and want to dedicate themselves to more than just one." Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hopeless to try and spread this type of information, because it is just so ridiculous, but you have to admit that is also an effective strategy to control information on a site like Reddit. You hire some shills and give them a subreddit or two to mod. You give these shills multiple accounts, that way you can dilute information, introduce hostility to whatever topic may be being discussed, all while maintaining a more convincing position on your mod account. Slowly, the mod account comes around to the position presented by the shills other accounts and begins to stand behind the narrative. Once they have "logically explained" away whatever "numbskull conspiracy theory" they've been paid to deal with, they are then able to pour over the reactions of the actual users and ban them so that they are effectively silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen it time and time again with multiple users in this sub over the years.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       thinks that it is free to say what it wants, but with certain mods lording over what is acceptable and what is unacceptable conversation.... You just can't have free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an idea as to how you might spot which mods are COMPROMISED, you need only look at how many subreddit they mod. Perhaps even which ones, just to establish a pattern. It's a theory, but a working one by the looks of it.

       You should include a lifestraw or mylar sawyer drink pouch instead of those idiotic tablets.  It's ok to have backup iodine tablets (polarpure is best) but also have vitamin c powder to neutralize the flavor.  The aquamira tabs and other ones make everything taste like chlorine or worse. I can't stand it.  People complain about iodine, but vit c deletes the flavor and even without I have no problem like the other tabs (the 1 or dual tab ones)...or the drops.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that is irrelevant with a sawyer pack or lifestraw

       I actually went back and forth about including a sawyer pack (not lifestraw) in this first kit. I'll have to think about incorporating it in the future.

       Please do make sure that your "recap" includes the central fact of your construction of a layer of new "immunity" around "Flytape" -- the only mod long accused of sockpuppetry gets a new Teflon coating against accusations of sockpuppetry, courtesy of you and this operation.

       Yeah, it looks like you're right. My point is just that he's not been a major contributor to the sub, like all of the other mods had been. It just seems kinda of strange that JCP would add someone like that to the mod team, especially without consulting the rest of us.

       True. I was referring to what Ambig was saying about him discussing it in

       mod mail. Maybe I'm just making too much of this.

       Perhaps I should start a whole other thread for this because this appears to have gotten out of hand (on a Friday night!). Let me know what I can do to assure you they aren't "in" on it with me. Flytape I don't even know, and I just reached out to JCP to get his opinion on the project I was working on. He saw it as a good opportunity to plug the project and get feedback from the C_S_T community. Totally backfired. But I'm still here to answer whatever questions I can to put your minds at ease.

       It'll sound like a cop out but no I would rather not.  I would need to get the rest of the mods' approval before doing something like that, everything said in mod mail is assumed to be private and amongst only the users involved.

       It's understandable, I would've had the same request if I was you - and in fact before I was a mod I often did ask for stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the post, it was really weird because he signed it off as being from him "and the mods" and we had never reached a consensus for anything in the post and personally I'm just naturally opposed to marketing/advertising like that.  And then there's been really no response from JCP at all since earlier this morning to any messages he's been sent or to this thread.  It just strikes me as strange and I can't think of a rational or innocent explanation.

       The stranger part is the identical post flytape made, who I don't think has ever visited the sub before.  The obvious implication really is that they're the same person using alts, and it begs the question of what else is that person involved with.  Eventually both of those usernames will have to say
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       in acknowledgement, so far they both are silent - which in itself is a little fishy.

       Flytape stalked an old account (and many other peoples accounts in the past) simply for disagreeing with him on certain topics.

       There is a long history on this user if you dig further. Can we please ask for both accounts in question to have their mod privileges revoked?

       nor
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">

       have really stopped by and explained what's going on here.

       I kind of understand the April fools joke,  by insinuating that
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T

       was planning on monetizing the sub in order to gain traffic,  but this still doesn't explain why FT posted the exact same post post verbatim,  only to delete it and have JCP repost it.

      <p>
       I also find

       to be incredibly damning, and from face value,  it really does appear to me that these two users are in fact one in the same.

      <p>
       I really hope both of them will drop in here and explain what the fuck is going on here and explain what this is all about.  It really doesn't look good for

       You can find out a lot about a user by checking out the way they construct words and sentences. The UnABomber was caught due to a strange use of "Eat your cake and have it too."
      </p>
      <p>
       I started by looking at both user names, arranging by top of all time (figured I'd look through their meatiest posts), and taking a look at what I came up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found one immediate odd thing ...
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of the phrase "any way" instead of "anyway."
      </p>
      <p>
       Looked through the posts and both users use "any way" instead of "anyway."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you can find a few more linguistics oddities if you look. It's really hard to cover up this kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT1: These might seem like small points, but together they add up to a user style. This is a linguistic fingerprint you can't mask. Here's the next two I found:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both users use the "oxford comma"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both users will often start a sentence with "And."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'll let you know if I find more. So far they seem fairly similar to me, but nothing definitive. However, these small points start to add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2:
       <a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/">
        http://snoopsnoo.com/
       </a>
       for both user names.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Accounts were created within 8 days of each other.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both use the words "thing" "post" and "time" with unusual frequency.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         7096 vs 7905 unique words in vocabulary (a lot can be influenced by proper nouns posted on.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       EDIT3: There are a few other areas where I've found unusual words/phrasing that I'm looking into. I'll get back to you. Feel free to look through and tell me what you think. Anyone know of anything besides snoopsnoo for automating this? The few I've found don't work.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Both user frequently will have one or two word sentences that they apply both capitalization and punctuation to.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Meaning:
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't say something like "sorry" instead it's "Sorry."
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of them do this 100% of the time, but both do it rather frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT4: This one seems unusual to me and pretty telling.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Unusual signoff. Both have ended posts with
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       something something,
[jim|flytape]
      </p>
      <p>
       examples (and each do this a few times):

      <p>
       EDIT5: Ok, done for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have come to a conclusion regarding these matters. However, I will give others time to put some research in via my methods or others. I don't want to poison others with my conclusion in case I am wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do believe I have definitive proof on whether or not these two users are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll check back in a few hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT6: Some non-linguistic things were pointed out to me. Right now I am no longer sure of whether or not they are the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are reasons to think they might be a different person. I'll let you provide further evidence for either way, as right now I am unsure:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         JCP uses what might be called excessive amounts of bold, and minor amounts of ellipsis and dashes. I don't see any of that in flytape.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         JCP will often say "[citation needed]". I have yet to see flytape ask for a citation in anyway, particularly not this unique way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         flytape will often say "Lol" or "Lmfao" note the unique capitalizations of the words. JCP does not ONCE use lol/lmfao or anything similar.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Removing posts: JCP consistently says "Removed. Rule #." flytape has inconsistent style here.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I should note: I think it is bad to have the same two people mod the same subreddits and that should not happen. However, I can't in good faith say whether or not they are the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT7: When I saw the same posts before, one was deleted and I could not see the same text. However, looking at this tells me they are the same person:

       Because reddit is a co-opted site that invented half of the rules to quash free speech.

       The vast majority of every legitimate thread of conversation in the main subreddits is so heavily moderated that the narrative of the site and its users is completely fabricated.

      <p>
       I have a history of sticking up for Flytape when people parrot SRD/conspiratard/TMOR propaganda that he's racist. This has gone on for years. It's entirely plausible in my mind that the principle people behind the parroting (it's just a few people I think with multiple accounts) of this disinfo are actual paid disruption/FUD agents provocateur who are assigned here to sow dissent and divide &amp; conquer.

       We didn't intend this as spitting in the face of the community; we intended it as a light-hearted--albeit elaborate--AF joke. We deal with legitimate and far-reaching conspiracies on this sub every day, many of which affect millions of people in severely negative ways. This deception was limited to the one day of the year that people expect to be deceived.

       Low trust in whom, the mods of this sub? It's highly possible some mods of this sub
       <em>
        are

       intelligences agents or assets. It's all but assured that some members of this community are disinfo agents. How much can you really trust users of an anonymous forum anyway? There's very few people I trust on reddit, and even those, I only trust to an extent, and only accept what they say if they have evidence to back it up. Even this evidence can be fabricated, so I don't even trust that completely.

       The rest of us were discussing it in mod mail pretty heavily, as we didn't really want to cause a stir in the sub if JCP could explain himself. The rest of us, or at least I, had nothing to do with it.

       "Flytape and me are" is poor grammar. Maybe the guy upstream analyzing has something to say about that. I find it all amusing. Your adamant denials buried deep in a tiny off-shoot thread is compelling though.

       Flytape banned me from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       once a few weeks ago, in what I would characterize as a very suspicious way, and made it difficult for me to prove I was a regular here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will notice I've had this account for only a few months and have almost 10k karma and given out shittons of gold to users here.  I earned that karma, mostly here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , a lot of it from original content I wrote... but because I taunted anticonspiracy people in another sub pointing to my own post, I got banned.  It was pretty clear what I was doing, and a slap on the wrist would have sufficed but it became a thing and other mods had to vote me back in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought this whole ordeal was foolish and didn't feel like flytape was operating with the same sentiment as the rest of the mod team.  To characterize me of all people as any kind of shill means you're not paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my vote is for 'ishiness'

       That's insinuating he's really a shill from TMOR in mind at least.  I just don't think that's very becoming of a mod here to accuse someone of being a TMOR shill without posting any kind of proof.  Do you have proof that he has an alt that posts to TMOR?

       I find it remarkable, not merely "in poor taste" that such an alleged "prank" coincides with a mod, Flytape, who has a long history of already being accused of such behavior.

       I am sorry, especially that you spent real money as a result of our prank. I do not know if reddit can refund you the gold, but I am absolutely willing to support you in any way that I can in such a claim. You can quote me on that and I will send any message to the admins you want concerning that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Flytape, I don't know much about him other than what I've said in my edit. I've never paid much attention to the drama that seems to follow him. I honestly have no opinion on it.

       Was this a psy-op? Yes, in a way, yet I think in the way any April Fools prank is; the purpose was to deceive, but not with any malicious intent, at least on my part.

      <p>
       Again, I do apologize.

       That's all fair. I didn't design the prank, so I can't really speak to the original intentions. Maybe
       <a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">
        /u/JamesColesPardon
       </a>
       can comment on this.

       What I would say is this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        that the entire prank was designed around a mod whose credibility was already damaged,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Assuming this was just a prank, this is part of its ingenuity: people already suspect Flytape of malicious intent or whatever, and they are therefore more likely to believe such a prank. Part of what makes an AF joke work is that those being fooled can believe, at least initially, that it could be true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        that so many user comments were deleted by mods in the course of this "good fun"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't believe that to be the case. In this thread, mostly what I've seen is comments showing up as [deleted], meaning the author deleted the comments themselves. AFAIK, comments removed by the mods show up as [removed]. See
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3luvvy/reddit_change_making_removed_deleted_content_more/">
        this changelog post
       </a>
       . If you have examples of mod-deleted comments, I would be happy to reconsider this position.

       This one I can't really deny fully. As far as I know, I have no reason to believe that they are the same user, and in fact have significant reason to believe otherwise. Could this have the end result of providing cover for Flytape, who might indeed be using alts or doing other nefarious things? Yeah, I guess it could. But if anything I would say it would draw more unwanted attention to him.

       If my memory serves correctly, Flytape stickies posts to the top of
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy

       more than any other mod, and I can recall multiple times where the highest rated comments on those posts were opposed to the post and asking why it was stickied. I think it's because he gets butthurt about his posts not being upvoted naturally.

       You know, there was another mod that was once here and did something similar. Spent a lot of time talking to alts of themselves. This all looks and seems familiar. If I recall, fly tape was a mod at the time and was advocating for the guy to stay... I can't remember though. I'm sure others can remember. Wasn't so far in the past.

       Yeah i came to the party a bit late. You know, part of it is a learning experience, imo. It kind of illistrates that we gotta remain vigilent when scrutinizing information -- even the information coming from trusted sources.

       It's up to you whether you want to post you linguistic analysis. I actually found your comment to be the most interesting of all of these: you really dug into analyzing the similarities of posting habits. There are real examples of people using multiple sock puppets, as well as bots using

       I did post my linguistic analysis through a number of edits. It was interesting putting theory into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       My end conclusion through linguistic analysis was that they were different users, though there were several red flags at first. I was only dissuaded from that conclusion by a moderator pointing me to that double post on
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">

       I was glad to do this and I had fun, I just wish it could have been more useful. Hopefully others will look into my techniques and use them if something like this comes up in the future. I think the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       crowd has a lot of interesting things to say, but often they could be more rigorous in their methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think jumping to conclusions because they fit your world view can makes us easily manipulated. It also allows for disinformation people to put in little phrases that when repeated to others make us seem foolish. What I mean is saying things that are 90% true and then tacking on a loch ness monster. When that information is then passed on to others, they dismiss the 90%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not quite the same, but an interesting example of on-line information manipulation is Rudolf Hess. A doctor analyzed his body and found he was likely NOT Rudolf Hess. His conclusion linked to the murder of Rudolf Hess in the 1940s and then the murder of his double in more modern times. There are a number of articles out there that make it seem like the doctor was only talking about the more recent murder. They then debunk that and use that to cover up the 1940s murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is important for the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       crowd to understand is that these days the internet allows for the rapid and free spread of information. Intelligence organizations are well aware of this. They can't hold back information, so they must do something else. I believe that in lots of operations they will add a "viral" element that allows for them to control the mainstream narrative and the "truther" narrative. It's also essential for them to violate Occam's Razor, as anything that violates that is easily dismissed by the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an early example of this, look into the JFK rabbit hole to end all rabbit holes:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing to remember is that there is more than just the CIA. There is more than just the CIA, Mossad, FSB, and GCHQ. There are a lot of intelligence agencies out there, and they all have a narrative to push. Just because the government and media is lying to you does not mean everyone else is telling the truth.

       EDIT: Wow, some people are not happy with these posts. Im curious if any of the downvoters want to give a reason? I feel what is being said in these posts is fairly well written and indepth.

       Do you have a link on the Rudolf Hess thing? That sounds interesting.

       This is probably my favorite part, and a very astute observation. Occam's raxor is a good idea in principle, yet is likely best applied to science. Anyone who is aware of the theory can easily use it to their advantage, to deceive.

       Do a google on "Rudolf Hess Murder" and take a look at how most of the articles only talk about one murder (the recent suicide.) Then look into "Rudolf Hess double" and see where that takes you. Notice how the articles of the first type try to obscure the idea of the double. They make it seem like the doctor only talked about the suicide when he talked about the suicide and the murder of the double. It's creative spamming of articles related to the suicide murder that hides the original murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreed on the Occam's Razor. We should realize that Intelligence agencies are aware of all of these things. How would you deal with free flow of information? It has to be a different tactic than just classifying things.

       I can see the slug trails from here in his pants already if you are correct.   Do you want to be the source of his orgasmic bliss?  Let him jack himself off with an alt.

       Definitely don't subject yourself to the same under the table work he had to do.   If you do, then you will have two choices, to spit, or swallow.

       The only reason they pull shit like that here is because of short comings IRL.  And if they tried it IRL, they would probably get a hot one to the eye.  Or at the least going home with a hair line fracture.

       Doing a prank like this, which involves Flytape of all people, was really lame.  That guy gets off from this type of controversial attention. I guess pleasing a gadfly is priority #1 here.

       No you are not because there is no punch line. No way JCP would be all serious most of the time and then completely fuck his credibility like that intentionally. If they did [plan and execute this farse], they are too goddamn stupid to be mods in the first place.

       This right here tells me that this is in fact a REAL conspiracy,  and not some well planned April fools joke.  Clearly if it was intended to be a joke,  you'd not have reacted so defensively as you did here.

       What the fuck is wrong with you guys?  Why would you pull a prank of this level onto a community already ingrained with paranoia?  Not to mention, Flytape loves this type of controversy, so you definitely helped satisfy his thirst for attention.  This was so pathetic :/

       I would agree with that sentiment.  But you did it with the most controversial and attention seeking redditor I have ever witnessed in my life.  Just googling his name shows dozens of divisive threads.  This is the guy who did that horrific podcast and has been demodded multiple times.  I think you went too far and I think the community would appreciate an apology.

       Your prank was so elaborate I beg to differ.  If any user was caught posting the same post verbatim with a signature sign off of another user, they would have been accused equally.  You just got a bigger reaction from the users who already distrust him.

       Dude if you had fucking consulted the rest of the mods before putting on our name on that shit today we wouldn't be having this conversation. Or if you had responded to my PMs or mod mails. I tried to keep this in house; the fact I had to come here to get you to respond at all is on you.

       Every 6 months or so a team of non-community outsiders try to turn r/conspiracy against Flytape. And usually their "evidence" turns out to be a load of BS to divide and conquer the sub.

       And here we go again on April first. I don't care enough to look into it, but this happens like every 6 months.

       It'll sound like a cop out but no I would rather not.  I would need to get the rest of the mods' approval before doing something like that, everything said in mod mail is assumed to be private and amongst only the users involved.

       Do a google on "Rudolf Hess Murder" and take a look at how most of the articles only talk about one murder (the recent suicide.) Then look into "Rudolf Hess double" and see where that takes you. Notice how the articles of the first type try to obscure the idea of the double. They make it seem like the doctor only talked about the suicide when he talked about the suicide and the murder of the double. It's creative spamming of articles related to the suicide murder that hides the original murder.

       Agreed on the Occam's Razor. We should realize that Intelligence agencies are aware of all of these things. How would you deal with free flow of information? It has to be a different tactic than just classifying things.

       We didn't intend this as spitting in the face of the community; we intended it as a light-hearted--albeit elaborate--AF joke. We deal with legitimate and far-reaching conspiracies on this sub every day, many of which affect millions of people in severely negative ways. This deception was limited to the one day of the year that people expect to be deceived.

       Low trust in whom, the mods of this sub? It's highly possible some mods of this sub

       intelligences agents or assets. It's all but assured that some members of this community are disinfo agents. How much can you really trust users of an anonymous forum anyway? There's very few people I trust on reddit, and even those, I only trust to an extent, and only accept what they say if they have evidence to back it up. Even this evidence can be fabricated, so I don't even trust that completely.
