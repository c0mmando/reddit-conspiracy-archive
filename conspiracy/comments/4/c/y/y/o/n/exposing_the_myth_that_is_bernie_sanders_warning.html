       Clinton said “With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gaddafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.” About the only truthful thing that’s ever come out of her mouth. Bernie was a cosponsor of the war propaganda resolution.

       His only vote against a war was Iraq however many Democrats did that and as a vote against Bush not the War. Bernie voted to fund the war and had no problem with it once Obama was in charge of it. He also supported the sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of children.

       He also was against impeaching George Bush and called it impractical.

       Bernie Sanders is a zionist. Totally supports Israel. He told people in a town hall meeting to shut up about it.

       Of all the corporate welfare which Bernie likes to droll on and on about, there is none larger than all of the military interventions he supports. He also supported the F35 program which of course was jointly built with the Israelis and cost 1.5 trillion dollars so far to build an aircraft that doesn’t even really work.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-all-the-problems-with-the-f-35-that-the-pentagon-found-in-a-2014-report-2015-3">

      </p>
      <p>
       With a 18 trillion dollar debt 8.3% of it is the F35 project alone. For you millennials who can’t do math, that’s 1.5/18. Of course parts of the F35 are built in Vermont. Bernie like everyone he criticizes fights for his slice of the pork projects and helps waste trillions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But forget about the waste that Bernie will not cut. Look at all the taxes and spending increases that he wants.
      </p>
      <h1>
      </h1>
      <p>
       Now what about his economic policies? Who do they really enrich?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders wants to increase the payroll tax. Basically punish people who work to give free shit to people who don’t. They never look at the underlying problem of why colleges are so expensive in the first place: Government guaranteed student loans!
Listen up millennials if the colleges know your loan is guaranteed then they increase the cost of tuition to match it. Colleges are investment vehicles for defense industries. Your tuition isn’t spent on education it’s spent on wall street.
Under the cloak of education the government is laundering money through the banks to students as a means of increasing the investment capital of universities into the war industries. They don’t care about you and furthermore they aren’t even educating you or preparing you for the real world. They are indoctrinating you and saddling you with debt.
Sanders is part of the problem. If you really want affordable college then get rid of the government involvement. Prior to guaranteed loans, colleges were affordable. Ron Paul and Austrian economics are correct. Peter Schiff and I explained.

       Bernie talks real big about going after the 1% and taxing people more. Well 47% of congress are millionaires compared to 1% of the rest of the country. When you tax someone that money does not go to the poor, it goes to the government and as we have seen the government wastes it on militarism which as shown above, Sanders supports. He wont cut any of the spending, instead he wants to spend more by taxing more, aka a typical tax and spend Democrat. He voted with the Democrats 96% of the time. That’s not an independent or a maverick.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Bernie wants to raises taxes above 50%! Tax money goes to the government. That is basically like taking your money and throwing it into a fire and then expecting ice cream to pop out. Businesses will pack up and leave if you tax them 50% or in some cases even higher. The more money a business has the better. The more money they give to the government the less money there is to pay workers and thus the fewer jobs that are available.
There is a huge difference between “the wealthy” and “wealthy business owners”. Businesses, provide jobs, goods and services. We need them making money. Instead of raising taxes, why not cut the bloated military budget starting with the F35. Why not get rid of excessive Departments, the DHS and TSA, the Department of Commerce, Education and the EPA. But wouldn’t that lead to a regressive disaster? No, I explained why to this Sanders supporter here.

       Very quality post. And to the Bernie drones, DUH he's a better choice than Hilary or Trump, but let's not pretend Bernie isn't part of the establishment just cuz he has photos taken of him riding public transit to work. He wont change the status quo. The game is always rigged.

       you'd rather gamble with Trump just to get federal funding for the green party?   I guess a popular people's revolution is NOT what Trump's billionaire friends want, nor do the catholic church.   Thanks for your input.

       Sorry but I'd say they're both just as bad as each other, given Trump's history on Israel and Sanders' history as a warmonger. They both fail the litmus test in my book. Of course, they're not nearly as bad as Hillary -- but is that really what we should be contrasting our potential presidents as? They're all bad, I know I won't be voting, because it's an exercise in futility, and Ron Paul is only dude I would have voted for in American politics for last 8 years.

       I don't see Trump as a true nationalist, a true nationalist doesn't have dual loyalty. Trump's speech to AIPAC was the only speech I've ever seen him use a transcript for: very telling. To me that says the only people he has to impress are the Jews because they are the only people he feels he has to impress. He knows what's going on; it's the reason he's disrespectful to the entire American establishment yet still feels it necessary to kiss the feet of Netanyahu. Disgraceful, and low energy indeed.

       What's wrong with capitalism? The means of production is in the hands of the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats wrong with being a salesman?  The stereotype is of being unreliable and doing immoral things to gain sales.  Not necessarily Trump but I think it's fair to say he wouldn't mind distorting the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is he fascist?  Well that remains to be seen. Imo you can't be the leader of a fascist government (USA) without being at least a little bit fascist.  Will the border restrictions to stop Muslims and illegals be used to limit American movement like how the Patriot Act etc is used?  Will he continue to torture and use imperialist methods to push US control (read as new York Fed control) onto the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he quite obviously will.   Hopefully he isn't full of shit and does go against globalism. that will probably get him killed though.  Tbh I don't believe in a president being able to change a society. that's naive as fuck.

       He is! He wants to protect America, reduce military responsibility, and, most important of all he's always called it like he sees it. Remember the Obama birth certificate? Remember how Trump made a big fuss and called it fake, remember how the lady who authenticated the BC died in a weird plane crash, or lived through the crash to drown after. He wants to protect his own interest, which is in America. If you go to r/the_donald you'll see that many people there see through the bullshit that the people on this sub do as well, I'm very excited to see this, gives me hope. He may turn out to be a disappointment like Obama, but currently compared to hilldawg and burdie, he is the most solid choice.

       While I'm kind of surprised by this and I need to do more research and read the articles I wouldn't dismiss this post just because I consider myself an avid Bernie enthusiast and all that comes out of his ass is rainbows. Anyways, one of the issues that I feel greatly about is climate change and what worries me the most is we the United States aren't doing what we should to prevent further damage to our planet. I'm new to the sub but i'm sure climate change comes up and Bernie Sanders is the only candidate IMO to really give a damn about the climate change crisis.

       No that wasn't my intention at all and my reaction either, I even said I'm a Bernie supporter but doesn't mean I believe he's perfect. I just wanted to engage OP in a conversation on the environment issue, I should have clarified that intention a bit but if you could read you could see I didn't act like I just ignored all the stuff he put up or trying to do whatever you think I'm up to. Just wanted to converse.

       Jill Stein of the Green Party is the most progressive candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, she will not be running in the democratic primary and therefore has little chance of winning given the current election system which makes it almost impossible for a third party candidate to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, i am supporting Bernie Sander for the Presidency of the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, we must not forget that Bernie is not a true progressive on all the major issues of today, esp. on foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       i will vote for Bernie Sanders in the primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Bernie wins the democratic nomination, then i will vote for Jill Stein in the general election since i don't live in a swing state. Those who live in swing states must vote for Bernie in the general election.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary wins the democratic nomination, then i will save my vote for Jill Stein.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can not in good conscience vote for Hillary or Trump who are warmongers.

       Bernie will be the least dangerous and the most open to the progressives.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is clear: we are going to need a movement of at least 100 million well-informed activists, free of misinformation and disinformation, to make sure that the President and the Congress act Lovingly and Wisely. Otherwise, little will get better for We the People no matter who is President.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am waking up and mentoring around 10 new uninformed/misinformed individuals every week.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's imperative that each and every one of us, without exception, does so too.

But we owe it to our children and grandchildren to try...We need to face up to the reality of where we are as a nation, and we need a mass movement of people to fight for change." That's what real politics should be — not merely a vacuous campaign to elect a personality, but a momentous democratic movement fighting for the common good.

       All I'm posting here is an exposure of Bernie Sanders. He's not who he says he is. I put a lot of time in this post and could equally do the same for Mrs. Clinton.

       Thanks for posting, it's a good post. I don't support anyone, tbh, but people (supporters) need to know the truth about Sanders. If they just "believe", well they are doing a disservice to the country. Facts are facts, and the fact is, Bernie is a fraud. A wolf in sheep's clothing.

       That could very well be true, I lean towards a wolf in sheep clothing, though. Just my opinion.

       I think there is some truth in that. I think Bernie is desperate to get power and I'm very suspicious of his Israel links.

       Your main post is super on point but I gotta ask, you really think Trump isn't an establishment pawn like the rest of those fools? He's just the anti-Sanders strictly in terms of political control. These two try very hard to make it seem like they're the outsiders to this evil game TPTB play with us, but let's be real, all of these guys are tools for the same interests.

       my thing is this: you have two sides of the spectrum: Trump and Bernie.  Trump "promotes racism and violence", and Bernie supporters "promote free speech and anti-racist views" that normally lead to racist views and violence.  It's gradually get worse and worse.  If it's not clear to any one else, Hillary will be the one getting in. She's the only one that TPTB will allow as she'll keep the status quo going.  I dont even know why there's debate on this.

       Trump has never promoted racism.

      <p>
       Bernie wants to expand the role of the Government. That pretty much leads to the opposite of promoting free speech.

       Had it come to this, that just because the other candidates are so terrible they will just vote Bernie because apparently it's the only choice they have. Stop giving up your power people. Mass non compliance to a system that is broken in ever way, then the house of cards will fall down.

       A long post of garbage and miss characterizations. The you tube of him supposedly shutting up the person was simply him trying to answer a question and the guy talking over him. And Hama's is a terrorist organization just like Israel. You're posting Briedbart crap, yeah I'll believe their quotes of him. Show me him saying it and you leave out the bulk of the relevant information in the articles themselves. Cherry picking doesn't come close to sullying his consubstantiality fighting for the common man for 40 years. He's been ahead on every subject consistently including gay rights in the seventies. He's always been anti war but pragmatic. No candidate you can name can come close to his consistency. Nice waste of time though.

       I don't think its people just spontaneously down vote correct information. Actually never mind considering this is Bernie Sanders we're talking about and people are falling for the whole "change" thing all over again.
