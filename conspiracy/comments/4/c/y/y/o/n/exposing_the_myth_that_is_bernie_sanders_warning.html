<p>Clinton said “With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gaddafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.” About the only truthful thing that’s ever come out of her mouth.

<p>His only vote against a war was Iraq however many Democrats did that and as a vote against Bush not the War. Bernie voted to fund the war and had no problem with it once Obama was in charge of it. He also supported the sanctions that killed hundreds of thousands of children.</p>

<p>He also was against impeaching George Bush and called it impractical.</p>

<p>He gutted the audit the fed bill (the night before it was being voted on)</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is a zionist. Totally supports Israel. He told people in a town hall meeting to shut up about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf2cCdgwgoM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m25s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf2cCdgwgoM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m25s</a></p>

<p>Of all the corporate welfare which Bernie likes to droll on and on about, there is none larger than all of the military interventions he supports. He also supported the F35 program which of course was jointly built with the Israelis and cost 1.5 trillion dollars so far to build an aircraft that doesn’t even really work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-all-the-problems-with-the-f-35-that-the-pentagon-found-in-a-2014-report-2015-3">http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-all-the-problems-with-the-f-35-that-the-pentagon-found-in-a-2014-report-2015-3</a></p>

<p>With a 18 trillion dollar debt 8.3% of it is the F35 project alone. For you millennials who can’t do math, that’s 1.5/18. Of course parts of the F35 are built in Vermont. Bernie like everyone he criticizes fights for his slice of the pork projects and helps waste trillions.</p>

<p>But forget about the waste that Bernie will not cut. Look at all the taxes and spending increases that he wants.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>Now what about his economic policies? Who do they really enrich?</p>

<p>Sanders wants to increase the payroll tax. Basically punish people who work to give free shit to people who don’t. They never look at the underlying problem of why colleges are so expensive in the first place: Government guaranteed student loans!
Listen up millennials if the colleges know your loan is guaranteed then they increase the cost of tuition to match it. Colleges are investment vehicles for defense industries. Your tuition isn’t spent on education it’s spent on wall street.
Under the cloak of education the government is laundering money through the banks to students as a means of increasing the investment capital of universities into the war industries. They don’t care about you and furthermore they aren’t even educating you or preparing you for the real world. They are indoctrinating you and saddling you with debt.
Sanders is part of the problem. If you really want affordable college then get rid of the government involvement. Prior to guaranteed loans, colleges were affordable. Ron Paul and Austrian economics are correct. Peter Schiff and I explained.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/01/28/geopolitics-with-ryan-dawson-episode-11-the-future-of-the-dollar-post-the-fiscal-cliff/">http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/01/28/geopolitics-with-ryan-dawson-episode-11-the-future-of-the-dollar-post-the-fiscal-cliff/</a></p>

<p>Healthcare same problem, instead of trying to meet the price by giving the government more control and raising taxes to do it, why not ask why the prices for procedures and drugs are so high?</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M</a></p>

<p>Overly protective patents, medicare and medicaid abuse, regional protections to prevent competitive pressure on the price of insurance etc. It’s a complicate topic but for more Dr. Philip Caper and I discussed what is wrong with US healthcare here for 50 mins.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ancreport.com/podcast/dr-philip-caper-on-obamacare/">http://www.ancreport.com/podcast/dr-philip-caper-on-obamacare/</a></p>

<p>Bernie talks real big about going after the 1% and taxing people more. Well 47% of congress are millionaires compared to 1% of the rest of the country. When you tax someone that money does not go to the poor, it goes to the government and as we have seen the government wastes it on militarism which as shown above, Sanders supports. He wont cut any of the spending, instead he wants to spend more by taxing more, aka a typical tax and spend Democrat. He voted with the Democrats 96% of the time. That’s not an independent or a maverick.</p>

<p>The US already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Bernie wants to raises taxes above 50%! Tax money goes to the government. That is basically like taking your money and throwing it into a fire and then expecting ice cream to pop out. Businesses will pack up and leave if you tax them 50% or in some cases even higher. The more money a business has the better. The more money they give to the government the less money there is to pay workers and thus the fewer jobs that are available.
There is a huge difference between “the wealthy” and “wealthy business owners”. Businesses, provide jobs, goods and services. We need them making money. Instead of raising taxes, why not cut the bloated military budget starting with the F35. Why not get rid of excessive Departments, the DHS and TSA, the Department of Commerce, Education and the EPA. But wouldn’t that lead to a regressive disaster? No, I explained why to this Sanders supporter here.</p>

<p>As for raising the minimum wage, it sounds good, but it isn’t. Ian Daily explains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see Trump as a true nationalist, a true nationalist doesn&#39;t have dual loyalty. Trump&#39;s speech to AIPAC was the only speech I&#39;ve ever seen him use a transcript for: very telling. To me that says the only people he has to impress are the Jews because they are the only people he feels he has to impress. He knows what&#39;s going on; it&#39;s the reason he&#39;s disrespectful to the entire American establishment yet still feels it necessary to kiss the feet of Netanyahu. Disgraceful, and low energy indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s wrong with capitalism? The means of production is in the hands of the NWO.</p>

<p>Whats wrong with being a salesman?  The stereotype is of being unreliable and doing immoral things to gain sales.  Not necessarily Trump but I think it&#39;s fair to say he wouldn&#39;t mind distorting the truth.</p>

<p>How is he fascist?  Well that remains to be seen. Imo you can&#39;t be the leader of a fascist government (USA) without being at least a little bit fascist.  Will the border restrictions to stop Muslims and illegals be used to limit American movement like how the Patriot Act etc is used?  Will he continue to torture and use imperialist methods to push US control (read as new York Fed control) onto the world?</p>

<p>I think he quite obviously will.   Hopefully he isn&#39;t full of shit and does go against globalism. that will probably get him killed though.  Tbh I don&#39;t believe in a president being able to change a society. that&#39;s naive as fuck. </p>

He wants to protect his own interest, which is in America. If you go to r/the_donald you&#39;ll see that many people there see through the bullshit that the people on this sub do as well, I&#39;m very excited to see this, gives me hope.

<p>One thing is clear: we are going to need a movement of at least 100 million well-informed activists, free of misinformation and disinformation, to make sure that the President and the Congress act Lovingly and Wisely. Otherwise, little will get better for We the People no matter who is President.</p>

<p>i am waking up and mentoring around 10 new uninformed/misinformed individuals every week.</p>

<p>It&#39;s imperative that each and every one of us, without exception, does so too.</p>

<p>Bernie: It may be too late to stop the billionaire class from trying to buy the presidency and congress... But we owe it to our children and grandchildren to try...We need to face up to the reality of where we are as a nation, and we need a mass movement of people to fight for change.&quot; That&#39;s what real politics should be — not merely a vacuous campaign to elect a personality, but a momentous democratic movement fighting for the common good.</p>

<p>That could very well be true, I lean towards a wolf in sheep clothing, though. Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my thing is this: you have two sides of the spectrum: Trump and Bernie.  Trump &quot;promotes racism and violence&quot;, and Bernie supporters &quot;promote free speech and anti-racist views&quot; that normally lead to racist views and violence.  It&#39;s gradually get worse and worse.  If it&#39;s not clear to any one else, Hillary will be the one getting in. She&#39;s the only one that TPTB will allow as she&#39;ll keep the status quo going.  I dont even know why there&#39;s debate on this. </p>
