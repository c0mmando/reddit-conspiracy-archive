<p>What forces are influencing cop culture to be comfortable with this kind of culture and behavior? </p>

<p>A judge has blocked release of the video, I&#39;m interested to see if it will be overturned and released at some point.</p>

<p>Jumping to the bottom of the rabbit hole... wasn&#39;t there an &quot;insider&quot; or cabal researcher who stated that we would be seeing public executions becoming increasingly common? If anyone remembers I would greatly appreciate it... </p>

<p>I think that any public unrest (obviously justified after events such as this) would be of benefit to the deep state in that it justifies increased police presence in the streets, increased coordination with police forces and three letter agencies, marginalize minority groups in the eyes of the controlled public, link legitimate protesters to violent controlled opposition groups, and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. I was a sheriff&#39;s deputy for 4 years, and to a degree it is a but of a warzone. There are two instances in my first year that someone called 911 to report they were being held at gunpoint. When we showed up, it was the gunman who had called, and he and 4 others opened fire on the first car that arrived. I was still about 2 minutes out ( opposite end of the county was my patrol zone) he threw his car in reverse and got the hell out. We had to get our (seized) Humvee and call state snipers in. All of this was pushed under the rug with a threat of termination if anyone spoke to the press. Another time, we had a hostage situation in a hotel room. The hostage had dialed 911 then hid her phone and kept talking to the guy. He was heard saying he would blow the building if she didn&#39;t shut her mouth. They dispatched about 20 city officers, about 10 county officers,  5 game wardens, a few state guys, mobile dispatch vehicle, and what they called &quot;the tank.&quot;  This thing was designed based off a Humvee, but was bigger. 4&quot; steel doors and panels, bullet proof glass, and I&#39;m told some type of plated tires that were bullet proof. All for a hostage situation that now may or may not include bombs. With the snipers watching, they sent a drone (not a human) to peer through the windows and such. They only saw a guy on the bed. He hit the floor when he saw the drone. Snipers moved to a better vantage point, and we had a team(SWAT) bust in. No bombs, but about 3 bags of ammo for the two ARs they had. All single shot, both purchased the day before at academy sports.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re ex cops. So was the first guy. Shits crazy</p>

<p>Edit: we never found a woman in the room.</p>

<p>I also believe that acts like this are a gradual form of agitation being employed against the civilian public.  The government wants to instigate civil uprising in America, so that it has pretext for removing any and all remaining restraints on its&#39; ability to brutalise the public.</p>

<p>If the public revolt, then the gloves get taken off completely.  If the public do not revolt, then the Judge Dredd scenario they want will still occur; it will just happen more slowly, until the government become convinced that the public are completely passive and there will be no negative consequences for them instituting complete fascist tyranny.  It&#39;s a case of heads they win, tails you lose.  Pacifism is not an answer for police brutality, because corrupt cops have no conscience; they will slaughter you irrespective of what you do.</p>

<p>The only real solution is to get out of the cities, which is why I already have.  Cities are pathological constructs by deliberate design; they allow a multitude of different forms of assault to be carried out against the people who live within them, and one of the worst is the capacity of centralised control.  Urban society is the single greatest threat to human survival that currently exists; it desperately needs to end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, the officer is being charged with murder. I don&#39;t think this really counts as an execution. Also, since he is being charged, I think that shows that they are not &quot;comfortable&quot; with the behavior. Whatever influenced the officer to shoot the man will come out in his trial. I would suspect the current anti-cop rhetoric probably makes them feel like they are at war with the public. But in general, I feel like the police force attracts those who want to have power over people. Not all of them, but some just join because they are bullies. </p>
