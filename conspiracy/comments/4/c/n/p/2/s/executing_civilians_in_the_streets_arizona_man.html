       What forces are influencing cop culture to be comfortable with this kind of culture and behavior?
      </p>
      <p>
       A judge has blocked release of the video, I'm interested to see if it will be overturned and released at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jumping to the bottom of the rabbit hole... wasn't there an "insider" or cabal researcher who stated that we would be seeing public executions becoming increasingly common? If anyone remembers I would greatly appreciate it...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that any public unrest (obviously justified after events such as this) would be of benefit to the deep state in that it justifies increased police presence in the streets, increased coordination with police forces and three letter agencies, marginalize minority groups in the eyes of the controlled public, link legitimate protesters to violent controlled opposition groups, and more.

       Yes and no. I was a sheriff's deputy for 4 years, and to a degree it is a but of a warzone. There are two instances in my first year that someone called 911 to report they were being held at gunpoint. When we showed up, it was the gunman who had called, and he and 4 others opened fire on the first car that arrived. I was still about 2 minutes out ( opposite end of the county was my patrol zone) he threw his car in reverse and got the hell out. We had to get our (seized) Humvee and call state snipers in. All of this was pushed under the rug with a threat of termination if anyone spoke to the press. Another time, we had a hostage situation in a hotel room. The hostage had dialed 911 then hid her phone and kept talking to the guy. He was heard saying he would blow the building if she didn't shut her mouth. They dispatched about 20 city officers, about 10 county officers,  5 game wardens, a few state guys, mobile dispatch vehicle, and what they called "the tank."  This thing was designed based off a Humvee, but was bigger. 4" steel doors and panels, bullet proof glass, and I'm told some type of plated tires that were bullet proof. All for a hostage situation that now may or may not include bombs. With the snipers watching, they sent a drone (not a human) to peer through the windows and such. They only saw a guy on the bed. He hit the floor when he saw the drone. Snipers moved to a better vantage point, and we had a team(SWAT) bust in. No bombs, but about 3 bags of ammo for the two ARs they had. All single shot, both purchased the day before at academy sports.

       They're ex cops. So was the first guy. Shits crazy

       Edit: we never found a woman in the room.

       I'm looking forward to our inevitable civil war 2.0, because I'm not ready to take a shit on the Constitution. Pigs have completely forgotten that they have much more in common with even the people they arrest, than the people who write the laws. Pigs are dumb animals. They might as well assault themselves, loved ones, and friends.

       I also believe that acts like this are a gradual form of agitation being employed against the civilian public.  The government wants to instigate civil uprising in America, so that it has pretext for removing any and all remaining restraints on its' ability to brutalise the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the public revolt, then the gloves get taken off completely.  If the public do not revolt, then the Judge Dredd scenario they want will still occur; it will just happen more slowly, until the government become convinced that the public are completely passive and there will be no negative consequences for them instituting complete fascist tyranny.  It's a case of heads they win, tails you lose.  Pacifism is not an answer for police brutality, because corrupt cops have no conscience; they will slaughter you irrespective of what you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real solution is to get out of the cities, which is why I already have.  Cities are pathological constructs by deliberate design; they allow a multitude of different forms of assault to be carried out against the people who live within them, and one of the worst is the capacity of centralised control.  Urban society is the single greatest threat to human survival that currently exists; it desperately needs to end.

       I am glad that someone has.  I have often been accused of insanity in life; and quite frankly, I wish that were true.  The reality of twenty first century human life is in many ways unspeakable; and the only way we are going to change that, is by acknowledging the nature of the problem so that we can devise solutions.

       Um, the officer is being charged with murder. I don't think this really counts as an execution. Also, since he is being charged, I think that shows that they are not "comfortable" with the behavior. Whatever influenced the officer to shoot the man will come out in his trial. I would suspect the current anti-cop rhetoric probably makes them feel like they are at war with the public. But in general, I feel like the police force attracts those who want to have power over people. Not all of them, but some just join because they are bullies.

       It's not really about their feelings. It's about the pervasive meme that people are out to kill cops in retaliation for [insert favorite thug-murdered-by-cops here]. If a cop is walking up on a traffic stop thinking that they will get shot just for being a cop doing their job, it may make them a bit on-edge.

       You are 100% spot on with that analysis. Cops are just people too, after all. Some are good, some are bad. But they know whats going on too, and if I were a cop I'd be on edge too.

       The charges have been reduced, via plea bargain, to negligent homicide with a sentence of less than 4 years, which he will surely serve half of or less, and be released just in time to join a private military contractor when shit hits the fan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with your last statement. This is very likely not a pre-planned incident but rather the natural outcome of the type of person that joins the police force for power and control, then being further radicalized by the polarizing events between cops and certain communities.

       I didn't see that the charge was reduced. Was that in the second article? Wonder what the plea bargain was then. What did he have to offer them that was bigger than 2nd degree murder?

       Wow. Well, this is a bad situation, and a cautionary tale about the state of gun-fear in this country. Again, as with the attitude towards cops, the media drives this narrative that if you see a gun, you need to call the cops. Then the cops will show up on edge thinking they're going to get shot at, with guns drawn.

       I have been thinking that for a long time.  But it would oh support their gun control bullshit even more.  And with the way the media is run, they will probably label us as terrorist thus having the rest of the US backed behind the killed cops.
