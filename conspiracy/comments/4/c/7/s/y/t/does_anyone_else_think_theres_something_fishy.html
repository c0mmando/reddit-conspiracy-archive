        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>More so than previous elections, that is. Even in 2012 it was relatively &quot;normal&quot;: old white republican vs. young black democrat. Typical subjects were brought up during debates, and the sheep went out and voted for either R or D as usual.  </p>

<p>Something about the drama in this election just seems so....<em>manufactured</em>. Like right now, the whole Ted Cruz sex scandal stuff. It seems so fucking unreal, stuff like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/U1Bwmn6.jpg">this</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amandacarpenter/status/531619189362933760">this</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/KatrinaPierson/status/337938391624736768">this</a>. I&#39;m trying to understand the motives of these supposed &quot;mistresses&quot; and I can&#39;t figure out for the life of me why they would blatantly tweet stuff about an affair like that. Especially since that Katrina girl works for the Trump campaign. It all just seems so odd to me, like there&#39;s a lot more going on than what we&#39;re being led to believe.</p>

<p>I never had much faith in the US population or the election process, but it seems 100x worse this year than in the past. It&#39;s like the entire thing is more like a reality show than a democratic election.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming the two equally controlled anti establishment types are trump and birdie. </p>

<p>Looking at the reactions of those in control is telling. </p>

<p>Bernie is rarely attacked by the media, trump is attacked, demonised and smeared daily via all types of mass and social media. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the deal with trump? </p>

<p>&quot;Jews have indeed played disproportionate roles in struggles for racial equality, from the movement against South African apartheid to the cause of civil rights in the United States. And while Jews felt called to these movements by faith, universalistic political commitments, or an innate sense of justice, doing so was also in their communal self-interest. A country that is politically pluralistic, open to new ideas and new people, ethnically diverse, and respectful of religious difference, is a country that will naturally be safer for Jews than a country that is none of these things. This, I believe, is why so many Jews, foreign policy hawks or not, innately fear Donald Trump.&quot; - James Kirchick </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they really hated trump he&#39;d get no airtime. </p>

<p>I think trump will appear to be going to win just to really piss off the &#39;intellectual&#39; left and have them hating on all the nationalists. After a summer of terror by the Islamic state and their CIA handlers, trump will be used as the mouthpiece to drum up the anti Muslim sentiment and maybe some kind of stunt showing the saud&#39;s to blame for 9/11 and for funding IS and this will be to get troops on the ground in the middle east. </p>

<p>These are just thoughts I&#39;ve had though, and I could be wrong, but the theatre in the states is just a distraction. Don&#39;t forget what the overall goals of the globalists are. They want to be allowed to go into the ME. They want a new <em>world</em> order, not a new leader in the states. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think of it like this: there&#39;s evidence of vote tampering going as far back as a hundred years ago when all of the votes were written down.  Now it&#39;s all electronic, it&#39;s been shown that these devices are easy to hack, and there have been numerous cases in the last couple of decades where they&#39;ve been massively manipulated.  I think it&#39;d be naive to assume that the votes <em>aren&#39;t</em> all fake.</p>

<p>I too am yet to meet a single person in real life who supports Hillary.  They&#39;re all baffled that she&#39;s &quot;in the lead&quot;, but they don&#39;t ask the obvious questions: is she actually in the lead?  Are the vote totals even real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just attended my state caucus and the 3 hillary supports was 2 really old women (60+) and one gay man. Out of dozens. And they were all hush but the gay guy had to speak up because H got one delegate in our area and <em>someone</em> had to rep her. However having lived in more.. affluent areas in 08, the Hillary supporters were stronger. (think million dollar homes in Seattle owned by baby boomers)</p>

<p>eta - I&#39;m a middle age woman myself, but there is a certain demographic that LOVES hillary. People who would normally vote GOP, but don&#39;t like the social issues - gay and women&#39;s rights - vote for H. I saw it in 08, and I&#39;m seeing it again this time around. </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders is definitely not a puppet, so he&#39;s received nearly zero airtime in the media. They don&#39;t want his agenda to spread.

But despite this, I can&#39;t help but wonder if he&#39;s actually been a pawn for decades, carefully positioned to give the American people hope, just for it to be destroyed in the end.</p>

<p>What I mean is, what if Bernie&#39;s that one guy they kept in reserve this whole time, the one guy who literally fits the bill for the characteristically consistent idealist to destroy the system, but it&#39;s been a ruse for fifty years?  If he gets elected, what happens to America if he betrays us?  The country will crumble and the people lose all hope of freedom.  No one will ever be trusted again, even if he&#39;s a real hero.</p>

Bernie has the same message they drilled into me, and what the original occupy movement was about. I like to imagine he figured &quot;now or never&quot; I saw him speak live twice now, and he&#39;s real. You can&#39;t even imagine. It&#39;s like if Lewis Black was older, and kinder.

<p>Even in the off chance that he isnt controlled now, he will be once he gets into office, because he is an appeaser and capitulator. he has never shown any sign of standing up to power. he gets away with inflammatory rhetoric now, because he is not a threat, but once he does pose a threat, he will be forced to toe the party line. </p>

<p>for his fed &quot;reform&quot; panel, he chose stiglitz, robert johnson, jeffrey sachs, d&#39;arista, et al, who are tied with Soros. while he attacks the billionaire class, often citing as an example the Koch brothers, he never criticizes Soros or other billionaires like Bloomberg and Gates who fund projects which Sanders approves of.</p>

<p>This may be true some of the time, particularly with Rep/Dem primaries and caucuses where there is no statutory/legal requirement for the parties to count the votes.</p>

<p>However, every time they cheat there is a risk, so TPTB prefer not to cheat unless they have to (they&#39;re not stupid). So, they will count and if they win the most votes &quot;legitimately&quot;, end of story. If they don&#39;t get the most votes, then they find a way to pretend they have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way to get perspective: think historically. There have been bizarre elections before, with emergence of nominees nobody expected. Usually these are third-party candidates who introduced some unexpected and therefore dangerous twist to ho-hum Rep vs Dem 2-party establishment contests. We forget how powerfully some candidates appeared un-American or even unreal to a majority of the US electorate - a Catholic (Kennedy)? a socialist (FDR)? an unreconstructed racist (Wallace)? a digital tycoon (Perot)? Are the current pack really more bizarre or corrupt than the usual suspects over the last hundred years? Time settles down the emotional spikes.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an anti-conspiracy theory: the American experimental political apparatus is unique and unpredictable. Nothing constitutionally prevents a very rich egotist like Trump from being President, except the standards of voters. There has always been manipulation, money, and backroom deals in this system. Our political system is functioning as designed fairly well right now. </p>

<p>If something is different this time around, it&#39;s that the establishment accommodation politics have been thrown out the window. And the hinge that is getting unhinged is foreign policy. Like the Brexit issue in Britain, the 2016 race is filled with perennial isolationism vs. globalism resonances. Voters look to Sanders and Trump to drop foreign adventures and take care of domestic concerns.</p>

<p>It is very hard to sell the globalist agenda to the ordinary people of the moderately wealthy west. You can sell half of it to liberals who yearn for an easy environmental fix (carbon tax, population control etc.), and you can sell the other half of it to those conservatives who crave military domination (middle east intervention, geopolitical mastery, immigration control, etc.). But there&#39;s a strange mood building that we are losing our way on both ends anyway, so why not ditch the establishment and try something, anything, else?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see globalism in itself as an interesting conspiracy anymore. The people who run and support it don&#39;t really hide much, except for the manufactured conflicts of political left vs. right, or the more deadly arming of local tribe vs. local tribe.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where the real conspiracy thinking starts for me: Why? What&#39;s driving the desperate need for rapid globalization among a very heterogeneous and competitive global elite? Is it cosmic weather distortions, inexplicable micro-organisms or maladies, unstoppable religious timebombs ticking, or ET contacts offering time-penetrating guidance?</p>

<p>Frank Herbert stuff - Asimov psychohistory - sci-fi 101 - that&#39;s what&#39;s conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theme of Herbert&#39;s is that he took religion seriously as a &quot;carrier&quot; of certain memes over long durations. You may remember several separate distinct instances of this - the Bene Gesserit wisdom lore, training, and eugenics program (gnosticism?) - the messianic Fremen religion (Islam?) - and the brief allusions to the Orange Catholic Bible, supposedly developed after a battle between humanity and intelligent machines (post-Singularity Christianity? - but perhaps that&#39;s a stretch). These were each &quot;conspiracy level&quot; ingredients in the inner plot workings of Dune, and they needed to all collide after millenia of &quot;cook-off time&quot; to produce the result in real-time (the novel&#39;s 10 years) of a God-Emperor.</p>

<p>Recall also how time-space-travel and precognition were treated in  the Spice Guild navigators and the drug-induced trances of the Bene Gesserit rites.</p>

<p>Now put those elements together, take them seriously as real and present possibilities, and imagine yourself in some global control center packed with computers and modern-day soothsayers. There&#39;s a conspiracy story.</p>

But seeing her struggling against Bernie it&#39;s clear this election could go in many directions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carl Rove is no longer in control of the (fake) message or the media (He thought he could manage it from the sidelines in 2012, but he failed). So the republication party has to face the fact that it is an empty shell of rhetoric - which has spun out of control. Enter Trump...  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, manipulation of the voting apparatus (which got Bush &quot;Elected&quot; into office over Gore) has a successful history, so it has attracted tons of dark forces since then. TONS OF DARK FORCES...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing really out of the ordinary IMO. The only major difference is this &quot;anti-establishment&quot; trope in the DNC and RNC--two major establishment parties.</p>

<p>This is the election that everyone&#39;s calling a &quot;shakeup&quot; when really both parties are providing purely controlled opposition. It&#39;s ridiculous. I personally think we&#39;re just getting started and the real &quot;anti establishment&quot; sentiment is yet to come. We just have to wait for whoever gets elected and for them to show that they&#39;re utterly powerless to this massively corrupt system. Then, maybe people will wake up a little bit. Or not. We&#39;ll see. I really can&#39;t predict the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about this election is that it is the dawn of an awakening of the American people. Trump is the embodiment of that. Sanders is too to an extent, but he&#39;s more for Socialism than anything, which isn&#39;t the right move. All this information is coming out about various scandals and bullshit is a distraction from the plan, which is to get Hillary into office. It&#39;s honestly very smart on her part. The Elites back her and create chaos among the other candidates, which fuels drama, which then captures our attention, allowing Hillary to engage in various deals and fraud to steal votes and essentially take the lead in the polls and with the number of delegates. People are starting to become anti-establishment, which is a good thing, considering all the corruption, but we&#39;re at a tipping point. If Trump wins, which could very well happen still, it will signify that people can stand up against the establishment. If Hillary wins, it will mark the beginning of very, very hard times for a lot of people, because she wants to continue to destroy the middle class and end democracy in America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fishy at all. Hillary has this thing in the bag because half of the electorate is fractured (republicans). The mainstream right is going to have to be dragged into modernity if they ever want to govern again, instead of focusing on this doublespeak nonsense like &quot;religious liberty&quot; when it comes to gay marriage, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make assumptions about reality with your call for modernity which are not static as the idea of what modern is might not be what it will be tomorrow.</p>

<p>Your suggestion that gay marriage is a relevant problem of society and an important &quot;moral&quot; impetus for any modern politics to govern might be just wrong.</p>

<p>We all live in some form of bubbles where certain narratives are the theme of the age but all this depends on the context.</p>

<p>We&#39;re at the edge of economical/social changes which will decide over life or death not just of people, states but cultures, aka. the way of life. In the past these breaking points lead to world wars, famines, new political systems and mass movement which wrote a new reality.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the bleak future I see because they&#39;re spinning the wheel out of control at the moment.</p>

<p>When it starts do you seriously think gay marriage or the typical left/right ideology labels to define/divide subgroups in the society will still matter?</p>

<p>P.S. I prefer to live in a liberal society where live&amp;let-live is the agenda but I believe the fat lady is already starting to sing. So don&#39;t misinterpret this reply:-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is running the circus.  Issues are created by the media as means of influenceing the public.  Its the powers who are pushing the media trying to control the elections.  This is nothing new but what is new is people are seeing through this garbage influence and getting angry about it.</p>

<p>A current exsample.... media pushes &#39;Trump has a problem with women&#39;. The message the media wants to really push is IF Trump has a problem with women how can he possibilty beat Hillary?
The medias end goal is to wipe Trump off as a viable candidate.</p>

<p>Looking at Trumps past (before the election ) one will see a whole other attitude where Trump admires strong women.  His first wife had complete control on interior design on Trump real estate.   Etc for many of the woman in his life.  Remember that super models have a lot of control over their working contracts.  But of course the media says different.</p>

<p>That was only an example of media meddling.  I for one am always suspicious of any message from the networks, ads, or entertainment outlets including social media.</p>
