       From my understanding it's a supposed NASA project which uses holograms, and the holograms would be used to fake an alien invasion and form a one world religion or something. That's the short version that probably leaves out a lot of information, but I'd like to know if anyone thinks it has any validity to it.

       The technology is there, the plan is there, why would there not be validity? Operation Northwoods was basically 9/11, some years later. I think it's possible, and wouldn't put it past TPTB.

       The only thing that makes me sceptical about it is that it hasn't been used en masse yet. I've heard of smaller incidents that were claimed to be hoaxes created by holograms, but the "happening" surely hasn't happened yet.

       Okay, in this talk by Cathy O'Brien
       <a href="https://youtu.be/FvEBmEo4IA0">
        https://youtu.be/FvEBmEo4IA0
       </a>
       there is a point where she talks about people saying they were Aliens to induce fear, and make her feel as though she didn't stand a chance.
      </p>
      <p>

        https://youtu.be/-Qa9IU1Z6ic

       . I watched this video and in the second half it talks more about Aliens and how that could happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The memoirs in linked in this article
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/09/idaho-shooting-suspects-hypersexual-martian-manifesto-is-a-window-into-an-unraveling-mind/">
        https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/09/idaho-shooting-suspects-hypersexual-martian-manifesto-is-a-window-into-an-unraveling-mind/
       </a>
       talk about Aliens as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, after reading about it, it sounded similar to electronic possession so I asked
       <a href="/u/curiosity36">
        /u/curiosity36
       </a>
       if he's seen aliens before (we talk a bit, he has a website,
       <a href="https://unitedagainstmindcontrol.wordpress.com/">
        https://unitedagainstmindcontrol.wordpress.com/
       </a>
       ). He told me that he has, and went into a little bit of detail as to what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also heard, although I do not have a source, that if aliens existed the pope would baptize them.  Again, although no source I have heard the powers that be want a one world religion and have picked the Catholic Church.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talked to my sister in law about it, and she told me she was curious if back in the day when people where getting abducted by aliens if it wasn't actually just people wearing masks.  The moment being so terrifying that you must believe that it was aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, mostly speculation, but I do think it's going to be a hoax.  And if the moment comes, and it isn't a hoax, and I still refuse to go with them, I would rather die on this planet then live with creatures that would practice all the atrocities that man kind has faced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I am interesting I'm hearing what information or opinions you have on the matter.  :)

       This reminds me of something similar and, actually, a little funny. When they were first testing propellerless-aircraft (jets) they had the pilot wear a gorilla suit. That way if anyone in a standard airplane at the time saw the experimental craft flying, they'd also report it was being flown by a gorilla and be dismissed as insane. Gray aliens the next step?

       Don't have very much info other than reading a lot of Serge Monast's thoughts on it. I think it's very possible, simply because not many people in the general public think mind control is really a thing. Though I do wonder how microchipping fits into Blue Beam. Maybe just an easier way to manipulate everyone's thoughts?

       Well, if they have a hologram only, when the attacks happen (if attacks happen). There is going to need to be a way for us to feel it.  So they would have to control our internal understanding to match the external understanding.  And perhaps the rare few that have the ability to block psychic attack either electronically or telepathically (i think that's the word I want) would believe by "seeing" and the fear of it would be enough to have them too in awe to know what to question.  Also, I was raised religious, I don't have an exact place to reference this too but my parents always said that in the last days to know if who you were interacting with was real you'd have to shake their hands.   I always thought it was going to be demons, but.... A hologram would probably fit better....?  Haha who knows, mostly speculation with a couple scary things to guess from, you know?

       If a bright enough light was directed at a hologram, wouldn't that break up or diffuse the image enough to tell it's fake . If it is a physical craft,  shouldn't it become more visible ?

       I don't know that much about holograms and the tech, but I think when they had hologram Elvis on American Singer Show they had all the stage lights on it. And as global dimming is becoming a bigger problem, I don't think it would be very difficult to use a hologram.

       I believe its a legit thing to consider when we see an event on television.

       That's something I hadn't considered. Pretty much everything on tv is fake anyway.

       A similar thing happened in Childhood's End, when Karellen appeared as the person most trusted by each individual in their innermost thoughts.

       And isn't that what chem and contrails are being used for, to create a sort of projection screen for this to go down?
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it seems too far-fetched and too large in scope to pull off effectively, but critical thinkers who see through the veil could be marginalized and attacked by the general population (much like those who criticize the official version of 9 11 we were fed have been marginalized for the past 15 years) if it ever does go down as rumored.

       The pollution alone surrounding all major cities is probably enough of a "screen" for such an event .  &amp; yes I've read many times about the possible uses of chemspray

       Yeah. I have also heard it is used to prevent astrological viewing of Planet X or Nebiru, used as a sort of blinder. Probably very multi-faceted in purpose: As a container lid/screen, cover and also just a cheaper avenue for expulsion of materials. Much like the purpose of Project Blue Beam, I don't know what to believe at this point.

       It'll be interesting to see if any of that happens. A terror attack at the Olympics seems very likely.

       i don't know ... so you're telling me they can make a hologram miles big, say, over some city... that will look real and hear/feel whatever ??
      </p>
      <p>
       i dunno man, that's a strech from making a tu pac appear on stage... that is small, stationary and far enough for everybody not see resolution artifacts or something .... stretch this over 5 miles above say LA? not so much
