    <div class="md"><p>In order to remain a leader in the 21st century, the US would have to control the oil resources in the Middle East and prevent Russia or China from taking control using either force or diplomacy.</p>

<p>To do this, a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; type event would be needed to rally the citizens and get their support for invading the ME. </p>

<p>Since there were significant investigations ongoing, the plan would need to include several targets. WTC 7 was chosen because of the SEC investigations into Enron, World Bank and dozens more. This was why Rudy never went to his newly remodeled command center during the crisis but remained walking around on the street with a photo op hankie over his face. </p>

<p>WTC 7 was also chosen due to the black Eagle Trust coming due on September 12th. </p>

<p>The Pentagon&#39;s accounting offices were hit, where auditors were busy trying to track Rummy&#39;s missing trillions he reported the day before, a story that got lost in the frenzy.  A meeting was also called by a senior pentagon official that had almost all of the operation Able Danger investigators present. The general who had called the meeting for 9am on 9-11 in that section never showed up to the meeting. The others were killed.</p>

<p>Also of note, the FBI&#39;s main bin Laden investigator John P. O&#39;Neil was pushed out of the FBI in 2001 and took a job as... head of security. his first (and last ) day on the job was 9-11.    </p>

<p>The towers were demolished for show, for shock &amp; awe, and because they were old, outdated and in bad need of asbestos repair costing millions. Silverstein leased the tired old buildings a few months before and ALREADY had plans for a new WTC 7 in his hands before the old one ever came down.</p>

<p>Had the attacks not occurred, Larrywould have been on the hook for costly repairs with dwindling rentals his plan was to take down the towers and build a new tower. Taxpayers paid for the demolition, also saving him millions.</p>

<p>Buildings were rigged, possibly a new thermite, possibly nuclear.... all was needed was a few patsies to board remote control planes, remotely fly them either with or without passengers... many of the passengers were Ratheon engineers who worked specifically on remote controlled airplane technology. </p>

<p>NORAD stands down to to multiple &quot;drills&quot; (Cheney was in charge of drills, first time ever a VP was) NORAD changes their story three times, ordered not to discuss it, records were destroyed, all because this was real and not fake.</p>

<p>Rescue workers were told it was clean to breathe.... oops. </p>

<p>Fairly simple, really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Federal Reserve owners, the families had gotten frightened by growing populations and no longer wanted to leave governing to governments. Due to paranoia they can only approve one form of government; oppressive tyranny, a police state. The Patriot Act was written before 911 and was ready when the Neocons infiltrated the DOD, and finished taking control of the US Government, and executed 911. This is post-coup America. Once the full complement of control mechanisms are in place: the only answers you will get is BOOT TO THE FACE!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s far more reasonable to assume you&#39;re both right. I&#39;ll elaborate. Yes planes hit the towers, but in my research they were smaller remote controlled military planes painted to look like airliners(smaller, not small.) so to a bystander it would look like a commercial jet flew into the building. The news footage is faked, you&#39;re correct. But it was only to superimpose an image of a larger plane over the plane that actually flew into the tower. Boom</p>

<p>how can the top say..30%?? of the building, weigh enough to crush the bottom 70%, like ok, that 30% could have fallen and just toppled off, but it crushes ALL the material below it? All the other things, like the explosions that were happening below the collapse, could be just the air pressure, but I doubt it, but it&#39;s possible, it is weird that it seems to be the same windows that are being blown out as it goes down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That whichever conspiracy group secretly planted explosives in the towers, somehow avoiding notice by any of the thousands of people who worked there at any time of day, while at the same time planning to hijack - I mean remotely pilot - I mean project holograms into the sky (which one again?) of 747s and fly them into the towers. They landed the planes at secret airfields and killed the passengers - I mean pumped knockout gas into the cabins so the passengers would be unconscious for the attack - I mean there were never any passengers because there weren&#39;t any planes.</p>

<p>Somehow, using both explosives to demolish the towers and planes to demolish the towers at the same time makes perfect sense, since the conspiracy shows no regard for human life and any which way the towers fell would have been good enough for them.</p>

<p>Somehow, the conspiracy fools the thousands of people in New York and New Jersey who watched it as it happened that it happened the way they scripted it. They provided fake video to the mainstream media to play during the attack, which coincidentally happened to match every independent and amateur recording because the conspiracy is omniscient and omnipotent.</p>

<p>The conspiracy fires a missile at the Pentagon and then scatters wreckage of another 747 in and around the grounds in record time, fast enough that anyone who came onto the scene only saw what they wanted them to see.</p>

<p>Somehow, the conspiracy manages to keep silent, even though hundreds, if not thousands, of people would necessarily have to be involved and none of them have leaked any incriminating evidence in the almost fifteen years since the day.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s obvious and credible that Bush did 9/11 - I mean the Jews did 9/11 - I mean the Trilateral Commission did 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Mossad were functioning as sub-contractors to the CIA for terror investigations. This arrangement was convenient, particularly within the US, where the CIA is not supposed to operate. They (The Mossad) also had agents at the pre-911 Malaysian terror conference. They knew of the planned attacks and encouraged them. They informed the CIA (but probably not of every detail). Both agencies agreed to let it happen, because of Neocon influences - the NWO needed a Pearl Harbor event.</p>

<p>The future hijackers were being followed all the time - that part isn&#39;t even controversial. The were tracked by the NSA through their phones and by Mossad agents masquerading as art students. Everyone in the CIA seems to be saying... &quot;Gee. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t push harder to get them to tell the FBI (Or, say, Richard Clarke),&quot; which is ridiculous on its face. They had Mossad agents (masquerading as movers) recording the 911 events. These agentd were caught by police, and mysteriously released - because the CIA intervened.</p>
