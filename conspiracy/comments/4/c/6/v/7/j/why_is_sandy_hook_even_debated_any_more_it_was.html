       If you truly are convinced, then the debates should be centered on how to transmit your certainty to others, for this is more difficult than one would initially think.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, it's a matter of what level of fake-ness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it a false flag, motive being to instill fear and massage the message that guns are dangerous and we shouldn't have them into the collective psyche (or at least have another incident to bring up in future political discourse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anyone die?  And if they did, was it some sort of satanic human sacrifice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or was Lanza a patzy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or did Lanza even exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Etc.
      </p>

       What are your conclusions regarding the above?

       When I first started reading about sandy hook, it was because I had bored myself to death with 9/11 theories on night shift and needed another conspiracy to read about. I watched some video called "sandy hoaxed" and then "we need to talk about sandy hook" and then the hours just started to fly by while I was looking further and further into it. I can't recall where I became convinced, which is my biggest obstacle in presenting my case to others.

       Interesting.  I'm quite familiar with most if not all of the theory behind false flag, hoax, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a big issue.  Evidence is not (always) proof.  This was a big concept for me to really sink in.  There can be boat loads of evidence that Sandy Hook was a hoax and that no one died, but that doesn't mean it's true.  The documentaries and videos and blog posts usually are biased towards presenting the evidence which bolsters the conspiratorial claim.  That's perfectly fine.  It's similar to a prosecutor intentionally not doing the defense attorneys job.
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me there is a lot of evidence supporting that it was a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I ask you the following question, and I hope you understand my purpose:  What is one piece of evidence that suggests Sandy Hook wasn't a hoax?

       These people on Reddit that always claim they know someone who died; although you asked for evidence and really that is just anecdotes, and could easily be misinformation. That's really the only thing I can think of that bodes well for the official story.

       I'm not even saying it's easy.  But this is always a good exercise to validate a strong belief (meaning if it's entirely hard or impossible to come up with evidence it was real, than that only leaves us with one other possibility)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway,  I remember months back when I was doing serious research on this and I downloaded archives of 'crime scene photos'  There were a ton of redacted "black screen" images (maybe say 20%) out of hundreds upon hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only ones that would have any value to me and my investigative cause were apparently redacted.  Anyway, I got thinking about this and it made little sense to go through the trouble of having, literally, black images amongst neutral pictures of a child's room, broken glass and what could have been an abandoned school.  It came off sketchy to me, that is, it seemed like just another propaganda tool which suggested "Oh yes there was death and blood that the public is legally(?) not sanctioned to see."
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I wouldn't have necessarily wanted to see a dead body (although that would shut me the f**k up for sure,) but some blood tracks/trails in the school would have been just fine to diminish most (not all!) of my skepticism about Sandy Hook.

       Yes, I often entertain these thoughts to myself; I think it is the hallmark of a rational mind. I always ask myself when I find that I am getting really emotional over something whether or not there is enough actual evidence to warrant feeling to strongly about it. There simply is so much information that even if it were not the truth it is enough to warrant suspicion, but the truth is that I have just learned so much that for me looking at all of these specific leads, it is impossible for them not be connected. Sure, I might be wrong about the who's and the why's, but I know for sure it didn't happen the way they said it, and I know the official narrative is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I say this more regarding ones that I traditionally do a ton of research on such as 9/11, specifically I can't make the statements I made above for Sandy Hook as I still need to do more research, but I sure as shit don't trust the official story.

       to speak against my own beliefs on the matter, I'd say that the shear size of the hoax (the number of people involved, corporations that were complicit, like CNN and the NFL) makes it too unrealistic to believe it happened. then there's the fact that nobody has come forward publicly to admit their involvement

       Well, although there might have been a fairly large number complicit, if it was indeed a hoax, it's not as many as most think.  In my opinion, if the area was cordoned off, there need not even be a complicit "clean up crew" for there was nothing to clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most parties would be in the same boat as every other gullible member of the public.  Certainly the media (who prostitutes itself daily for bad, not necessarily true news) and even the NFL whom could have hosted those MK-Ultra'd kids thinking that Sandy Hook was real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then of course there is always a well-played death threat or blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just playing devil's advocate.  Whenever I hear "too many people have to be in on it and why hasn't someone come forward" etc, it seems to me to be a failure of imagination (playing out the scenario in the mind)

       What about those fake swat teams where the guy in the middle is actually Wheeler's father in SWAT gear, but if you think about it like this: Wheeler had to play the officer in SWAT gear in order to keep the amount of co-conspirators to the last amount of people possible; in order to do this they reused certain actors and had to heavily disguise one to do so. That's how I see it anyway.

       This isn't an easy one.  It's a shame we don't have real investigative reporting nowadays or people who are willing to bend the rules (still maintaining a higher moral ground) to get the truth.  Anyway, I fear too much time has past to figure this one out.  Especially since the school was demolished...

       Wow, I had no idea the school and the house were demolished. That makes it pretty obvious, imo

       On another note, any article with a picture of adam needs to have a creepy warning attached. That dude is so creepy looking.

       His face was most likely photo-shopped/morphed to induce that effect in the public, which (mostly) has no clue of the level of photo-shoppery, CGI and audio dubbing that the media, NASA (Space pictures,) and government agencies (the famous Osama Bin Laden audio dub) pulls on us.  The worst part is they think it's noble to do this.  They think their cause is "just."  They are utilizing the concept of the ... NOBLE LIE!  Except they are mostly ignoble lies nowadays. ( My username should have probably been Ignoble_Lie ....)

       We all ought to pay close attention and be ready to scrutinize more.

      <p>
       And just because most of my work in this thread has been on trying to urge others to find reasons why it might not be a hoax (although most of our senses, research, eyewitness, and intution point the other direction,) this particular point is kind of easy to see the other side.   Supposing 26 people really did die in the school, it does give strong motivation to tear the house and school down to simply leave behind the past (although coming to terms with it might be the better approach)

       to directly answer your question, I think it was a hoax that went like this:
president Obama sent attorney general Eric Holder on Nov 27th to speak with Governor Dan Malloy to go over details with him about a drill that would be presented to the public as a real event.
since Connecticut is Corrupticut, Eric Holder knew that he could get their cooperation in deceiving the country. They found a closed school, dressed it up to appear as a functioning school shot the empty place up and told CNN to start rolling the cameras.
except they were really careless in passing this off as a real event, because we now know of all the anomalies surrounding the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: we're told there were two lanza brothers, Ryan (the oldest) and Adam (the shooter). In reality, the shooter never existed. Ryan lanza was named adam when he was born, changed his name to Ryan 3 years before the hoax, and had to pretend that he had a younger brother named adam who had severe mental issues. then the "shooting" happens, and it's adam who did it, except adam only exists on paper by that point.

       Except for the fact that it's 100% inconsistent with EVERY SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION HUMANS HAVE EVER MADE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion was once used to explain many natural phenomena that science had yet to fully understand. But since then, many religious mechanisms have been abandoned for more secular explanations. I cannot think of a single counterexample to this, wherein a scientific mechanism was better explained later on by a religious one. And I don't believe that's a coincidence.

       If you think satanic sacrifice is an impossibility, then you are entitled to that opinion.  I do not share it.

       I don't believe you've done enough research into the occult (past and present) to be entitled to that opinion though.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

       These people on Reddit that always claim they know someone who died; although you asked for evidence and really that is just anecdotes, and could easily be misinformation. That's really the only thing I can think of that bodes well for the official story.

       to speak against my own beliefs on the matter, I'd say that the shear size of the hoax (the number of people involved, corporations that were complicit, like CNN and the NFL) makes it too unrealistic to believe it happened. then there's the fact that nobody has come forward publicly to admit their involvement

       Well, although there might have been a fairly large number complicit, if it was indeed a hoax, it's not as many as most think.  In my opinion, if the area was cordoned off, there need not even be a complicit "clean up crew" for there was nothing to clean up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most parties would be in the same boat as every other gullible member of the public.  Certainly the media (who prostitutes itself daily for bad, not necessarily true news) and even the NFL whom could have hosted those MK-Ultra'd kids thinking that Sandy Hook was real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then of course there is always a well-played death threat or blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just playing devil's advocate.  Whenever I hear "too many people have to be in on it and why hasn't someone come forward" etc, it seems to me to be a failure of imagination (playing out the scenario in the mind)

       His face was most likely photo-shopped/morphed to induce that effect in the public, which (mostly) has no clue of the level of photo-shoppery, CGI and audio dubbing that the media, NASA (Space pictures,) and government agencies (the famous Osama Bin Laden audio dub) pulls on us.  The worst part is they think it's noble to do this.  They think their cause is "just."  They are utilizing the concept of the ... NOBLE LIE!  Except they are mostly ignoble lies nowadays. ( My username should have probably been Ignoble_Lie ....)

       We all ought to pay close attention and be ready to scrutinize more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because most of my work in this thread has been on trying to urge others to find reasons why it might not be a hoax (although most of our senses, research, eyewitness, and intution point the other direction,) this particular point is kind of easy to see the other side.   Supposing 26 people really did die in the school, it does give strong motivation to tear the house and school down to simply leave behind the past (although coming to terms with it might be the better approach)
