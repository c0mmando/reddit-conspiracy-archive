       The reason the elite is attacking Europe (and blaming muslims for the attacks), is because said elite wants to invade Syria and other countries -- to cement the power and wealth of the banksters and the military industrialists running this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is to make Europeans (and other Westerners) so angry at the muslims -- that the common folks here in Europe demand a ground invasion of Syria, Iran and other countries on the hit list of the military industrialist bankster complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next possible date for an Illuminati attack in Europe, is April 4. But I think they'll wait until the 11th. And then hit again on May 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're planning to use dirty bombs against the West. So look out for a depleted uranium attack on a master number date. They're gonna spread radioactive fallout in the middle of big cities, thus making the common man demand a ground invasion of the "rogue nation(s) harboring the terrorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is being used as a wedge to increase the gap and hostilities between the politically correct multiculturalists -- and the angry working class commoners. The point of his candidacy is to instigate an "American Spring", a civil war in America. The Illuminati might fake a Trump assassination, or they might assassinate him for real (or someone else might kill him anyway (a lot of people truly hate him)). Either way, there will be a massive civil war in America this September/October, coinciding with WW3 in the Middle East, a truly immense migrant invasion of Europe -- and the biggest financial crisis in the history of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Western banks will ban cash while simultaneously implementing a negative ten percent interest rate on deposits. Global trade will grind to a halt and supply lines will dry up. People will start hoarding food and household items. Civil war will break out in Europe as the welfare states collapse -- one after the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is when Obama will launch the ICBM's. The mainstream media will show spectacular moving images (CGI) of the missiles rising to the sky. Then giant holographic "mother ships" will appear and unleash swarms of black ops electrogravitic craft being piloted by "Nordic Blonde" GMO humans selectively bred in secret underground NWO facilities. These "angels" will shoot down the ICBM's and be presented to the world as extraterrestrials by the lying mainstream media propaganda apparatus. And they'll impose their New World Order on the world, to great fanfare from the sheeple, the "skeptics" and the paid shills in the West.

       I've been told about an upcoming civil war as well and this was coming from a former freemason. The whole presidential race has successfully created a divide between people and is getting more violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also told me that obama will have a third term following some catastrophic event. The refugees are being scapegoated to further their agenda in the middle-east. Europe and the US are going to have some dark days.

       Haha my thoughts exactly. This guy writes as if he has been given concrete knowledge about events in the future. It's fucking ridiculous. What's worse is the fact that half of this sub takes shit like this seriously, as if it's the word of God, and runs out to make preparations for Armageddon on those dates. And people wonder why well this sub gets ridiculed.

       The Illuminati generally hits the West on "master number" dates. (The 11th, the 22nd or dates such as 4/4, 5/5, 6/6, etc.) It's a kind of signature they're using, probably for occult reasons.

       . Some of what I've written in the opening post, especially in the last paragraph, really comes from him (although I've used my own words, added something and left out a lot of stuff). Perhaps he, in turn, was inspired by the guy you mentioned.

       And you're right, "my" work is in no way original. Although I think a lot of people arrive at these conclusions independently of each other. After all: It doesn't take a genius to see that Trump isn't really "anti establishment", and that he's basically an actor. Any thinking person can see it.

       Interesting this point here:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The point of his candidacy is to instigate an "American Spring", a civil war in America. The Illuminati might fake a Trump assassination, or they might assassinate him for real (or someone else might kill him anyway (a lot of people truly hate him)). Either way, there will be a massive civil war in America this September/October, coinciding with WW3 in the Middle East, a truly immense migrant invasion of Europe -- and the biggest financial crisis in the history of mankind."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been hearing multiple rumors and thoughts about the "New American Republic". Many people seems to agree with your points on this and the entire Lavoy/Bundy thing seems to be the pull to get people together on the anti-federalist side as so far it's been a huge catalyst for the movement.

       The civil war in the Unites States has already begun and it began in 2007 when an unfathomable amount of wealth was transferred out of the hands of the common into the hands of the elite. The elites always are always playing the larger time-frames, whilst the commons focus on their day to day lives. Meaning that events that the commons have already forgotten are still at play with the elites.

       It's a fact that G.H.W. Bush was an insider. He is/was part of "Majestic-12", and even made a public statement related to the issue quite recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       A thing I find interesting is that Vannevar Bush, the genius supposedly heading Majestic-12 back in the day, was publicly opposed to Kennedy's Apollo program, at a time when the general public embraced it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was he so vehemently opposed to a popular manned space program?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect it has everything to do with the fact that Vannevar Bush was very aware of the black ops projects utilizing electrogravitics (the Biefeld-Brown effect). He knew said technology was vastly superior to the ridiculous (and dangerous) chemical rockets used by the Apollo program. But he obviously couldn't spill the beans publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're wondering who Vannevar Bush was (no relation to the more famous Bush presidential dynasty btw), he was the guy who founded military industrial giant Raytheon (inventors of the microwave oven and today the world's largest manufacturer of missiles). He was also the brains behind the Manhattan Project and the inventor of the technology/concept that later became known as hypertext.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend the Vannevar Bush interviews found on YouTube. They're very revealing and interesting, and I've never heard any person talk with more authority than that guy. He sounds like the most confident man you can imagine. And that's understandable, considering the knowledge he had. (And yes, he does hint at that knowledge.) The cigarette smoking man in the X-Files is partially based on him.

       Indeed it does. It's hard to believe, but it's explained quite well (and in great detail) on
       <a href="http://www.redefininggod.com">
        www.redefininggod.com

       . That's my main source of inspiration.

      <p>
       Edit: "Everybody else" might be taking it a few steps too far. But the real leadership of Russia and China are indeed "in on it" according to the hypothesis presented on RedefiningGod. Or to put it in other words: The leaders of China and Russia are being stage managed by NWO puppet masters such as Kissinger.

       I was too vague with my language.  By "everybody else" I meant all the non-obvious actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people think there are off-planet powers that aren't all working in concert with events down here as planned by the Illuminati/Magician class.  If one were to go way out there, this could include mythological, archetypical figures like Zeus, planets like Saturn, Dr. Who, stuff like this.  It really depends on your world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would wonder about the complicity of the off-world actors with this plan, for instance.  If this is something you've thought about.

       My opinion is that this is just stemming from the project for new american century stuff.  The agenda moves forward and that is a takeover of America from within...but why, and by whom?  Speaking of Dick Cheney, he basically promised a nuclear attack on us soil.

       Not really my thing, I was just going from a personal take on it, "hey, I would say to myself" and then from the back of my mind, "remember the guy from that post that gave a date", that's all there was to what I meant, just him being close, and me recalling his date.
The only dates that are accurate are the dates that the bills are Due on.

       Thanks for spreading this information &amp; you also got the Brussels bombing right, which is partially why I read deep into your stuff. According to the link you've posted around (redefinggod), a Bible quote that caught my eye was:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
       </em>
       ”
      </p>
      <p>
       This quote is taken from  Matthew 24:22. Someone mentioned 4/22 being the Paris signing, but I do believe something will also happen on 4/4.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the likelihood of having two separate events within the same month, to somehow coincide with the NWO/globalization? Do you know any significance 4/4 has to them?

       I just know that all master numbers seem to be significant to the Illuminati. I suspect they'll skip the 4/4 date and attack on 4/11 instead, since 4/4 would be too close to the 3/22 Brussels attack. But they could indeed strike on the fourth as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we'll see an increase in the number of attacks in the months leading up to the big war in September. In July and August, I expect to see four or more Illuminati attacks per month -- in the West. There will also be several attacks from other terrorist groups on random dates, around the globe. We've seen a lot of attacks these last few days, and I don't think the Illuminati itself can be directly blamed for all of them.

       Do you think Europe will be attacked more due to the high Muslim/Islamic population in it? There was something that said that they prefer to stay in Europe, despite places like Canada offering to take much more in. I find it greatly concerning that Germany (of all countries) has a million refugees. How has Germany not been attacked with that number of refugees? Do you think a larger bombing/attack is in the making for them due to their past persecution of Jews?

       When the Nordic Blondes appear, reading our minds and also speaking to us in our minds, if the awakened ones are thinking thoughts that show obvious lack of bewilderment for their entrance, do you think they'll kill us?

       Yes, I think Europe will be attacked more, precisely due to the reasons you mentioned. It's not really the refugees doing the attacking, although some refugees might be used as a tool by the Illuminati. The Illuminati basically organizes the attacks and provides the islamists with what they need to pull off the attacks -- without revealing to the islamists that they're being used as patsies. The islamists probably believe, genuinely, that they're only working for Allah and that they're going to Paradise by blowing themselves up and killing infidels. They're convenient tools for the satanic Western elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might kill us, but I wouldn't worry. If the Nordic Blondes do appear, they won't be common, and it's not likely that any of them will actually show up in your area. If you ever do meet one, just try to behave or seem like you're willing to go along with whatever their agenda might be. I think you'll be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they do kill us, the only thing dying are the avatars we're playing as. We're immortal souls playing as avatars in a MMO VR game called Life. It would be a shame to die, but at least you fought for a good cause and reached a very deep level of understanding. That understanding is worth a lot, and will be used to decide what kind of avatar you can play as when you incarnate in this game again. You'll get to play as a powerful avatar, and a lot of other souls will be awake and playing on your team.

       So the Nordic Blondes won't actually appear in unison around the world, at the same time? I didn't read that anywhere, but I assumed they would for obvious purposes of having everyone's attention at the same time. Sort of like cornering a rat. Or causing a mesmerizing effect such as the coming of Christ.

       The law enforcers etc who help fulfill this agenda, what's their reward? I'm not entirely sure what the Rothschilds/Rockefellers/etc get out of it either. What is supposed to happen to them?

       If they appear, I don't think they'll do so in unison. Most people will probably only see them on television or on the internet, so they might as well be CGI instead of "real physical beings". But they'll probably do a public appearance here and there, just to convince (more) people that they really exist. I suspect that the MSM will convince all the sheeple anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea how the law enforcers will be rewarded, or if they'll be rewarded at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to wake people up, is spreading the word. But obviously, this is some far out conspiracy theorizing that might be wrong -- and it sounds so laughably insane that you honestly won't get many people to believe it anyway. I sure as heck know (from experience) that almost no one are willing to believe any of "my" conspiracy theories, including this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to be self sufficient and I'm trying to spend more time with family, nurturing my relationship with them. I'm also learning to grow my own food. (As part of the self sufficiency stuff.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The scenario I described is really only one of roughly five possible scenarios I'm seeing, some of which are a lot worse than this. I wouldn't rule out a nuclear winter scenario similar to the one found in "The Road". That would certainly be in line with the elite agenda outlined on The Georgia Guidestones, after all. The beings I've been in contact with (or perhaps it's just my subconscious) did inform me of a "global disaster", and that sounds pretty bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows. We'll just have to wait and see, and focus on enjoying life and being a good person, caring for our fellow sentient beings. And remember that all of this is nothing more than a very advanced (and amazing) virtual reality multiplayer game simulating Love.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Rothschilds/Rockefellers and the rest of the elite banksters, will simply make more money and gain more power. If Nordic Blondes do appear, those beings will only be tools for the human bankster dynasties. It'll be business as usual for most people, and the world might go on pretty much as before the calamities. Surveillance will be increased, though, and technology will continue advancing at an exponential rate.

       It seems like Reddit itself (such as on C_S_T) has become even more awakened than before. If there is anything that would be consensual in awakening people I think it'd be websites like this one and hallucinogenics. What are some of the other subs that seem to be enlightened like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       ,
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">

       Well, I've sort of alluded to the Summer or Terror in some of my posts here, although I haven't used that specific term. I'm skipping a lot of the details mentioned by Ken on his blog, and my work here is only a very short summary of some of the things he talks about + some "original work" from me. (At least it's "original" in the sense that I arrived at it independently from other people, although lots of other people obviously are aware of the Trump stuff, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The summer of terror is indeed happening, as far as I can tell. But I do, of course, hope I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The awakening might be controlled by the elite itself. They're certainly aware of it, if it's really happening -- seeing as they're monitoring all our electronic and telephonic communication (at the very least (and probably all our brain/spiritual activity as well)). And the elite also has some controlled opposition agents (like Alex Jones) "waking people up" to the "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ken on RedefiningGod also claims there'll be a "Truth Tsunami" coming this fall. It'll supposedly consist of limited hangout revelations, e.g. "the truth about 9/11 and who was really behind it", the truth (or alleged truth) about other false flag attacks, etc. He claims they'll blast all that stuff in the MSM to wake people up. The NWO agents will be the ones exposing all those truths (or half truths), and that'll supposedly make the sheeple embrace their NWO overlords and accept their rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       He explains the concept (and all other concepts) better than I can, though, so I recommend his work for reference. He also provides a lot of links to sources in the MSM and so called alternative media.

       My POV is that whenever something comes out about a "controversial" topic or something considered a "conspiracy" made by conspiracy theorists, the film/shows completely eradicate any sense of critical thinking in the individuals watching it and induce censorship and a forced opinion.
      </p>
      <p>

       Yes, there's a lot of predictive programming in the MSM and in movies, TV series, etc. ("The Lone Gunmen" famously exposed the 9/11 plot on March 4th, 2001, but that's just one example among many.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not aware of other subs dealing with stuff like this, but I used to visit the astral projection sub and the UFO sub. I don't really like the UFO one though (too many shadow government shills and ignorant people for my taste). I just recently became aware of C_S_T, and it seems like a great place.

       Hallucinogens are amazing, at least for me, but I don't think they're everyone's cup of tea. Awakening and/or intelligent people will certainly enjoy them though.

       Interesting find about that pregnancy. I wasn't aware of it. On a sort of related note (perhaps), I kinda think some of Trump's children look like "Nordic Blondes". Ivanka is hot, if nothing else. :p

       Another thing to ponder: David Rockefeller's 101st birthday is coming on June 10th (if my memory serves me right (I won't bother googling it right now)). Perhaps "someone" will "celebrate" it by pulling off a really spectacular "ISIS" attack. Or something along those lines.

       No significance other than the fact it's the 101st birthday of the supposedly most powerful and influential bankster and power broker alive today. But I don't think there's a high likelihood of an attack celebrating him that day. It wouldn't surprise me if there was one, though.

       Good read. I personally think whatever is going to happen will take more time to unfold than a few months. I like the idea of project bluebeam being rolled out as a psyop where they are seen as saving us from ourselves rather than attacking us. It makes a lot more sense. But in your scenario the ICBM thing just comes out of nowhere. I think Russia has to get involved for an ICBM launch. So the whole Ukraine thing had to come into play. Anyway it will be interesting to see what happens. Fasten your seat belts!

       It comes out of nowhere in my post. Perhaps I should've mentioned that Russia obviously will be involved. They're playing the role as number one antagonist of the USA. It's not just the Ukraine thing though; it's the Syria thing.

       I agree with everything accept the Nordic Blondes. They will be generic mix race, looking like the people you see on commercials who can pass for asian, hispanic, black, mediterranean, white or islander. The antigrav pods will be 22 feet in diameter and very unadorned inside tho they will be transparent from the inside and opaque metallic outside, and yes, they will talk in your head and read your thoughts.

       I agree. And you might be right about their physical appearance as well. The reason I guessed they'll be "Nordic Blondes" is that such beings feature in a lot of UFO stories, and the US breakaway civilization probably continued on the work started by nazi eugenicists.
      </p>
      <p>
       UFO researcher Richard Dolan has some interesting stories to tell about people who've seen strikingly beautiful "Nordic Blondes" walk among ordinary people.

      <p>
       But who knows, you might be right.

       Yeah I agree. They actually screwed up the relatively simple Kennedy Assassination from the sound of it. Took a lot of bullets, and his driver still might have had to turn around, and shoot him lol. Coordinating a big fake Alien invasion sounds impossible.

       Haha my thoughts exactly. This guy writes as if he has been given concrete knowledge about events in the future. It's fucking ridiculous. What's worse is the fact that half of this sub takes shit like this seriously, as if it's the word of God, and runs out to make preparations for Armageddon on those dates. And people wonder why well this sub gets ridiculed.
