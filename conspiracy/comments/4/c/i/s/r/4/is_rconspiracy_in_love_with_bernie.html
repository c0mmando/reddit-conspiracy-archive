        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted something critical of Bernie here earlier  (that he has been a proxy dem for basically his entire career) and got down voted. The gist of it is that he made a deal with the DNC to get into congress. He gave them his vote and put the brakes on the 3rd party movement in VT and they never supported a dem to run against him for his whole career. I was surprised that this sub would immediately reject the idea. Here is more info for anyone interested: </p>

<p>This is a 1999 opinion piece by Will Miller of the Vermont Liberty Union Party (his original party) that gives some background on how Bernie built his relationship with the Dems:
<a href="http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363">http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363</a></p>

<p>and here is an election result detail from 1990, showing the unauthorized democrat getting just 6k votes without the DNC&#39;s blessing, where the DNC candidate got 45k votes in 88&#39;:

    <div class="md"><p>I think Bernie Sanders is a better candidate than Hilary Clinton for the Presidency.  I think Donald Trump is a better candidate than Ted Cruz or Mark Rubio for the Republican side.  I like that they are basically funding their own campaigns without the usual corporate donations from the pharmaceutical, banking, prison, media, defense etc industries.</p>

<p>I think Sanders vs. Trump debates would be best for our society and I haven&#39;t given up complete hope in elected candidates since the death of Paul Wellstone, Cynthia McKinney, JFK Jr, JFK, RFK, etc.  If it was hopeless and they didn&#39;t pose a threat and were all controlled, they wouldn&#39;t have to kill them or rig the elections against them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not in love with them or thinking of them as a savior status or symbol, but I think there are some candidates better than other candidates.  If you don&#39;t support the candidates running, do you support any candidates that I am not aware of?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. Also, people are harder pressed to admit they&#39;ve been duped when it directly involves something they have perceived control of - like elections. It&#39;s easy to see 9/11, it&#39;s not a personal assault on one&#39;s ego. The power of the electoral process is that people think they have a hand in it. It would be like finding out that you weren&#39;t the biological father of your children.</p>

His policy appears to be &#39;for the people&#39; while Trump is doing himself no favours and we only have to look at Clinton&#39;s donor-list to see who she truly represents.</p>

<p>It may very well be more of the same smoke and mirrors act from them all, even Bernie, but he appears to be the first legitimate Presidential candidate in a long, long time.</p>
