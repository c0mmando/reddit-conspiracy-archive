       I posted something critical of Bernie here earlier  (that he has been a proxy dem for basically his entire career) and got down voted. The gist of it is that he made a deal with the DNC to get into congress. He gave them his vote and put the brakes on the 3rd party movement in VT and they never supported a dem to run against him for his whole career. I was surprised that this sub would immediately reject the idea. Here is more info for anyone interested:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a 1999 opinion piece by Will Miller of the Vermont Liberty Union Party (his original party) that gives some background on how Bernie built his relationship with the Dems:
       <a href="http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363">
        http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and here is an election result detail from 1990, showing the unauthorized democrat getting just 6k votes without the DNC's blessing, where the DNC candidate got 45k votes in 88':

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and a more recent article on Bernie and the Dems:

       I think Bernie Sanders is a better candidate than Hilary Clinton for the Presidency.  I think Donald Trump is a better candidate than Ted Cruz or Mark Rubio for the Republican side.  I like that they are basically funding their own campaigns without the usual corporate donations from the pharmaceutical, banking, prison, media, defense etc industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Sanders vs. Trump debates would be best for our society and I haven't given up complete hope in elected candidates since the death of Paul Wellstone, Cynthia McKinney, JFK Jr, JFK, RFK, etc.  If it was hopeless and they didn't pose a threat and were all controlled, they wouldn't have to kill them or rig the elections against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not in love with them or thinking of them as a savior status or symbol, but I think there are some candidates better than other candidates.  If you don't support the candidates running, do you support any candidates that I am not aware of?

       Yeah I know, but she had some dirty tricks done to her as well and I know I didn't say that too clear, but I was aware of that.  Ron Paul was also a person I supported when the media and the RNC pulled dirty tricks on him.

       I think it will be Hillary regardless. I don't think Bernie is comparable to those figures you are naming, nor is Trump. I do agree that the real threats get killed. Jill Stein is a decent candidate but not a viable one.

       That's the narrative the media seems to be pushing very hard.  I think is worth testing that hypothesis and challenging the electoral system in our country regardless.  If the media and corporations are pushing Hillary, I'm going to resist that and support an alternative.

       Not really. Kennedy went rogue on his own and what came of it? That was 50 years ago. Bernie has cooperated with the military industrial complex for basically his entire congressional career. He is not an outsider or a threat to the establishment.

       Well said. Also, people are harder pressed to admit they've been duped when it directly involves something they have perceived control of - like elections. It's easy to see 9/11, it's not a personal assault on one's ego. The power of the electoral process is that people think they have a hand in it. It would be like finding out that you weren't the biological father of your children.

       Bernie is the new unelectable just like Ron Paul was.

       Every time they have to outright steal the votes in order to win I am all for it, that way maybe people will wake up and see that everything is rigged.

       The fact that most people here still believe in the legitimacy of government tells you volumes about the current state of this sub.

       Scary. I'm not even offering up conjecture or theory, just info on Bernie's past that is easily corroborated.

       As a foreigner, why wouldn't people be pro / 'in love with' Bernie?
His policy appears to be 'for the people' while Trump is doing himself no favours and we only have to look at Clinton's donor-list to see who she truly represents.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may very well be more of the same smoke and mirrors act from them all, even Bernie, but he appears to be the first legitimate Presidential candidate in a long, long time.

       People of a "conspiracy theorist" bent generally recognize the political process as contrived. Bernie appears to be legitimate, but has been part of the duopoly since the 90's as touched on in my post.
