       It's gotta be the sandy hook conspiracy..9/11 is to painfully obvious, my dad was a New York City homocide detective at the time and he always said it was weird they got rid of the all the twisted steel, I think that's called "tampering with evidence"

       For sandy hook? the documentary "We need to talk about sandy hook" really cemented it for me, it includes police footage and goes in depth about the parents and who they were and how they're connected..even if you still don't believe, you have to admit something bizarre went on.

       Friedrich Paul Berg
      </p>
      <p>
       Today at the former German concentration camp at Dachau, it is no longer claimed that Jews or anyone else were ever killed in the gas chamber there. In the room that is supposedly a gas chamber, one can clearly read a sign written by the museum authorities in five languages which says, "THE GAS CHAMBER disguised as a 'shower room' –- never used as a gas chamber."[1] Although the room was completed in 1942, it was never used for its intended purpose -– presumably, it was used for other purposes; perhaps it was used as a shower room after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the western end of the crematorium building which houses the so-called gas chamber "disguised as a shower room," one can today see and walk through four delousing chambers which were used to fumigate clothing.[2] The only explanation regarding these chambers is a sign above them, also in five languages, which simply says "Fumigation cubicles" in English and Desinfektionskammern in German. There is no mention anywhere within the camp of the important fact that these chambers used Zyklon-B to fumigate clothing as well as other articles placed within the chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "shower room" is not a gas chamber at all, but the so-called "fumigation cubicles" are gas chambers. Moreover, the "fumigation cubicles " are extremely well-designed gas chambers which represented, and may still represent, the state of the art in gas chamber design. They were the product of more than 20 years of research and development into the application of hydrocyanic acid (often referred to simply as cyanide) for the extermination of vermin. This is clearly shown by the extensive German technical literature from the end of World War I through World War II on this subject.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
       The delousing chambers at Dachau were far superior in design to the gas chambers which are still used in this country for the execution of criminals. As a consequence of their design, the operating procedures for the delousing chambers at Dachau were quite simple; for example, although gas masks had to be available, the operators were only required to use them in emergencies or in special situations. By contrast, the American gas chambers for executions still require the use of gas masks during the normal post-execution procedures. Compared to the American gas chambers, the German delousing chambers at Dachau were also safer to operate and far less expensive to construct.[4]
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of this article I have added a translation of one of the many articles that can be found in the German wartime technical and medical literature discussing the proper use of Zyklon-B for the control of typhus through the extermination of its principal carrier, the body louse. (See appendix.) The article by Emil Wustinger is especially important because of the numbers it gives to show the extent to which the Zyklon-B delousing technology was actually used by the Germans to save people from the ravages of typhus. According to Wustinger, 25 million people had already had their clothing and personal belongings fumigated from the start of the war until the beginning of 1944. This number is, interestingly enough, the same as the one which appears in the Gerstein statement as the number of people who had been "killed" in gas chambers.
Zyklon B
Until the introduction of DDT by the Americans and by the Germans in 1944, the delousing of not only clothing but also living quarters, especially barracks, and railroad trains in order to kill body lice was the only effective means of controlling the spread of typhus. Until the arrival of DDT, the most effective pesticide for killing body lice, i.e., for delousing, was Zyklon-B.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Exterminationists claim, as Raul Hilberg did in The Destruction of the European Jews (1961 edition, pp. 565-67) that Zyklon-B was simply the commercial name for prussic acid (hydrocyanic acid is the chemical term generally used for prussic acid), or that it was hydrogen cyanide solidified in pellets which passed "immediately" into the gaseous state upon being dropped into a gas chamber, they merely show that they have no idea as to what their great murder weapon really was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zyklon-B was, and still is, essentially a porous material with liquid hydrocyanic acid absorbed into it with a small amount of chemical stabilizer and warning ingredient added.[7] The absorbent material was generally diatomaceous earth but paper discs were also used, especially in the United States. After the hydrocyanic acid had completely evaporated, the porous material – now completely harmless – could be returned to a Zyklon dealer and refilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed with which hydrocyanic acid evaporates out of the Zyklon granules or paper discs is not instantaneous. Although the hydrocyanic acid does immediately begin to leave the porous material as soon as a can of Zyklon-B is opened, that does not mean it leaves all at once. On the contrary, it still takes about half an hour for most of the cyanide to leave under normal conditions and under normal room temperature, about 68 F. Even more time is needed for all the cyanide to leave the granules.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Dr. Gerhard Peters, who was the managing director of DEGESCH and who from the early 1930's through World War II was probably the most prolific advocate of Zyklon-B:[8]
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . As a general rule, the material is spread out in a layer which is 1/2 to 1 cm thick, after which most of the hydrocyanic acid has already evolved after half an hour.[9]
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the process begins immediately, it is nonetheless a gradual process. It can be speeded up by dispersing the granules in thinner layers or by using smaller granules to begin with or – what is most important in order to understand how the standard delousing chambers worked – by forcing air through the granules and/or by the addition of heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of heat not only to prevent condensation during the venting of a cyanide gas chamber but also during the gassing phase itself is evident from the very title of a German patent which was granted to DEGESCH in 1940. The title of patent no. 700469 which took effect retroactively on July 26, 1934 reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       Method for generating the necessary heat for the vaporization of poisonous substances for gases used for pest control [emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       The text of the patent explains at some length the need for heating in order to accelerate the release of fumigating gases such as hydrocyanic acid. The patent includes a schematic drawing showing the same circulatory equipment arrangement which was probably used in all of the standard DEGESCH gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of heat to the venting process is spelled out in the following text from Peters and Wüstinger.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... As a consequence of the extensive preheating of the fresh air entering at D, the venting of the chamber is completed in 10 to 15 minutes. The carts can then be driven out and the articles of clothing can be immediately returned to their owners who in the meantime have had their bodies deloused.[10]

       Ironic you have yet to say how he discredited himself or what he claims in the video you surely didnt watch that is fradulent because every source I verified supports everything he says. No he does draw conclusions as humans are wont to do, but states clearly when he is speculating vs listing facts. I dare you to watch the video and debunk even a single point made

       The Korherr Report (Himmler's statistician) puts the number of murdered Jews at a little under 2.5 million by early 1943. Deniers can't account for those Jews. It's because they were indeed dead. Add to Korherr's figure the Jews who died after the extermination camps were closed in '43, and you'll get a ROUGH figure of 3 million. It's a Holocaust, no doubt. But not 6 million. - THAT David Cole from his r/conspiracy AMA.

       first rule of historical research the closer to the event the material is published the more accurate it is. Here is the red cross death tolls, many dont know the red cross routinely inspected the german camps just as it did the american camps. Over half the fatalities occured in the last 6 months when the allies blew up german supply trains headed to the camps btw....

       Ok, a link that works. I've seen this document before. You found the worst version of it; I can barely read that one. Either you're trying to trick me or you're ignorant about this document. This list is the number of
       <em>
        German
       </em>
       citizens that were
       <em>

       Mark weber represents the majority opinion, first "david cole" isnt an authority, now mr weber is lacking in your eyes, I suppose YOU are the only authority on the matter. Riddle me this how come Jacob marcus rader the founder of the american jewish historical society wrote the 1956 encyclopedia brittanica entry on ww2 and made NO MENTION of death camps or gas chambers? How do you reconcile the german camp survivors in the video I posted refuting your uninformed non sense?

       You really want to bring witnesses into this? There are thousands of witnesses to the extermination of "undesirable people" at the hands of the Third Reich.
       <em>
        Many
       </em>
       former Nazis have given in depth testimonies affirming these acts.

       and tens of thousands more who say the opposite when steven spielberg filmed the "shoah project" he interviewed(with a team of course) over 20,000 ww2 german camp survivors and only didnt edit out the few hundred who took the "reparations"(ahem bribe, also oddly they never teach the jewish "victims" got huge cash payouts) and ignored the 85% who said the others were full of shit. So go ahead, I encourage you to research it on your own, as I did, sadly your mind is already made up, such is the nature of cognitive dissonance

       ask and ye shall receive... In 1994, Steven Spielberg founded the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, originally called the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to record testimonies in video format of survivors and other witnesses of the Shoah. Between 1994 and 1999, the Foundation conducted nearly 52,000 interviews in 56 countries and in 32 languages.

       there is very little critical thought in the attacks. it's all the recycled anti-truther routine, over and over again. just discredit, discredit, discredit, almost zero pretense of even attempted understanding. that's not real user behavior - that's pr shill behavior.

       humans are not geiger counters.   there are other causes of cancer besides.   don't you think that there was enough toxicity without nukes?   buildings full of asbestos turned to dust, computer parts, plastics, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       so called 'dustification'  which isn't even a real word.  don't you think it's wiser to look at more mundane known causes of this - like regular demolition explosives - the ones that first responders report hearing and seeing?
      </p>
      <p>
       is it possible that thermate reaction accounts for the melting metal, hotspots that persisted for months?    nukes don't do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       the melting rock has been utterly debunked to my satisfaction.  it's the natural shape of the bedrock.

       people aren't suppressing it, they think (and rightly) that the nuke stuff, and judy wood are all disinfo.   if you have some ACTUAL evidence of nukes - like geiger counter readings, or nuclear material - I'd be interested to look again.  for me, thermate and conventional demo explosives satisfy all features of the explosions.

       I have looked into this.  Why did they build the first two world trade centers over those large holes (which are quite different from the bedrock formations one sees in, say Central Park; hill-like raised, roving smooth structures.)  Have you ever actually been to Central park?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I grant you there are similarities, but the glacier sounds like a mighty fine excuse for the holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question remains.  Read the articles about the ice glaciers before you dismiss me and claim I haven't "checked the facts" and that "this is obvious".  The engineers for the new tower felt it was necessary to fill these holes in before building over it.  Wouldn't the engineers pre-1973 come to the same obvious conclusion?  And if they didn't, how does one go about building around such a large hole in the ground?  (The World Trade Centers had extensive basement and underground structure including subways)
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, sometimes the "obvious" answer is used as a ploy, a distraction, no? If you don't think so, why are you here?

       There's no 'pointing it out.'  That is the official explanation.  Being a native new yorker, I found the articles about 'glaciers underneath the WTC foundation before hearing about the nuke theory, and even before I really was old enough to begin my quest towards investigating it all from a conspiratorial leaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I ask you, should you (or I) buy the official explanation?  When, after all, the events of that day are so magnificently strange and unprecedented, regardless of your conspiratorial leaning.

       Possibly. But what I saw was someone attesting that the bedrock does not look unusual. They went further and attested that it looks that way to everyone else, or, to an outside observer looking at the pictures. Then he concluded by suggesting that there was not a need for an explanation as to why the rocks look the way they do, and that the 'nuclear explanation' provides no evidence on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of rebutting, you misdirect by refocusing the discussion:

       He's not. It's a common device used to describe that something is/was evident, to the lay man, the "common man," or "everyone else." But you could have asked that question, then moved back on topic...

       But you didn't.

      <p>
       Of course he hasn't. Does  he read your mind, or have a checklist from you to make sure he doesn't miss a step? Why would you ask such a question?

       It was a rhetorical question, because I pretty much understood he didn't discuss the issue brought forth in the same way I did, so it makes little sense to use the "common man" example, from your perspective and his.

       Now a rhetorical question from you?  Of course I have given my brain plenty of time to think about these issues.  I'll admit I need to learn more about geology before being sure.  But it came off as very odd when I first saw and it remains odd.

      <p>
       No evidence?  The energy from a nuclear explosion can smooth out a rock and logically would (most probably) a semi spherical hole in the ground.  Furthermore, if we were even to take the nuclear conspiracy seriously, it would require channeling the energy upwards, through the core of the building.  It would need to be suppessed in all other directions but vertically upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this pass for evidence?  (Another rhetorical question.)  And no, of course evidence is not proof, but your "no evidence" assertion is ... simply ridiculous, I hope you come to realize this in your own time although I expect you to continue hunkering down with your original argument/ line of thought that this topic requires zero consideration.

       The rock formations in central park aren't 'natural' rock formations, they were put there after the entire site was excavated. The lake - manmade. The reservoir - man made. The entire park - man made.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for you to refer to central park as being some sort of frame of reference for how things were in NY beforehand - you really could not find a worse example!

       That's cool and all, but I wasn't even the one to bring up Central Park.  That was the person I am conversing with, as I attempt to get through to him why a large hole underneath the world trade center 1&amp;2 construction is odd.  What do you think?  Should it have been filled back in 1973?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S: Just because the rock formations are put there doesn't mean they aren't natural persay, just an unnatural location. Regardless, I am focusing on the shape of the structure found underneath the WTC towers (and when I brought up Central Park, the shape of them as well.)  Underneath the towers existed a (pretty symmetric) hole, which is already rather abnormal when compared to most naturally occurring formations.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example compare to this "hole-type" glacier:
       <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4148/5072265957_d6c4423ca3_z.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I say hole, it's more of a natural looking deep sink with notably different arcing, rather than what we see here:

       I don't think it's odd at all. Most buildings like that have huge cavernous basements. I've been watching them erect skyscrapers in LIC and they all start off with massive holes that don't seem to get filled completely. That being said I'm not a construction expert, neither are you, so this is all beyond our knowledge.

       I don't care if you get down voted. I've watched that video a few times and it's some of the most interesting evidence I've seen.

       I've posted it on this sub reddit before and been slammed with down votes but I urge other people reading not to judge the video based on his comment karma.

       The above demonstrates the massive amounts of dust generated by the blasts. Before the collapse, detonations are heard 2-3 seconds before collapse which are used to weaken the structure before the final charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       During 911 these pre collapse charges were detonated over the course of an hour;

       somewhat different, considering the wtc was built on very hard rock (a blend of granite and 'manhattan schist'), not sand or dirt. and it was 'only' 150kT according to Khalazov -- still f'n huge, but not megaton
      </p>
      <p>
       that demolition video is pretty different from what we saw on 9/11. we didn't have all those blasts going off, up and down the tower. the whole thing would have been lighting up, not just 2 or 3 squibs. i agree that it was a controlled demolition (by Controlled Demolition, Inc.), but i disagree that it could have been done conventionally or using only thermite.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw, there were some conventional explosions in each tower (basements and elevator shafts) to clear the 'chimney path' for the primary thermonuclear device. widely reported.

       I've spent the most time in Sandy Hook because alternative news reporters gave plenty more information than you could ever expect. They definately pointed out a lot of things that the main stream media left out. It was very interesting and it really shows an obvious false flag agenda for gun control. There are a lot of other interesting news stories to look at. I would have never seen the details if all of these great independent reporters had not pointed out what was obvious. When something happens, all I have to do is wait a while because I know there are independent investigators that will tell me things that MSNBC or CNN or FOX won't. Most main stream media is false, shut off the TV, it is nothing but propaganda. It's better to weed through all the online information and find the most reliable sources because they are out there. And just because people wear a suit in a TV studio doesn't necessarily make them better. Look for people who can reference what they say because you will spend a lot of time trying to deprogram all the propaganda slaves who can't accept anything out of the pre-programmed poisoned message of the elites, globalists and every power/money hungry snake out there.

       I don't know if it has an official name but I've looked in to ancient advanced civilisations a lot. Like in india where there's a lot of references to people in space suits and flying devices, like today's modern planes. There's also quite a lot of radiation about which they (people who researched this) believe there must have been the equivalent to a nuke went off. This is due to finding walls from very old cities fused together, which could only happen if they were exposed to extreme force and heat rapidly. I'm not a believer just yet, but it's a very interesting read.

       I looked into Atlantis and there's also apparently a big pyramid with a massive crystal sitting at the bottom of the sea between cuba and USA. Sorry I don't have many details, I read them for fun mostly as there's no real hard evidence to back any of this stuff up. Just geological coincidences. There was a team set to go diving at the pyramid but the US government made the Cuban government withdraw the permit (apparently). Real spooky stuff. Would be cool if it were true though.

       Well it's got no place in conspiracy apparently. This kind of interesting stuff gets down voted hard, so you have to keep an eye on the "New" section. They seem to down vote anything that doesn't involve the presidential election or Israel.

       Just because quantum mechanics has a theory on how transistors work does not mean that theory is true, they did not predict anything, all they do is match data.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we conclusively have is experimental effects of solid state physics and that predate quantum mechanics and was being experimented on since we had electricity.

       Bad explanations do not make them true in the absence of proven ones.

      <p>
       All we know is experimental data. To prove it you would need a theory with internal consistency which never happens in Quantum Mechanincs.

       Which is sad, bexause for some reason so many people are willing to just believe science.  Although I am not well versed in science, I have found that (at least main stream science) is based on the 5 senses.  But that diminishes, and dismisses anything mystical.  If my understanding is flawed, let me know, but there are so many more interesting aspects to the human experience (such as the soul, vibrations, interacting with paranormal beans, energy work, etc etc.). It's based on what we can experience on the surface level with our body, but not further.  If a person was to dig further it isn't taught in school.  And natural healers are considered to be 'quacks'.  There are absolutely some weirdos in that field, but most wouldn't be willing to kill you like big pharma.  Most wouldn't try to put a stop to your findings/research if it went against the consensus.  Perhaps I misunderstand how the industry works, so if I do, let me know.

       Most likely yes. Slavery generally requires dehumanization, one way to accomplish dehumanization is racism or bigotry of some form.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think racism is exclusively a 'white' phenomena, that's horribly ignorant. I do think 'whites' have used racism more 'successfully' than any other group though, at least in modern times. Most of the 'success' had to do with the timing, more precisely the technology available.

       That's debatable but I'd have to side with you on that.

       However, I feel reparations are the wrong method of rectifying the damage done by 'colonial racism.' (Has a nice ring to it. And I know you did not bring up reparations, I felt it might be a next logical step.)

       I agree reparations are not the way to go. Even though I didn't bring it up, which you admit.

       Actual social equality is what's needed. People can help themselves at that point. A decent first step would be focusing on the disproportionate incarnation of 'minorities.'

       The whole 'for profit prisons' BS needs to be heavily investigated and regulated (I know right...) because it ensures a certain demand, contractually in most cases, upon the government, by a private business. And that demand is people's fucking lives... long tortuous labor in a prison camp. That's all it is, and I agree. That needs to stop, yesterday.

       Racism is a definition-quality-example of a conspiracy.

       I just explained above what I mean when I say that racism is a conspiracy. It's moved beyond theory to fact and practice, but it's still a conspiracy because there is a grand misinformation campaign.

       Many people are not aware of "Americas history with Indigenous North and South Americans, Africans, Mexicans, Arabs, etc... [And] people attempt to deny history or selectively focus peoples attention away from certain particulars of history."

       Maybe our discussion would be more productive if you highlighted some ways racism isn't a conspiracy.

       Up to this point you're following a familiar formula for a "troll", "shill" or "bot" that attempts those things. I hope that's not what you're doing and we can have a reasonable discussion from this point on.

       I’m thinking that reality is pretty much the exact opposite of what you’re claiming, but would like to have a clarification as to what you believe the conspiracy actually is before coming to a final conclusion.

       If I say, “Get fucked,” will you knock that off? Because asking for clarification isn’t anything like what they do. All they care about is their paid-for party line, repeating their talking points even after being proven wrong.

       There is no good part of racism. The idea of races of humans is scientifically fallacious. There is only one race of humans, the human race, homo-sapiens.

       Hateful is one thing. Having an entire process to exterminate another entire group is beyond just hate, it's sinister. Governments and their tycoons used psudo-scientific anthropology to attempt to create and rank 'races,' so that people wouldn't feel guilty about exterminating entire cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is that people don't see racism as a conspiracy while it precisely fits the definition. People have been lead to believe that racial hate is a natural occurrence, a "human characteristic," the fact is that hate is a learned response from ones culture. People must be taught to hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a grand disinformation campaign which now is self perpetuating, that allows people to deny that racism was created.

       I see what you're trying to say, but I don't agree with it to an extent. I agree that people in power use the media to influence public opinion and hence a lot of people are fearful of blacks, muslims, etc -- I can agree with that. But the genocide thing? That it isn't "natural"? I can't agree with that.

       I may be ignorant, but the only genocide I know of where the government itself took part in exterminating a particular race or ethnic group is that of the holocaust (and I know half of us on here don't believe that ever happened, but that's a different conversation). With respect to one group of people not trusting or hating another group of people, that cannot be said to be anything but a natural social construct. I wouldn't say that hating other people is the natural tendency of people, but dislike or hate of them occurs for a cause -- like the Romans calling everyone that wasn't them a barbarian and warring with them constantly as the groups tried to take each other's land. People have different interests and their view of others is heavily influenced by their interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history, people have been absolutely terrible at empathizing with others that are not like themselves in culture or appearance. I'm not sure how this is in any way a conspiracy besides the fact that people have used this human tendency to their advantage over the years, and if that is the "conspiracy", it isn't so much of a conspiracy as a fact of life (which, to you, proves your point that it is in fact a conspiracy so I guess I'm just another one of the sheeple to you).

       The government being directly involved is a legal loop hole to get governments out of modern claims of genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is there are insufficient social policies to combat the damage that racism and colonization has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US's history is rich with genocidal tendencies, if people will allow for a slightly more liberal definition of genocide. One where the government convinces the people to carry out genocide for their own sake, while the government sits back and watches people kill each other and do nothing to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was certainly genocide before colonization, but it was localized with neighbors. Which could be chalked up to competition for resources, just as much as it could be to genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the case with the natives of the north, central, and south Americas. This was the case with African slaves. This was the case with all the broken treaties between the US and Mexico. In modern times the process has been externalized further by using "terrorism" to tweak the genocidal algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear of the unknown is natural. To then go out and destroy the unknown based on artificial information is invented. Dehumanizing others isn't natural. But it's necessary if people don't want to go to war simply over resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       You admit that you see it "besides the fact," but then attempt to mitigate it as a "fact of life." You're selectively choosing facts. Your'e only a sheep if you continue to maintain an admittedly fallacious position.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a secret conspiracy because people do know, it's a secret because people deny the facts and try to mitigate them.

       Yes, I admit it is a fact that racial or cultural differences are used to further a cause. I also see it as a fact of life that people will use whatever angle they can to have the action taken that they desire, whether that be race, religion, socioeconomic standing, etc. That's not selectively choosing facts or stating an inherently contradictory position, that's understanding human nature and the mindset of power-hungry people.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point anything I say won't matter because your last sentence essentially states even though people know about it it's still a conspiracy, and any attempt so show that it's not a conspiracy is worthless because it is denying or mitigating your "facts".
      </p>
      <p>
       We both agree that race is used to influence people's opinions, but your opinion of what makes racism a conspiracy is that humans innately are colorblind and never hateful of anyone different than themselves (or if they are hateful of a group of people it is due to the fact that their government made them that way) is unprovable for either side of the argument.

       As long as you acknowledge race is an artificial construct used to further some cause, I'm perfectly happy with how this discussion went. This seems to be your general position.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really care all that much if you agree that it's a conspiracy, as long as you recognize the activity as sinister.
      </p>
      <p>
       People know the truth about 9/11, but there is a huge misinformation campaign and a social stigma that goes along with denying the official story, especially publicly. It's the exact same misdirection strategy as racism, albeit the tactics are different.
      </p>
      <p>
       People know, but it remains a secret because of the misinformation. This is the nature of almost all global conspiracies, it allows them to hide in plain sight. Some people learn the truth and try to convince others, some are receptive, others are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say people were natural colorblind or hate-less. I said in so many words that it's a big jump from hate to genocide. Genocide is learned. Fear and hate of the unknown is entirely natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need or expect us to all be holding hands singing. We can hate each other as much as we want, as long as we agree to not kill, rape or steal from each other.

       It's really sad that people in this sub pride them selves as being critical thinkers while being racist. As soon as race comes into the equation people loose their minds. Without any real inquiry people just down vote based on assumptions. You all should just understand that every down vote you give some one speaking out against racism is an up vote for TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here will believe all kinds of elaborate hoaxes. But the most wide spread, elaborate hoax that effects about 7 billion out of 8 billion people: "Oh no, that's a bullshit hoax." Probably the same ones that hold misogynistic, homophobic or other bigoted views.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is absolutely logically inconsistent to be a conspiracy theorist and think racism and other bigoted ideological divides aren't conspiracy. How do these people spew all these things about Jewish people, for example, and not see the contradiction at play? It's just baffling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean this to degenerate or insult all participants of this sub, just the racist conspiracy theorists. I don't even want to insult them. I just want all foolish racism to stop in an otherwise ideal forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have to understand that there is no way we're going to overthrow TPTB if we maintain their ideological divides. We must conquer the bigotry among our selves before we can hope to conquer them.

       I've probably studied it more than anyone - not a mainstream theory, but Kurt Cobain faked his death.     The best way to present it to question why people believe he is dead, and to provide the facial overlay of his new identity.

       Dude, Bill Hicks would be rolling in his grave if he thought people actually believed he was Alex Jones. I mean, I'm all for people faking their own death to move onto something else (in fact I believe David Bowie recently did this to go into hiding from the Black Star, but that's just my own little idea), but Bill Hicks was a fucking Legend, worth listening to. Alex Jones is not.

       Friedrich Paul Berg
      </p>
      <p>
       Today at the former German concentration camp at Dachau, it is no longer claimed that Jews or anyone else were ever killed in the gas chamber there. In the room that is supposedly a gas chamber, one can clearly read a sign written by the museum authorities in five languages which says, "THE GAS CHAMBER disguised as a 'shower room' –- never used as a gas chamber."[1] Although the room was completed in 1942, it was never used for its intended purpose -– presumably, it was used for other purposes; perhaps it was used as a shower room after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the western end of the crematorium building which houses the so-called gas chamber "disguised as a shower room," one can today see and walk through four delousing chambers which were used to fumigate clothing.[2] The only explanation regarding these chambers is a sign above them, also in five languages, which simply says "Fumigation cubicles" in English and Desinfektionskammern in German. There is no mention anywhere within the camp of the important fact that these chambers used Zyklon-B to fumigate clothing as well as other articles placed within the chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "shower room" is not a gas chamber at all, but the so-called "fumigation cubicles" are gas chambers. Moreover, the "fumigation cubicles " are extremely well-designed gas chambers which represented, and may still represent, the state of the art in gas chamber design. They were the product of more than 20 years of research and development into the application of hydrocyanic acid (often referred to simply as cyanide) for the extermination of vermin. This is clearly shown by the extensive German technical literature from the end of World War I through World War II on this subject.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
       The delousing chambers at Dachau were far superior in design to the gas chambers which are still used in this country for the execution of criminals. As a consequence of their design, the operating procedures for the delousing chambers at Dachau were quite simple; for example, although gas masks had to be available, the operators were only required to use them in emergencies or in special situations. By contrast, the American gas chambers for executions still require the use of gas masks during the normal post-execution procedures. Compared to the American gas chambers, the German delousing chambers at Dachau were also safer to operate and far less expensive to construct.[4]
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of this article I have added a translation of one of the many articles that can be found in the German wartime technical and medical literature discussing the proper use of Zyklon-B for the control of typhus through the extermination of its principal carrier, the body louse. (See appendix.) The article by Emil Wustinger is especially important because of the numbers it gives to show the extent to which the Zyklon-B delousing technology was actually used by the Germans to save people from the ravages of typhus. According to Wustinger, 25 million people had already had their clothing and personal belongings fumigated from the start of the war until the beginning of 1944. This number is, interestingly enough, the same as the one which appears in the Gerstein statement as the number of people who had been "killed" in gas chambers.
Zyklon B
Until the introduction of DDT by the Americans and by the Germans in 1944, the delousing of not only clothing but also living quarters, especially barracks, and railroad trains in order to kill body lice was the only effective means of controlling the spread of typhus. Until the arrival of DDT, the most effective pesticide for killing body lice, i.e., for delousing, was Zyklon-B.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Exterminationists claim, as Raul Hilberg did in The Destruction of the European Jews (1961 edition, pp. 565-67) that Zyklon-B was simply the commercial name for prussic acid (hydrocyanic acid is the chemical term generally used for prussic acid), or that it was hydrogen cyanide solidified in pellets which passed "immediately" into the gaseous state upon being dropped into a gas chamber, they merely show that they have no idea as to what their great murder weapon really was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zyklon-B was, and still is, essentially a porous material with liquid hydrocyanic acid absorbed into it with a small amount of chemical stabilizer and warning ingredient added.[7] The absorbent material was generally diatomaceous earth but paper discs were also used, especially in the United States. After the hydrocyanic acid had completely evaporated, the porous material – now completely harmless – could be returned to a Zyklon dealer and refilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed with which hydrocyanic acid evaporates out of the Zyklon granules or paper discs is not instantaneous. Although the hydrocyanic acid does immediately begin to leave the porous material as soon as a can of Zyklon-B is opened, that does not mean it leaves all at once. On the contrary, it still takes about half an hour for most of the cyanide to leave under normal conditions and under normal room temperature, about 68 F. Even more time is needed for all the cyanide to leave the granules.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Dr. Gerhard Peters, who was the managing director of DEGESCH and who from the early 1930's through World War II was probably the most prolific advocate of Zyklon-B:[8]
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . As a general rule, the material is spread out in a layer which is 1/2 to 1 cm thick, after which most of the hydrocyanic acid has already evolved after half an hour.[9]
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the process begins immediately, it is nonetheless a gradual process. It can be speeded up by dispersing the granules in thinner layers or by using smaller granules to begin with or – what is most important in order to understand how the standard delousing chambers worked – by forcing air through the granules and/or by the addition of heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of heat not only to prevent condensation during the venting of a cyanide gas chamber but also during the gassing phase itself is evident from the very title of a German patent which was granted to DEGESCH in 1940. The title of patent no. 700469 which took effect retroactively on July 26, 1934 reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       Method for generating the necessary heat for the vaporization of poisonous substances for gases used for pest control [emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       The text of the patent explains at some length the need for heating in order to accelerate the release of fumigating gases such as hydrocyanic acid. The patent includes a schematic drawing showing the same circulatory equipment arrangement which was probably used in all of the standard DEGESCH gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of heat to the venting process is spelled out in the following text from Peters and Wüstinger.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... As a consequence of the extensive preheating of the fresh air entering at D, the venting of the chamber is completed in 10 to 15 minutes. The carts can then be driven out and the articles of clothing can be immediately returned to their owners who in the meantime have had their bodies deloused.[10]

       and tens of thousands more who say the opposite when steven spielberg filmed the "shoah project" he interviewed(with a team of course) over 20,000 ww2 german camp survivors and only didnt edit out the few hundred who took the "reparations"(ahem bribe, also oddly they never teach the jewish "victims" got huge cash payouts) and ignored the 85% who said the others were full of shit. So go ahead, I encourage you to research it on your own, as I did, sadly your mind is already made up, such is the nature of cognitive dissonance
