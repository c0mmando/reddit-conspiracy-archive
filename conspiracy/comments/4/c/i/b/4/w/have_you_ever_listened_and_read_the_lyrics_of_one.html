<p>Pretty interesting what the Israelis are listening to... </p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadag_Nahash">wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The band&#39;s songs call for peace, tolerance and equality, and include political and social protest.</p>

<p>The lines of the song are all slogans seen on Israeli bumper stickers. The opposing political slogans are juxtaposed to create an angry and ironic portrait of political and religious life in Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No question there is <em>A LOT</em> of brainwashing and indoctrination in Israel perpetrated against the Israeli people. I should know -- I moved here in 2010 and witnessed it first hand sending my kids to public kindergartens and schools. But Hadag Nachash is not a good example of that, and your interpretation of their song was one of those &#39;lost in translation&#39; kind of things. </p>

<p>Notice that in the very song you quote they juxtapose all these nasty slogans with the following words from the chorus, which is repeated many times throughout the song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how much evil is it possible to swallow? 
father have mercy, father have mercy 
my name is Nachman and I stam-stammer 
how much evil is it possible to swallow? 
father have mercy, father have mercy 
blessed be He, that I breathe... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the message here is not even subtle. They are calling this war-mongering, Arab-hating attitude evil, plain and simple. And they are a very popular hip hop band, as you point out. A less popular hip hop band is called System Ali, which is composed of Arab, Jewish, Russian immigrant members who rap in Arab, Hebrew, Russian and English (some of the members are better than others...). They have an even more progressive, critical message, as you can imagine. </p>

<p>Check out this video. At some point one of them starts rapping in English, so you can get a sense of their message:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N94SThV4E90">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N94SThV4E90</a></p>

<p><a href="http://972mag.com/every-song-is-a-fight-for-existence/77720/">Here is an article about them</a> from a critical English-language blog written by Israelis. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khrVB88ZgrY">And here is a hilarious parody of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air opening sequence,</a> where the guy ends up being sent to Beit El (a settlement shoved up the ass of the Palestinians in Ramallah). It has a very critical message about the settlements and other things, though I can&#39;t say it&#39;s especially popular. For English subtitles, press the CC button on the youtube player (note that when he talks about the transvestite, a better translation would be &#39;cum on a transvestite&#39;s back&#39; rather than &#39;piss on a transvestite&#39;s back&#39;). </p>

<p>As in most countries, artists in Israel tend to lean to the left (not all of them, and left should be written as &quot;left&quot; and taken with a grain of salt; the so-called left in Israel tends to be quite center as the political spectrum has shifted to the right over the years as it has in the US; and just as in the US most or all of the popular ones are probably controlled opposition). </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that just as in the US there are people who are very critical of their government, the same is true in Israel. There are many who do not hate Arabs or Palestinians and who genuinely want peace. Unfortunately not nearly enough. And unfortunately those in control of their government have fed them a diet of hysterical divide-and-conquer fear for decades and decades.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no question that the dominant attitude here is just awful. Awful. And I will be the first to admit that. But honestly the same can be said about the US. It&#39;s just easier for Americans to remain blind to the injustices and crimes committed in their name because much of it is done overseas (not that having the largest prison system in the world --by far -- has exactly been outsourced). But the press blackout on these crimes in Israel is about as pervasive as American crimes are in US media, so that most Israelis have about as much of a sense of what goes on in the territories and Gaza as Americans have a sense of what goes on in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s maybe easier for Israelis to swallow it because they&#39;ve been fed a narrative for nearly 100 years that the Palestinians and the Arabs are their enemies and want to kill them. It&#39;s the same fear, hatred and dehumanization that is now being perpetrated on the rest of the world since 9/11, and now reaching a fever pitch with Boston, Paris I&amp;II, San Bernardino, Brussels and whatever is next on the NWO agenda. </p>

<p>Let us not make the mistake of dehumanizing each other. The moment we start pointing fingers at each other is the moment we stop pointing our fingers <em>up</em> at them. If we do that, they win. </p>

<p>Sadly, these days the question is far from rhetorical: How much evil <em>is</em> it possible to swallow? How much evil with they try to cram down our throats? We may soon find out. Lord have mercy on us all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;N.I.G.G.E.R. (The Slave And The Master)&quot;</p>

<p>[Chorus]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don&#39;t acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious, we are the slave and the master
What you lookin for? You the question and the answer</p>

<p>[Verse 1]
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, coolin off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I&#39;m from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level - it&#39;s not unusual
To see photos of dead homie&#39;s funerals
Aluminium foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls die their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigger&#39;s payed, ancestral slaves
Descendant of kings, it&#39;s necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, where tims on every scene</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>[Verse 2]
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigger?
No I&#39;m gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes, take off the bracelets
Savers went broke, smokes, our diesel, need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Bought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses&#39; lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peepin us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreamin of
Between cuttin hard coke with new razors slicin my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringin us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistake, tryna get it like metering</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>[Verse 3 {Over Chorus}]
{My nig&#39;, what up my nig&#39;? Yep!}
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain&#39;t just rappin for fame
I got my old homie hasslin to father askin for chains
Yep, I get it cash up, this paper don&#39;t matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain&#39;t my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They callin it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung&#39;
I&#39;ll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You&#39;ll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let&#39;s keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Sure violent, but not supremacist/racist.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

&quot;Angel Of Death&quot;  </p>

<p>[Lyrics &amp; Music - Hanneman]  </p>

<p>Auschwitz, the meaning of pain<br/>
The way that I want you to die<br/>
Slow death, immense decay<br/>
Showers that cleanse you of your life<br/>
Forced in<br/>
Like cattle<br/>
You run<br/>
Stripped of<br/>
Your life&#39;s worth<br/>
Human mice, for the Angel of Death<br/>
Four hundred thousand more to die<br/>
Angel of Death<br/>
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead<br/>
Sadistic, surgeon of demise<br/>
Sadist of the noblest blood  </p>

<p>Destroying, without mercy<br/>
To benefit the Aryan race  </p>

<p>Surgery, with no anesthesia<br/>
Feel the knife pierce you intensely<br/>
Inferior, no use to mankind<br/>
Strapped down screaming out to die<br/>
Angel of Death<br/>
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead<br/>
Infamous butcher,<br/>
Angel of Death  </p>

<p>Pumped with fluid, inside your brain<br/>
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes<br/>
Burning flesh, drips away<br/>
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil<br/>
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs<br/>
How long can you last<br/>
In this frozen water burial?<br/>
Sewn together, joining heads<br/>
Just a matter of time<br/>
&#39;Til you rip yourselves apart<br/>
Millions laid out in their<br/>
Crowded tombs<br/>
Sickening ways to achieve<br/>
The holocaust<br/>
Seas of blood, bury life<br/>
Smell your death as it burns<br/>
Deep inside of you<br/>
Abacinate, eyes that bleed<br/>
Praying for the end of<br/>
Your wide awake nightmare<br/>
Wings of pain, reach out for you<br/>
His face of death staring down,<br/>
Your blood running cold<br/>
Injecting cells, dying eyes<br/>
Feeding on the screams of<br/>
The mutants he&#39;s creating<br/>
Pathetic harmless victims<br/>
Left to die<br/>
Rancid Angel of Death<br/>
Flying free  </p>

<p>Angel of Death<br/>
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead<br/>
Infamous butcher,<br/>
Angel of Death  </p>

<p>Angel of Death   </p>

<p>Bomb the Boats, Feed the Fish - Forgotten Rebels  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want no foreign pricks to take my job away from me<br/>
My tax dollars paid their ransom, would they do the same for me?<br/>
I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t want them in my home<br/>
I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t want them finding me alone<br/>
They&#39;re commies, sub-human subversives<br/>
They&#39;re commies, human living curses<br/>
They got nowhere to go so let them drown<br/>
I don&#39;t want them around so let them drown<br/>
Let&#39;s bomb the boats and feed the fish<br/>
Gulls peck flesh from rancid stiffs decaying on the deep blue sea<br/>
Bits and pieces here and there, bomb them far from my country<br/>
Do you, do you want them in your home<br/>
Do you, do you want them finding you alone?<br/>
They&#39;re commies, sub-human subversives<br/>
They are commies, human living curses<br/>
They got nowhere to go so let them blow<br/>
They got nowhere to go so let them blow<br/>
I don&#39;t want them around so let them drown<br/>
Let&#39;s bomb the boats and feed the fish. Bomb the boats and feed the fish.<br/>
Bomb the boats and feed the fish. Bomb the boats and feed their fucking flesh to the fish.  </p>

<p>Born into this world of filth
A plague in every city
The real world in not so real
Filled with scum and lying thieves
Threats of pain, claiming lives
When we owe you nothing
Forced to live in fear forever
Still they breed</p>

<p>Always wanting, always taking
What was never yours
Someday you will feel the hate
That you gave to others</p>

<p>Filled with diseases
Still they breed</p>

<p>Hate towards you and your kind
Bad blood flows forever
My life is not complete
Until you&#39;ve killed each others</p>
