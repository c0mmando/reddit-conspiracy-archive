        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About a year and a half ago, Jessica Schneider was handed a flyer by one of her colleagues in the child-advocacy community. It advertised a training session, offered under the auspices of the Illinois Principals Association (I.P.A.), in how to interrogate students. Specifically, teachers and school administrators would be taught an abbreviated version of <em>the Reid Technique</em>, which is used across the country by police officers, private-security personnel, insurance-fraud investigators, and other people for whom getting at the truth is part of the job. Schneider, who is a staff attorney at the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was alarmed. She knew that some psychologists and jurists have characterized the technique as coercive and liable to produce false confessions—especially when used with juveniles, who are highly suggestible. When she expressed her concerns to Brian Schwartz, the I.P.A.’s general counsel, he said that the association had been offering Reid training for many years and found it both popular and benign. To prove it, he invited Schneider to attend a session in January of 2015.</p>

<p>The training was led by Joseph Buckley, the president of John E. Reid and Associates, which is based in Chicago. Like the adult version of the Reid Technique, the school version involves three basic parts: an investigative component, in which you gather evidence; a behavioral analysis, in which you interview a suspect to determine whether he or she is lying; and a nine-step interrogation, a nonviolent but psychologically rigorous process that is designed, according to Reid’s workbook, “to obtain an admission of guilt.” </p>

<p>Most of the I.P.A. session, Schneider told me, focussed on behavioral analysis. Buckley described to trainees how patterns of body language—including slumping, failing to look directly at the interviewer, offering “evasive” responses, and showing generally “guarded” behaviors—could supposedly reveal whether a suspect was lying. (Some of the cues were downright mythological—like, for instance, the idea that individuals look left when recalling the truth and right when trying to fabricate.) Several times during the session, Buckley showed videos of interrogations involving serious crimes, such as murder, theft, and rape. None of the videos portrayed young people being questioned for typical school misbehavior, nor did any of the Reid teaching materials refer to “students” or “kids.” They were always “suspects” or “subjects.&quot;</p>

<p>Laura Nirider, a professor of law at Northwestern University and the project director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, attended the same session as Schneider. She told me that about sixty people were there.<br/>
“Everybody was on the edge of their seat: ‘So this is how we can learn to get the drop on little Billy for writing graffiti on the underside of the lunchroom table,’” she said. One vice-principal told Nirider that the first thing he does when he interrogates students is take away their cell phones, “so they can’t call their mothers.”</p>

<p>. . . Other parties, though, have raised concerns about Reid-style interrogations in schools. By now, it’s well known that the brains of young people are not fully developed, especially in regard to executive function. Young people tend to be impulsive, suggestible, poor at risk assessment, and lacking an appreciation for long-term consequences—characteristics that make them vulnerable to false confession. </p>

<p>For that reason, <em>the International Association of Chiefs of Police warns against using even mildly coercive tactics with children.</em> In its 2012 guide to interviewing juveniles, the association—without specifically naming Reid—decries several of the company’s common practices, including using body language as a clue to deception. Children and teen-agers “may commonly slouch, avoid eye contact, and exhibit similar behaviors,” the guide says. “Officers should not interpret these everyday teenage mannerisms as indicators of deception.”</p>

<p>. . . Things get especially complicated when interrogations take place in school, where students <em>have fewer legal rights than in a police station</em>. School officials do not need a warrant or probable cause to search a student’s locker or backpack, nor are they required to give a Miranda warning prior to an interrogation, no matter how severe the offense. According to Barry Feld, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and a specialist in juvenile law, the power differential between students and administrators has a significant effect. “All these kids are thinking is, ‘How do I get out of here without my parents finding out?’ ” Feld said.</p>

<p>. . . Neither Buckley nor Schwartz agreed to be interviewed for this article. In an e-mail, Schwartz said that the I.P.A. has modified its workshop to take better account of the rights and vulnerabilities of young people, expanding the portion of the training that deals with what he called “non-interrogative interview techniques.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they have fewer legal rights than in a police station. In addition, a new initiative by the NEA includes language that effectively makes teachers and administrators legal co-parents of your children, including the right to order psychological and psychiatric evaluations for your kids, as well as monitoring you to see that you give your kids the psych meds the doctors prescribe them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A child being treated like a terrorist will lock up and become fearful and obedient. It also keeps other children from being nonconformist through fear. It also separates the teacher from the student so that the system can be monitored and exploited properly. We can&#39;t have human interaction outside the system.</p>
