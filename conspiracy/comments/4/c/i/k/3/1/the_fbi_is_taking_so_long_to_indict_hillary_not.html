    <div class="md"><p>Assuming she&#39;s found guilty - which, let&#39;s be honest, she likely would be in a &quot;fair&quot; trial situation - the current AG would likely only press for minimal / slap-on-the-wrist type punishment (similar to what Petraeus got).</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that even with a Presidential Pardon, Hillary&#39;s current campaign would be, without a doubt, completely decimated by a conviction.</p>

<p>Hopefully her campaign would be derailed prior to actual conviction, though we cannot be sure unless it actually happens. American voters are, on the whole, unintelligent and deluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that he&#39;s just genuinely a guy with moral integrity and that&#39;s how he wants to win(clean, like the rest of his political career, without question) - which incidentally is exactly and the only type of guy who should ever be president, but we&#39;ve gone without that type of guy (one with integrity) since they killed JFK.</p>

<p>other examples of this - Bernie is the only candidate ever to offer the police at his events overtime and pays it out to them, he&#39;s the only or one of the only candidates who pays his interns at all (and a good wage no less, like $13-15/hour, which beats the $0 that HRC/Trump&#39;s interns get), he&#39;s the only one who only deals with <em>unionized</em> venues. He seems to genuinely care about doing things the right way, as can be seen from his past from the civil rights days on. This guy needs to be president, we need him to be president and he deserves to be president. Billionheir-boy clinton-campaign-contributor Trump is a HRC shill, and anyone supporting him is casting their vote for HRC, they just don&#39;t know it. He was set up by the family dynasties to separate opposition to the corrupt establishment into two opposing camps - and any of you trump supporters here should be ashamed of having fallen for it. You think a guy like that gives a shit about you? There&#39;s only one candidate who backs his talk with actions and gives a shit about anyone but himself, and that&#39;s Senator Sanders.</p>

<p>also he doesn&#39;t try to get the poor divided and at each other&#39;s throats (immigrants, etc. muslims, blacks, etc. etc.) to divide opposition to the very rich ruling  class, as trump does, because he&#39;s just an obvious shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reasonable assertion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m suspicious of all of them.</p>

<p>Bernie is left squeaky clean. The worst people got on him is <em>socialist</em>. I find this incredibly suspicious. No one is clean in politics. My guess is that if he somehow wins he&#39;ll go back on every promise he made. For all we know &#39;he&#39;s&#39; the alien overlord. But he&#39;ll probably just be slandered to social death or assassinated for a true death.</p>

<p>The others are simple.</p>

<p>Trump is quickly becoming the candidate people love to hate. Unapologetic and racist. He will not get elected. But he may be able to start a race war anyway.</p>

<p>Hillary is undoubtedly corrupt. But it&#39;s the brand Americans expect. She will have no consequences for her actions. She will most likely win.</p>

<p>Just be ready for the epic storm after the election.</p>
