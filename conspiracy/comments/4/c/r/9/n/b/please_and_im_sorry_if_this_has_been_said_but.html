       This is a diverse group of people with MULTIPLE political stances. For some of us, being against Hilary isn't enough, we are also against the philosophies of Marxism(communism, socialism, democratic socialism.) I'm not necessarily right-wing but I can deffiantly say that, education and health care are not a right. So please, stop putting that old globalist (you know the NWO wants open borders right?) in my face. Thank you

       The elections are a sham anyway. They already have a good idea of who will actually be elected. Trump is just there to generate noise. Sanders has stood behind Obama's official line along with Hillary (talking about arming Jordanians).
      </p>
      <p>
       With every single candidate, demolican or repubcrat (we have one party, not two) is for continuing to create/fund ISIL/ISIS, continue US state sponsored terrorism and more war war war. Don't believe Sanders. You can't believe that "I'm against war" shit while he talks about arming our "allies" which are the brown people we chose to like this month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Candidate intentionally say contradictory things. We see it on Colbert/Stewart/Oliver with the clips side by side and it's use to show they don't know what they're saying, but they know. They know very well. It's intentionally. They'll always have a clip to back up whatever side they chose for that day/rally. Selective memory helps people grab onto one and ignore the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Voting in the US doesn't fucking matter. The game is rigged and the points don't matter.

       Two, there appears to be an establishment conspiracy against Bernie Sanders and the will of the people of the United States. It is not about promoting him for POTUS.

       Bernie supporter here. Here's my opinion. I think Trump is a racist psychopath. Hillary is a soulless puppet. Cruz is...I don't know, something. Bernie is an idealist. But, I would rather vote for an idealist than a puppet or psychopath. An idealist can change and adapt, a puppet does what its told, and a psychopath is just that, psycho. But again, just my opinion.

       I agree. Being against illegal immigration does not make someone racist, I think we need stricter immigration. However, his seemingly generalization of all muslims is. I think trump is a joke, honestly. He doesn't have the skills to be an effective politician. And we need to discuss matters like this civilly or else it just turns into a childish yelling match. Not all bernie supporters are like that and not all trump supporters are either. There are extremes of both sides.

       So are you suggesting that his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. is a ploy to discriminate against the Arab race? Or are you conceding that he is not racist?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ban on Muslims would apply to non-Arab Muslims, from Indonesia for example, therefore it is not race based, therefore it is not racist. Right?

       Banning an entire religion from entering a country sounds so close minded and ridiculously medieval. I, personally, don't want what basically amounts to a bigot running a country with enough nukes to eradicate the world several times over and hating one of the largest religions in the world. I just want him to replace all Islam and Muslim with christians and Christianity and see how the people react. In my opinion, he hates muslims and mexicans. If it were up to him, I feel his version of america is an all white, caste system based, women subservient, personal utopia. I just don't find him as a legitimate canidate to run the country. But again, its just my opinion.

       So, I'm just trying to show you that you can't support your assertion that Donald Trump is racist. The media told you to believe it, and you did. You're just doing what everyone does right now: calling him racist - the insult with the maximum level of emotional impact - and then moving the goalposts when asked to substantiate it (well he's obviously bigoted, crazy, etc.). Is it interesting to see how the media can plant a thought in you, and then you freely parrot it, and spread their propaganda to others, entierly of your own volition?

       Seriously. This country has been sold out to the banking cartel since the early 20th century. Regardless of whatever puppet is in the White House, whether it be for war, or whether it be for so-called social issues, the puppet will continue to borrow and endlessly spend and only increase the monumental debt we already have. Bernie can not and will not fix anything. His rhetoric of "income inequality" is dangerous. There is no such thing as equality unless it is in destitution. The transfer of wealth should never be in the hands of any centralized power.

       "Sooner or later the people in this country will realize that government does not give a fuck about you. It doesn't give a fuck about your children, your rights, your welfare or your safety. It's only interested in it's own power and increasing it and expanding it wherever possible." Fuck Hillary. Fuck Trump. Fuck Bernie.

       MArxism(communism, democractic social etc) was invented to get the people to hand their rights to the government and believe they are fighting the powers that be. The leftists want me to pay for your child to get an education, well I'm sorry but your child is your responsibility not mine. Also to say that our system is Free market capitalism is a bold faced lie, we are more socialist than most European countries already. So I don't want more of the same (more government ) I want less taxes and a smaller government. And Not Bernie big government career politician sanders.

       He's clearly anti-establishment, just fact check him, he voted to audit the fed, he calls out elitists...he's the best option. 
We don't need to have this dog eat dog mentality anymore, we've evolved out of Africa, we don't need to make this a competition. It's 2016, there is plenty of money to go around. 
And that border bs is such an ancient ideology. The world is globalizing, you really need to get used to it, you can't separate yourself from isolate yourself anymore. Border, no border, doesn't matter.

       I understand what you are saying but I disagree. I believe that illegal immigration is truly negative, I also value lowering taxes. Under Bernie he'll ask for more money for more bureaucracy, I cannot not support that.

       Putting up a wall won't stop illegal immigration. All it would take is an extremely high penalty for business owners who hire illegal immigrants. Make it so the risk is not worth it. If illegals can't get work it will force them to become citizens.
Taxes are going up regardless, might as well have free college and health care if your'e gunna get taxed out the ass. 
Trump's won't follow through on what he says, and it's not like he'll have complete control, there's still the senate and house.

       Whenever someone flat out dismisses all aspects of socialism, I believe they are either intellectually inferior to me and others who think a hybid is not only good but necessary, or that they are some kind of paid shill, or that they are just an asshole, psychopath with zero capability of relating to other people in the world.

       wow dude you leftists are bafflingly arrogant. Thanks for belittling and exsposing yourself as superior saviors that all fucking commies think they are. I hope you like giving 60% hard earned money to give to a failed welfare system, only to find out that your government is terrible at using your money effectively.  Good luck with trusting the state. God you brown shirts are terrible "if they disagree shame them until they agree." And I'm not either of those things but I can tell you love the smell of your farts.
