<p>It&#39;s an oligarchy. The establishment wants you to think you have a choice, but you don&#39;t. Pick the puppet on the left, or the puppet on the right. With the exception of Bernie Sanders, all the candidates are at the very least millionaires. We have to understand that they will do anything to gain power and maintain their wealth. </p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t stop there. We are brainwashed by the media every day. Only 6 companies (all of which are worth multiple billions of dollars) control 90% of TV programming. We are brainwashed by reality TV(Kardashians, The Voice, ect.), pop music, celebrity drama, and professional sports. This is evident by the fact that a fucking reality TV star is literally about to win the GOP nomination. 
We are being indoctrinated. Sure, sports are fun, but what do they really mean?? Nothing. It&#39;s the same shit every fucking year just to say that a team is &quot;world champions&quot;. Every year the top 10 most watched TV shows are all football games. The establishment knows this, and because of this they spend millions of dollars on advertisements to get you to buy their shit. </p>

<p>Capitalism is so ingrained in our culture that we don&#39;t even notice it anymore. For every 30 minutes of programming, 8 are advertisements. We are slaves to these companies. Most every piece of clothing that we wear has some kind of company name on it. And we HATE cheap clothes. But they&#39;re made in Indonesia paying little Indonesian children pennies a day to make. Matter of fact we hate cheap/poor anything. In this country, we look down on poor people. We think things like, &quot;They are poor because they don&#39;t work hard, so they deserve it.&quot; Meanwhile the 1% are literally bankrupting this country. </p>

<p>And you know why we don&#39;t do anything? Because the rich have all the power, and everybody thinks that they are future millionaires. That&#39;s bullshit. Speaking of which, money is the reason people go to college. Not to become educated, or learn about the world around them, but to make fucking money. And not only do young people have to take on massive debt to attend school, it is what is expected. They are fucking us before we can even do anything about it. </p>

<p>But they don&#39;t want you to think about these things. They want you to be afraid. Be afraid of ISIS, and these &quot;savage&quot; urban black people who &quot;resist arrest&quot;. The police kill more Americans than ISIS. They want you to be afraid of Islam too. But they aren&#39;t 100% wrong there. You should be afraid of Islam and every single other religion. Religion is a tool to control us too. People don&#39;t choose their religion. Your parents choose for you. And If your parents believe in God, it&#39;s because their parents did and so did their parents and so on. </p>

<p>But Let&#39;s assume God is real for a second. So hypothetically, he chose to put you in a country where things aren&#39;t completely fucked, but chose to put all those poor kids in Syria, or Somalia, or wherever, to literally starve to death and murdered every single day? If that&#39;s how God works, then fuck that guy. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s not forget how women are treated in this country too. People criticize Muslim women all the time for choosing to wear a hijab and cover up because they don&#39;t want any man to see them outside of their home. Women in America are expected to be beautiful and sexy, and if they aren&#39;t, they are viewed as less valuable. Whose culture is more oppressive?</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just the way it is right? That&#39;s what they want you to think. The establishment also wants you to think that we can&#39;t do anything about it, But that&#39;s where they&#39;re wrong. We, the citizens of the United States must wake up and do something about all this fuckery before it&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue it&#39;s more pervasive than that. I&#39;d argue you, as well as me, as well as probably most other people who have access to the internet are a part of the problem, in some way. You mentioned Capitalism...the fact that society judges people&#39;s worth by their capacity to consume...well, ask yourself, do you buy things you don&#39;t need? Do you keep up with fashion, trends, culture? Do you have a smartphone, do you drive a car, do you eat processed food, do you spend money on superfluous things? Of course you do. We all do. It&#39;s easy to say, &#39;oh, the problem is people haven&#39;t WOKEN UP!&#39; but it&#39;s harder to take a look at yourself and admit that you buy into it too. It&#39;s almost impossible to exist in this world and not participate (albeit indirectly) in some of the things that are causing the problems we rant about. The real, revolutionary thing would be if everyone could somehow come to prioritize their relationships with other people (even strangers) over objects; if we could develop a new form of capital that was socially-based and not resource/object based. If being connected to your community and family and loved ones was the ultimate form of wealth.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t see it happening anytime soon, because I see screeds like this blaming others instead of people talking about how they&#39;d personally like to change their lifestyles to better fit their own ethics. Which is fine, no judgements, I&#39;m no better. Just realize, if you can&#39;t change it, then it&#39;s kind of a waste of your time to worry about it. Focus on being the best person you can be in your own life...it sounds corny but, &#39;be the change you want to see in the world&#39; is really the best any of us could do. If we all did it, it&#39;d make an enormous difference....if just one of us does it, maybe we can make a difference in our own little worlds, which are ultimately the only worlds that matter.</p>

Citizens united specifically, also corporate personhood, also trade agreements that work against the interest of the avg citizen, also election fraud; also redistricting; also electoral college; also the Bush v Gore supreme court decision that said that election tricks perpetrated by 2 private companies (dnc/rnc) is more important than that which was designed by the constitution and the general will of the american people transmitted into the public sphere through hours upon hours of dialogue between the people AND the government; </p>

<p>No shit. Your point?</p>

<p>a democracy (republic or no) cannot function with a misinformed public.</p>

<p>We are not a democracy. A democratic-Republic cannot survive if the masses are retarded, which you seem to be. Yes, I agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the democratic republic is a sham. theater.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not, we just have retards roaming the land, not knowing history or the difference between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The myth:</strong></p>

<p>In a democratic republic, you vote on who will represent you.  The two things I just said are that people cast a vote and the winner gets to be the &#39;official&#39;.  The official goes to office and work on your behalf for your interests.</p>

<p><strong>The reality</strong></p>

<p>You vote on your officials, but it&#39;s for show (EDIT: it&#39;s still important to vote--even if symbolically).  The people who get elected win by electoral votes.  Electoral votes count more than popular votes (<em>Bush v Gore</em> precedent).  Electoral college is 2 competing private companies (DNC/RNC), they aren&#39;t constitutional like popular vote.  Electors get elected by the DNC / RNC in district and state conventions.  People want to think it&#39;s community folks who show up with a bunch of their friends and get elected by their friends.  That&#39;s does happen, but more often those people are like crisis actors--paid to vote someone forward.  There are no election rules that inhibit this...it&#39;s a backdoor to people like hillary hiring a bunch of voters.  Did you know that&#39;s how electors work?</p>

<p>To further cement the electoral votes, and reduce the appearance of any perceived frauds, TPTB will shape popular elections by fooling with them.  Keeping them from being universalized, making the vote process change every time, using and replacing faulty e voting machines, stealing the vote, adding requirements to the vote (show ID), spreading disinfo about the incapability of secure internet voting, etc.</p>

<p>Officials get hired to do one thing, then immediately they betray their constituency by doing the exact opposite.  They take campaign contributions and other perks they can get away with in order to fulfill the wishes of those industries and companies paying them.  One perk is that if / when they lose a race, they get hired as a board member of the company, which will continue to try to get them back into office.  This is the revolving door of the public/private sphere.</p>

<p>They mislead the public, and spread disinformation to mind-control the public to accept their decisions and to accept the otherwise repugnant motivations and activities of the industries they represent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a republic, it&#39;s a shit show.</p>

<p>Definition: Republic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definition: Democracy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.</p>

<p>They are virtually the exact same thing aside from a slight semantic argument about members</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s neither, it&#39;s a kakistocracy.  It&#39;s not even an oligarchy, because those oligarchs can be blackmailed or destroyed by the eye of sauron (alphabet agencies) if they don&#39;t fulfill the directives of sauron.  </p>

<p>People here have talked about a conspiracy to destroy Chipolte with all their campylobacter, ecoli news by GMO companies...  not commenting on whether I believe it or not, it&#39;s a decent example of this.  If you had a company that went against the pharma / medical / military / agri  industrial complex, they&#39;d do you in and sauron would either let it happen or facilitate it.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind, to a mom and pop or an individual, this (if true) would be bioterrorism and ecoterrorism.  Somehow oligarchs are allowed to perpetrate eco and bioterrorism against a population but when activists do it in a very small and harmless way (strapping themselves to trees), everyone gets upset.  </p>

<p>Compare and contrast the impact of BP oil spill versus chaining yourself to a tree, or setting someones office on fire in the middle of the night.....</p>
