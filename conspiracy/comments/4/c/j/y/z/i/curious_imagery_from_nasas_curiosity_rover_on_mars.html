       This post presumes images from NASA's rovers and orbiting satellites are at Mars as the agency claims. Thus, the images are valid. A factual portrayal of what is on the surface of that planet. There is another argument. That the fact of these images is evidence of fakery. I don’t adhere to that view, so I won’t argue that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Mars images sourced from NASA’s JPL Website.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Blue Sky
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have come to expect an orange sky. Because that’s what most all public rover images show us. But the reason for this is due to a
       <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA16799">
        color wheel filter
       </a>
       placed in front of Curiosity’s main imager.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s no great conspiracy for this. NASA seeks to control the wavelength of light hitting the imager in order to accurately determine light and shadow levels in varying wavelengths. In fact, NASA included a color and image calibration chart on the rover. Much like is used by every filmmaker in existence since the advent of color film. Again, no conspiracy.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Spirit and Opportunity rovers only included a black and white image sensor.
      </p>
      <p>
       But orange is not the color of Mars’ sky. It is actually blue. Here is a photograph of a sunset on Mars which clearly shows a blue sky.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA also released a so-called ‘white balanced’ photo by Curiosity of Mount Sharp. This is a false color image which shows an aquamarine blue sky, which they note “…makes the sky look overly blue.” Yet read that statement carefully. This process might render the color of the sky ‘overly blue’ but that also implies that a true-color image would still render a blue sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=3730">
        http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=3730
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As with all atmospheric color effects, this is due to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering">
        Rayleigh Scattering
       </a>
       of the sun’s light off Mars’ atmosphere. It’s the same effect as is present on Earth. Though, it is a diminished effect as Mars has much less dense atmosphere than Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see the same effect along the edges of Mars in this
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#/media/File:Mars_23_aug_2003_hubble.jpg">
        Hubble Telescope image
       </a>
       of the planet from Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, Mars does have a blue sky. Particularly at sunset, just as on Earth our sunsets are reddish-purple.

       <strong>
        Water on Mars
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Last September, 2015, NASA announced confirmation of water flowing on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars/">
        http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, NASA, being made up of conservative scientists apt to protect their reputations at all costs, doesn’t show more stark evidence of pooled water on the surface. Evidence collected by Curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a Gigapan of stitched together Curiosity images:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/124981/snapshots/459217">
        http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/124981/snapshots/459217
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There appears to be an open pool of water, with a shore, and reflections from rocks showing on its surface. (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/B3gVESv">
        Closeup
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another image with an apparent shoreline and beyond that waves flowing in the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/01172/mcam/1172ML0053090040502442E02_DXXX.jpg">
        http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/01172/mcam/1172ML0053090040502442E02_DXXX.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another image that seems to show an apparent pool of water in the open:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00696/mcam/0696ML0029480000304185E01_DXXX.jpg">
        http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00696/mcam/0696ML0029480000304185E01_DXXX.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is water streaking down in sand:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00712/mcam/0712MR0030300290402561E01_DXXX.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been led to believe that due to low atmospheric pressure, open pools of water are impossible on Mars’ surface. The water would simply evaporate away. Yet if one takes these images at face value, that’s clearly not true. Something is wrong with the model.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Strange Stone Formations
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we’re going to get to some truly weird images.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is this? In the center of the image. From Sol 837, four stones apparently joined with seams following curved grooves (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/v5ZaGJr">
        Closeup
       </a>
       ):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00837/mcam/0837MR0036770220500756E01_DXXX.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The stones would appear to be a segment of something that had once been much larger. One thing it does resemble is part of a megalithic wall, here’s one example from
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_stone#/media/File:Inka_mauern_cuzco.jpg">
        Inka ruins
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Other stones in the area appear to have shapes that might fit together to form coherent structure. (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/ChPd9bS">
        Closeup
       </a>
       ) How do processes of natural wind or water erosion create an object like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another image of joined rocks, this one from Sol 923 (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/s9YoYVz">
        Closeup
       </a>
       ):
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet one more, this time from Sol 978 ([Closeup(

      <p>
       What is one to think of rocks supposedly created by natural forces alone yet joined together with beveled seams and complex curves?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Strange Stone Shapes:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here are two truly strange objects, taken on Sol 1077. One, hexagonal, with an apparent cylinder jutting out its center - as if to join another rock. And the second object in frame, a rock with a curving flat surface, smoothed as if it had been polished. Both are beveled. (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/SC7rEmA">

       and

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is what can only be termed a cube with sharp near 90 degree edges (

      </p>
      <p>
       And another cube, this time with an apparent square hole (

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another shape with a hole in the center (

      <p>
       A stone object that appears to have a sharp axe-like shape with a large perfectly round hole in one side (no closeup needed).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/01027/mcam/1027MR0044910000503829E01_DXXX.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s another image of two strange shapes taken on Sol 725 just filled with WTF
       <a href="http://imgur.com/YsMphso">
        (Closeup 1

       and
       <a href="http://imgur.com/wiKb4S1">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t even know where to begin interpreting these formations. So I’ll simply ask the central question: How does one explain these objects as having been created by blind natural forces? How are such complex curves and flat surfaces and perfectly square or round holes be made by volcanic action or erosion? Has anyone - I mean
       <strong>
        anyone
       </strong>
       -- ever seen any natural formation on Earth that resembles these images?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are worthwhile questions.

       If they were reflections, they would mirror the rocks, as well as show detail in the reflection. Instead, they're just dark spots that don't mirror the shape.

        "The colors come from the fact that the very fine dust is the right size so that blue light penetrates the atmosphere slightly more efficiently," said Mark Lemmon of Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, the Curiosity science-team member who planned the observations. "When the blue light scatters off the dust, it stays closer to the direction of the sun than light of other colors does. The rest of the sky is yellow to orange, as yellow and red light scatter all over the sky instead of being absorbed or staying close to the sun."
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, Martian sunsets make the blue near the sun's part of the sky much more prominent, while normal daylight makes the rusty color of the dust more prominent.

       Without a complex working knowledge of the conditions on mars, or conditions in the past, it would be impossible to accurately find comparisons from earth.  Unless conditions are the same, the results aren't going to be very comparable.  Not sure what to think about the pictures at this time, but I don't think you can go by whether or not you kind find something similar on earth due to the difference in conditions these rocks reside in.  Not to mention we don't know what kind of rocks we are looking at on mars.  Granite would be effected differently than sandstone, for example.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The color of published Viking and Pathfinder images varies greatly in hue, saturation and chromaticity. True color is important for interpretation of physical, chemical, geological and, possibly, biological information about Mars.
       </p>
       <p>
        The weak link in the imaging process for both missions was the reliance on imaging color charts reflecting Martian ambient light. While the reflectivity of the charts is well known, the spectrum of their illumination on Mars is not.  “Calibrated” images are usually reddish, attributed to atmospheric dust, but hues range widely because of the great uncertainty in the illumination spectrum. Solar black body radiation, the same on Mars as on Earth, is minimally modified by the atmosphere of either planet. For red dust to change the spectrum significantly, reflected light must exceed the transmitted light. Were this the case, shadows would be virtually eliminated. Viking images show prominent shadows. Also, Pathfinder’s solar cells, activated by blue light, would have failed under the predominately red spectrum generally attributed to Mars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, no consensus has emerged on the colors of the soil, rocks and sky of Mars. This paper proposes two techniques to eliminate color uncertainty from future images, and also to allow recalibration of past images: 1. Calibration of cameras at night through minimal atmospheric paths using light sources brought from Earth, which, used during the day, would permit calculation of red, green and blue intensities independent of scene illumination; 2. Use of hyperspectral imaging to measure the complete spectrum of each pixel.
       </p>
       <p>
        This paper includes a calibration of a NASA Viking lander image based on its color chart as it appears on Earth.  The more realistic Martian colors become far more interesting, showing blue skies, brownish soil and rocks, both with yellow, olive, and greenish areas.

       I don't recall the exact nature of the liquid, but I believe is not pure h2O like here on earth. But something that periodically freezes, thaws and then evaporates upon exposure to the surface.

       Some of this Mars stuff is really starting to smell fishy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time and time again, I see posts of Mars photos with claims of an object being visible, usually involving a close-up (which you're often urged to view first, as here), while there are far more interesting things elsewhere in the same picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the more interesting examples is the supposed steel spearpoint. The first time I saw the image, my eyes went straight to the spear point and I thought "wow, I can see why you think it looks like a
       <a href="http://www.outfit4events.com/runtime/cache/images/productFull/pon_0503.jpg">
        spear point,
       </a>
       but it still looks more like a rock to me." Then I saw
       <a href="http://s020.radikal.ru/i723/1511/01/a558397e01a0.jpg">
        this.
       </a>
       The spear point wasn't the object in the middle of the picture which immediately jumped out to me as the most obvious candidate in the entire frame, it was that thing in the bottom. Whenever that pic is talked about, it's always about the thing in the bottom rather than the one in the centre.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some royal standouts in this submission, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/124981/snapshots/459217">
        In this image,
       </a>
       we are being directed to look at what is very clearly a shadow on a small slope and being told it is evidence of water. It's not. It's a fucking shadow. Get your eyes checked. Meanwhile, the whole area around this non-reflective puddle is scattered by stones which clearly
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       reflecting sunlight, and some of those reflections
       <em>
        might be
       </em>
       because of dew/frost (though some of the rocks do also look very metallic). If we pan to the left, however, we see the tracks of the rover, some of which appear to be filled in with ice while the ones closest to the rover appear to be in lightly damp sand. If we then continue panning past the rover's tracks, we come to a dirty great big blurred spot that just happens to be covering almost all of an object which looks interesting as fuck. If we go back to our starting point of the reflecting shadow and pan right, we come to what appears to be a lizard poking it's head out from behind an alien gravestone complete with horns and markings. Now, that last one has got to be pareidolia, but once I've pointed it out, can you unsee it? At the very least, that rock is interesting because it is alone, oddly shaped and the markings could even be fossils. Why are we talking about shadows when we have apparently wet rover tracks, an 'alien grave' guarded by a lizard, and a blurred object (metres away from the rover) in the same image? While we're at it, the rover appears to have broken a rock while running over it. Why is the inside of that rock bright blue? It almost looks like an opal. And why does there seem to be a rock that has freshly landed in the damp sand nearby?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the supposed pools of water in the next couple of images are sand formations
       <em>
        caused by
       </em>
       water. They put a great big clumsy mask over one object, but went to all the trouble of meticulously photoshipping out all of the specular highlights from the puddles? The second image may not have any water in it, but the sand is certainly darkened in a way which seems it was very recently wet (or covered in something like algae). The water trickling out of the rocks, though, that's something else. If you look carefully, you can see the tracks of previous melts underneath that one. It hasn't just melted once or twice in one place, the sand has faint scars of similar flows all over it
      </p>
      <p>
       The rocks I think are mostly natural, though there are a few interesting ones. What interests me here is why we're looking at a rock with a square hole in the background without any mention of the other features of the same rock, nor anything about the rock in the middle of the picture which would have been described as carved in other photos. There's a few things like that, but the one that has me baffled is why we're looking at lumps of once-molten metal from an impact instead of what looks like
       <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/01027/mcam/1027MR0044910000503829E01_DXXX.jpg">
        a clawed fucking footprint in the centre of frame.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep seeing stuff like this and it's starting to feel very limted hangoutey. A couple of genuine curiosities in amongst misdirection, sometimes even in the same picture. I'd be very interested to know where discussion of these images is originating.

       But the thing is, I don't think a 'keen eye' is necessary. If you're looking for space crabs on Mars, how can you miss that 'alien grave' and it's lizard guardian? I get why the molten metal is interesting, but that hole is most likely from a bubble, rather than being worked. How can people who spotted a 2-inch Bigfoot fail to see the 'claw print' next to that lump of metal? How the fuck does
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       miss that masked object in the panorama?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say it feels limited hangoutey, I mean I get the feeling that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       (I don't know what) in at least one of these many Martian photos is real and that a whole lot of other things are being used to steer the conversation. It's very likely that the 'real' photo, if there is one, is either very well known and hidden in plain site or is buried under so much noise that it has already faded into obscurity so that the diversionary nonsense is all that remains. It should go without saying but some of these Martian images could
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       have been taken on Earth, too, so even the most convincing evidence could be fake.

       I didn't notice the grave/lizard thing, but that blurred out object to the left is obvious. And the rover tracks are kinda strange, why so white/blue/reflective and almost like dry mud tracks? There is always that question of
       <em>
        what aren't they telling us
       </em>
       which makes these photos interesting. You can speculate all day about a supposed extraterrestrial planet where literally all of our knowledge about it comes from one government agency.

       Because the panorama was not stitched together by NASA and whoever did it made a mistake. The blurred object in this panorama is debunked

       I think the official explanation is that wind and flowing water also had a part to play in shaping current Mars geology. (It is acknowledged by actual science that Mars had rivers and oceans in the distant past.) Then there is the volcanic action and erosion, as well as meteorite-, asteroid- and comet impacts.

       However, I personally believe there have been numerous ET civilizations on Mars in the past, and I believe some of them are there to this day. I also suspect some breakaway human civilizations have bases on Mars, or that they're visiting the planet. These civilizations use electrogravitic craft and zero point energy to move through space and time.

       I don't know much about them. I just suspect they exist. At least one.

       They'd be on any celestial bodies they could reach and build bases on. Not just Mars. But Mars is among the first bodies they'd inhabit, simply because it's relatively "easy" (compared to most other objects in our solar system) to build a base there.

       I usually just lurk this subreddit to get a nice chuckle from some of the loonier stuff (only conspiracy theories I believe are true is jfk being assassinated by the elite and an effort by oligarchs to take over the world). But this is an amazing find actually.
      </p>

       The rocks pictured there could be natural or could be alien made. I have seen volcanic rocks that look similar, as well as rocks in the American southwest that look like that. The biggest issue with something like that is our brains instinctively recognize patterns, and most manmade patterns can be found in nature but because we see them in stuff made by humans oftentimes our first thought is to think it wasn't made by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       The water pool and the blue sky are act
the most interesting things here. That clearly looks like a puddle to me. I hope this post might get some more attention. It could be that NASA has found standing water (possibly bacterial life in it too!) but are not saying anything because they are not 100% certain. NASA has to justify its budget to congress and there are a lot of shills in congress who want nothing more to cut NASA's funding and use that money to fund wars and corporate welfare. Making a claim that they found standing water etc without it being foolproof, then that claim biting them in the ass if it isn't true would bring in a lot of sharks.

       In science things can take years to be proven true. Multiple people have to get the same result and come to the same conclusion.

        "The colors come from the fact that the very fine dust is the right size so that blue light penetrates the atmosphere slightly more efficiently," said Mark Lemmon of Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, the Curiosity science-team member who planned the observations. "When the blue light scatters off the dust, it stays closer to the direction of the sun than light of other colors does. The rest of the sky is yellow to orange, as yellow and red light scatter all over the sky instead of being absorbed or staying close to the sun."
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, Martian sunsets make the blue near the sun's part of the sky much more prominent, while normal daylight makes the rusty color of the dust more prominent.

        The color of published Viking and Pathfinder images varies greatly in hue, saturation and chromaticity. True color is important for interpretation of physical, chemical, geological and, possibly, biological information about Mars.

        The weak link in the imaging process for both missions was the reliance on imaging color charts reflecting Martian ambient light. While the reflectivity of the charts is well known, the spectrum of their illumination on Mars is not.  “Calibrated” images are usually reddish, attributed to atmospheric dust, but hues range widely because of the great uncertainty in the illumination spectrum. Solar black body radiation, the same on Mars as on Earth, is minimally modified by the atmosphere of either planet. For red dust to change the spectrum significantly, reflected light must exceed the transmitted light. Were this the case, shadows would be virtually eliminated. Viking images show prominent shadows. Also, Pathfinder’s solar cells, activated by blue light, would have failed under the predominately red spectrum generally attributed to Mars.

        Accordingly, no consensus has emerged on the colors of the soil, rocks and sky of Mars. This paper proposes two techniques to eliminate color uncertainty from future images, and also to allow recalibration of past images: 1. Calibration of cameras at night through minimal atmospheric paths using light sources brought from Earth, which, used during the day, would permit calculation of red, green and blue intensities independent of scene illumination; 2. Use of hyperspectral imaging to measure the complete spectrum of each pixel.

        This paper includes a calibration of a NASA Viking lander image based on its color chart as it appears on Earth.  The more realistic Martian colors become far more interesting, showing blue skies, brownish soil and rocks, both with yellow, olive, and greenish areas.
