    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This is explosive. This is about a film no one can see, because it exposes lunatics and destroyers in the vaccine industry.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from the Vaxxed producer and director, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/the-vaccine-film-robert-deniro-wont-let-his-audience-see/">after their film was just axed</a> from Robert De Niro’s Tribeca Festival (as reported by Jeremy Gerard, <a href="https://deadline.com/2016/03/robert-de-niro-vaxxed-tribeca-film-festival-statement-1201726799/">see</a>: “‘Vaxxed’ Filmmakers Accuse De Niro, Tribeca Film Fest Of ‘Censorship’ In Wake Of Cancelation,” 3/26/2016):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“’To our dismay, we learned today about the Tribeca Film Festival’s decision to reverse the official selection of Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,’ said Andrew Wakefield and Del Bigtree (the director and producer, respectively). <em>Robert De Niro’s original defense of the film happened Friday after a one-hour conversation between De Niro and Bill Posey</em>, the congressman who has interacted directly and at length with the CDC Whistleblower (William Thompson) and whose team has scrutinized the documents that prove fraud at the CDC. …” (emphasis added)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay. So here is the sequence…</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>De Niro, who has an autistic child, decides to screen Vaxxed at his Tribeca Festival. It’s a film that reveals lies and crimes, and shows there is a causative connection between vaccines and autism.</p></li>
<li><p>Pressure is applied to De Niro, so he meets with Florida Congressman Bill Posey, who lets him know the film is right on target. Posey knows, because he and his team have many pages of documents from CDC researcher, William Thompson, who blew the whistle on vaccine-autism fraud in 2014.</p></li>
<li><p>De Niro decides he’ll not only screen the film, he’ll introduce it himself, live, onstage.</p></li>
<li><p>out of the shadows emerge people who put the screws to De Niro. What do they tell him? His career in film will end? His annual Tribeca Film Festival will go down the toilet? The medical treatment his autistic child is receiving will be cut off? He and family are now “not safe?”</p></li>
<li><p>De Niro backs away and cancels the showing of Vaxxed.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s been taught a lesson. Don’t go up against the medical cartel. Keep your mouth shut. Suffer in silence.</p>

<p>Think about this. You can see a film about US drone strikes killing innocent civilians. You can see a film about criminal surveillance of the entire population. You can see a film about the CIA overthrowing foreign governments. You can see a film about mega-corporations spewing chemicals into towns, where children are born with defects and adults are dying of cancer.</p>

<p>But you can’t see a film that suggests a vaccine could be causing autism.</p>

<p>That’s too hot. That strikes at a secret too big to tell.</p>

<p>That torpedoes a monopoly that must be protected, no matter what. Censored. Blacked out.</p>

<p>To boil down the background: In 2014, long-time respected CDC researcher, William Thompson, made a statement asserting that he and several esteemed colleagues had lied about a key study they authored 10 years earlier.</p>

<p>The study actually revealed a connection between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and the onset of autism in young black boys—but that part of the study was censored.</p>

<p>In fact, Thompson said, he and his colleagues sat in a room at the CDC, brought in a garbage can, and threw out those pages of research. That’s right.</p>

<p>But Thompson kept copies of the pages. Congressman Bill Posey and a few other people have those pages.</p>

<p>Thompson says, through his lawyer, that he will not speak to reporters. He’ll work with Congress, if an investigation is mounted. But there is no indication Congressional hearings will ever be laid on.</p>

<p>Because this story is too big.</p>

<p>This is the subject of the film, Vaxxed. The betrayal of the people by the Centers for Disease Control.</p>

<p>You can bet your bottom dollar that the prospect of Vaxxed being shown at Robert De Niro’s own festival—with him on stage introducing it—raised alarms at the CDC. Loud ones.</p>

<p>There is a very good chance that the CDC reached out to someone, who in turn reached out to De Niro and whispered in his ear and caused the actor to pause for thought.</p>

<p>He paused, and decided to turn around. He decided the risk was too great. He laid down his sword, such as it was, and went dark.</p>

<p>First Amendment? Never heard of it.</p>

<p>We now live in a country where the government decides, when it needs to, how to “protect the population” from “dangerous information.”</p>

<p>In this case, the Hippocratic Oath is turned inside out. It becomes: “First, do harm.”</p>

<p>Vaccines can cause autism? Well, sure, but don’t tell people that. Lie and keep lying, and keep calling it science.</p>

<p>Who cares how many children are destroyed? Protect the medical monopoly. Protect the vaccinators.</p>

<p>Don’t let a film see the light of day.</p>

<p>But it will. One way or another, it will be shown and people will see it and then they will know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh vaccine safety is a science alright, a science on how to fool people. Tobacco science, corporate science, pseudo-science, faith-based science, call it what you want because it&#39;s all the same thing which goes something like this:</p>

<p>Companies pay people to produce desirable results and when they don&#39;t get desirable results they simply throw out the results (and/or the scientist) and keep going.</p>

<p>They actually get to call this shit science believe it or not.</p>

<p>If a person or scientist presents negative findings, they get defamed and called fraud. They might even get an &quot;affair&quot; article written about them on Wikipedia and suffer shame in front of their own peers like Seralini, Pusztai and Wakefield did. Or maybe they are journalists who get punished and labeled quacks/pseudoscience by industry goons for sharing their own investigative work like Vani Hari/Food Babe and Mike Adams/NaturalNews and Zen Honeycutt/Moms Across America and Ena Valikov/Veterinarian. Or they might get threatened like Tyrone Hayes did. Or they might have their career shat on like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy did. Or they might have their presidential campaign shat on like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Or they might have a documentary pulled from their own film festival like Robert DeNiro did. Or RFK Jr. Or Bill Maher. There are numerous shit-piece articles on the internet about these people. All written by butthurt industry goons probably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, while there are plenty of good vaccines out there that have saved countless lives over the past century, there are also plenty of completely unneeded vaccines that are pushed on the public and often mandated for children that harmful. </p>

<p>Vaccines are a huge business, you can go back and look at the shareholder presentations from all the big Pharma companies from ten years ago and see how they told their shareholders that the future profits were in vaccines. </p>

<p>Why? Because by law, pharmaceutical companies cannot be held liable to pay damages for vaccines that have hurt people. More and more and more vaccines have been cranked out and sold and injected into the willing public who not only thinks that they are safe, but thinks that they are necessary. Neither of these things are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree now, I was on Infowars.com last night and found an article where the whooping cough vaccine was in fact linked to autism. truly saddening shit, I don&#39;t trust the government at all but with zero alternatives what can we do? except burn down D.C. and kill any police or soldiers that try to intervene, that won&#39;t happen because people still have McDonalds and cable. I feel like i&#39;m taking crazy pills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/03/27/the-vaccine-film-robert-deniro-wont-let-his-audience-see/">The vaccine film Robert De Niro won’t let his audience see</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robert De Niro, who has a child with autism, was going to personally introduce the film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdCU2DfMBpU">Vaxxed</a>, to the audience at his Tribeca Film Festival in New York.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thewrap.com/robert-de-niro-defends-showing-anti-vaccination-documentary-at-tribeca/">He thought the film was important</a>. It makes a case for a connection between vaccines and autism.</p>

<p>Then, an uproar ensued, pressure was brought to bear, <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/robert-de-niro-pulls-anti-vaccination-documentary-from-tribeca-film-festival/">and De Niro decided to cancel the screening at his festival.</a></p>

<p>Hello, goodbye.</p>

<p>One of the angles used to pressure him? People might agree with the film’s content and decide not vaccinate their children, or they might decide to space the vaccines out over a longer period of time. This horrible act might endanger lives. It might kill children.</p>

<p>Therefore, don’t let people see the film. Don’t let them be contaminated. Don’t let them make up their own minds. Don’t let them have access to information. You see, the parents themselves are children wandering in the wilderness, with no ability to analyze information. They must defer to the experts. They mustn’t listen to other voices. They mustn’t be permitted to think.</p>

<p>Free speech? Never, ever heard of it.</p>

<p>You see, this is Science. Only certain people know what science says or means. They are the chosen few in the palace. They decide for the rest of us. They are the little gods and the censors.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m sick and tired of this bullshit.</p>

<p>On big screens all over the country, you can put up movies depicting people being torn limb from limb, drowning in their own blood, you can put up movies with panting soft-porn money shots, you can put up movies that blow up half the world; but you can’t show a movie that questions the effects of vaccines.</p>

<p>That’s show biz, where the stars are co-opted on a daily basis, and if they move off the dime, they’re attacked in the press.</p>

<p>But so what?</p>

<p>Listen, Robert, you could have shown the film, and you could have laid on a live presentation afterwards, with speakers delivering both sides of the issue right there in the theater. You could have stood up and said you weren’t going to be bulldozed. You could have said Film itself is based on the sanctity of free speech and there was no way you were going to sacrifice that principle. You could have drawn a line in the sand. You could have parlayed your reputation and awards in the industry to make a point. You could have explained who pressured you and why. You could have refused to let the moment pass. You could have broken the back of censorship, and you could have enlisted the aid of a few of your famous friends, right up on stage, to back you up. You could have turned the whole thing around, because after all, you were just preparing to show a film. That’s what you were doing. With enough force behind your words (you know how to do that, don’t you?), you could have exposed the whole insane sham of Don’t Show a Film. </p>

<p>You could have said, “This is not the Censored Tribeca Film Festival. That’s not the name of this event and it never will be.” You could have blown the doors apart. You could have gone live and done in public, for once, what you do on the screen. You could have hit the censors in their snake eyes and put them away. You could have gone on The View and Fallon and Kimmel and Oprah and made your case against the people who want to shut down free speech. And you know you could have scored a victory.</p>

<p>But you didn’t do that. You backed down.</p>

<p>It’s not too late. You can still fire up your courage and your outrage and show the film. It’s your festival. You’re the boss.</p>

<p>Do you realize the size of the rock you’re standing on? Do you know what the First Amendment really means?</p>

<p>So what if you’re shy in public. So what if you need a script?</p>

<p>I’ll give you a script. I’ll give you one. It’ll melt the spines of those arrogant cowards who want the public to obey and keep their mouths shut and submit to wall-to-wall surveillance and march all the way to their graves without a whimper in the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>

<p>For fear of poking a hornet&#39;s nest... This is true though. You can&#39;t just waltz into an academic discussion and disagree with the majority consensus before you have taken the time to actually study the topic in question. When it comes to vaccines and autism we have to start with the giant frickin&#39; elephant in the room that no one has the first clue as to what autism actually is. I personally don&#39;t think there&#39;s a connection between vaccination and autism but I do think that a lot of the concerns stem from the general lack of scientific understanding of autism leading to an inability to properly discredit these claims. </p>

<p>That&#39;s one way to look at it. </p>

<p>The other is to consider that having a minimal level of competence in data analysis and experimental design is important in interpreting experimental results.  Just as its nice if your accountant reads at least a few books on physiology before performing your appendectomy.  </p>

<p>The vaccination debate isn&#39;t considered settled by 99.9% of scientists because they&#39;re shills.  They consider it closed because the so-called science supporting the antivax position is riddled with bad experimental design, misapplication of statistical methods, and cherry-picked or in some cases, fabricated data. </p>
