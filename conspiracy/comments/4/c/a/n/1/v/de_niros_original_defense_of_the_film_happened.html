        Statement
       </a>
       from the website of the documentary Vaxxed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I find utterly baffling: the very study used by vaccine apologists to foolishly announce that the "science is in" (what a ridiculous statement in itself) has been exposed as a fraud
       <em>
        by the very scientist who participated in the study itself.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you have an individual who
       <em>
        actually was involved
       </em>
       come forward and cry fraud...and yet we
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       can't even have a
       <em>
        discussion
       </em>
       because "the science is in?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an actual member of Congress who agrees that the concerns are warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a documentary that attempts to share this information with the public (waters in which the media dare not tread), and it's immediately universally denounced and subsequently censored, when the vast majority have yet to even
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a new degree of cognitive dissonance that I can barely fathom.

       Good writeup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happened twice on reddit actually, but it was for two different GMO documentaries. I watched as trolls from
       <a href="/r/GMOMyths">
        /r/GMOMyths
       </a>
       shut down an AMA on
       <a href="/r/movies">
        /r/movies
       </a>
       and a Netflix release on
       <a href="/r/JoeRogan">
        /r/JoeRogan
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a look at their brigade on both threads:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/3xkfdp/good_food_bad_food_a_doc_on_netflix/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/3xkfdp/good_food_bad_food_a_doc_on_netflix/
       </a>

        https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3wzgk3/hey_reddit_we_are_zoe_listerjones_life_in_pieces/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       One user even says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are you going to do another pseudo-science movie about how vaccines cause autism next?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You'll find the same users in both threads. Tis a shame reddit admins do nothing about this. More of their trolling can be found
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3n0o8t/vote_manipulation_public_opinion_manipulation/cvpld3z">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was the director of Vaxxed who said it best in an interview:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Who doesn't want us watching this? Is it a corporation?

       Edit: Perhaps the good news is that while they can buy a whole lot of upvotes, there are only a few people who actually comment. Seems to be the same people over and over. My first encounter with the GMO shills was adamwho. He's pretty funny after a while since he's so transparent.

       Just because the MSM says it, doesn't make it inherently false...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-vaxxers piss me off personally because of the harm they do to others and not themselves most of the time, as 99% of these people have had vaccines in the past, and the hypocrisy enrages me even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some vaccines are shown to be unsafe, sure, we should pull them and revise their contents if there are issues, but the crowd who hears about a couple cases and decides that all vaccines cause autism or whatever just serves to have me tune them out.

       Harm, eh? I could fill thousands of pages worth of harm done by the pharmaceutical industry to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. The industry is criminal, and has been found guilty of numerous crimes and has paid out billions, but that's just the cost of doing business. They know that even if they get caught, they'll make billions more.

       So why would it be any different with vaccines? They are shielded from any lawsuits claiming injury, so they have no incentive to ensure safety.

       It's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a couple of cases. Do you think people would seriously have a problem if it were only "a couple of cases"? There are probably hundreds of thousands of cases over the past few decades, but we'll never know for sure. Why? Because there are huge corporate and governmental interests that have a vested interest in not only
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       funding studies on vaccine safety, but suppressing studies that show harm.

       There's no reason, but as you've said before, they've paid out billions in settlements in the past, and are shielded from lawsuits claiming injury, so why would they try so hard to protect the supposed secret about vaccines when they'll make money regardless?

       True, I'm mainly speaking from personal experience, I've talked to a lot of people, and more people than you might think are anti-vaxxers, I've met maybe one that hasn't actually been vaccinated in their life, even after being consciously aware of the decision (I don't honestly expect infants and very small children to understand vaccinations).

       You pasted the wrong link, I read both though, and look, the HPV and DPT (which seems to be the main issue in the study you mentioned) vaccines, should get looked at closer, whenever something like this is discovered, I'm all for further investigation and reevaluation. However, I'm still not necessarily behind some big shadowy group of pharma corps covering up something like this as clearly studies are being done, just not many.

       While possible, this has about as much evidence of my 99% statement earlier, you could claim anything and say that you'll never know because cover ups... I'm okay with further studies into safety, and the numerous NIH links prove that some of these are being done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm okay with the people that want more studies into questioning the safety of any existing medication. I'm just against people that definitely put others at risk by not getting vaccinated and then spreading stuff like the measles (or, on the more severe side, say polio/smallpox/etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the science comes in and says that yes, this this and this in vaccines A B and C are unsafe, I'm all for revising the formulas of these vaccines to be safer. But until there's anything definitive, I'd prefer to not get awful stuff that's preventable with vaccinations.

       I agree with you about the mainstream media. The truth about vaccines tho is that we don't really know. Yes vaccination in theory is a good idea. I think this is where anti-vaxers take a lot of heat because people immediately jump on the label and in their minds think that is what they are saying. The problem is the chemicals in these vaccines, things like preservatives and other chemicals like formaldehyde or aluminum.

       So one of thousands of scientist who have studied this issue flips over and calls the study fraud, and that's the end of the story, eh?
