        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posted this online earlier today explaining some of the news articles I&#39;ve seen recently. I started making connections about these, and if America keeps heading in this direction the future is going to be awfully scary. I got all the source articles from here and I haven&#39;t seen anyone make these connections yet. What do you all think?</p>

<p>If anyone has been following my posts as of lately there&#39;s a lot of controversy going on right now. At first glance they might all seem like isolated incidents but it&#39;s starting to become clear to me there&#39;s a hidden agenda.</p>

<p>First I posted about NSA technology and how it will soon be used on American citizens having nothing to do with terrorism. That&#39;s exactly what Edward Snowden warned about and the government justified it by saying they would only use it to monitor terroristic threats. That all went out the window pretty quickly. But Americans have protection under the 4th amendment and law enforcement requires reasonable suspicion, warrants, etc to search people. So people let it slide, because hey, &quot;you dont have anything to worry about if you aren&#39;t doing anything wrong&quot; right?</p>

<p>Last night I posted an article about a movement in Congress to ban &quot;burner phones&quot; or, to say it with a less negative connotation, cell phones that don&#39;t have your name directly attached to them. This would literally make it impossible to communicate privately. Everything you say through any means of communication will have your name attached to it.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/burner-phones-could-be-made-illegal-under-law-that-would-require-personal-details-of-anyone-buying-a-a6955396.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/burner-phones-could-be-made-illegal-under-law-that-would-require-personal-details-of-anyone-buying-a-a6955396.html</a></p>

<p>Now I&#39;m posting this link. What this bill does is allow companies to send your information to government agencies without any sort of justification. No warrants, probable cause, suspicion, they&#39;re just free to send you in to the feds. This completely bypasses the 4th amendment!</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/worst-anti-privacy-legislation-patriot-act/">http://thefreethoughtproject.com/worst-anti-privacy-legislation-patriot-act/</a></p>

<p>Despite similar bills having been repeatedly shot down by Congress and American citizens, they continuously redraft the bill and attempt to pass it again. This time they hid the bill inside government spending legislation, so basically it&#39;s either passed into law or the government doesn&#39;t have a budget and we have a shutdown.</p>

<p>Ignorance is bliss and its easy to ignore corruption, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t happening. America is on the brink of becoming a surveillance state. How long until the thought police are at our doors?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figure this kind of surveillance is already in place.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve often thought about how bills are written - have you ever tried to read one?  Insane.  That&#39;s why our representatives don&#39;t bother reading them before they vote.  No wonder every President wants the line item veto.  But that&#39;s a double edged sword, because who knows what the President wants to accomplish?  Confusing.</p>

<p>I am also really disappointed in my Congressmen.  I&#39;ve written to them - they don&#39;t EVER vote the way I would.  I vote, but they don&#39;t represent me.  It gets discouraging after a while.</p>
