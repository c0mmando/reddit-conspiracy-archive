I believe that this entire dispute between the FBI and Apple was all for show. The relationship between the two organizations is in good standing, but the general public doesn&#39;t know all that. It&#39;s a mutually beneficial relationship. All Apple has to do is feign standing up for the little guy and the privacy of civilians. This front is good for business, especially when you consider the shitstorm that would result if Apple would have publicly assisted the FBI. </p>

<p>Apple and the FBI want you to think that the iPhone is the ideal device for evil antics.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not be so naive.</p>

<p>Closed source equals bought and paid for back doors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is right, but I&#39;m curious what the FBI got out of publicly claiming that they were able to open the phone?</p>

<p>If I were a criminal hiding shit on my phone, I would have been rooting against both (1) Apple unlocking the phone for the FBI and (2) the FBI finding their own way in. So the fact that the FBI claims to have found their own way in seems to frustrate their purpose, if their purpose is to make us think our iphone data is impenetrable.</p>

<p>So what did they get out of it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My current model of US fascism is best described by the Qwest situation some years ago.  All of the telecoms did exactly what the government asked (the exposed back room NSA closet before there were anti-terrorism laws that probably just allow them to do that) but Qwest dragged its feet a lot and so the CEO was taken down on a scandal.</p>

<p>Additionally, how did all of those yellow dots just get on the printed paper?  They didn&#39;t pass a public law on the matter nor was there ever an ISO or international standard about it.  They do what the fuck they want to and the corps do what they say or important people are taken down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody missed the point on this one, I think.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no question that iPhones can be accessed by the government, the point of this whole thing was to keep the US government&#39;s capabilities to do so out of open court and the media.</p>

<p>Had Apple publicly bent over for them, this would no longer be an issue, for Apple would have created a &quot;public&quot; backdoor for them, <em>public</em> meaning a backdoor that isn&#39;t classified.</p>

<p>However Apple  didn&#39;t play ball and the Internet at large freaked out, so the FBI said fuck it and just did it themselves this time. </p>

<p>A) Apple helped the FBI and pretended not to...</p>

<p>B) The FBI had a method for unlocking the phone the whole time and were trying to hide that fact by making Apple co-operate...</p>

<p>C) Actually cracked the phone without Apple&#39;s help...</p>

<p>D) Did not actually crack the phone, but said that they did be cause they couldn&#39;t win the court case and wanted to save face</p>
