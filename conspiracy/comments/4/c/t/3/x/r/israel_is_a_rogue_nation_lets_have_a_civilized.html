    <div class="md"><p>Right now, rabid defenders are chomping at the bit, but even they know they don&#39;t have a good opening here.  Recent events have shown that over 50% of Israelis think the recent murder of the Palestinian laying on the ground was just and right.  Fuck Israel.</p>

<p>Most of all of course, Israel is directly responsible for 9/11, and our subsequent never-ending war(s) on terror.  When the american people wake up to this fact, it will be time to wipe them off the face of the earth.  They better keep the propaganda pumping at a fever pace to prevent their demise.  With each passing day, you can feel their paranoia increasing... I hope they keep it up. </p>

<p>When I hear the term &quot;greatest ally&quot; it makes me physically ill.  Israel is our ENEMY in every way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go find another democracy in the region that isn&#39;t stuck in the stoneage, doesn&#39;t behead people to make a point, has equal rights for women, allows citizens of any relgious or ethnic background to vote in elections and to run for office, and isn&#39;t run by a succession of billionaire royalty that answers to no one. Find an Arab country that doesn&#39;t proudly promote it&#39;s hope to annhilate its neghbors. Visit Israel some day and enjoy a country where you won&#39;t be killed because you aren&#39;t the right religion, where women aren&#39;t treated like children, where they don&#39;t have to hide their faces and bodies under stifling hot robes, where they are allowed to own property, can drive cars, and don&#39;t have be accompanied by male relatives everywhere they go. Visit a school and see a place where the curriculum isn&#39;t primarily focused on religious indoctrination and where girls are allowed to learn too. There are also women and non-Jews in the Israeli military. Enjoy uncensored Internet access, with wifi spots all over the place, and  count on news in television, radio, and newspapers that isn&#39;t state run or censored and routinely includes criticism of its own government and politicians, without fear of beheading. The crime rate in Israel is low, but if, God forbid, you are raped, the police won&#39;t punish the victim and the victim won&#39;t bring shame her family.bIsrael isn&#39;t perfect by any means (show me a country that is), but it it is a very real democracy that will always have the machinery in place to make itself better. Some rogue country.
  I almost forgot. Israelies are very friendly, the food is terrific and so is the night life. AND you can be openly gay me not have to fear vviolent harassment or getting thrown off of roofs. Great public transportation too!</p>

I said that Israel was as imperfect as any other countries. Of course all countries, including Israel, should be held accountable. What would be a reasonable response from the American military if Mexico was routinely shooting randomly over the border wall with us? And please elaborate when you say worst human rights violator in the world. Could you provide a link or two from respected, unbiased sources? I think North Korea, Cuba, China, Iraq, and a lot of other countries might have something to say about it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a game asshole. What be your strategy for protecting your people from a steady barrage of rocket fire? Israel is the only democracy in the region, allowing citizens of any religion, ethnicity, or gender to vote and hold office. As for the occupied territories, do you know how Israel ended up in those territories? By making a preemptive attack on the Egyptian army amassing at her borders with the very public intention of pushing Israel into the sea. Israel beat the shit out of The Egyptians, and the Jordan, for deciding to join in the fray. Yes, Israel acquired land during the war they were provoked into fighting. Since when are there take backs in war? Why didn&#39;t we give back to Mexico the land they lost to us in war? Don&#39;t start shit with someone and then call fall because they stood up to you and won. &quot;Palestinian&quot; is a misnomer anyway. There&#39;s never been a land called Palestein. Sure, it sucks to be displaced. But that&#39;s what happens when your big brothers start q fight and lose
Palestinians are Syrians and Jordanians. I&#39;ve never understood why those countries haven&#39;t offered to take in their own people after the 1967 war. Israel doesn&#39;t enjoy separating parts of their country, but there are people who are fixated on hurting, killing. And creating chaos for Israel. Demonstrate that you can play nicely and the walls will come down. The Arabs have been really good at passing up opportunities for real peace. But anyway, fuck it. I&#39;m not going to change my thinking and no one is going to change. Just try to be a good person and model compassionate and kindness for others
 Have a good day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. What ISN&#39;T a false flag? How about all the tunnels into Gaza at the Egyptian border. Or the sea craft? Don&#39;t take my word for it. Google Gaza smuggling tunnels and see for yourself. There are many links and they couldn&#39;t possibly all be false flags. You sure know a lot about what&#39;s really going on. It&#39;s never educated, credible people who eat this shit up. It&#39;s the fringe feeling helpless and impotent. Blaming Israel or Jews things is a worn out angle. Why don&#39;t you spice things up and pick another group to blame everything on? Seriously though, you seem to know a lot. Don&#39;t you feel any responsibility to get the word out?

    <div class="md"><p>The award winning British film maker Richard Belfield. Thanks to the audio evidence obtained by Belfield, it is finally possible to prove the survivors of the attack on the USS Liberty were right all along. The survivors have always been extremely confident that Israel’s intentions were to sink that ship and kill everyone on board so Egypt could be blamed for the tragedy. Why? To convince President Lyndon Johnson (and the American public) that we needed to declare war on Egypt. This is the definition of a ‘false flag‘. (can you say 9/11?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11. Ha! Did you read the popular mechanics article that dismantled most of the &quot;theories&quot; one-by-one? If you&#39;re like conspiracy buffoons, you&#39;ll avoid any information that doesn&#39;t fit your screwy narrative. To believe that the U.S. government planned or deliberately allowed the 9/11 attacks, you’d have to posit that President Bush intentionally sacrificed 3,000 Americans. To believe that explosives, not planes, brought down the buildings, you’d have to imagine an operation large enough to plant the devices without anyone getting caught. To insist that the truth remains hidden, you’d have to assume that everyone who has reviewed the attacks and the events leading up to them—the CIA, the Justice Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, scientific organizations, peer-reviewed journals, news organizations, the airlines, and local law enforcement agencies in three states—was incompetent, deceived, or part of the cover-up. Hundreds of people involved and not one had their conscious eat away at them for being part of the biggest, most murderous coverup in the history of our country? That sure is impressive.
Of course the world can be scary sometimes, and big events draw in people who don&#39;t feel in control to connect dots where dots don&#39;t exist. I have no malice towards you. You want a happier, safer world, as we all do. If believing this kind of stuff helps you sleep at night, I shouldn&#39;t be judgmental.
As for the USS Liberty, I have no idea what that was. I&#39;m not up on Mideast history during the Johnson administration. But it obviously got on your tit. I can only say, of course Israel can be as sneaky as any country. All countries have spies, espionage, etc. Countries even spy on their allies. Show me a country that can&#39;t do better. </p>

<p>&quot;The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion (about $26 billion in 2016[1] dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and producing the fissile materials, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.&quot;</p>

The Manhattan Project, as far as I know, screened potential participants before bringing them aboard. The mass murder of innocent civilians wouldn&#39;t have been able to screen all the participants, and would just have to gamble on all participants being ok with the blood of innocents on their hands.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a potemkin &#39;nation&#39; existing as an ideological centerpiece of a bloodline that stands behind the physical nation and the Hebrew peoples, in the shadows.</p>

<p>Also known as khazarians, these people have created the physical Israel as the cornerstone of their push to obtain ancient, historically significant territory throughout the so called Levant region. The location and the &#39;mysteries&#39; in and beneath that land is of great value and significance.</p>

<p>They see themselves as a different, higher class of human, by bloodline, and as such, seek to dominate and control those they see as beneath, or less than them.</p>

<p>This is not referring to the typical Israeli citizen or Jew, but rather, the shadow dwelling bloodlines. The khazarians.</p>

<p>They run an apartheid state, conduct systematic ongoing genocide, and by way of their control apparatus, control education, media, and laws in such a way so as to make any questioning or criticism of them difficult, fringe, and illegal.</p>

<p>Here is a bit of proof as to their media capabilities for those in denial or unaware.</p>

<p>We could go on into the discussion of who ow s the disparate Central Banks globally, the FEDeral Reserves that loan sovereign nations their own &#39;currency&#39;, which is also illegal.</p>

<p>Or which families are directly tied to the Soceity of Jesus aka the Jesuits and the Vatican.</p>

<p>Or which nation seems to provide &#39;security&#39; for many unfortunate victims of  &#39;terrorism&#39;, including the Brussels airport and the Rio Brazil 2016 Olympics.</p>

<p>The key however, is that it is not about the people of Israeli by and large, or the Jewish faith, but rather those who stand behind them and would and have sacrificed them in an instant to remain in control, in the shadows, and have the ability to play victim.</p>

<p>They call those not like them &#39;goyim&#39;. And make mottos such as &#39; by deception we  wage war&#39;.</p>

<p>How that cannot be seen as a predator prey relationship is unclear. I know of no other species that uses camouflage and deception against its own...</p>

<p>That is the view from where I sit.</p>

<p>What IS relevant is that: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israel was taken from the British Mandate by force through the use of terrorism</p></li>
<li><p>Israel took, through the 67 war, land that they were not entitled to under international law</p></li>
<li><p>Israel continues to occupy palestine in a manner which is both illegal and immoral according to all conventional ethics</p></li>

<p>Like how they sacrificed them during WW2 by refusing entry for jews into their lobbied Western nations of France, Britain and the US and forcing them to go to a land that didn&#39;t belong to them with the help of &quot;Nazi&quot; Germany. They knew that under war conditions and spending time in refugee/POW camps, those who refused to go would eventually either starve or succumb to disease without supplies. This would ensure their victory not of the war but of the minds in European nations.</p>

<p>They based their entire modern religion and manifest destiny off of their trademarked &quot;Holocaust&quot; that was first introduced in the early 70&#39;s as a way to market and exploit the minds of people and the West&#39;s coffers of these tools for which modern corporate foundations take a page in extracting taxes from the population through false guilt/empathy. They basically had Germany pay to built israel in their image.</p>

<p>Their holocaust is like 9/11, all but proven contrived only because discussion is made to seem silly and treasonous despite the facts.</p>

<p>I still think it&#39;s more about ultra-othodox religious practices in general rather than something specific to Jews.</p>

<p>Seemingly histories favorite victims. I view a lot of the aggression of Israel has to do with historic victimization. Not that this excuses behavior, but it does provide an angle from which a solution may be created at some point. I fell like if Israel would just share the temple mount and such the world would be way better off. But sadly religion and politics generally go hand in hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I never bought the &quot;jewish pema victim&quot; mythology, despite being a relative small percentage of the population anywhere they tried to settle, they always achieved prominence within a generation. Take the idea of the jewish slaves being saved by &quot;god&quot; killing the first born of egypt. God murdering babies over jewish slaves, meanwhile God, who is all knowing knows his son will be crucified by his &quot;chosen people&quot;? In reality this is how that went down:(And this is a good example of how history is perverted to portray a narrative)</p>

<p>The first example of ritual Jewish cannibalism is the Hamentashen eaten on the Purim holiday. Jewish children learn that the triangular pastry is a replica of the triangular hat worn by Hamen, the arch enemy of the Jewish people. The truth is that the pastry is actually meant to look like Hamen&#39;s ear, not his hat. These pastries are filled with poppi seeds, apricots, chocolates, and other sweets, but many Jews throughout history also filled these pastries with the flesh, fat, and blood of local gentile children kidnapped and murdered in a ritual sacrifice of revenge. </p>

<p>This practice continues today and often involves the use of aborted fetuses supplied to Jewish bakers from organizations like Planned Parenthood. This is one reason why so many Jews are pro-choice and donate money to pro-abortion causes.</p>

<p>Second, the Afikomen. This special matzah is hidden during the Passover seder. It is a fun game for children to seek out and find the hidden piece of unlevened bread, return it to their father for a reward, and then everyone eats it for dessert. All fun and games, right?</p>

<p>No. This ritual is symbolic of the tenth plague: the slaying of the first born. Jews teach their children that &quot;God&quot; killed the Egyptian pharaoh&#39;s first born as a punishment for not releasing the slaves. This is not entirely true. Jews also teach that God works through the actions of men. The Israelites were the real perpetrators of the mass killing of all Egyptian children.</p>

<p>This includes Egyptian children born to women in Jews&#39; own homes. Most slave familes of that era had at least one child in their household fathered by the Egyptians. This is symbolized by the vacant seat at the seder table, the plate of uneaten food, and the feigned ignorance of the wherabouts of it&#39;s intended occupant, &quot;Elijiah.&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s the truth? The male Jewish head of household murdered his stepson, baked his flesh into the matzah, put his blood into the 4 cups of red wine drank at the seder, and rejoiced in the murder of the innocent child of the pharaoh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres a list of ALL the citations</p>

<p>As far as why these practices continue, &quot;you shall know them by their works&quot; as well as the fact I personally witnessed an unusually fleshy hamentashen being served at a purim at the home of a family friend, the &quot;goy&quot; were served from a seperate plate, our jewish hosts fed us from a plate down by our end of the table, the plate closest to us had homentashen that looked quite different from the ones they themselves ate.</p>

<p>And many great men have raised such an accusation. Martin Luther wrote in his book &quot;Of The Jews And Their Lies:&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They stabbed and pierced the body of the young boy Simon of Trent. They have also murdered other children...The sun never did shine on a more bloodthirsty and revengeful people as they who imagine to be the people of God, and who desire to and think they must murder and crush the heathen. Jesus Christ, the Almighty Preacher from Nazareth, spoke to the Jews: ? Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He (Martin Luther) accused them (the Jews) of all those fictitious crimes which had made Europe such a hell for them. He, too, claimed that they poisoned the wells used by Christians, assassinated their Christian patients, and murdered Christian children to procure blood for the Passover. He called on the princes and rulers to persecute them mercilessly, and commanded the preachers to set the mobs on them. He declared that if the power were his, he would take all the leaders of the Jews and tear their tongues out by the roots.&quot; (Stranger than Fiction, p. 249)</p>

<p>The Struggle of Der Sturmer: The only newspaper in Germany, yes, in the entire world, which often screamed the accusation of ritual murder into the Jewish face, was Der Sturmer. For more than ten yeas Der Sturmer led a gigantic battle against Judaism. Which caused Der Sturmer to be under constant attack by the Jews. Dozens of times it has been confiscated and prohibited.</p>

<p>Its workers, most of all its editor Julius Streicher, were dragged into court hundreds of times. They were convicted, punished and locked into prison. Der Sturmer came to know the Jew from the confession which Dr. Conrad Alberti-Sittenfeld, a Jew, wrote in 1899 in No. 12 of the magazine Gesellschaft:</p>

<p>&quot;One of the most dangerous Jewish qualities is the brutal, direct barbaric intolerance. A worse tyranny cannot be practiced than that which the Jewish clique practices. If you try to move against this Jewish clique, they will, without hesitating, use brutal methods to overcome you. Mainly the Jew tries to destroy his enemy in the mental area, by which he takes his material gain away, and undermines his civil existence. The vilest of all forms of retaliation, the boycott, is characteristically Jewish.&quot;</p>

<p>The Der Sturmer was not stopped for several years. Just in Nuremberg alone there have been fought dozens of Talmudic and ritual murder cases in the courts. (Now you know why the Nuremberg trials were held against the German Military leaders, it was retribution by the Jews on their hated enemies the Germans). Because of the Jewish protests the attention of the world was focused on these cases. Thereafter heavy convictions followed. At first no judge had the courage to expose the Jewish problem. Finally in 1932 (court case lasting from October 30th to November 4th) Der Sturmer won its first victory. The jury found the following:</p>

<p>1). Der Sturmer was not fighting against the Jewish religion; but against the Jewish people.
2). The Talmud and Schulchan aruch are not religious books. They have no right to be protected under the religious paragraphs.
3). The laws of the Talmud which are quoted and published in Der Sturmer are exact quotations from the Talmud.
4). The laws of the Talmud are in harsh contradiction to German morals.
5). The Jews of today are being taught from the Talmud.</p>

<p>With this verdict Der Sturmer brought about the first big breach in the Jewish/Roman Administration of Justice, which was given the job before the National Socialist revolution to protect Judaism and its government. The jews, of course, became greatly agitated about this. But for De Sturmer this success was an omen of the victory yet to come. Of course, Der Sturmer did not stop half way. It knew what had to be done. It was their duty, or so they believed. To frustrate the gigantic murder plot of Judaism against humanity. It was their duty! To brand this nation before the world, to uncover its crimes and to render it harmless. It was their duty! To free the world from this national pest and parasitic race. Der Sturmer would fulfill its mission. It would, for a time, light up the darkness with the truth which shall eventually rule the world. And it would always direct itself according to the following proverb: &quot;He who knows the truth and does not speak it truly is a miserable creature.&quot;</p>

<p>The Laws of The Talmud: If one wishes to learn and understand why the Jews can commit such insane crimes as ritual murder, they must know the Jewish secrets. They must know the teachings of the Torah (The Talmud), and the Schulchan aruch. These laws and teachings are proof that the Jews feel themselves superior to all nations, that it has declared war on all other races, and that it is the sworn enemy of the whole of non-Jewish humanity. Even Tactius, the Roman historian who lived shortly after Christ (55-120) A.D.) wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;The Jews are a race that hate the gods and mankind. Their laws are in opposition to those of all mortals. They despise what to us is holy. Their laws condone them in committing acts which horrify us.&quot; (Historian V. 3-8)</p>

<p>The Jew knows that when the non-Jewish world knows his laws and sees through his plans that he is lost. Therefore, by threat of death he forbids their translation and publication. A well known Jewish scholar (Dibre David) writes:</p>

<p>&quot;If the Gentiles (non-Jews) knew what we are teaching against them, they would kill us.&quot;</p>

<p>What makes you think it&#39;s credible? Why believe this small selection of evidence over the mounds of contrary conventional accounts? What is it about this evidence you&#39;ve presented here that supersedes other contrary evidence, conventional wisdom, and peoples personal experiences?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say this is all true for a moment though. I have had many Jewish friends, seen the practices of their orthodoxy. Why have I and others not seen all this, especially given it&#39;s long history? How are we to direct this insidious sect? Surly it&#39;s not all Jews, but an increasingly small minority. Granted they could very well be in positions of power, given the lengths of what they are accused of. That being the case though, how are Jews any different from any other secret power hungry groups. What&#39;s so special about Jews? This degree that people go to single out Jews seems counterproductive as there are many other groups doing all kinds of vile things. Just one head of the hydra so to speak.</p>

<p>I also just don&#39;t see what makes Jews unique. Every culture with militaristic tradition, which is a lot of cultures worldwide, have a belief that they are superior to other peoples and nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point I&#39;m convinced you have not read the Bible. That website (and subsequently your argument) nitpicks quotes and excludes half of the actual quote which gives it its context entirely, thereby squeezing them into your ridiculous narrative.</p>

<p>To give you an example:</p>

<p>On that website it says Deuteronomy 8:19 &quot;and walk after other gods and serve them, and worship them.&quot; </p>

<p>I have the King James Bible in my hand, the ACTUAL quote says</p>

<p>&quot;And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.&quot;</p>

<p>As you can see the first half of the passage is missing which gives it context.</p>

<p>Another example:
The website says Acts 14:11-12
&quot;11 The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.&quot;</p>

<p>If you had actually read the Bible you would know that this passage is referring back tto the previous passage that describes the Gentiles and how they view Paul and Barnabas. </p>

<p>I could do this for nearly every passage the website quotes but I&#39;m not going to continue this because 1) I don&#39;t care enough and 2) you&#39;re too stupid and delusional to be convinced otherwise</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What planet am I on right now? The Bible passage from Deuteronomy that I quoted is word for word the same thing that&#39;s written on the two bible passage sites you just provided so I literally have no idea what you mean by my &quot;self-report is wrong&quot;. You didn&#39;t even address what I said, because you&#39;re in denial. The website &quot;thegodmurders&quot; leaves out half of the bible quote, you just proved my point by linking two other sites that contain the full quote. Like I said, a lot of the quotes on that page are missing the full passage, something that you chose to not address because you know you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Your understanding of the Bible is horrible, indicating you have not, in fact, studied it at all. You only cite websites that leave out half of Bible passages and you plagiarize other peoples&#39; work in order to pass as somebody who&#39;s educated and scholarly. In reality you have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>I graduated from a Catholic HS. I studied the Bible for four years. God doesn&#39;t &quot;recognize&quot; other gods. What Deuteronomy 8:19 and the Ten Commandments says is that anybody who recognizes other gods should not worship them. </p>

<p>It seems clearly evident that you have a problem with religion, more specifically Judaism and/or Christianity. Your misinformed bias is incredibly strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as why these practices continue, &quot;you shall know them by their works&quot; as well as the fact I personally witnessed an unusually fleshy hamentashen being served at a purim at the home of a family friend, the &quot;goy&quot; were served from a seperate plate, our jewish hosts fed us from a plate down by our end of the table, the plate closest to us had homentashen that looked quite different from the ones they themselves ate.
And many great men have raised such an accusation. Martin Luther wrote in his book &quot;Of The Jews And Their Lies:&quot;
&quot;They stabbed and pierced the body of the young boy Simon of Trent. They have also murdered other children...The sun never did shine on a more bloodthirsty and revengeful people as they who imagine to be the people of God, and who desire to and think they must murder and crush the heathen. Jesus Christ, the Almighty Preacher from Nazareth, spoke to the Jews: ? Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning...&quot;
&quot;He (Martin Luther) accused them (the Jews) of all those fictitious crimes which had made Europe such a hell for them. He, too, claimed that they poisoned the wells used by Christians, assassinated their Christian patients, and murdered Christian children to procure blood for the Passover. He called on the princes and rulers to persecute them mercilessly, and commanded the preachers to set the mobs on them. He declared that if the power were his, he would take all the leaders of the Jews and tear their tongues out by the roots.&quot; (Stranger than Fiction, p. 249)
The Struggle of Der Sturmer: The only newspaper in Germany, yes, in the entire world, which often screamed the accusation of ritual murder into the Jewish face, was Der Sturmer. For more than ten yeas Der Sturmer led a gigantic battle against Judaism. Which caused Der Sturmer to be under constant attack by the Jews. Dozens of times it has been confiscated and prohibited.
Its workers, most of all its editor Julius Streicher, were dragged into court hundreds of times. They were convicted, punished and locked into prison. Der Sturmer came to know the Jew from the confession which Dr. Conrad Alberti-Sittenfeld, a Jew, wrote in 1899 in No. 12 of the magazine Gesellschaft:
&quot;One of the most dangerous Jewish qualities is the brutal, direct barbaric intolerance. A worse tyranny cannot be practiced than that which the Jewish clique practices. If you try to move against this Jewish clique, they will, without hesitating, use brutal methods to overcome you. Mainly the Jew tries to destroy his enemy in the mental area, by which he takes his material gain away, and undermines his civil existence. The vilest of all forms of retaliation, the boycott, is characteristically Jewish.&quot;
The Der Sturmer was not stopped for several years. Just in Nuremberg alone there have been fought dozens of Talmudic and ritual murder cases in the courts. (Now you know why the Nuremberg trials were held against the German Military leaders, it was retribution by the Jews on their hated enemies the Germans). Because of the Jewish protests the attention of the world was focused on these cases. Thereafter heavy convictions followed. At first no judge had the courage to expose the Jewish problem. Finally in 1932 (court case lasting from October 30th to November 4th) Der Sturmer won its first victory. The jury found the following:
1). Der Sturmer was not fighting against the Jewish religion; but against the Jewish people. 2). The Talmud and Schulchan aruch are not religious books. They have no right to be protected under the religious paragraphs. 3). The laws of the Talmud which are quoted and published in Der Sturmer are exact quotations from the Talmud. 4). The laws of the Talmud are in harsh contradiction to German morals. 5). The Jews of today are being taught from the Talmud.
With this verdict Der Sturmer brought about the first big breach in the Jewish/Roman Administration of Justice, which was given the job before the National Socialist revolution to protect Judaism and its government. The jews, of course, became greatly agitated about this. But for De Sturmer this success was an omen of the victory yet to come. Of course, Der Sturmer did not stop half way. It knew what had to be done. It was their duty, or so they believed. To frustrate the gigantic murder plot of Judaism against humanity. It was their duty! To brand this nation before the world, to uncover its crimes and to render it harmless. It was their duty! To free the world from this national pest and parasitic race. Der Sturmer would fulfill its mission. It would, for a time, light up the darkness with the truth which shall eventually rule the world. And it would always direct itself according to the following proverb: &quot;He who knows the truth and does not speak it truly is a miserable creature.&quot;
The Laws of The Talmud: If one wishes to learn and understand why the Jews can commit such insane crimes as ritual murder, they must know the Jewish secrets. They must know the teachings of the Torah (The Talmud), and the Schulchan aruch. These laws and teachings are proof that the Jews feel themselves superior to all nations, that it has declared war on all other races, and that it is the sworn enemy of the whole of non-Jewish humanity. Even Tactius, the Roman historian who lived shortly after Christ (55-120) A.D.) wrote:
&quot;The Jews are a race that hate the gods and mankind. Their laws are in opposition to those of all mortals. They despise what to us is holy. Their laws condone them in committing acts which horrify us.&quot; (Historian V. 3-8)
The Jew knows that when the non-Jewish world knows his laws and sees through his plans that he is lost. Therefore, by threat of death he forbids their translation and publication. A well known Jewish scholar (Dibre David) writes:
&quot;If the Gentiles (non-Jews) knew what we are teaching against them, they would kill us.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Jew (by conversion), I have more than a few problems with your statements.</p>

<p>First: I have seen exactly zero evidence of Hamentashen being filled with anything human.  As for why you got a different looking cookie, it might well be because some are Kosher and some were not.  Or some were apple and some were cherry.  Or some were cream cheese and some were pizza. The combinations are endless.  I have yet to see a recipe which involves human flesh, or be in the presence of Jews where human flesh was served. Jews are not getting kickbacks from Planned Parenthood.  Come on! That&#39;s gross and disgusting.  They are cookies, for pete&#39;s sake!  As for the plate you were served: there are only about a million possible reasons why you were served on the plate you were.  Maybe they had service for 6 and 10 people showed up, so someone had to bring spare plates.  Ever heard of that happening? Maybe one was a kosher plate (they exist) and one was not.  Did you ever think to ASK YOUR HOST / HOSTESS about the plate? They <strong>might</strong> have an actual reason why you were served on that particular plate.  Or you might just be reading way too much into tiny insignificant details. </p>

<p>As for the Afikomen, it is a &quot;special&quot; piece of Matzah that, traditionally, the father hides, to be found by the children (if any are present) at the end of the Passover Seder.  I have <strong>never, ever, ever seen</strong> or heard it compared to any of the Plagues.  It is written by very much respected Rabbis that the Afikomen is to hidden in order to give the children something to do, because the Rabbi is, like, human and recognized that small children might get a little testy after sitting at a meal for a while.  Never heard the Afikomen as representative of a plague.  That is entirely on you and your Nazi friends. </p>

<p>And thirdly, there is always an extra seat left at the Passover Seder for the PROPHET Elijah, who preached against idol worship.  You might recognize Elijah from your own Bible.  And if you look closely enough at your own Bible, you would realize that it is one and the same book that Jewish people recognize as the Bible.    At a certain point in the Seder, Elijah is actually invited to come in and partake of the festivities.  Elijah is also invited to participate in other Jewish events.  </p>

<p>Also, just for the record, there is no Jewish conspiracy.  If there was, not a single Jew I know nor myself have ever gotten the memo or subscription invite.  </p>

<p>Do you actually have a credible citation? And by credible, I mean something written by an independent person or team of people who actually have credible, actual facts to support their cause, and who are not Nazi or neo-Nazi? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t recite anything about Purim; I merely pointed out problems with your own interpretation of food you claim to have been served.  </p>

<p>I have not seen the video, but there is a name for them: Holocaust deniers.  There exists so much more evidence FOR the Holocaust to have happened, that Germany&#39;s government has made it illegal (and I believe, punishable by prison time) to deny that the Holocaust happened.  Think about that.  The German government is so very certain that something happened, that they are willing to lock people in prison for saying that it did not happen.  (((I just looked it up, it&#39;s anywhere from 3 months to 5 years in prison))).  </p>

<p>I have not heard of anything Antisemitic attributed to Ben Franklin, so I did a quick Google search, and this was the first link:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy</a></p>

<p>which states that Ben Franklin was improperly cited as the giver of a a speech warning of the &quot;dangers of Jews&quot; (I&#39;m paraphrasing here).<br/>
But wait! It turns out that Ben Franklin never actually gave this speech.  One of the points the author makes is that Jews are vampires.  Do we also glitter and play baseball on stormy days? If so, also not given that memo.  Same author also asserts that Jews would not move to Palestine / Israel if given the chance.  Dude, my brother in law lives in Israel along with several other million Jews. He moved there VOLUNTARILY, because he WANTED to.  So that&#39;s also wrong.  So Ben Franklin, one of the esteemed fathers of our country, instrumental in drafting the Declaration of Independence, inventing a lot of stuff, and starting a newspaper, a university, libraries and so much more also thought that Jews were vampires who would have nothing to do with Palestine /Israel if given the chance? See, if that was true, wouldn&#39;t there be something, anything about it on Ben Franklin&#39;s wiki page? But there isn&#39;t. I checked.  </p>

<p>The author of the Franklin Prophecy Wiki also asserts that George Washington was antisemitic. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s the deal.</p>

<p>Washington actually sent a letter to the Jews of Rhode Island, in which he wrote:   &quot; writing &quot;May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy</a></p>

<p>And as for Ben Franklin, he was considered a &quot;friend&quot; of the Jews in Pennsylvania, and actually helped to build the synagogue in Philadelphia:  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Prophecy</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t know too many Nazis that went around building synagogues, but that&#39;s just me.  </p>

<p>And before you get too wound up, let me just remind you that Jesus Christ himself was actually a Jew.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luther was a real idiot:</p>

<p>&quot;In his treatise Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants, he urged the princes with these words,</p>

<p>&quot;Therefore let everyone who can, smite, slay and stab, secretly or openly, remembering that nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful or devilish than a rebel. It is just as when one must kill a mad dog; if you do not strike him, he will strike you, and a whole land with you.”</p>

<p>As a result, the peasants were brutally suppressed.
The Protestant historian H. A. L. Fisher wrote:</p>

<p>“The manner in which he [Luther] dissociated his movement from the peasant rebellion . . . and the encouragement he gave to a course of repression so savage that it left the German peasantry more defenseless and abased than any social class in central or western Europe, are serious blots upon his good name. The German peasants were rough men and rough fighters; but their grievances were genuine, and their original demands were just and reasonable.” 
Here are some other quotes by Luther on the matter:</p>

<p>Here are some other quotes by Luther on the matter:
“Like the mules who will not move unless you perpetually whip them with rods, so the civil powers must drive the common people, whip, choke, hang, burn, behead and torture them, that they may learn to fear the powers that be.” </p>

<p>“Peasants are no better than straw. They will not hear the word and they are without sense; therefore they must be compelled to hear the crack of the whip and the whiz of bullets and it is only what they deserve.” </p>

<p>“To kill a peasant is not murder; it is helping to extinguish the conflagration. Let there be no half measures! Crush them! Cut their throats! Transfix them. Leave no stone unturned! To kill a peasant is to destroy a mad dog! If they say that I am very hard and merciless, mercy be damned. Let whoever can stab, strangle, and kill them like mad dogs.” </p>

<p>“I, Martin Luther, have during the rebellion slain all the peasants, for it was I who ordered them to be struck dead. All their blood is upon my head. But I put it all on our Lord God: for he commanded me to speak thus.”</p>

<p>While animal sacrifice was part of the practice of ancient Judaism, the Tanakh (Old Testament) and Jewish teaching portray human sacrifice as one of the evils that separated the pagans of Canaan from the Hebrews (Deut 12:31, 2 Kings 16:3). Jews were prohibited from engaging in these rituals and were punished for doing so (Ex 34:15, Lev 20:2, Deut 18:12, Jer 7:31). In fact, ritual cleanliness for priests prohibited them from even being in the same room as a human corpse (Lev 21:11). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Benjamin Freedman who was a former jew Germany had won WWI two years after the war started.  They offered to make peace with England setting everything back the way it was before the war.  England was actually considering it until the zionists came up with a plan to get the americans into the war.  The zionists made an agreement with England that if they got the americans into the war that they would get Palestine.  This was called the Balfour Declaration.  This was in the form of a letter from United Kingdom&#39;s Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Walter Rothschild.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly pro-Israel&#39;s policies, and I&#39;m anti-&quot;chosen people&quot; of any variety, but I like Jews because they are pro-family, pro-education, pro-community.  They exclude the goyim, but the goyim benefit in a back-handed way by an improvement of the culture in the area.  Now that I&#39;m stuck in a state where the &quot;chosen&quot; are Mormon, and I can tell you - I WISH we had more Jews.</p>
