       Holmes was one of six recipients of a National Institutes of Health Neuroscience Training Grant at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver. Holmes is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside with a Bachelor of Science degree in neuroscience. They’re videos of him at the age of 19. He appears to be customary, happy and informed. After his years in college, he worked as an intern at the Salk Institute partnered by DARPA of Biological Studies as well as at Miramar College’s biotechnology summer boot camp. Holmes inscribed in his resume that he created a computer program to illustrate temporary perceptions of causality and programmed a flicker fusion utility device. Flicker fusion is used in mind control. James Holmes also wrote papers on temporary perceptions of causality after college. Gen and a knowledge, was given to Holmes by Terry Sejinowski.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terry Sejinowski works to understand the computational resources of the brain itself, and tries to link brain function and behavior using computer models. By using simulations to make sense of experimental data, Sejnowski has helped link biophysical processes in the brain to human behavior. His research has revealed in- sights into a raft of phenomena from vision to sleep to brain disorders. Holmes referred to John Jacobson as his mentor. Jacobson worked at Hughes Medical Institute at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. Holmes, when attending school in Colorado was in a very specialized class studying things relating to “mind control”. Only a total of 6 students were allowed to attend, per semester, after completing an interview. Witnesses during the shooting stated that Holmes had an acquaintance. Nevertheless, during his trial Holmes was heavily drugged. Holmes also states, through witness references that he didn’t remember anything, absolutely nothing (Hypnosis state).
      </p>
      <p>
       Scopolamine commonly used in Columbia is markedly similar to the date rape drug, except thousands of times more potent. When you are subjected to this drug your autonomy ceaselessly vanishes. James Holmes seem to be on such a drug, one reason being because his eyes were extremely sensitive to light (abnormal). He had, in regards to ocular effects, dilated pupils, mydriasis, cycloplegia to some extent by virtue of fluttering and twitching eyelids, erythema apropos dermatologic effects, redness in her face, neck and upper chest, and tremors. Compare his court pictures and videos to pictures and videos a few years before and you will see what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       The apparent benevolent personality of the shooter...his connections to neuroscience and his father’s supposed connections and intelligence, might have flipped the switch if any.  He could have delved too deep into his psyche, his sub-conscious mind, subsequently creating a monster in the process or was he used as a scapegoat?
      </p>
      <p>
       specialized class studying 'MIND-CONTROL' and is so secretive that only '6' students are allowed to attend, per semester, and it's by interview only! As far as his 'Psychologist' is concerned... She is the HEAD of the Psyche staff for the MIND-CONTROL

       Interesting post, thanks. I agree with the idea that Holmes was under the influence of some kind of mind control. But I also think the Colorado shootings were hoaxed (like Sandy Hook, Boston, etc.). So the question I ask myself is whether they mind-controlled him into doing it and believing he was doing it, or is he "in on it"?

       they woke him up in his car, too drugged out of his mind to speak and multiple eye witnesses on the 911 tapes report 3 military guys fleeing the crime scene

       But if it was a hoax and nobody was killed, then what were the military guys doing there? Same question with San Bernardino. Is it just something to throw off conspiracy theorists...?

       was the hoax that no one was killed or were a few people actually killed and james was the hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       i saw a bunch of eye witnesses on youtube talking to a reporter and they all said there were 3 shooters, that "james" or someone in the front row got up and opened the outside door to let someone else in right before the shooting started
