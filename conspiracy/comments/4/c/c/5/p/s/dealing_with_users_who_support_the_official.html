        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is directed solely at those of us who have little to no doubt that Sandy Hook was a hoax. When commenting in THIS post, I advise you to <strong>ignore</strong> all of the users who reply saying that they knew a victim, or that they were related to one, or that they know for a fact that the event was real, or that they need someone to explain why we think it was fake. <strong>(all commenters are encouraged to exercise their right of the freedom of speech however)</strong></p>

<p>I will be making an attempt here to classify the different types of people who have anything to say about the “shooting” at Sandy Hook Elementary School. I’ll call them types of “supporters of the official narrative” or SOTON Types for short. </p>

<p><strong>SOTON Type 1:</strong><br/>
Shill. The worst kind. An accomplice, employee of, or servant to, the entity or entities who carried out the hoax at SHES. A shill’s purpose is not to engage the person they’re speaking directly to, but to speak rhetorically to the readers of the comment thread, with the intention of either distracting or convincing those readers that the shooting was real and to “move along, there’s nothing to see here”, because we’re crazy and cruel for calling it fake, right?</p>

<p><strong>SOTON Type 2:</strong><br/>
The people who refuse to believe that they were lied to by our Holy Government and the honest workers in the main stream media. This type of SOTON will most commonly insult us or accuse us of being cruel and sadistic or horrible for stating that nobody died at SHES. They honestly and truthfully believe people died at SHES, and will likely make intellectually dishonest attempts at saying it was real (saying you weren’t there, or I know a guy who knows a guy, or put your tinfoil hat back on, or telling us to prove it was fake instead of themselves taking a good honest look at the countless resources that clearly indicate foul play).</p>

<p><strong>SOTON Type 3:</strong><br/>
People who are liars but are not shills. They are difficult to distinguish from a shill. This type of SOTON wants attention. They may suffer from Munchausen syndrome and are claiming to have lost a relative or friend at SHES for the purpose of garnering sympathy (I usually see these people in the comment section of YouTube SHES tribute videos)</p>

<p><strong>SOTON Type 4:</strong><br/>
The second type of shill. The sneaky little bastards that pretend to not understand why people say it was fake. They usually say something like “can someone please explain…”. This SOTON’s purpose is to engage us in a long back and forth string of comments that is longer than the patience of people who stumble across the thread and don’t yet know that SHES was a hoax. They intend to muddy the waters with thousands upon thousands of comments intended to fill space in a forum.</p>

<p>Then there are people who honestly don’t know why we call it a hoax and they ask us to explain it because they really are too lazy to research it for themselves. Try to be nice to these idiots, because if we can help them to wake up, they are each ONE MORE PERSON that we can have on OUR side.</p>

<p>If I’ve missed any, I encourage those of you who reject the official narrative to let me know so I can add them to the list of classifications.</p>

<p>WHY do I classify these people, you ask? Because we aren’t allowed to accuse others of being shills in this forum. Because we aren’t allowed to insult them, though they are more than deserving of ridicule and insults. Instead, when you encounter them, simply reply with a link to this post, state that you believe them to be a SOTON Type 1, 2, 3, or 4, and state that you will not engage them in conversation unless they admit that it was hoax. My goal with this post (pun intended) is to lead this forum toward the truth and to let the shills know that we see them for what they are, and to render their efforts useless, without breaking the rules.</p>

<p><strong>edit 1</strong> : formatting</p>

<p><strong>edit 2</strong> : you&#39;ll read in the comments my interaction with a redditor who&#39;s provided photographic evidence that verifies his username and his connection with the victim Lauren Rousseau. While I still believe this event to be a hoax and the victims&#39; names to be fabricated, this is the first victim I am reconsidering.</p>

<p><strong>edit 3</strong> : by request of u/CaptainObviousHere1 - the <a href="http://imgur.com/sO9ct58">beer keg</a> is all bought and paid for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone that has an open mind would like actual photo evidence of Lauren Rousseau&#39;s existence, I&#39;d be happy to oblige. I knew her for 7 years. She was one of my wife&#39;s closest friends. I was supposed to see her on the evening of the shooting for a mutual friend&#39;s birthday.</p>

<p>The name the media provided wasn&#39;t fake, it was real. She did in fact teach at Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p>

<p>Again, if there&#39;s ANY interest at all, I&#39;ll post pictures.</p>

<p>Edit: there&#39;s at least some interest.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a pic with my username.</p>

<p>Is there anything more I can do to prove she was real? I&#39;m sorry the pics aren&#39;t the best quality. I think it&#39;s pretty clear that she was in fact a real person and that her and I were close friends.</p>

<p>Edit: replaced a picture that had my real name in it</p>

<p>Second edit: thank you for the gold. I hope my posts were helpful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus H Christ, there is a mountain of holes in your story. Why would they be in witness protection? Witness protection is for one&#39;s safety. Who is out to harm them? Why would they sign onto it to begin with? A buttload of money? Would you leave your friends and family for a lot of money? I know I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t and the Lauren Rousseau I knew definitely wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Seriously, stop responding to my posts with your shitty, half-baked theories on what happened to my friend. Try presenting actual evidence or a well-thought out theory. As you can read from my other posts, I&#39;m not close-minded, but this post is just silly top to bottom.</p>

<p>And then, I really hate arguing, I dont want to argue with anyone...even you, some stranger online. It just feels wrong, not fair, and not nice. Pointless really. Tmrw is Monday for us both. We are both just people. Jobs. Friends. Family. Money stress. Not worth growing animosity towards someone I don&#39;t know, life is hard enough. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are opinions about the consistencies or lack of consistences  about the story presented to the public, and borderline stupendously ridiculous interviews with some select individuals who are criticized as being actors, being that you come forth presenting evidence of a victim being real?  </p>

<p>Additionally, if people died, could this still have been a planned event, by a perpetrator other than the singular Adam Lanza?  And do you even have reason to believe Adam Lanza was the murderer of your friend?</p>

<p>Finally, do you believe we received a portrayal of the true events that happened that day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The stories that reach the public sphere with such magnitude as Sandy Hook tend to be manipulated and injected with a message regardless of their veracity.  I do not believe, however, that there is bound to be inconsistencies.  I do believe that inconsistencies can occur in crimes, but we live in a reality based world limited by the known laws of physics.  Inconsistences should be scrutinized, and given the amount presented at Sandy Hook ...</p>

<p>From that idiotic Medical Examiner (and his famous quote &quot;I hope it doesn&#39;t come crashing down on their heads,&quot;)<br/>
Gene Rosen&#39;s acting and morphing (ridiculous) story,<br/>
A mentally unstable non-professional teenager gunning down 26 people without help,<br/>
The demolition of the school and house, and more.    </p>

<p>... the alarms should be ringing.</p>

<p>Considering you are on this board, I assume you&#39;ve heard of the NWO.  If you are one to believe in a shadow force which pulls the strings behind the curtain (call it what you want,) their strategical time-line far exceeds that of the normal (singular) person.   This is a tool in their toolbox that can be played at any moment&#39;s time present or future, for it is permanently added to the list of shootings which may require us to have our rights to arm ourselves (in any fashion) taken away.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on this board because OP replied to a 4 month old post of mine. His post history got me here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not anti-conspiracy but the idea that people think the SH victims didn&#39;t exist makes very upset and even a little nauseous. I wouldn&#39;t wish losing a friend or family member like that on my worst enemy. Losing a close friend right before Christmas and a week after losing our dog was one of the hardest times in my life. Random breakdowns at home and at work, difficulty sleeping, and it didn&#39;t take long for people to start saying that it was a hoax. Then, being constantly reminded of it via social media. </p>

<p>You can believe what you want as far as who did it. I don&#39;t care. But telling me Lauren didn&#39;t exist is a slap in the fucking face, to mine and hers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hoped my questions lead you towards my beliefs (That although people may have died, the event is still verifiably suspicious.)  It seems you are not in the position to confirm the actual story we received that day.  I was simply curious what your opinions were.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss and the trauma you were put through due to inhumanity; whether it be by an Adam Lanza, or shadow forces at large.  It doesn&#39;t matter which it is to an immediate victim or someone related to a victim.  </p>

<p>Finally, I hope you understand that my skepticism and inquiry is for good reasons (to prevent or disrupt future inhumanities, for I believe that the world is veiled by a complex web of deceit and stricken with evil, which I understand is not a belief shared by many)  </p>

<p>Based on what?  You have obviously never ordered for a institution or business in the last decade+.  You go to Emedco or Grainger or Staples or etc... and order whatever ADA compliant signs you can find.  Usually if a child is at the point they can&#39;t read, there&#39;s a teacher taking them to the bathroom.  </p>

<p>I went to school in literal Rural NJ way back in the 80&#39;s, and I remember all of our doors had reinforced glass with the cool steel chicken wire in it.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s an elementary school a few miles from my house, and you can see how TRULY rural we are.  Single baseball diamond, and maybe some slides to the right.  Don&#39;t see a basketball court. Closest I think it the section of parking lot they colored so kids could play games at recess.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.2032358,-74.2079888,439m/data=!3m1!1e3">https://www.google.com/maps/@40.2032358,-74.2079888,439m/data=!3m1!1e3</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I finished my Elementary school days in the late 80&#39;s: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6887847,-74.2513281,218m/data=!3m1!1e3">https://www.google.com/maps/@40.6887847,-74.2513281,218m/data=!3m1!1e3</a></p>

<p>Paved lot, only a basketball court, and the only &quot;ball field&quot; is &quot;bases&quot; painted on the pavement for when you play kickball.  When I was a kid in the 90&#39;s, there was two swing sets, but thank to liability(I&#39;m guessing), those are long since gone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see that assertion anywhere in his post. He only says the event was hoaxed. You are reaching, maybe even misdirecting, and with all due respect I am not surprised that you cannot provide us with any evidence of her name or her death.

    <div class="md"><p>While part of me doesn&#39;t doubt that this might have been a hoax and no kids really died, I think that the possibility that kids DID actually get murdered in that school still doesn&#39;t keep the Sandy Hook event from being a false flag event nonetheless.</p>

<p>I think it doesn&#39;t really matter whether people actually got murdered at Sandy Hook or not because the main point is that it <em>was still</em> a false flag operation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sort of like 911:  Did people really die?  Hell yeah they did.  3,000 people got murdered in that event.  Nobody can say that people <em>didn&#39;t</em> die.  Nobody can say that a lot of mayhem didn&#39;t occur in the event.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the real point behind that event, however.  The real point is that IT WAS A FALSE FLAG OPERATION through and through.</p>

<p>Same thing with Sandy Hook.  Too many people are getting caught up in whether people actually <em>did</em> die or not.  Maybe they did, maybe they didn&#39;t.  I&#39;m personally not super sure one way or the other...and I don&#39;t really care all that much, to be honest, because the main point is that I know it was a false flag operation/fear-porn event designed to try to, among other things, repeal the 2nd Amendment.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter whether people <em>actually</em> got murdered or whether a bunch of crisis actors were used.  The real point is that it was a <em>staged event</em> that did <em>not</em> take place in the manner that the MSM reported it.  It was brokered by TPTB behind the scenes, and people need to make sure and not forget that regardless of whether they argue that people actually did or did not get murdered in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if the victims were real, I still wouldn&#39;t doubt that at least <em>some</em> of the whole Sandy Hook event was staged.  And if <em>none</em> of it was staged? (which is b.s. since there are enough videos definitively showing that at least <em>some</em> of it was staged) the fact of the matter is that the MSM and it&#39;s &quot;never let a tragedy go to waste&quot; modus operandi made sure and milked it for all it was worth with regard to using that event (false flag staged event or not) as an attempt to repeal the 2nd Amendment.  That alone <em>really</em> put everything that happened into serious question because the deep agenda the MSM threw behind the event made it just...reek of a contrivance and an opportunism that made whatever might have actually been real or authentic become suddenly doubted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldnt categorize you as SOTON type 4 based on his definition.  That is a pretty reasonable conclusion to come to, and the one I lean towards.  That being said, there is evidence that no one died, such as destruction of evidence (the house and the school were demolished) and no crime scene photos with even a speck of blood released, to my best knowledge, they were all redacted in the photo dump.)  But as I mentioned in a thread of Sandy Hook, evidence is not proof, and I tend to agree with your post, as it&#39;s too risky to not sacrifice human life, if the mission is important enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you have total control over the media you don&#39;t need to worry that much about things going wrong. It&#39;s actually safer that way because you don&#39;t have real victims&#39; families suing and demanding answers. Instead you can use the &quot;victims&quot; families as propaganda mouthpieces. I agree they wouldn&#39;t hesitate to kill a school full of children if they thought it would further their goals. But in this case it&#39;s actually safer and more effective to hoax it</p>
