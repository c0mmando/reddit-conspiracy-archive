       Right.  I think this sub is a place where it's ok to say stuff about

       <li>
        Gmos

       But with vaccines it's a wash

      <p>
       Outing fake events gets you someone always saying, false flag doesn't mean someone didn't die.  Which is true.  In fact Thomas Sheridan does a very good job pointing out how this particular subject is very sensitive because if you're wrong and you've accused the media of fakery but someone really
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       die, then you look like an asshole.  (which is what they want--don't give them what they want)

       Global warming is another one of those things.  I'm actually on the fence with this issue.  I feel like I'll never know enough.  However I DO believe in weather manipulation.  I believe that the RRR (polar vortex / california 3 yr drought) was done on purpose by haarp type tech in order to reverse the jet streams in order to restart the stalled gulf of mexico current loop that stalled as a direct consequence of the deepwater horizon incident.

       re: global warming, just look up the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures going back thousands of years and you'll see that the sun was, is, and will continue to be the #1 factor in temperatures by far.  Then look at all of the times the IPCC has been caught with its pants down falsifying data.  Then look at the "studies" where those "97% of scientists agree" numbers come from and realize how fake those percentages are.  And then go from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously humans are having a negative impact on the environment but all of this global warming nonsense is, well, nonsense.  Also consider that they do all this talk about limiting carbon emissions.  Well who is the biggest polluter on planet earth?  The US military/government, and it isn't even close.  Where is the green movement calling for a limit to military spending or a limit to senseless wars?  You won't hear a peep from them about that, because the movement is controlled.

       Yes definitely.  Most posts about these topics get downvoted so much that they don't even make the front page, let alone the top few spots, and all of the comments sections are full of naysayers and "debunkers".

       I think there is a lot behind this. In fact the search for Planet X is the reason we found Neptune and Pluto in the first place. Both times they did not explain the perturbations in Uranus' orbit.

       Edit - Speaking personally, I've experienced brigading when discussing false flags on the day they take place. Almost like there are folks sitting by waiting to steer the narrative.

       That used to bother a lot me because it felt like people here believe that literally every major event in modern history is a false flag. Obviously that is patently absurd. And claiming false flag the day of an event is clearly not based on strong evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while, I started to find it productive. Not that I find evidence that every event is a false flag, but rather that we should vigorously question the official narrative every time. Even if TPTB are not behind an event, they will certainly spin the reaction to their favor. But I do believe that history will prove that they were behind quite a few

       events.

       I think it's wrong for people to say "someone DIED shut up about your conspiracy theory"!  I'm of the opinion that it should be investigated independently from all angles instead of getting the single sourced info from the  ministry of information jamming it into your stupid mouth like some kind of foisgras retard duck

       We talk about them a lot on this sub.  It's hard to know whether people have less interest in this kind of thing or if it's being controlled.  I posted a thing on C_S_T about big agro and it got pretty good traction comparably.  Maybe they don't control that sub as much since it's not as well known.  I feel a kind of fight clubby vibe, like don't talk about cst

       I personally attack flat earthers.  Sorry.  I've been at high altitude, I can't unsee what I saw, no do I think it was a massive hologram or that the window was a projection screen window fooling me with the rounder's lies.  I keep telling the flat earthers they need to get really high

       Go watch stuff. Youtube "no plane theory." There's a lot to explain, and quite a few possibilities involved. Needless to say, there are men of great stature, pilots, retired military, etc that have come out as "no planers" to put a tag on it. They bring hard science and physics to the table about subjects that still remain unexplained by the official story. By being able to set aside the fact that (presumably random) video submissions of people saying they "saw a plane!," the theory opens up full scale to all sorts of possibilities. You can weigh the number of people on video saying they saw planes vs the number that didn't hear or see anything before the explosions, and I can promise you that you would be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you a sneak peak: planes, that large, CANNOT fly at the speeds they did, at the altitude they did, and pull the maneuvers they did. Even if they were somehow able to, the sound from full throttle engines and impossible air displacement would have been deafening to all who were present.

       and no youtube. so even if you got footage with your videocamera, how you gonna get it to the public? the distribution was almost entirely controlled.

      <p>
       it's interesting to me that 9/11 needed cgi to be good enough for prime time, but video phones and internet video distribution to not exist yet. there was a very narrow window of time where this could've happened.

       The time you want to skip to is around 9:01 and just let it roll. Watch it on mute once, even, before you watch it with sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take note of the characters on screen and
       <em>
        covering
       </em>
       the event. Make note of who the on-site reporters are - and their relationships with the networks themselves.

       Personally I think they were CIA remote controlled planes that were switched and used to seemlessy fly in which two untrained Muslim terrorists couldn't ever do the first time.This event was too crucial to have the planes miss the towers so why would it be left to chance? That would explain why people that saw the plane didn't recognize it as a commercial jet, it was a silver/gray agency plane.

       I can get behind them being remote controlled, but to say that it wasn't planes hitting the WTC at all is a bit of a stretch.

       Personally I don't know what hit the Pentagon but I think it could have still been some type of plane. "They" want to spread the belief that it wasn't a plane so if they ever release the "real photos" it will show a plane even if it really wasn't.

       It very well could have been, but so much time has passed since 911 so it's likely that any photo/video evidence will have been heavily "edited" and will not portray the full truth.

       Agree. I don't give credence to the idea that these "prophecies" are happening because "God's will." but rather self-fulfilling prophecies that are being pushed by the conglomerate of special interest groups such as Zionists &amp; the Israeli lobbyists. Nothing is ever set in stone.

       I wonder if it would be possible to measure instant down votes with variable of topic search term. Here one user found evidence of instant downvoting tied to username. I don't know enough about Reddit to know how to gather the data set but it would be fairly simple to look at vote fixing for variable of topic with the data

       Socialism is always evil, don't you know?  There's a lot of ancaps here (rwa's / libertarians), not many anarchosyndicalists or agorists.  No one ever talks about the latter..it's not even socialism, it's actually social anarchism

       Proof? Please don't make hard assertions of things that you do not know to be factual. That's "truthiness" at its worst and only does a great disservice to informed discussion. Gullible people will read your assertion and not question your motives or actual knowledge of the situation and take it as fact. It creates a vicious cycle of defamation and disinformation.

       You claimed he is stalling, meaning he's purposefully going slow for some kind of hidden reason. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just be honest and say "

       he is stalling" instead of making a hard assertion that you cannot support? If it's your opinion, like you claim now, they you shouldn't portray it as fact. That's all I'm saying.

       In this sub anything that is pro-Jewish, pro-Sunnis, pro-Trump and pro-West or conversely anti-Bernie, anti-Ataturk, anti-Assad, anti-Putin, anti-Serbia, anti-Iran, anti-Hezbollah, anti-Shia, anti-Catholic, anti-Jesuit, anti- Free Masons will get you downvoted hard and your opinion will be silenced.

       pro-trump stuff is upvoted, anti-bernie is a wash; I would say (in this sub) pro-hillary gets instadownvote, but that's by
       <em>
        us

       , not by
       <em>

       I think there is a lot behind this. In fact the search for Planet X is the reason we found Neptune and Pluto in the first place. Both times they did not explain the perturbations in Uranus' orbit.

       Proof? Please don't make hard assertions of things that you do not know to be factual. That's "truthiness" at its worst and only does a great disservice to informed discussion. Gullible people will read your assertion and not question your motives or actual knowledge of the situation and take it as fact. It creates a vicious cycle of defamation and disinformation.
