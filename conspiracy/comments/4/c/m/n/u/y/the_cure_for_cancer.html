<p>Its as if nobody understands that there are <em>thousands</em> of different forms of cancer, and are all completely different and require different treatments. </p>

<p>Lung cancer is completely separate from Melanoma or Leukemia. </p>

<p>When I hear people say &quot;They already have &#39;a cure&#39; for cancer&quot;, I always ask &quot;really, which cancer?&quot;, and nobody can ever answer. </p>

<p>Not to mention that the only explanation people have is that &quot;they make more money off of treatments then they would off of a cure&quot;, which is blatantly false. If you actually take time to look at the numbers, they would make <em>exponentially</em> more money off of a cure. They could literally set the price at whatever they wanted and reap the insurance companies. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m in the wrong and there really is evidence that suggests that they have a cure for every separate form of cancer, then feel free to educate me. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all here for the same reason, this is just one theory I really can&#39;t get behind.</p>

<p>The main reason people choose cannabis over pharmaceuticals is because of the lack of side effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that there are extremely rare diseases out there, that even Pharma can barely treat (such as Toxoplasmosis). </p>

<p>I agree that the current state of Big Pharma needs to change. If there is a natural remedy for a disease, we should use it. Having a monopoly over human life is wrong. </p>

<p>However, there are only so many naturally occurring chemicals, and not all of them are beneficial. </p>

<p>I agree 100%. However, I think that would lead to the easing out of synthetics, if all compounds/substances were allowed to be fully studied. There are so many lost natural remedies our ancestors used/knew about. This is why I do not think they will ever allow it, as what we&#39;re experiencing now, and I think they know that. Which is why they are against it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also not easily treatable. There is only a 65% survival rate because the best drug we have for it (Deraprim) has been around for ~60 years and can&#39;t specifically target the Toxoplasma, but instead targets <em>everything</em>, which can kill the patient before the Toxoplasmosis does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just smoking/vaping/eating cannabis will not fight the cancer. You need to make some potent Rick Simpson or similar oil take large amounts daily for at least 90 days. Many people have reported success with such a program, however it is hard to really tell the effectiveness  and success rate without good studies and documentation. </p>

<p>Another factor to consider is what type of cannabis is being used, for Rick Simpson oil it generally is a high CBD strain with a lower THC. There are differing opinions are which cannabinoid is more effective, and it may well differ on what you are trying to treat.</p>

<p>Smoking/vaping/eating cannabis can help a lot of people with the side effects of cancer treatment, help them feel better, improve spirits, restore appetite, among other benefits. </p>

<p>I think it is more-so connected to the war on drugs as a whole. There is much more behind TWOD than simply keeping drugs out of our hands. If cannabis is not only legalized, but accepted into the &quot;mainsteam&quot;, then that opens the door for other drugs to be legalized for recreational use. </p>

<p>So essentially, you&#39;re saying that you are directly working with the proposed leader of the NWO? </p>

<p>I&#39;m finding that really hard to believe without any evidence lol. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t honestly believe that. </p>

<p>There are diseases that lay dormant in every human being <em>from conception</em>, and have a &lt;1% chance to &quot;activate&quot;. </p>

<p>No matter how healthy you eat or how much you exercise, there will always be a chance that you are effected by it. </p>

<p>Not every disease has to do with physical health. </p>

<p>Just look at something like schizophrenia for example. </p>

One guy died, one is in remission another is on the way out and one is getting ready for surgery.  I&#39;m not gonna say Fukushima, but I guess I just did.  All aver 40 years old.</p>
