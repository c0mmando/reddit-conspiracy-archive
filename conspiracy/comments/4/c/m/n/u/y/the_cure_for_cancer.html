       Am I the only on who gets a bit annoyed when I hear people talk about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its as if nobody understands that there are
       <em>
        thousands
       </em>
       of different forms of cancer, and are all completely different and require different treatments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lung cancer is completely separate from Melanoma or Leukemia.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I hear people say "They already have 'a cure' for cancer", I always ask "really, which cancer?", and nobody can ever answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that the only explanation people have is that "they make more money off of treatments then they would off of a cure", which is blatantly false. If you actually take time to look at the numbers, they would make
       <em>
        exponentially
       </em>
       more money off of a cure. They could literally set the price at whatever they wanted and reap the insurance companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm in the wrong and there really is evidence that suggests that they have a cure for every separate form of cancer, then feel free to educate me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all here for the same reason, this is just one theory I really can't get behind.

       I doubt there is a cure all patented drug, but cannabinoid oils, along with exercise, and a healthy/non-alkaline diet could very well could cure cancers. Marijuana can be grown in your background, and you can create your own oils. If it can really cure cancer, and everyone has access to it, do you really think that big pharma wants that? They'd lose billions. That's the conspiracy (imo).

       I have always been aware that cancers and virus' thrive in acidic environments and they die in alkaline ones.  Lots of studies on this too.  I understand that too alkaline is not good, but on the slightly alkaline side is good.  It probably has a lot to do with genetics too.

       The problem with cannabis is that, while safe, is not nearly as effective as a lot of current treatments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason people choose cannabis over pharmaceuticals is because of the lack of side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to actual survivability though, it's not even close to the best option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we get an oil potent enough to flat out kill cancer cells, I can't see it making a very big dent in Big Pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire (first) world currently relies on Pharma for everything from a simple cold to life threatening illnesses.

       I agree, in the current state of research, which is why more research needs to be allowed. It's a crime against humanity for them to block it, especially if there is evidence it can eliminate cancer cells (which there is).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think we as humans are moving to the more natural route. People are awakening to the shit these big industries are doing to us. So, I don't think it would eliminate big Pharma over night, but over time is will damage them irreversibly (as they should be).

       The problem is that there are extremely rare diseases out there, that even Pharma can barely treat (such as Toxoplasmosis).
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that the current state of Big Pharma needs to change. If there is a natural remedy for a disease, we should use it. Having a monopoly over human life is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are only so many naturally occurring chemicals, and not all of them are beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that we need an even amount of both natural and synthetic treatments, as very rarely is life black/white.

      <p>
       I agree 100%. However, I think that would lead to the easing out of synthetics, if all compounds/substances were allowed to be fully studied. There are so many lost natural remedies our ancestors used/knew about. This is why I do not think they will ever allow it, as what we're experiencing now, and I think they know that. Which is why they are against it.

       Uh...Toxoplasmosis is not only extremely common, but easily treatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the so-called "synthetic" treatments have their roots in natural treatments...but, in order to them to be legitimately effective, we have to concentrate and tweak them.

       ~2,000 people a year is not extremely common. It lies dormant in all of us, yes, but the amount of humans that it becomes "active" in is extremely low.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also not easily treatable. There is only a 65% survival rate because the best drug we have for it (Deraprim) has been around for ~60 years and can't specifically target the Toxoplasma, but instead targets
       <em>
        everything

       I'm simply saying that,

       (survival rate), it is not the best treatment we currently have.

       Just smoking/vaping/eating cannabis will not fight the cancer. You need to make some potent Rick Simpson or similar oil take large amounts daily for at least 90 days. Many people have reported success with such a program, however it is hard to really tell the effectiveness  and success rate without good studies and documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor to consider is what type of cannabis is being used, for Rick Simpson oil it generally is a high CBD strain with a lower THC. There are differing opinions are which cannabinoid is more effective, and it may well differ on what you are trying to treat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoking/vaping/eating cannabis can help a lot of people with the side effects of cancer treatment, help them feel better, improve spirits, restore appetite, among other benefits.

       You're right to an extent. Nowadays there are

       Start a commercial grow for CBD and see how quickly you get shut down.  That's all you need to know.

       We did everything by the books, and as soon as we changed over to pure CBD we got raided in less than 3 days.

       I, like everyone here, think that our governments suppression of cannabis is downright morally, ethically, and in every way possible wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I don't think that grow ops nor dispensaries being raided/shutdown is
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       linked to cannabis' benefits towards cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is more-so connected to the war on drugs as a whole. There is much more behind TWOD than simply keeping drugs out of our hands. If cannabis is not only legalized, but accepted into the "mainsteam", then that opens the door for other drugs to be legalized for recreational use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think they want their past ~60 years of work to be unraveled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I could be way off base and it really is simply because of cancer.

       It's not just cancer. CBD is helpful for many different ailments. Right now many people suffering from seizures are having amazing treatment through CBD oil. It has been shown to help treat if not be the main treatment for, many different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the conspiracy is so strong against the Pharma industry. Imagine being able to treat dozens to hundreds of ailments through a super easy to grow plant. That certainly sounds to me like a big monetary loss for those in the medicine field.

       Selenium is a cure for various cancers.  So is high dose, IV vitamin C, and so is CBD (cannabidiol)  These things don't cost a lot though compared to expensive poison (chemo, or an hour on a ten million dollar microwave), so that's why doctors say they are invalid, even though their own NIH research proves they work.  This is why I love science, because the truth is rather agnostic and also somewhat democratic (well, until the nsa takes over NIH and starts deleting things...which they WILL do).  Search conspiracy sub for selenium and cbd for my research, getting tired of linking to it sorry

       From everything I have read thus far though, has Vit C and CBD not simply been exceptional at treating some forms of cancer, but not actually been linked to curing it?

       Or am I wrong and they've now been officially linked? Genuinely curious, this shit intrigues me.

       Lol alright, if that's what you're going with. What is your point anyway? The fact that there are multiple types of cancer means we couldn't have discovered a cure for at least one? Explain to me how a one time use cure would make more money than pills that suppress the ailment for a short time and can be sold for a rigged price equal to that of the cure.

       There are thousands of different forms of cancer that require different treatments.

       A cure for one form of cancer will do nothing to another form.

      </p>
      <p>
       There are diseases that lay dormant in every human being
       <em>
        from conception
       </em>
       , and have a &lt;1% chance to "activate".
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how healthy you eat or how much you exercise, there will always be a chance that you are effected by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every disease has to do with physical health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at something like schizophrenia for example.

       Yea, it sounds like I was being B&amp;W, so what I guess I meant was its really all you can do to stay healthy and try to avoid disease.  Ive got a healthy friend, brain cancer, 2 months to live.  So I get you.

       What is really interesting is the fact that I know and have known 4 people that have gotten brain cancer in the past 4 years.  One guy died, one is in remission another is on the way out and one is getting ready for surgery.  I'm not gonna say Fukushima, but I guess I just did.  All aver 40 years old.

       It's gotten to the point where we can't fish in a lot of the areas we used to, because almost all of the fish in the area contaminated by nuclear waste.

       It's awful what we're allowing to happen to this planet.

       I have a theory that it's intentional, but that's for another post.

       Keep me updated on that post.  They must have a way to neutralize it if it is intentional.  I'd rather think we just live in absolute ticking time bomb of insanity.
