<p>The top criminal organization is the Federal Reserve Bank which is privately owned and prints the money that the US government borrows. </p>

<p>The Constitution explicitly says that the government must print/create the money NOT a private bank. </p>

<p>Why are the people letting this go on? A private bank is printing money for itself and then using this worthless “paper” to acquire all things of real wealth like land, rights to natural resources, precious metals, patents, and then when this “paper” crashes, the people will have been robbed of all things of real wealth, and the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank will own all of it.</p>

<p>How stupid are the people  that they would let this robbery slavery go on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top criminal organization is NOT the Federal Reserve. They are a part of a global network of central banks, manipulated in policy by the Bank for International Settlements. The Bank for International Settlements isn&#39;t even the biggest criminal organization. Look more towards &quot;benevolent and friendly societies&quot; for a glimpse into the real power that shapes global policy.</p>

<p>Solutions have been proposed by many (Dean Henderson, Michael Tellinger, The Li berty Movemnt)......but people will have a hard time adjusting to a less industrial pace of life, especially when most with at least upkeep-of-lower-middle-class-survival-money won&#39;t make that drastic a change if HBO, wifi, Starbucks, Macy&#39;s, Sunoco, the internet, Netflix and Wal-Mart are still around and kicking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus I believe that most of society has been conditioned to accept a form of logic that is backwards. Things must be simple, a lie and a con. These are acceptable forms of logic. Complex, true and straightforward are not acceptable. We have not been taught to critically think or analyze facets of society, government or corporate structure. I fear the maze is too complex and the control systems vast. Yea though we know it&#39;s wrong, how can you swim out side of the school without compromising your basic needs? </p>

Sadly enough, these banksters created this situation most people are in and probably Love it. It keeps us preoccupied on what tomorrow will bring and not on the distant future. A future they are stealing. The FED is more powerful than any mob boss and is almost untouchable. Especially with how people&#39;s lives are nowadays, a constant grind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can protest, even rebel until you turn blue in the face ... but it&#39;s never going to end. It&#39;s human nature and the systems arise spontaneously. There is no free will. You either operate within the confines of the system or you perish ... and you and your maladaptive genes will be ruthlessly discarded in the social darwinistic meat grinder we so lovingly call &quot;life&quot;.</p>

<p>The middle class masses have been domesticated since the industrial revolution and these are the very final stages of the endgame. We&#39;ve been physically and psychologically hacked by capitalism to the point where we&#39;re actively being replaced with technology on a massive scale ... and we&#39;re not even responding in self-preservation anymore. We&#39;re essentially digging our own mass graves like captives in a concentration camp from which there isn&#39;t any escape but different forms of death varying only in degrees of pain and length.</p>

<p>Take a good look at kids nowadays. They&#39;re embracing their captivity like hostages suffering from a Stockholm syndrome. These aren&#39;t free humans anymore, these are spineless, subjugated drones programmed to consume themselves to death with absolute garbage. They don&#39;t know any better, they never knew anything else. They were born in the camp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You claim, &quot;The Constitution explicitly says that the government must print/create the money NOT a private bank.&quot;</p>

<p>What the Constitution actually says is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall have the power ...</p>

<p>To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;</p>

<p>To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and in section 10:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No State shall ... coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the Constitutional convention, they considered giving the federal government the power to print paper money (&quot;emit bills of credit&quot;), but decided against it. (<a href="http://www.thegoldstandardnow.org/at-the-constitutional-convention">Source</a>)</p>

<p>The Constitution never says anything about private banks. Back then, lots of banks printed paper money (banknotes) that were redeemable in gold or silver, although not inconvertible bills of credit or &quot;legal tender&quot;.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is not exactly <strong>a</strong> private bank. The Federal Reserve system includes a federal agencies and <em>twelve</em> quasi-private regional banks. Almost all of the profits of the Federal Reserve system goes to the federal government, which has received over a trillion dollars from the Federal Reserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter that Federal reserve profit goes to the government, what matters is the Federal Reserve enforces parasitic, inflationary policies that benefit it&#39;s private member banks but hurt the government and the people.  As long as the government has to pay back it&#39;s budget at interest to private holders of government bonds, it will be forever stuck in a ballooning debt cycle.  The vast majority of America&#39;s debt is simply interest on top of interest, what little the Reserve gives back is nothing compared to what the Government is losing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what Bernie Sanders means when he says that the Fed stole 16+ trillion from us taxpayers.  He&#39;s talking about the federal reserve&#39;s <a href="http://www.sott.net/article/250592-Audit-of-the-Federal-Reserve-Reveals-16-Trillion-in-Secret-Bailouts">secret bailouts for large banks</a> and their raising the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discountrate.htm">&#39;discount&#39; interest rate</a> (it&#39;s a misnomer, there&#39;s no discount)...this is the interest rate the federal reserve  charges on loans to commercial banks.  In other words, when they raise the interest rate, it&#39;s so they can get more money out of taxpayers because the banks will respond by by lowering their savings interest rate and raising their loans interest rates in reponse to the federal interest rate.   </p>

<p>This is trickle-down economics...they pass their &#39;discount&#39; on to you....making whatever your money is worth, worth less (ie: discounted).  </p>

<p>Same thing happens with Quantitative easing (QE) which the Fed also controls, which as you will recall is like splitting a pan of brownies from 6 pieces to 12, you have more brownies (dollars in circulation) but each one is worth less (smaller size)</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want more money (they print it remember), they want people to owe them more money so they have to pay it back with interest (the unpayable debt since every $1 = $1 + x% interest).</p>

<p>Usury = debtors slavery. The power of which some man spoke about; on how controlling the printing money usurps the power of those who write the laws of the land.</p>
