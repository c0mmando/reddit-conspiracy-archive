I believe evil is a mental illness.  Either of perception or of behavior or of empathy.  I beleive in superstition to the extent that the mind creates the world around you, so the power of belief is very real, even if unscentific.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a psychotic break where I felt &#39;haunted by demonic forces&#39;... stuff in my place was moved around in such a way as to cause me fear, venous hum, hypersensitive to sound, heard scratching on walls and stomping in the attic.  It turns out, I was moving stuff and forgetting...I caught myself moving stuff once and then forgetting and then reremembering is how I know.  It was almost like being mind-controlled.  I saw a praying angel statue in a cemetary as covering her face in despair (now that I&#39;m &#39;normal&#39; again, I understand now the flaw in my perception during that time).  Under the influence of a psychosis, the mind filled in details incorrectly and negatively....it was my first foray into insanity and it was not nice but I&#39;m thankful I had it.  Some say it was a shamanic awakening experience--it is another way to describe the things that happened to me.  Again thankful.</p>

<p>Turns out this psychotic break was caused by a poisoning.  I had ingested 1.5 lbs of arsenic and toxic high iron milk powder from Nestle and I figured it out, stopped drinking it and did a rapid detox with large amounts of cilantro juice, iodine, zeolite clay, brown seaweed extract fucoidin.  This is not some wild attack on Nestle either.  I have the assay from a company showing there&#39;s a problem with their product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty retarded of you.  You ask a question, he answers, you call him silly.</p>

<p>You just came here to talk about how Satan is behind everything bad and have a nice echo chamber for your existing views.  You explicitly dismiss an answer that disagrees with you without discussion so why bother asking the question?</p>

<p>Satan is one of many similar manifestations of across all cultures and is simply one more fairy tale used to explain human malfeasance.  But if you need to believe in Satan to make comfortable sense of the world, fine.  Just don&#39;t pretend you want a discussion on the topic when you just want to proselytize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh.  My first inclination was just to answer &quot;no.&quot;  It&#39;s quite straightforward to me and trying to predict why you might disagree with that and addressing those possible things would be a waste of time without hearing a counterpoint.  You gave none anyway.</p>

<p>You asked the question.  Either accept that that is someone&#39;s answer or address why you disagree.  Dismissing them off-hand just serves to illustrate how disingenuous it was of you to phrase this as a question instead of titling it something like &quot;Let&#39;s talk about Satan&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t subscribe to religion because man is entirely capable of horrendous acts on his own without something the blame it on like the devil. </p>

<p>There are however some things I can&#39;t explain nor could others I am pretty sure. </p>

<p>For example. A girl I dated for a long time had this aunt she always warned me about. Said she had something inside of her that wasnt right. (She was native American) </p>

<p>Now g/f mother was one of those evangelical types of batshit crazy. She was all about god and quoting Bible stuff. Well was at her mother&#39;s house for a week cause g/f had some medical thing (can&#39;t member). </p>

<p>Her aunt was living there as well. Well before all this a bit of back story. I used to be friends with this guy in the navy on sub&#39;s. Really enlightened person. He fought me that there are forces (elemental) that exist in all of us. </p>

<p>Some can control fire, wind, and water. Everyone has this ability and he even showed me that he could control wind. It was amazing. He was also able to somewhat control (heat) not like an open flame. </p>

<p>He went outside one day and meditated in the snow. A circle of 3ft around him the snow was melted. Really amazing shit. </p>

<p>Well he explained that never had he met another that could control water. He said that its important to remember that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Since this place (plane of existence) was mostly water that these people would most likely be off.</p>

<p>Back to story. </p>

<p>I walked by the aunts bedroom and heard voices. Not human nor were they radio. These were fear inducing sounds. I am not a linguistic type. I can however say that my Spidey sense was tingling. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t thing anything more then just weird shit OK. </p>

<p>Later that night I walk past the bathroom. She is running water in the bathtub with that creepy vibe. She stops the water and I am not making this up. The water came out of the tub and levitated above the rim yet didn&#39;t spill out. </p>

<p>Picture the water thing from the abyss if you need a mental picture. </p>

<p>Never saw her after that as I noped the fuck out and never returned. So its within all of us to use our natural gifts for good or bad. </p>

<p>People use religion as a crutch to excuse their behavior and shift guilt to something else because they can&#39;t accept the reality they see. Its so much easier to just say let&#39;s label this into a mentally digestible format for everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy was a great friend. He introduced me to MDMA. He explained that its more then just a high. Its more of an experience into our being. </p>

<p>Never did hard drugs before that. Did LSD with him as well. He said it was the key to the door of reality. Said that shrooms were more the peep hole thru the door of reality. </p>

<p>LSD as he explained was more then just seeing it thru your eyes cause you can interact with your environment on lsd while shrooms was more of the observation way. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know man could have been influence more then my own experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. I think that&#39;s why those substances are illegal. I&#39;ve never done any of them, but I&#39;ve heard many stories about it. Also, Ayahuasca. The occult know about these things, and harness them. While we are not allowed. The veil though is being lifted, and there is definitely more to the human story than what we&#39;ve been told.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever thought about ancient history and this stuff? Or the bible or other religions? It seems like this is an unheard of science, and all of these people back then had used these powers in a way. Over time I feel like they are being hidden. I don&#39;t know why. But also secret societies, I feel like they are in this somehow. I don&#39;t know if I could believe all the stuff about it being evil. If it was it seems like it wouldn&#39;t be obvious. Also the sign on the dollar bill, I like to think of it as the founding fathers reminding us about the true god forces, that there really is one. I&#39;ve read that they would have to put these hidden messages because the people who they would need to hide them from would not allow it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I met a guy a few years ago  He was a friend of my brother and he always seemed a little &quot;off&quot;.  There was just something odd about him.  My brother is a lot older than me, so we didn&#39;t hang out, but this guy &quot;Frank&quot; was over at our house occasionally.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t pay much attention to him until somehow we ended up alone together in the garage, a big metal building on our property that my brother and his band used for practice and where we stored farm and garden tools. </p>

<p>As will happen on farms, a wild critter ran across the floor and I screamed like the 9 year old girl I was.  I jumped on top of the lawnmower lest it run up my leg and, I dunno, bit me?  Frank, I guess, wanted to be the hero and chased down the thing that turned out to be a rat. He cornered it and said, &quot;what do you want me to do with it?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Kill it!&quot; shrieked 9 year old me.</p>

<p>And he did.  He stomped on that rat until it was a bloody, hairy smear on the floor.  And he did it with such passion and enthusiasm - like 9 or 10 stomps, way more than was required - I was physically sick.</p>

<p>When he was finished, he grinned at me and my blood ran cold.  I can still remember my heart jumping into my throat and my ears roaring.  I scrambled off the lawnmower and ran into the house.  I found my mom in the kitchen and glued myself to her until Frank went home.  </p>

<p>Now, I was raised on a farm and killing animals is not something I am normally squeamish about. We hunt, we fish, we slaughter cows and I&#39;ve rung more chicken&#39;s necks than I can count.  But watching Frank kill that rat with such gusto convinced me beyond a doubt that evil exists in this world and it exists in Frank especially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this friend growing up with a little brother that was pure evil. If you were his friend which luckily I was no one could look at you the wrong way without him throwing a rock at them. This one time we were riding bikes and I had him on my back pegs. Out of nowhere a dog bolts after us barking. I start to speed up but He decides to jump off and beat the dog senseless. I was relieved to be honest with you that time. Some time later we are outside hanging outside His house and the neighbors dog was barking at us. All of a sudden here He comes out of the house in just His whitey tighties and jumps the fence and beats up a the Doberman like a UFC fighter. He was a 1st grader when all this happened. Now he&#39;s in jail for attempted murder. He shot someone point blank in the eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister has seen demons.</p>

<p>They would be all warped and weird looking.  They would tell at her, and whisper at her.  Always telling lies about her worth and how she wasn&#39;t good enough.  She saw a blue Dragon type thing once.  The same night she saw this creature, my cousin who lived in the same complex as her also saw it.  She said at first she was scared, but she realizes as an adult that she is in tune with herself, and hateful entities don&#39;t want that.  She also believes that these creatures chose a different path then having a physical body, and regret it deeply.  So they exist on the different plane and can influence the true, eternal you.  They knew you before the paths split so can really hit deep.</p>

<p>She can also see pain (shown as blue in her minds eye) and energy blockages in the body (shown as green). She can do this with people she&#39;s barley met.  She can even pinpoint pain they didn&#39;t know they had. She then uses her hands to direct pathways to open up and move more fluently.  She&#39;s psychic and can read situations, dreams and feeling more accurately then anyone I know.  She can tell what is wrong in your body and suggest movements and foods that will aid in fixing the issues.  I tell all my friends she is full of magic.  I honestly believe she is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny story, it turns out psychedelics are being studied for their ability to actually reverse mental disorder, even though &#39;conventional wisdom&#39; (ie: stupidity) says that they caused schizophrenia and other problems.  The latter has been proven to be false. Specifically magic mushrooms and ayahuasca are being evaluated (maps.org).  LSD has yet to give any kind of remarkably positive benefits for mental disorder beyond breaking addiction (alcohol, opiates) and psychological phobias, for which it has proven effective, over 4 decades ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  I will.  She might not know, but might as well try.  She&#39;s super weird though haha.  If she takes Tylenol she has a full on psychedelic trip.  Harder then I&#39;ve ever had, and I have enjoyed some drugs.  She&#39;ll see dancing rats, crawl/scoot to the bathroom and try to shower with the curtain open to &quot; Make a bigger shower&quot;.  During that same episode she kept spinning around and falling over while telling me that &quot;Spinning makes you balanced.&quot;. I gave her innositol (concentrated B vitamins) once and she went insane for 5 minutes.  He skin was crawling, the carpet was growing and wiggiling, she was speaking in gibberish (which she does often enough if she gets really tired), and crawling around.  When she smells food not only can she taste it, but she can pick out the flavonoids in it to pair it with other foods perfectly (best cook I&#39;ve met, and my brother went to culinary school).  On top of that she can also see individual colours that make up a full color.  So she can pin point exactly how much yellow is in a red, where as most of us just see red.  It leads me to believe she has synaesthesia.  Also, as a fun family game around the dinner table we&#39;ll toss coloured energy balls we created at each other.  Who ever catches has to say the colour out loud and she is always right unless someone else&#39;s energy tampers with it.</p>

<p>Anyway, she&#39;s really cool, and generally sociable and loving.</p>
