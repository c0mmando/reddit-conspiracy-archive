       I want to know why the things on the front page of /conspiracy/ (ANY subreddit, rather) don’t actually show up in new, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don’t. There are things on the front page that are never in new. I use new because 1. fuck what “other people” have upvoted (because Reddit’s owners purposely game votes to push hegelian dialectic) and 2. I want to see EVERYTHING that is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       New isn’t everything. I could have sworn it was supposed to be and I’d love an explanation for why it isn’t.

       You couldn't be more wrong. Choose a top thread from this sub right now, and look at when it was posted. Then go to new, and scroll until you find it near that time range. I just did it for the top two. You're making shit up. I understand this sub, but the tendency of some of the users here to find a conspiracy in EVERYTHING is astounding.

       Sometimes they do, but yeah sometimes when I'm bored at home I'll basically sit in the new queue all day (among other subs) and then when I look back at the front page of r/conspiracy, there's links 4-6 hrs old that I never saw once in the new queue.

       I've been here for ~8 years and have never seen this happen anywhere on the site. Everything that gets submitted shows up in the /new/ page (until it gets removed or 'spammed' by reddit itself). I suspect that you're mistaken.

       If a post gets enough upvotes in  a short period of time it moves from /new to the subs front page.  Also if a lot of posts are being made a post can quickly end up on the second or third page of /new.

         </strong>
         Some of the articles and research written and published just few years ago, after
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">
          Mr. Snowden
         </a>
         made his startling revelations about the US Intelligence Community blatantly illegally spying on all US citizens and the methods they use, has either gone completely missing or has been buried under mountains of government/corporate friendly data and lies. The search algorithms, offered to costumers by certain private companies, has been modified to "disappear" the "controversial" data.

           2 Example:
          </em>
         </strong>
         If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you most likely end up with a "The Arabs did it in corporation with Evil Alien Reptilians" style material, which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you can observe how the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a wave of misleading articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum.

         If you post anything on r/news r/conspiracy r/worldnews r/economics about the crushing economic inequality, corporate crimes, financial crimes, financial rigging (LIBOR, FOREX, gold, silver, interest rates) your comments section will be crushed by waves of paid government Sh!lls &amp; Pund!ts (or smart computer algorithms). If your post makes it to the front page, the moderators will immediately remove it. Most "controversial" posts will die a silent death due to rigging of the voting mechanics (their favorite method).

       Just want to add this... do yourself a favor and go through whatever looks interesting. When you see something that looks good,
       <strong>
        upvote

       it.

       By doing so, you will be helping to counteract the negativity and censorship that honest content often receives. You will also be helping to ensure that good content gets the visibility it deserves.

       I know I watch a lot of documentaries and sometimes submit them to
       <a href="/r/documentaries">
        /r/documentaries
       </a>
       . Lately everything I submitted was immediately voted down, long before anyone could watch it. I thought someone was hitting me. I started looking on
       <a href="/r/documentaries/new">
        /r/documentaries/new
       </a>
       and noticed almost everything anyone submitted was immediately voted down. Now they have a bunch of new pro-censorship mods but they deny its them. But someone is doing it.
