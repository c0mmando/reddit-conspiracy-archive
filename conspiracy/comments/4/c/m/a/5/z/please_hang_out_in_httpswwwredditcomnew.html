<p>They don’t. There are things on the front page that are never in new. I use new because 1. fuck what “other people” have upvoted (because Reddit’s owners purposely game votes to push hegelian dialectic) and 2. I want to see EVERYTHING that is posted.</p>

<p>New isn’t everything. I could have sworn it was supposed to be and I’d love an explanation for why it isn’t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Censorship</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Google</em></strong> are all actively rigging the access to &quot;controversial&quot; issues in relation to the 9-11 Attack, US Intelligence Community, Military Industrial Complex, US Warfare, Financial Sector, Mega Corporations, Key Figureheads and Politics. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1 Example:</em></strong> Some of the articles and research written and published just few years ago, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Mr. Snowden</a> made his startling revelations about the US Intelligence Community blatantly illegally spying on all US citizens and the methods they use, has either gone completely missing or has been buried under mountains of government/corporate friendly data and lies. The search algorithms, offered to costumers by certain private companies, has been modified to &quot;disappear&quot; the &quot;controversial&quot; data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2 Example:</em></strong> If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you most likely end up with a &quot;The Arabs did it in corporation with Evil Alien Reptilians&quot; style material, which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you can observe how the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a wave of misleading articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3 Example:</em></strong> If you post anything on r/news r/conspiracy r/worldnews r/economics about the crushing economic inequality, corporate crimes, financial crimes, financial rigging (LIBOR, FOREX, gold, silver, interest rates) your comments section will be crushed by waves of paid government Sh!lls &amp; Pund!ts (or smart computer algorithms). If your post makes it to the front page, the moderators will immediately remove it. Most &quot;controversial&quot; posts will die a silent death due to rigging of the voting mechanics (their favorite method).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Reddit, owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a>, are serving their evil overlords well, this is just another brick in the great wall of lies and disinformation, created by the corporate owned mass media in tandem with the US intelligence community. </p>
