        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have posted about this in the past, but I really cannot seem to stop researching it, and it is something that makes me uncomfortable to talk about with most people for fear of being labeled a bigot, which I am not. In fact, I consider myself an open-minded individual. I decided to write a more organized post about this in hopes that people can chime in with different perspectives/research.</p>

<p><strong>Gender norms have gone out of style:</strong>
<a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/11/30/363345372/for-these-millennials-gender-norms-have-gone-out-of-style">http://www.npr.org/2014/11/30/363345372/for-these-millennials-gender-norms-have-gone-out-of-style</a></p>

<p>So what&#39;s the big deal? Who cares? Let people live how they&#39;d like, right? Well, I&#39;m going to list some things that I feel are <em>problematic</em>.</p>

<p>For one, should children really be able to determine their gender, especially at young ages?</p>

<p>Look at Jacob&#39;s Journey:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/transgender-kids/jacobs-journey-life-transgender-5-year-old-n345131">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/transgender-kids/jacobs-journey-life-transgender-5-year-old-n345131</a></p>

<p>Would we trust a 5-year old with any major decision? Would we trust a 5-year old to get a tattoo, for example? You would probably say no, but why do we (much of society) now trust a 5-year old to make a decision like this?</p>

<p><em>Personal anecdote:</em> I was convinced I was a lesbian when I was 13. It took me many years to figure out my sexuality, and I now know that that would have been really harmful to me if I actually came out as a lesbian at that age. I am definitely straight, but I can see why now (in hindsight) I truly thought I was a lesbian. If you are interested, I&#39;ll discuss this further...</p>

<p>Here is an article about the dangers of gender conversion therapy in children:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/must-put-end-gender-conversion-therapy-kids/">http://www.wired.com/2015/07/must-put-end-gender-conversion-therapy-kids/</a></p>

<p>Edit: may have been confused about what this article was actually saying - my apologies, but I&#39;ll leave it.</p>

<p>If you do a simple google search on transgender children, nearly all articles that pop up are positive. There clearly is a bias in the scientific community on this topic. With something complex as this, you think you would see a more balanced view on the topic, especially in a search engine (haha, I am aware of Google&#39;s manipulation of information - another conspiracy of course).</p>

<p><strong>What is the conspiracy?</strong></p>

<p>There are several conspiracies associated with this, and a simple google/youtube search will get you everything from destruction of family/society to satan/illuminati based content. I&#39;m going to try to post some things that I feel are most relevant to this discussion board. It&#39;s interesting that is really hard to find articles that do not promote how fabulous gender fluidity is...and I do not think that is a coincidence.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that I have nothing personal against any individual. My concern is that the destruction/confusion of gender roles will have a negative impact on society (and it already has). Let us also keep in mind that there is a lot of misinformation surrounding the benefits of sex changes, when in reality, many sex changes are not effective.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/health.mentalhealth">http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/health.mentalhealth</a></p>

<p>Though this article is from 2004, you can find many examples of people regretting sex changes, even remaining suicidal and depressed after the fact. Edit: here is something more recent about pushing gender choices too early:</p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/06/14/push-for-kids-to-choose-gender-identities-too-early-could-backfire/">http://nypost.com/2015/06/14/push-for-kids-to-choose-gender-identities-too-early-could-backfire/</a></p>

<p>So, again, what would be the conspiracy behind destroying gender roles as we know them? I am going to do my best to be succinct here because this can go in many directions.</p>

<p>As you can already see, gender fluidity has increased. As this trend continues, the destruction of the traditional male and female gender roles will break down more and more. Now as there continues to be more acceptance of this (and there is), we will start to see more acceptance in other areas (bestiality, pedophilia) - though who knows what can happen with that.</p>

<p>In a brave new world style fashion, (<a href="http://www.henrymakow.com/brave_new_world.html">http://www.henrymakow.com/brave_new_world.html</a>), &quot;Recreational sex is also an integral part of society. According to &quot;The World State&quot; (New World Order Government), sex is a social activity, not a means of reproduction, and sexual activity, including homosexuality, is encouraged from early childhood. Fertile women are conditioned to use birth control.</p>

<p>The maxim &quot;everyone belongs to everyone else&quot; (sexually) is repeated often, and the idea of a &quot;family&quot; is considered pornographic. Love and emotional relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed.</p>

<p>Marriage, natural birth, parenthood, and pregnancy are considered too obscene to be mentioned in casual conversation. Thus, &quot;society has advanced to a new level of sexual comprehension&quot;.</p>

<p>The population is limited to no more than two billion people, and everyone is promised happiness. Natural reproduction has been done away with, and children are decanted and raised in &quot;Hatcheries&quot; and &quot;Conditioning Centres.&quot; No more family relationship; no more mothers and fathers; no more grand parents, brothers and sisters; no cousins, no uncles and aunts, no more family. </p>

<p>In this &quot;satanic idealization&quot; of the human future, totally cut-off from God and healthy human nature, the population of the world is &quot;unified&quot; under &quot;The World State&quot;, where the promise is an eternally peaceful, stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful.&quot;</p>

<p>Far-fetched? I don&#39;t really think so.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate that a person&#39;s sexuality/sexual desires are not so important to me. However, we have gotten to a point where are sexual selves become our defining characteristics, when there is much more that makes us human.</p>

<p>I also want to connect this with &#39;trans-humanism.&#39; Perhaps the other conspiracy is to create a more genderless society so that trans-humanism is easier to establish in the long run. In fact, trans-humanism is becoming quite popular:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/a-new-generation-of-trans_b_4921319.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/a-new-generation-of-trans_b_4921319.html</a></p>

<p><strong>More Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I never want to undermine somebody&#39;s struggles with his/her/whatever sexual identity. At the same time, in our efforts to be overly politically correct, we are not even thinking about how this will impact our children and the future in the long run. I think this is a huge deal, and I cannot believe I do not see more posts about it throughout this site that are not significantly and automatically downvoted. If you have nothing else to contribute, what are your thoughts on this video?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4kbybo60Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4kbybo60Y</a></p>

<p>Note that in this video, that once children go through the transgender hormone therapy, they will be sterile. Will all this confusion of gender norms eventually create sterilization in our society, again going back to the Brave New World dystopian idea of the future.</p>

<p>There is a lot more that can be said here. I wanted to start off with some points, and I&#39;m thinking we can go from there!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read and contribute. I hope this opens up some good discussion. </p>

I would never deny the existence of trans people, or even trans children, but when we start treating every single issue a person experiences as well &quot;they are just born that way&quot;, we are seriously undermining the power of society and environment.</p>

<p>For one, the bigger conspiracy is probably about all of the chemicals in our food and water. I should have posted more about that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well honestly from my point of view, even with all the time you&#39;ve taken for your opening statement, it&#39;s no different an argument to me than how certain people argued that &#39;gay marriage&#39; was going to literally end the world. </p>

<p>It&#39;s called progress... More different type of people are being accepted as actual humans. That&#39;s all you are seeing. </p>

<p>And even if many millennials are suddenly toying with gender and mixing traditionally female and male fashions even if they aren&#39;t actually trans, what&#39;s the big deal? </p>

<p>I also just kind of find it bewildering when any woman argues for traditional gender roles, like... do you know what you are asking for? </p>

<p>Actually if you really research feminism, you&#39;d be surprised in who was involved in the promotion of certain feminism concepts, like women working outside the home.</p>

<p>I know what you are talking about but no thank you. To me it does not matter what kind of elites profitted off of women&#39;s suffrage.  Sorry but women still want to be free and still fight to be treated equal to men. Under capitalism the elite always profit. Doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t work to do or real progress to be made. </p>

<p>Lol what do you miss about not having a choice though? You are free to be a housewife if you wish to have that life, you are also free to make other choices too. Wouldn&#39;t you want that if you ever have girl children? </p>

<p>What exactly do you miss about traditional gender roles that you can not have today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually wasn&#39;t talking about suffrage. There was a huge push to get both men and women working. In the past, there could be one income, and a whole family would be fine. It turned into two people working full time, and that even does not a support a family very well anymore.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important that my words are not taken out of context. It&#39;s not so much that I am anti-feminism. I like that women have a choice. However I am saddened that ideas of masculinity and feminity are slowly being erased. I do think they had their place in society. That&#39;s just a personal preference though, and we are all entitled to that, as you seem to believe.</p>

<p>Also I think there are women who believe every viewpoint of feminism without any question. I feel that is dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But when you break them down what is masculinity and what is femininity? Strength vs empathy? Harshness vs softness? What of a man who is sensitive and quiet? What of a woman who is loud and strong? </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with any trait that you or i would label feminine or masculine, what is wrong is to say &#39;this&#39; isn&#39;t for men or &#39;that&#39; isn&#39;t for women. It makes individuals feel as though they are wrong and unnatural when every individual is different. </p>

<p>If it weren&#39;t for gender roles, couldn&#39;t we all just be ourselves much easier? Why do we have to force pink and dolls onto girls and blue and trucks onto boys? Is that truly innate? Maybe for some but I do wonder what would happen if we treated all babies the same. </p>

<p>It is true that we&#39;ve had a lot of downfalls but this is not so much due to women entering the workforce as it is due to women&#39;s work being UNDERVALUED. Women are still paid less for the same work as men. Black people are paid less for the same work as white people. Disabled people are paid less for the same work as able-bodied ppl. etc</p>

<p>We have to value ppl equally. There are many downfalls to capitalism and the system we live in but allowing individuals more freedoms in choice, to decide how to live or decide how to be themselves, i don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. Here&#39;s my two cents. </p>

<p>As a &quot;normal&quot; American boy raised on movies like <em>American Pie</em> and <em>Old School</em>, I definitely came to view sex as a recreational/social activity. To me, sex was just a fun activity that felt really good. Given the state of modern birth control, I didn&#39;t see any reason <em>not</em> to have lots of sex. People who dated for months before &quot;going all the way&quot; seemed old-fashioned. I didn&#39;t get it. </p>

<p>However, mid-way through college my views started to change. I began to notice that sex was being used for odd purposes. There were multiple false-rape accusations on campus, and certain gay kids would say that any straight behavior was &quot;heteronormative and oppressive.&quot; </p>

<p>Furthermore, I started to tire of the idea that &quot;going out and hooking up with hot chicks&quot; is this super-cool thing for all young people to do. It&#39;s not that I consider hooking up morally wrong or anything, it&#39;s just...kind of an illusion in some ways. Like, how many random hook ups happen without alcohol? And do they really live up to the hype - like Rock Stars sing about? </p>

<p>Perhaps I sound a little &quot;square&quot; now, but it is weird to me that two hundred years of sexual mores just <em>changed</em> on a dime in the 60s. Of course there has always been lots of sex behind the scenes, but I don&#39;t think it was ever <em>institutionalized</em> like it is now with open acceptance of porn, sex Ed, etc. </p>

<p>The blogger Roosh also made a really good point, which very much changed my thinking. He notes that &#39;liberal&#39; stances on sex and the social issues all share one thing in common: they either directly or indirectly limit human reproduction. He writes of each liberal position: </p>

<p>&quot;-Abortion is a bodily “choice,” not human murder. <strong>Result: it decreases population.</strong></p>

<p>-Birth control is a “choice” that allows women to better practice consumer lifestyles. <strong>Result: it decreases population.</strong></p>

<p>-Promotion of sterile human relationships in the form of homosexuality and transsexuality can’t possibly result in the creation of life. <strong>Result: it decreases population, reproduction, and traditional family formation.</strong></p>

<p>He then links to a chart showing that birth rates in the Western world have been steadily declining since WW2. Given the elite&#39;s obsession with population control (this could be good or bad, I&#39;m not entirely sure), this all seems to make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>Basically, I think the things we&#39;re taught about sex are more myth than reality. Speaking as a guy, there&#39;s a lot of mythology around being The Man who gets all the girls, but it just never really turns out like the movies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why many modernized countries go toward 2 children per couple is that they embraced a new economic model.  In the old one, more children meant more hands to work the family land or fulfill roles in the tribe.  </p>

<p>In the modern world time is exchanged for money, so there is a limited amount of time and money available to raise children.  Raising a child takes time and that reduces income potential and vice versa.  So, people correctly choose to have fewer kids to be able to have enough time and money to support them.</p>

<p>This right here is what is wrong with our society; the fact that people are deathly afraid to be thought of as &#39;a bigot&#39; or &#39;racist&#39; just mystifies me.  It is the modern equivalent of people being put in the stocks in the center of town because they saw a woman&#39;s ankle or whatever.  Just people being superstitious and irrational, like they always have.  History will not be kind to political correctness.</p>

<p>Would we trust a 5-year old with any major decision? Would we trust a 5-year old to get a tattoo, for example? You would probably say no, but why do we (much of society) now trust a 5-year old to make a decision like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The decision at that age is not permanent. There&#39;s no medical intervention at all pre-puberty, and at the onset of puberty the only intervention is reversible puberty-blocking drugs. The first irreversible treatment given is hormone therapy at around 14-15, which has <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract">good outcomes</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an article about the dangers of gender conversion therapy in children:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just so you know, &#39;conversion therapy&#39; doesn&#39;t refer to letting the kids transition. It refers to trying to suppress or remove their identification as the opposite sex.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to make it clear that I have nothing personal against any individual. My concern is that the destruction/confusion of gender roles will have a negative impact on society (and it already has). </p>

<p>This sounds like sort of an &#39;underpants gnome&#39; sort of claim: 1. destroy gender roles, 2. ???, 3. downfall of society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us also keep in mind that there is a lot of misinformation surrounding the benefits of sex changes, when in reality, many sex changes are not effective. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/health.mentalhealth">http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/health.mentalhealth</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That article is well over a decade old, and doesn&#39;t say what you think it says. It says that the evidence at the time indicating that it <em>was</em> effective had possible methodological gaps, which it did. But there&#39;s been a whole lot of research done since, and studies overwhelmingly show that post-transition trans people are better off. See, among many others,</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract">Heylans <em>et al.</em></a>, 2014: &quot;A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract">Colizzi <em>et al</em>.</a>, 2013: &quot;At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR [&#39;cortisol awakening response&#39;, a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P &lt; 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P &lt; 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168">Gomez-Gil <em>et al</em>.</a>, 2012: &quot;SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Though this article is from 2004, you can find many examples of people regretting sex changes, even remaining suicidal and depressed after the fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotes prove little, and broad-scale surveys show regret rates of only a few percent (and most of those were because they didn&#39;t get results as good as they&#39;d hoped, not because they were &#39;wrong&#39; about their identification).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you can already see, gender fluidity has increased. As this trend continues, the destruction of the traditional male and female gender roles will break down more and more. Now as there continues to be more acceptance of this (and there is), we will start to see more acceptance in other areas (bestiality, pedophilia) - though who knows what can happen with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, the exact same slippery slope argument that has <em>literally never been right in the history of the world</em>. That argument gets made on literally every single liberalization of sexual or gender roles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lt;brave new world excerpt&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we generally agree that Brave New World&#39;s future isn&#39;t an ideal one. But you&#39;ve yet to show any causal link for how trans people would, as you seem to implicitly claim, get us there. Just because one thing is similar doesn&#39;t mean everything is - it&#39;s a &quot;Hitler ate sugar&quot; type of argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, I never want to undermine somebody&#39;s struggles with his/her/whatever sexual identity. At the same time, in our efforts to be overly politically correct, we are not even thinking about how this will impact our children and the future in the long run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh really? I&#39;ve thought <em>plenty</em> about it, and I think the conclusion is very clear: trans people should have access to transition, because it is greatly beneficial to them and harms no one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that in this video, that once children go through the transgender hormone therapy, they will be sterile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, yes, that is true (until we can stem-cell our way to functional gonads, anyway). But so what? Are we claiming vasectomies are now a tool of the Illuminati or whatever because they prevent reproduction?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a push for <em>acceptance</em> of fluid or non-standard gender identities because, to be frank, people are assholes about it. I got kicked out of my family when I came out, which I can promise you was not fun. Why wouldn&#39;t I push, and why wouldn&#39;t others who know similar stories push, for greater acceptance?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing about the individual existence of Transgender people. I am arguing that there may be large influences pushing people toward Transgenderism  (or any of the labels) that people may not be aware of. Chemicals in food and water? Propaganda in society? Biased studies? My question to the board is could there be something larger here, and is it affecting individuals more than it should?</p>

<p>We have already seen an increase in gender fluidity in millennials. Could this be the fact that people are more accepting and people are more willing to &quot;come out?&quot; Absolutely. Could it mean there is something larger pushing people in that direction? That&#39;s the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have three explanations but I can&#39;t take credit for one of them.</p>

<ol>
<li>) It&#39;s that they are trying to create more genders to market to.  Thomas Sheridan discusses this brilliantly in &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j39MNMZueyA">The Sigil and the Salespitch</a>&quot;.  You really need to listen to this video--its one of the best there is on this very subject.</li>
<li>) It&#39;s that it&#39;s a gnostic globalist (rosicrucian alchemists) ritual of alchemical marriage between opposites, the &#39;coincidencia oppositorum&#39;--they aren&#39;t trying to flip (postop) genders, they are specifically trying to create &#39;stuck in-between&#39; pre-op transmen and transwomen in an act of human instrumentality (forced evolution)...  FIrst you combine genders into androgyne...then combine with computers to make androidgyne</li>
<li>) From a more nefarious perspective, that there is a <em>&#39;neo-Lebensb(p)orn&#39;</em> eugenics (reduce population) effort happening to bring about a few trends:

<ul>
<li>Evolving porn into something more mainstream, through this trick called the &#39;porn music video&#39; or PMV, &#39;compilations&#39;,  &#39;trainers&#39; and &#39;hypno&#39; type videos (messages overlayed on top of compilation video).  By tying porn to pop music and EDM music, the video can manufacture a cognitive jump of social acceptance of porn / porn messaging in the viewer.</li>
<li> The fact that these PMV videos persist means they&#39;ve not violated copyrights and therefore there&#39;s a LOT of money and high production value (ie: video editing skill) behind these videos.  Think about that.  (google deep slut puppy vanilla) Othewise xvideos and xhamster and the like would have the shit sued out of them because they are actually many times the primary producer of these videos, even though they are apparently not monetized (no video ads) and... so how they are making their money back is puzzling to say the least (it cannot simply be from webcam banner ads alone--no one clicks that shit).  I&#39;ve never paid for porn and probably watched 1000 hours of it over the last 2 decades.  My point is there is LOADs of money thrown at these videos, but with no attempt to get the money back. Therefore I can conclude that the &quot;medium is the message&quot;--they dont&#39; need your money, they need your attention.  Think about why porn tube sites work WAY faster than youtube ever did, even at night.  My conclusion is that Porn is some kind of mass social-behavior / mind-control effort.<br/></li>
<li>Porn addicts usually have troubled relationships / don&#39;t want to f their wife</li>
<li>Shemale porn has skyrocketted in terms of proliferation, prominence and consumption--ask any pornographer that it&#39;s the fastest growing demo in the industry in the last 15 yrs...starting around 1998 ish.  See for yourself with google trends.</li>
<li>Shemale &#39;hypno&#39; style videos (NSFW / gay/bi =&gt; <a href="/r/sissyhypno">/r/sissyhypno</a>) are all over xvideos/hamster now to the extent that its sometimes difficult to avoid them.  Now people have to put &#39;vanilla&#39; into the title just so they know there&#39;s not bisexual or gay stuff in the video.</li>
<li>Hypno videos by at least 3 artists will subliminally flash a Shutzstaffel SS runes inside of a female symbol as a calling card.  It may be a game (ie: video edite by trans for trans (ex: annamalice)---the artists fashion themselves to trans-dominatrix in the nazi-occult thanateros sex-death goth fetish tradtition for example,  but I personally think it is much more than that)</li>
<li>The hypno videos try to make white men into females who like black men (&#39;sissification videos&#39;).  Obviously your choice to watch them, but damn there&#39;s so many of them now.   So if you assume they are nazi occultists making these videos as a kind of mass mind control program of anyone &#39;bi-curious&#39;, then the effort is to transify them into female and bisexualize black men, pitting two &#39;socially repugnant-to-right-wing-authoritarians&#39; groups against each other to remove them from the gene pool as <em>an effort of porn-mediated eugenics.</em>  I have to acknowledge that this is a lot nicer than putting them into gas chambers--making them a bunch of incredibly skillful porn that ostensibly violates so many copyrights like they &#39;just don&#39;t care about it&#39;.</li>
<li>Because of SJWhood, you aren&#39;t allowed to say anything like I&#39;ve said above about transpeople unless you are yourself a transperson.  In this way, they&#39;ve created a kind of <em>sjw entitlement forcefield around themselves</em> wherein they get to be an <em>insular elite class that no one can remark about</em>.  In this way, they are akin to the <em>ancient Japanese Samurai of the Tokugawa Shogunate</em>, their <em>sword is a finger snap</em> and head snaking, &#39;oh no you <em>didnt</em> just say something gender insensitive&#39;.</li>
</ul></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all of the above is true, but one thing is that transsexuals are essentially the perfect &quot;elective patients&quot;.  In other words, biologically healthy individuals who consume health care at a very high rate for life.  </p>

<p>A.  First, you have the hormone thing.  Two drugs, a blocker for the hormone you make, and the opposite sex hormone.  Both for life.</p>

<p>B.  Regular visits to an endocrinologist to check said hormone levels, as well as visits to the GP for normal health stuff.  </p>

<p>C.  The surgeries required to switch genders.</p>

<p>D. The aftercare of those surgeries.</p>

<p>Just calculate the money spent to pull this off.  Probably $10k conservatively per person.  And the latest effort is to force insurance to cover these treatments.  In fact, that Bradley Manning was denied this after being put in prison for essentially treason, shows just how far we are.  Imagine the money to be made by creating a problem that costs several thousand dollars and creates a lifetime patient.  </p>

<p>What gets me is that while the above elective treatment is covered, there are lots of poor people who can&#39;t even afford a doctor or dentist.  For years.  If you&#39;re poor, you simply don&#39;t see a doctor.  There&#39;s no money in treating a poor, but there&#39;s lots of support for treating an upper class transsexual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feminism and blurring the lines between male and female only exist to destroy the sanctity of <strong>family</strong>... It&#39;s disgusting. God made them man and woman. And woman was not meant to be made equal to man. (And I say this being a woman myself!)</p>

<p>When women are viewed as equals to men by society, they will begin to be looked down upon for taking on the submissive role that they were meant to have. The next generation is loaded and ready for this to occur. And what happens next? Now we say, a man that doesnt get off his ass and work for his family is worthless! What happens when society starts saying a woman that doesn&#39;t help her husband provide is worthless as well! (Though it&#39;s already beginning!) When a woman that stays home to tend to the house and raise her children with the love and care that no one but a father or mother can provide is looked down upon, you know we&#39;ve lost! When the parents are expected to leave their children with <em>strangers</em> that can&#39;t possibly love and care for our children the way we do... (And look around, it&#39;s already happening!) The society that operates under these ideals is disgusting, and will only serve to destroy.</p>

<p>Micah 2:9-10 <em>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</em></p>

<p><em>Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christianity isn&#39;t all about mushy gooey loving people the way that you think, and coincidentally, the way a lot of churches decide to preach.. Even Daniel said in Psalms that he hated those who hate the Lord...</p>

<p>Psalm 139:19-22 <em>Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</em></p>

<p><em>For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</em></p>

<p><em>Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</em></p>

<p><em>I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</em></p>

<p>And according to the Bible, loving someone means caring for <em>their soul</em>.. Loving someone means preaching to them and warning them against sin! And a man laying with a man, or a woman laying with a woman is most definitely sinful.</p>

<p>If you are a true follower of Christ, you love others by preaching to them so that they might be saved also. Being persecuted and hated whilst preaching the truth all to save <em>someone else</em>! THAT is true love! And that is the love that Christ taught.</p>

<h2>1 John 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</h2>

    <div class="md"><p>Kid, you really have met your match here.</p>

<p>Eating shellfish and wearing mixed materials were cardinal ordinances, which have been done away with in Christ.</p>

<p>Cor 2:16-17 <em>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</em></p>

<p>The difference is that eating shellfish and wearing mixed materials was not decreed an abomination. These were instead symbolic cardinal ordinances which were a shadow of things to come. Homosexuality, however, was and still is an abomination. As Christ said,</p>

<p>Matthew 15:11 <em>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</em></p>

<p>Matthew 15:17-20 <em>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? But those things which proceed out of the mouth</em> <strong>come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</strong> <em>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</em></p>

<p>Wearing mixed clothing and eating shellfish does NOT DEFILE A MAN!! However, when a man <strong>lusts</strong> after another man in his heart, he IS defiling himself, not only because homosexuality is an abomination, but also because a man can <strong>never</strong> be married to another man in the eyes of the Lord, and thus it will always be <em>fornication</em> as well. As Christ said,</p>

<p>Matt 5:28 <em>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</em></p>

<p>Whether or not you ever have physical relations with a member of the same sex, if you have found it in your heart to lust after someone of the same sex, you have committed not only homosexuality in your heart but fornication in your heart as well.</p>

<p>Matt 19:4-5 <em>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</em></p>

<p>Anyone who says otherwise is preaching against what the Bible taught, and what Christ taught. Such are false prophets. And this is what Paul had to say about such:</p>

<p>Galatians 1:6-10 <em>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another</em>; <strong>but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ</strong>. <em>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you</em>, <strong>let him be accursed.</strong> <em>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</em></p>

<p><em>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</em></p>

<p>They preach these things to please men. When the Bible clearly condemns homosexuality! The Bible says not to be effeminate! </p>

<p>1 Cor 6:9-10 <em>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</em></p>

<p>They preach these things to please men because men don&#39;t want to be accused of their sins! The Bible even says this!</p>

<p>John 3:19-21 <em>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and</em> <strong>MEN LOVED DARKNESS RATHER THAN LIGHT, BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL!</strong> <em>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,</em> <strong>LEST HIS DEEDS SHOULD BE REPROVED!</strong> <em>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</em></p>

<p>Pointing out the speck in <em>your eye</em>:</p>

<p>1) You are not my brother. Brother refers to brethren <strong>in Christ.</strong></p>

<p>2) This verse means do not accuse your brother when you are guilty of the same thing. I am not guilty of homosexuality, clearly, as I am condemning it. Neither am I judging you. There is one that judges you. And he already has judged you and condemned you, with the words written in this Bible.</p>

<p>John 3:17-18 <em>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but</em> <strong>he that believeth not IS CONDEMNED ALREADY,</strong> <em>because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</em></p>

<p>I am merely preaching to remind you of what the Lord has <strong>already judged.</strong> And I will continue to preach the truth, because that is what the Lord has told His children to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I think we should seriously investigate chemical pollution altering our sexuality, I think so much of the fear of sexual variety comes from the fear of the judgement of God.  </p>

<p>Evidence of this is visible in the often made assertion that homosexuality is a choice.  Many Christians have evolved on that, but many haven&#39;t.  If one truly believes the Bible is the word of God, then one believes homosexuality is sin, because it says so.  If homosexuality is sin, then it either is a choice or God is extremely mean to homosexuals expecting them to change something they can&#39;t or live in a personal hell where they can&#39;t express themselves as they are.  So, the true believer chooses to believe that homosexuality is a choice to avoid believing God is being extremely unfair to a portion of the population, which would make him seem like an evil god.  Good people don&#39;t want to follow an evil god.</p>

<p>Look at how many posts and posters with fear of sexual variety express a faith in God, almost always Christianity for those typing in English online.  It&#39;s because the Bible is believed to contain God&#39;s words.  The Bible says that sex should be only heterosexual and within the confines of marriage.  So, faithful people get scared that we are doing something wrong and offending God just by allowing other people to express themselves as <em>they</em> feel that they are.</p>

<p>I actually do believe in God.  Belief in a creator is not the issue.  Belief without question in the words of men purported to be the words of God is the problem, dogmatic belief.  One can question the purported words of God delivered by human beings to varying degrees or go all the way.  I consider this dogmatic belief to be the line dividing spirituality from religion.  The differences between religion and spirituality stem from this personal decision to believe or not believe what other people tell you about God.  </p>

<p>This is why spiritual people are uncertain of their own beliefs/ideas, question their own beliefs/ideas, listen to new beliefs/ideas, change their beliefs/ideas over time, are more tolerant of other people&#39;s beliefs/ideas, and are typically less fearful of God than religious people are.</p>

<p>Religious people are certain of their own beliefs (believing faith is a virtue), are often afraid to question their own beliefs (fear of lack of faith, damnation), are afraid to consider new beliefs, don&#39;t change their beliefs over time very much (fear of abandoning the religion/God, so not accepting Jesus as one&#39;s savior, inviting damnation), are afraid to tolerate other people&#39;s beliefs/ideas because they think they know they are misleading people (faith), and are more fearful of God (fear of eternal pain for so many things), <em>&quot;God fearing&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>How can one know for sure what God said?  The Bible?  The Torah?  The Koran?  The Book of Mormon?  None of us believe that <em>all</em> of these books contain the authentic words of God, but there are places in this world where <em>each</em> of these books is believed by many or a majority to contain the words of God.  Obviously, just because a book does not contain the genuine words of God, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s all false.  </p>

<p>The story of Jesus is awesome and his teachings are timeless and relevant to our lives, even many atheists/agnostic/spiritual people agree with them.  Jesus&#39; teachings are the Christian values that we aught to be practicing; forgiveness of others; expressing a non-judgemental attitude toward others, listening to our enemies, helping the weak and needy, exercising compassion (love) toward other people, living with personal integrity, avoiding hypocrisy.  Just because a religion uses the name of Jesus, it doesn&#39;t mean that encourages people to practice his teachings.  </p>

<p>The teachings of the adversary/Lucifer/Satan/devil/divine illness/anti-life machine/whatever you call the archetype of evil, are the exact opposite of Jesus&#39; teachings and express competition to its extreme rather than cooperation; vengeance toward others, judgement of others, condemning and not listening to our enemies, taking advantage of the weak and needy, exercising power over other people (control by fear), living outside of personal integrity for personal pleasure, expressing rampant hypocrisy without remorse.</p>

<p>Instead of insisting that one particular book contains the words of God while the others don&#39;t, why not just look inside ourselves and ask the tough questions about God and beliefs without evidence?  Are we too afraid of damnation to consider the idea that we are being used and abused by men using the image of God to control us?  Does questioning religious belief negate the existence of God?  No, it doesn&#39;t.  Let&#39;s stop fearing God and start loving God, creation, each other and ourselves, as we actually are.  Fear gets in the way of that all too well, but it is something we choose to experience with our choice of beliefs that elicit it.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, because it shuts down our hearts and minds.</p>

<p>Would we trust a 5-year old with any major decision? Would we trust a 5-year old to get a tattoo, for example? You would probably say no, but why do we (much of society) now trust a 5-year old to make a decision like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree about children not being able to make fully informed decisions, one can only hope that some restrictions will be put in place to protect them.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, I do think the percentage of people who are actually transgender/gender-fluid as adults has not changed that drastically (not counting the individuals who just hop on the bandwagon for awhile). Due to intolerance and bigotry many people were very in the closet about these issues for hundreds of years in America.  In fact, there have been transgender people here since long before the white man arrived.  Now that there are protections in place and the fear has slightly subsided, it just seems more common since it is more out in the open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people are just generally so unhappy because society and the economy suck so bad, that they turn to things like transgender ism, hoping it will make them happy. And our society is obsessed with gender, so it breeds a curiosity to see &quot;the other side&quot;. Also notice how much more common it is for males to transition to females instead of viceversa. Females have a lot of power in today&#39;s society, and I think a lot of people are attracted to that, and want to be that. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Interesting analogy.  To make it more accurate, imagine that society has a coming-of-age ceremony where pubescent people get either a male tattoo or a female tattoo put on them.  Puberty is like this, in that it is the turning point in life where major sex-specific changes occur as a matter of course.</p>

<p>So, imagine that some people say that this is the wrong tattoo for them.  We can make it a Bloods tattoo and a Crips tattoo if you want to move the analogy away from the gender.  A kid is about to get their Crips tattoo (or female tattoo), and they want to have a Bloods tattoo (male tattoo) instead.  Them doing so is equivalent to transition.  Them being allowed to postpone the tattooing for a few years is equivalent to using hormone-blockers to postpone breast or beard growth until they are a little older.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Related thoughts on casual sex:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought very deeply about sex lately.  It&#39;s probably because I&#39;ve been single for the first time in a few years, but it&#39;s been refreshing.</p>

<p>There is very strong programming in our society to treat sex as a transaction.  I especially notice this in sexually charged places, such as bars and clubs, and even more so on Tinder.  Sex is treated as a commodity, something that people are supposed to give each other (especially that women are supposed to give men), assuming the &quot;negotiation&quot; goes well.  It&#39;s treated as this drug of sorts, that everyone needs to get high off of, and get high as frequently as possible.  The quality of the high is second to the quantity of the high.  That&#39;s the societal programming that we are raised in.</p>

<p>The concept of &quot;objectification of women&quot; has finally hit home, even though I&#39;m much older than I want to admit to have finally realized it.  As much as women talk about the programming to be sexually attractive at all times, men are given the same programming <em>about women</em>.  Men are quick to categorize women into sexual viability categories - &quot;yes I would have sex with her, so I will be friendly with her&quot; or &quot;she seems like a slut, I should try to take her home right now&quot; or &quot;I think she&#39;s ugly&quot; or &quot;I think she&#39;s fat.&quot;  As awful as it sounds, those are the primal programming messages that flow through the male mind.  And it is reinforced with women - they might think if they aren&#39;t having sex, that something is wrong with them, that they are ugly, fat, or otherwise undesirable.  If men aren&#39;t having sex, we are taught to think that we aren&#39;t macho enough, or suave enough, and that we are a failure.  Our society places so much personal worth on the quantity of sex a person is having.</p>

<p>I think that also drives the counter-culture of anti-sex.  The culture is so hyper-sexualized, that the opposite is complete lack of sex and sexual identity.  It&#39;s the only way that some people can feel important, because they are taught to think that they aren&#39;t important without sex.</p>

<p>The best sex is never with a one-night stand.  One-night stands are such a low-vibration way to have sex.  It&#39;s so cold, transaction, unemotional.  It feels so foreign, because sex is literally the deepest physical and emotional connection that human beings can have with each other.</p>

<p>The best sex comes from a unique emotional attraction with another.  Even if you haven&#39;t known that person for very long, you know almost immediately when you meet someone, how deep your emotional connection is with them.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m looking for in my next partner is someone that I hope has a similar mindset, whether they know it or not.  I want to make love to their soul, by pleasing their body, and engaging their mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think capitalism has just turned &quot;gender&quot; into another product for people to consume. Everyone is sooo caught up in selfie culture. People aren&#39;t discovering their sexuality and gender through human contact anymore. We&#39;ve removed the pheromones, and replaced them with identity labels on a profile.</p>

<p>Instead of people doing the hard work of changing society, they&#39;re taught to individualize and problematize their feelings about gender. If yoy&#39;re a man who likes pink skirts, it&#39;s easier to &quot;become a woman&quot; than to stand up to bullies and own the fact that you&#39;re a dude who likes skirts. Lots of &quot;gender non-conforming&quot; kids grow up to be gay or lesbian (and &quot;desist&quot; from their desire to be the other sex). The pressure to &quot;trans&quot; kids seems to be worse in environments with homophobia. (Heck, in Iran it&#39;s illegal to be gay but they will provide &quot;corrective&quot; sex change surgery.)</p>

<p>Also, in some cases exposure to certain types of porn... &quot;Autogynephilia&quot; is a controversial topic, but there are undeniably men who develop a fetish for &quot;sissification&quot;. This is by no means all trans people, but it is a significant subset.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.4thwavenow.com">www.4thwavenow.com</a> for some thoughtful critical analysis of current transgender politics, from a feminist (not bigoted) perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was being a little flip. But almost every trans narrative I read seems to boil down to clothing and/or toy preferences. I have rarely read a description of anyone&#39;s &quot;internal gender feelings&quot; that wasn&#39;t based on tired, sexist stereotypes.</p>

<p>Sorry that I believe in self-acceptance. And that I think everyone should be taught to love the body they have, and embrace their individual personalities as they are. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a pretty non-stereotypical female. And every single reason I&#39;ve ever read for a trans person &quot;knowing they were truly female on the inside&quot; was stupid bullshit that doesn&#39;t apply to all women anyway.</p>

<p>There are a small number of people (often called &quot;truscum&quot; in the oh-so-accepting &quot;trans community&quot;) who suffer real gender dysphoria. But there are waaay more people who are just re-ifying gender stereotypes because of something they read on tumblr. The kind of people who make up labels like &quot;demisexual&quot;. (Which is an &quot;identity&quot; based on the idea that the majority of people supposedly enjoy casual sex, but you are a special snowflake who only enjoys it when there is an emotional connection.)</p>

<p>I also read stories of people who obsess about their gender identity and sexuality labels (and pronouns) but have never had sex or been in a relationship. And I think we put the cart before the horse. Instead of <em>thinking</em> about your sex and gender, go out and LIVE it. Mash your genitals up against someone else&#39;s. Discover the pleasure in whatever sticky mess turns you on. Worry less about the labels.</p>

<p>Finally, I know people who have &quot;de-transitioned&quot; and/or regret surgeries. People who truly believed they were the wrong gender, transitioned, and later realized that their dissatisfaction was not ameliorated by changing genders after all. People can make mistakes in understanding themselves, but it&#39;s become verboten to point out potential errors in gender thinking. Gender identity has become a sacred self-declaration. Even in 5 year olds. Who also self-declare themselves to be dinosaurs or puppies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling anyone how to live their life. I don&#39;t hate trans people, or want to prevent them from doing whatever they please. But I do think society lacks a healthy understanding of exactly what gender is in the first place, and how much (or how little) it matters.</p>

<p>&quot;Gender&quot; is a made up social construction, that has changed in different times and places. I think it could be done away with entirely. Biological sex matters, but only to the act of human reproduction. Other than for reproduction, sex and/or gender should be pretty damned irrelevant.</p>

<p>I want to be rid of gender, and let everyone live as they wish. Trans people want to re-ify gender, and increase its importance. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary, productive, or healthy for society.</p>

<p>This is patently untrue.  Go to <a href="/r/transgender">/r/transgender</a> and related subs, and I&#39;d be shocked if you saw that at all, let alone it meaning &quot;someone with gender dysphoria.&quot;   The VAST MAJORITY of trans people have gender dysphoria.  If they are on HRT of any kind, they have been diagnosed with it.   And when &#39;truscum&#39; does come up(usually the term used is &#39;trutrans&#39; or a variant), it&#39;s usually in relation to people spouting the same sexist BS that you are saying all trans people spout, and who try to police others behaviors using said BS(&quot;you aren&#39;t girly enough, you don&#39;t like men, REAL women walk in high heels, etc.&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I&#39;ve always wondered why it&#39;s considered &quot;intolerant&quot;, &quot;bigoted&quot; and &quot;trans-phobic&quot; to simply discuss transgenderism. It seems like the idea of it is being drilled into people and that they&#39;re being told to accept it without asking questions.</p>

<p>Am I against transgenderism? No. I don&#39;t care what other people do with their bodies. But I&#39;m also kind of uneasy with the idea that young children are now able to forgo these transformations simply because they want to be the other gender. It&#39;s actually quite insane to think about. What does a 5 year old know about sex or their sexuality? Like, at least wait until puberty maybe.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first thought I had as to why all of a sudden we&#39;re told to be comfortable with and accepting of this <em>&quot;trans&quot;</em> ideology without asking any questions about it is that it&#39;s some sort of long-term conditioning for when/if Trans-humanism becomes a thing. Now from a primitive human point of view, the idea of merging with computers/machines/robots can seem horrifying. </p>

<p>However, I think that this may ultimately be our next step in evolution. </p>

<p><strong>---Warning: Trippy shit below---</strong></p>

<p>Instead of patiently waiting billions of years for mother nature to slowly upgrade us, why not use the intelligence that we already have to speed up the process exponentially? After all, us humans and machines are basically made from the same shit when you look at it from an atomic point of view. We, and everything around us, are made out of nothing but atoms which are held together by energy. These atoms, the very same ones that you are made of, have been around since the beginning of the universe. The particles that YOU are made of are at least billions of years old. </p>

<p>So if the building blocks that compose you are billions to infinitely many years old, and <strong>you</strong> have only been <strong>you</strong> since your birth, then WHAT are <em>YOU</em>? What makes you.... <em>you</em>? Your thoughts? Your soul? Your consciousness? Your memories? It certainly isn&#39;t the atoms that you are made out of, because those have been around for billions of years before you became <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>So anyway, if <em>you</em> are nothing but thoughts/a soul/consciousness/memories living inside and controlling a body made of billion year old atoms, which is essentially just a container that <em>contains</em> <em>you</em> inside it, then why not put &quot;<strong>you</strong>rself&quot; inside a superior body, or &quot;life container&quot;? Is the body that contains <em>you</em> simply good enough? It&#39;s usually good for about 80 years or so if you&#39;re lucky enough to be born in a 1st world country. But then what happens after that? After your body (or <em>life container</em>) dies? What happens to <em>you</em>? Do <em>you</em> go to heaven? Hell? Does it turn out that <em>you</em> are really just living in another dimension and that all of this, all of the life around <em>you</em> as you know it, is just a simulation that <em>you</em>&#39;re playing around in... So the real <em>you</em> essentially &quot;wakes up&quot; when your atomic body dies in the simulation? Or perhaps <em>you</em> simply reincarnate and get to experience life as another person/animal/plant/alien when your physical body (or container) dies? Or perhaps, what if... there is simply <em>&quot;Nothing&quot;</em> after death, and that this whole life was just a 1 in infinity kind of &quot;random&quot; experience that you&#39;ll <strong>NEVER</strong> have again? That last thought is the one that scares me the most. That all of life was a &quot;fluke&quot; which only happened because of the fact that the universe itself is infinite, so even if it did happen randomly, it happened only because odds even as small as 1 in infinity were mathematically inevitable as the universe itself is infinitely old? Are you okay with &quot;dying&quot;, and essentially risking that last scenario, where <em>you</em> will never have another chance to <em>live</em> again?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure some of us are. I don&#39;t think I am. Think about it, the fact that anything... <em>&quot;exists&quot;</em>, is a fucking miracle. The fact that that these atoms, the very same ones that compose everything around us, could be put together in such a way that they are essentially <em>thinking</em> and are <em>aware of their very own existence</em> is mind-boggingly fascinating. Do <em>we</em> want to <em>potentially waste</em> this? Or should <em>we</em> guarantee ourselves an eternal &quot;life&quot; by merging <em>&quot;us&quot;</em> with machines, which are basically just atoms arranged in a smarter and more superior way, a way much better than our current mostly Carbon-based bodies, to ensure immortality? To ensure that <em>you</em> get to live, create, learn, love, laugh forever? And to ensure that <em>you</em> don&#39;t... <em>go away forever</em>? </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m well aware of the fact that trans-humanism might not even be impossible. After all, <em>we</em> don&#39;t even know what consciousness is yet. Even the world&#39;s smartest and most educated biologists, chemists, physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians etc, don&#39;t have a clue about what makes you, <em>you</em>. So how exactly do we transfer <em>you</em> and <em>your consciousness</em> into an <em>eternal, superior life container</em>, if we don&#39;t even know what makes you, <em>you</em>? We are still very far away from this, if &quot;this&quot; can happen at all. </p>

<p>But think about it. <strong>If it was possible</strong> to transfer <em>you</em>, <em>your</em> consciousness, <em>your</em> memories, and everything that makes you, <em>you</em> into a mechanical life container (which is essentially just a body built from the same eternal atoms that your current body is made out of, only its atoms are arranged in a superior, non-degrading manner) that makes it possible for <em>you</em> to keep living, experiencing and creating new things forever, would you want to do it? </p>

<p>If anyone here bothered to read that bat-shit crazy hunk of text above, then I encourage you to poke some holes in my logic or even add to it. This is obviously shit I can&#39;t say in real life without sounding like a deranged lunatic who belongs in a mental hospital, so I&#39;d really like to discuss it with you random internet strangers, no matter what your opinions are. </p>

<p>Edit: grammar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, interesting and thoughtful post. Sorry you got downvotes for your effort. It&#39;s a shame this isn&#39;t higher up. Thank you for taking the time to articulate a very interesting idea.</p>

<p>And thank you also to OP for starting this conversation. Your original post is thoughtful and refreshing. I obviously have an unpopular opinion on this already. But I get sick of both &quot;sides&quot; of this debate shouting the same old points at each other. I see one-dimensional slogans, but not a lot of genuine curiosity and thoughtfulness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just another fad. </p>

<p>When I was a teenager, it was &quot;cool&quot; to be bisexual and self harm. Later it was &quot;cool&quot; to be Emo or Goth. Now it seems to be the in thing to be transgender of some description.  </p>

<p>It&#39;ll die down eventually and some other fad will take its place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was around 16/17, a lot of people I knew (especially girls) claimed to be bisexual as it was something alternative and was deemed to be going against the system. None of them were truly bi and it was a &quot;cool&quot; thing to do. </p>

<p>I was going to rock, alt and metal clubs and first started to seriously get into that kind of music around that age and I&#39;d say about 75% of people I met claimed bisexuality. I even did it myself to seem like I was one of the trend setters. Many years later, the only thing still true about that is that I still like the music. </p>

<p>This whole thing with kids claiming to be demiromantic pansexual trans femme queers or other such made up rubbish is similar. It&#39;s a fad to be seen as alternative and going against the norm. </p>

<p>How many of these kids who claim to be transgender or gender fluid or pansexual or dragonkin or some other such nonsense will look back in a few years time and think what idiots they were. </p>

<p>The same way that people used to tell their parents (myself included) that whatever alternative lifestyle they were following wasn&#39;t a &quot;phase&quot; and how they just don&#39;t understand it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fad, plain and simple. Take a look on Tumblr at all the people who claim to be various genders and also the same  people who self diagnose mental illness and autism etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion puts a lot of fear in the hearts of human beings regarding sexuality.  It mandates heterosexuality confined to marriage.  It is coupled with and makes sense inside the construct of our economic system.  For without marriage, a pregnant/child raising woman or single father has no means to earn a living and have adequate time to take care of the child.  This makes marriage an economic necessity for the good of the children, and us adults too as we were shaped as developing children.</p>

<p>Yet, this system of marriage, or lifelong sexual monogamy, is not universal in the human experience.  It does not explain our sexual urges, tendencies and behaviors.  How many married people are unsatisfied sexually with their partners?  How many look at porn looking for that satisfaction?  How many cheat or fantasize about cheating on their partners?  Pretty much everyone does, but many, often religious folks, won&#39;t admit it.  They don&#39;t want to set a bad example, endorse what they perceive as sinful behavior, even admit their sexual thoughts, feelings and unacted upon fantasies.  So, they play the clean, pious, white robed puritan to convince others, and even more especially themselves, that they are following the rules set out by God.  God made the world yet people keep acting in ways that undermine the system marriage He supposedly mandated.</p>

<p>Have any of you noticed the many people who cheat on their partners yet are so afraid of losing them when they are discovered?  This is because, even thought they are not sexually satisfied with their partners, they still love them and thus continue to want to be with them.  This is because love and sex are not the same thing.  People can love outside of sex, being friends, family and acquaintances.  People can have sex outside of love and still be loving people, having one night stands, casual sex with friends, sex with prostitutes, look at porn, masturbate, etc.  Of course, sex can be a very emotionally bonding experience and it often results in a stronger love bond between partners.  It is also quite possible to be in love this way with more than one partner.  There are a lot more possibilities than religion allows us to feel comfortable accepting, without fear.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t deny the reality you can observe around you out fear of the wrath of a supposed creator of the universe, with ambiguous credibility no less.  Accept it and each other and work out your problems with respect for one another and one another&#39;s known agreements with others.  Judging others makes us attack them.  Believing that god doesn&#39;t want them to be this or that or do this or that compels us judge them.  Stop fearing <em>this</em> god that has so any issues with his own creation, providing seemingly endless opportunities to fear divine punishment.  Question the things you were told to believe about the creator of the universe and you can more easily shed these fears, based on False Evidence Appearing Real, the written or spoken words of men stuffed into the perceived mouth of God.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is not exclusive to human beings.  Other intelligent social mammals engage in it too.  Dolphins do it, even in their blow holes.  Bonobos, which are equally related to humans as chimpanzees, but to me and others appear to move and act even more like us than chimpanzees, do it too.  Not only do they have homosexual sex, they have a lot of heterosexual sex too.  Their balls are as big as chicken eggs.  It is theorized that this hypersexuality is a form of social bonding that increases the cohesion of the pack for cooperation.  It also helps them work out problems, they appear to even screw to make up.  </p>

<p>There is also the theory that sperm competition from multiple partners deters the aggressiveness of males toward other males competing for females.  Several males will mate with a single female and so it makes the paternal identity ambiguous.  Most other animals will fight for and guard their females to ensure their DNA is what she propagates.  The competition takes place inside the female, through multiple mating sessions, in this alternative reproductive method.  It is less violent and honestly, look at how hot many humans find the practice.  </p>

<p>Gang bang porn is popular, especially multiple males with one female.  Furthermore, males are finished having sex for a few minutes at least after they orgasm, while females can orgasm after orgasm after orgasm.  The females much much moreso than the males, like their bonobo relatives, make a lot of sexy sounds, female copulatory vocalization, which males find enticing.  This turns them on for sex.  Many human males, of course not all, report to enjoy mating with a female after other males did.  How odd?  Yet, this behavior is completely appropriate for a sperm competition reproduction social system, even if it is obscenely taboo in our society.  </p>

<p>Larger testicles like we and bonobos have, ensure we have many millions of little ones to compete, should the need arise.  Also the notched head of the penis, enhanced by the foreskin, actually pulls semen out of the vagina.  Well, wouldn&#39;t that be a great thing for sperm competition too?</p>

<p>There are also many people that are bisexual.  Many of them <em>choose</em> (lol, they are the only ones that can) to express only their heterosexual side, usually to avoid social friction caused by attacks from judgemental people who believe it is wrong.  Some others of them express homosexual behavior, because they feel it more strongly.  We are compelled to choose an identity and stick with it, so many tend not to explore their other side.  I see so many self-proclaimed heterosexuals, who probably do really feel heterosexual feelings, enjoying good laughs about sucking dicks and screwing other dudes in their butts.  Prisoners cover their social asses with machismo while they opt for gay sex, saying they love putting their sausages between the buns other men just for dominance reasons.  <em>Yeah, right.</em>  Also, there are religious areas that allow gay sex too, as long as they can use religious legalese to make themselves feel that it is ok.  They often claim it isn&#39;t homosexual.  They lie to themselves in this way, but they&#39;d be better off to stop lying to themselves about God, so they could just drop the fear entirely.</p>

<p>I would bet that chemicals we put into our water as well as natural mutations cause some unusual sexual behavior, indeed we see deformations from it in animals, but homosexual behavior and bisexuality has been going on much longer than industrial civilization.  It was rampant in many places before the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) spread.  Rome and Greece were two such places.  One can&#39;t deny that those who have mixed parts, boobs and a penis, or a giant penis sized clitoris, are experiencing something unusual.  Yet, self-reports of homosexual urges in the modern day, as well as decades ago in previous studies, as well thousands of years ago embraced by a great many within cultures that accepted it shows that this phenomenon of homosexuality is not just caused by pollution or cultural machinations.  It&#39;s part of the variety one would expect with intelligent hypersexual social mammals that engage in sperm competition like the bonobos.  All of the behaviors that undermine marriage that I have previously mentioned actually fit within this alternative paradigm.  Perhaps marriage, or forced sexual monogamy, for economic reasons, is the aberration in human behavior causing our apparent sexually dysfunctional behaviors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to open your mind wider on the issue of human sexuality I&#39;d recommend these links.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJhklPJz9U8">Christopher Ryan</a> is a researcher that points out the evidence that paints a convincing alternative picture of human sexuality that more closely fits our behavior and anatomy than we are used to believing.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbzG0n3shTM">Mosuo tribe of China</a> is a small group of 30,000-50,000 that has a matriarchal society.  There is no ritualized lifelong sexual monogamy. While they do sometimes call sexual encounters &quot;walking marriages,&quot; they don&#39;t usually have women leave their family household to have children.  They continue to live with their household and their sisters, brothers, aunts and uncles help raise their children.  This gives them a lack of economic fear about the welfare of their offspring.  So, their culture has different sexual beliefs and rules.</p>

<p>They find it offensive if someone attempts to exercise sexual ownership over other, telling them that they cannot sleep with who they please.  We do the opposite.  Expressing jealousy and possessiveness is expected in our society, the norm.  In Mosuo society the men and women both get to sleep with whoever wants to sleep with them.  The rule is that after the male comes over for sex, he has to leave in the morning.  They don&#39;t leave the household with the female and make a new household, usually.  When the love in the relationship fades, instead of fantasizing about cheating, one or both of the couple chooses to break off the relationship and then it is over.  This is ok, as the children are raised by the women and their family, including their several uncles.  People often cite the need for good male role models in our society, but under theirs, the dead beat dad situation doesn&#39;t need to harm the children.  They&#39;ll have plenty of uncles to emulate.</p>

<p>Men and women both work for the good of their respective households.  There is thus larger households and more of a sense of community and sharing, like we have in our families and neighborhoods, not scary authoritarian communism.  This culture, among other pieces of evidence, proves to me and others than our system of marriage is an integral component of our economic system.  If we changed to the Mosua method of reproduction, it would change how we see going to a job 40+ hours per week to maintain so many separate households and the resources that they require.  The Mosuo system is perhaps less useful as a tool of social control for owners to harness the labor of others to get rich.  Why work your life away acquiring so much stuff when you can work less and hang out with the cool people you love?  I couldn&#39;t help but notice how happy the Mosuo people seemed compared to how we seem, generally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was actually well-written and you made some good points. I can&#39;t reply to all of them right now, but I do want to note I purposely did not include religion in my post because I think that is a whole other subject area.</p>

<p>With that being said, is there a reason religion did set up some structure to our society, specifically regarded marriage and sexuality? I mean even if not religion itself, every culture has roles for its people. Where I live the Navajo people are a matriarchal society. Should we say they are &#39;wrong&#39;? Or is there a reason for the structure?</p>

<p>Are we losing any sense of identity? All is OK now? We don&#39;t need any rules when it comes to our society ? That&#39;s a big leap, but that&#39;s what I feel like...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Children need our time, effort and resources, so there must be a social system to support them if we are to survive and thrive. Where we go wrong is enshrining one system over another as some absolute truth, shutting out alternative systems. </p>

<p>Our roles are defined by the system. What we should ask ourselves is which system benefits us and our children the most? Which system aligns with the ways we truly are? Does our current system account for our behavior or place demands on us that we so often fail to live up to?</p>

<p>Matriachies were more common in the past and it appears that part of the package of Abrahamic religions was to replace them with patriarchies. They are more conducive to external control, economic and religious. Matriachies appear to be less useful for power over others types as they are more community based, less economically desperate, and are in less of an emotional need for saviors to fix their problems. Notice how male oriented the Abrahamic religions are? Women are the backbone of matriachies. In these Abrahamic religions, they are virtual slaves, or second class citizens at best. This is no accident.</p>

<p>Marriages in patriarchies, in contrast with matriachal mating situations like the Mosuo, keep women dependent on men for their economic needs. This leads to all of the possessive behaviors in sexuality.  Women don&#39;t want their men to leave them without economic support, so they are in fear of being abandoned for another woman. Men don&#39;t want to raise someone else&#39;s kids with their hard spent time and effort, so they too guard their sexual partner to make sure she does not cheat. The Mosuo don&#39;t have to fear this economic situation, so they can embrace a different system. I couldn&#39;t help but notice how happy they seemed. <em>I talked about the Mosuo in my reply to my original post.</em></p>
