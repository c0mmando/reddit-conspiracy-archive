<p>These total and complete scumbags, the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs are privately owning ALL the money supplies in the world this way because they privately own the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank Of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, and they send the US military to attack any country who tries to print/create their own money, as was seen with Germany(WW2), Iraq, Libya, and now Syria and Russia.</p>

<p>It is time to take the printing/creating of the money supply, which is the Highest Power On Earth, back to Congress, so that the government can lend the money to banks and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security, thus allowing this to be “wealth of the People” with no national debt, as Jesus and the Constitution have commanded.</p>

<p>Because ALL the countries OWE the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs their entire money supplies with interest, the Central Bankers/International Oligarchs have COMPLETE control and slave master status over them. </p>

<p>Jesus would be livid about this, so if you love Jesus, then why do you burn him by allowing this situation to continue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read bits and pieces but honestly I think I would have heard these &quot;fulfilled&quot; Biblical prophecies referenced here and elsewhere over and over if they were at all convincing.  I have read most of Revelations which is the big prophecy one and all the significant ones there are constantly being portrayed as being fulfilled right now because it&#39;s the end times.  It has apparently been the end times for around a millennia according to a host of influential religious groups at any given time.  Regardless, the stuff in there is so vague that you can apply it to just about any set of circumstances just like any enduring prophecy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the bible actually gives specific details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know of no instance where this is the case.  Son of a powerful man can be applied to virtually any politician or billionaire.  A beast rising from the sea can be applied to nations, social movements, armies, an actual beast, really about anything.  And those are the most specific type of thing I&#39;ve heard/read from the Bible.</p>

<p>Show me something that actually lists specifics on something that happened well after its writing and isn&#39;t completely predictable like &quot;there will be war in this general region&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t exist because all prophecy is bunk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Daniel describes the exact ebb and flow of four empires from Babylon to Medo-Persia to Greece to Rome. He even foresaw the meteoric rise to power of the Greek conqueror Alexander the Great, as well as the final division of his Greek empire by four of his surviving generals</p>

<p>And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a notable ehorn between his eyes. 6 Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power. 7 And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, 5attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.</p>

<p>8 Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it ffour notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an arbitrary application of a story about goats.  Sure he meant the goat to have greatr significance than just a goat, but if you then just pick any set of later events, you have so many choices that you could fit it to anything.  No mention of any specifics.  Just goats.  This is a prime example of what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>The sources to &quot;discredit&quot; claims that the prediction came after the events are both religiously oriented authors writing books to support prophetic visions in the Bible.  I can&#39;t speak to the quality of the claims by the skeptics or the supporters but this is not refutation from unbiased, scientifically based sources, but rather from those seeking to uphold the biblical narrative (as does this site).</p>

<p>As far as Ezekiel predicting the fall of Tyre, how many cities that existed in that region in 500bc were not destroyed in war.  The description bears no particular resemblance to the Greek record of the conquest anyway.  More importantly, it does not give even a hint of a time frame.  Tyre declaims Jerusalem and god tells Ezekiel it will be destroyed by many armies (it was one with a the help of a vassal army by the Greek account) over <em>200 years later</em>?</p>

<p>Further, while the text is to some extent accepted as dating from Ezekiel&#39;s time of exile, the best scholarly work shows that it has been adapted from oral tradition and altered significantly both before and after the fall of Tyre.  I find this utterly unconvincing.  How many times could one have predicted that a contemporary middle east city of the era be destroyed in war and been right?  Pretty much 100% of the time.</p>

<p>This says there are seven of these startling truths and I don&#39;t really want to go through each one.  This is exactly the kind of vague prediction and arbitrary application I&#39;m talking about.  Further it comes from a site which is explicitly geared towards teaching people to argue the merits of biblical prophecy rather than examining it from an unbiased perspective.  How many prophecies aren&#39;t mentioned because they have nothing to do with anything that happened?  I guess the other 95% of humanity at the time just had only fake prophecies since for some reason god never goes into, they had never heard of him.</p>

<p>This stuff is exactly what I was talking about.  No, it&#39;s not coincidence.  It would only be coincidental if it involved some kind of unusual alignment of prophecy and actual events.  This is just folklore people like to believe is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think it boils down to cherry picking.  It picks examples that can be fit (however imperfectly or arbitrarily) to cases that later occurred.  It ig nores cases that cannot.  Further it ignores cases that do not bolster the legitimacy of one particular ideological historical narrative based on the predetermined biases of those presenting it.  Why not give equal credence to Vedic or Norse or Buddhist prophecies, none of which relate to the times, places or events of biblical prophecies?  Because that doesn&#39;t support one particular, equally arbitrary mythology.</p>

<p>Edit: Actually you could.  These things are all so vague one could take say Vedic prophecy and twist it to fit events relevant to Christianity.  It&#39;s all just mental gymnastics in support of one of many logically untenable pantheons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of it has been altered.  Well, all of it has, but the fundamentals of some of it has.  This is historically provable.</p>

<p>My point is that these predictions in no way indicate foreknowledge of events.  They are simply a sampling of random statements, chosen selectively in support of a particular narrative while ignoring others.  More important that ignores simple principals of logic and consistency.</p>

<p>I could do far better pointing out how The Lord of the Rings was prophecy regarding World War 2.  The key similarities were written well before their real-world counterparts transpired.  Still, the similarities are <em>way</em> stronger and more consistent than any &quot;predictions&quot; from the bible.  The point is that you can draw comparisons but it is only that; comparing one thing to another.  It is not prediction.  It is post facto comparison, not divine revelation.  Attributing foreknowledge to the people who produced it is illogical on countless levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The meaning may be the same in some cases or not in others.  I made no specific claims as to that.  I&#39;m simply saying that there is no reason to believe biased, cherry picked examples when there are just as &quot;good&quot; alternative examples of &quot;prophecies&quot; from other faiths and sources.  There is no rational or provable basis for the idea of precognizance and the suggestion of some self-contradictory imaginary figure in the sky sending sporadic and seemingly randomly picked messages to certain people all  of whom lived millennia ago doesn&#39;t really strike me as the most likely explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going off topic and I never claimed that the basic content was altered, only stated the obvious truth that it could have been.  I stated that it was passed from oral tradition to written over a period that spanned the time before and after the fall of Tyre.  Alterations will inevitably occur though not necessarily in the underlying message.</p>

<p>Regardless, even if I believed it was word for word from the mouth of Ezekiel it would in no way predispose me to believe in divine prophecy given the inconsistency with facts, the huge chronological disparity and the relatively predictable fulfillment of the prediction.</p>

<p>The number of times prophecies are dead wrong or irrelevant dwarfs the number of times that they have even a modest correlation to real events but even a broken clock is right once a day, and in this case only partially right.</p>

<p>As far as the goat thing, that&#39;s really a perfect illustration of my point about taking something vague and then looking for a circumstance that <em>kind of</em> fits it.  It doesn&#39;t even qualify as coincidence, let alone a divine message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I said that it had been altered.  I did not say that the message was fundamentally changed.  In fact I said that I could not say whether or not it had.  If you want to nitpick, whatever.  The fact is that two and a half millennia plus countless translations mean that alteration is inevitable and forgery is distinctly possible.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t care.  As far as my wholly rational world view is concerned, I may as well be arguing to you that Santa Claus does not exist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right.  I can&#39;t prove god didn&#39;t send prophecies to a random assortment of people thousands of years ago and you can&#39;t prove to me that Thor doesn&#39;t call down lightening upon those who disobey his edicts.  Neither scenario is any more credible than the other regardless of vague statements about goats being arbitrarily linked to geopolitical changes, or abortion rights, or wars or social movements or anything anyone decides to conflate it with!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Riding?&quot; Hmmm.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just consider Matthew 2:5, asserting that Jesus&#39; birth in Bethlehem is a prophetic fulfillment.  He means (so scholars tell us, and I heard this prophecy explicated by a radio bible study show just last month) Micah 5:2, predicting that &quot;out of thee, Bethlehem Ephrata, ...shall he come forth that is to be ruler in Israel.&quot;  Cool beans, huh? Prophecy fulfilled! Except:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bethlehem Ephrata is a clan, not a town.  See 1 Chron 2:18, 2:50-52, 4:4.  Matthew dropped &quot;Ephrata,&quot; distorting the text.</p></li>
<li><p>As is quite clear in the succeeding verses of Micah, whoever he&#39;s referring to will &quot;lay waste the Assyrians.&quot;  Jesus has a lengthy resume but I missed that part.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So Matthew, Prophet of the Inerrant God, misquotes and distorts Micah for his own purposes, backdating a prophetic &quot;prediction&quot; which is explicitly contradicted by Micah&#39;s text.  A pretty clear example of how &quot;things changed&quot; right in the book.  And I think he does it because for the foreseeable future (har, little prophesy humor there) he can get away with it, his audience is illiterate and won&#39;t catch him out.  </p>

<p>And this is just an example of somebody trying to get away with a textual reconciliation.  Jesus himself doesn&#39;t apparently care about accuracy, he is just all over the map, prophesying scores of things (the end of the world in his listeners&#39; lifetimes, mostly) that just didn&#39;t happen.  </p>

<p>But never mind, I am an equal-opportunity seeker after the truth.  It&#39;s now time for me to go prove the inerrant truth of the Bible by finding a rabbit that chews its cud.  Lev. 11:5-6.  They must be out there somewhere, the Book says so! And when I find one, I&#39;ll let you know.  </p>

<p>(PS: I am being a little hard on God&#39;s Holy Apostle here.  The only way to know he&#39;s being a deliberate old fraud is if I knew he had Micah open in front of him when he was screwing up the text.  If he was just preaching based on dim memories of a Temple education, maybe he&#39;s negligent, not fraudulent.  Not that this makes a difference, inerrancy-wise.) </p>
