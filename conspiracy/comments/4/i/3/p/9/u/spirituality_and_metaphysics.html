        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>We are biologically wired to move towards pleasure and away from pain. This simple fact underlies the (seemingly) chaotic movements we see all around us every day. Thus, to understand the Game of life, &quot;follow the pleasure&quot; (in all its forms: sex, status, success, money, power, love, relationships, etc.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned this in past posts, but higher-order pleasures are more in demand and therefore attract greater competition. For example, if you want to be wealthy, you need to work your way into the ownership class (top 1% of the country). If you want power, you need to compete to get into the .1%</p>

<p>Pleasure (you could also call it “love” or “value”) is the organizing principle of Nature. Hierarchies set the rules for who is allowed to access different tiers of pleasure. In the sexual marketplace, for instance, only the top men are allowed to date many beautiful women, while the rest are left out to dry.</p>

<p><strong>Is this Worldview Cynical?</strong></p>

<p>To analyze the sexual marketplace is to simply follow the flow of sexual energy (you could even say &quot;life energy&quot;). Doing so reveals many truths about reality and human nature - it&#39;s not really about getting laid.</p>

<p>Also, you really can’t escape the will-to-fulfillment. Hippies may rail against “mainstream” sources of pleasure (like careers and the traditional family), but they just find fulfillment elsewhere (in drugs, group identity as ‘rebels’ etc.) Even people who dedicate their lives to seemingly high-minded causes like religion and charity do so in order to feel good.</p>

<p>To prevent total egoism from ruling the world, there is a source outside the universe that balances things out (often called God or the Creator, but that’s for another post.)</p>

<p><strong>Game Awareness</strong></p>

<p>Your level (another way of phrasing this is “how much value you provide”) in any hierarchy determines how much of the Game you are allowed to “see.” It’s similar to how the CEO of a company has access to all the company’s information (even employee emails), whereas a middle-manager knows very little about the bigger picture.</p>

<p>This fact is not as trippy or New Agey as it might sound. Let’s use the sexual marketplace as an example. The beta (low-value male) is constantly confused. He doesn’t understand why women ignore him, or why he doesn’t get invited to parties. The whole social scene seems unfair, chaotic, and “random.” His awareness of his surroundings is thus very low.</p>

<p>The alpha male, on the other hand, possesses intuitive knowledge about how social life functions. He knows that women like men who are dominant and in-shape. He knows that it&#39;s important to provide value and to keep a stoic mindset. Therefore, even if parts of his Game are lacking, he doesn’t sink into depression. He has a road map for success that always works; it’s just a matter of time and hard work until he gets there. The alpha male thus has higher awareness of his surroundings and how life works than the Beta possesses.</p>

<p><strong>Interdependence</strong></p>

<p>To perceive laws that apply across time and space is to gain an intuitive understanding of the connection that exists between everything in existence. You start to see how things fit and move together, and life ceases to be &quot;relative&quot; and &quot;random.&quot;</p>

<p>Your average college student, for example, thinks events are isolated and random. His friends are the other guys randomly assigned to his dorm. He relies on fortuitously bumping into girls at other people’s parties in order to exchange numbers. He views college itself as a kind of timeless la-la land separate from society at large. A hilarious example of this is when kids at fancy schools protest against the 1%, not realizing they chose to attend an institution that is purposefully designed to churn out more members of the ruling class.</p>

<p>A college student growing in awareness begins to sense some “method to the madness.” Specifically, he starts to realize that the college social Game is far from random. Some guys clearly have higher status, date more women, have better job prospects, and so on. To join these guys, the burgeoning Red Pill student learns to provide value, maintain a strong mental frame, and develop healthy habits amongst other Red Pill behaviors. By Senior year he establishes himself as a Club leader, respected Fraternity member, or top student moving onto a high paying job.</p>

<p>There is actually another level above the aforementioned one, but it is rarely if ever achieved by college kids. To reach full Red Pill enlightenment, you need to find the Laws that govern not only sexual and social dynamics, but that run society (and ultimately the universe) as well. Everything needs to be placed in its proper context, and seen as part of an interconnected whole (ruled over by God, but again that’s for another post.)</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>99% of kids view college (you can also insert society, the media, the government etc.) as “normal.” They can’t imagine it being any other way. And yet, college has changed massively in each of the last three generations. There are many schools that have developed like this:</p>

<p>(1940s)
Only white men can attend; pedigree more important than grades; serious study of Western civilization; little or no party culture</p>

<p>(1970s)
Coeducational; Mostly white; Partying, casual sex, rock n roll predominate; academics critique Western imperialism</p>

<p>(2010s)
Coeducational; highly diverse; competitive academically; still some party culture; Western culture under assault; Social justice and feminism main part of curriculum</p>

<p>In each stage, what’s “normal” is completely different. In fact, certain values can be literally reversed in a single generation’s time. Why does this happen? Well, for one, there are many wealthy and powerful interests that line up to push different agendas on college campuses. This is another example of higher level “Game” that is hard to see when you&#39;re being influenced by it. Indeed, the idea of influencing campuses en masse seems “out there” and “conspiratorial” until you’ve been rich for a long time and have many influential connections. Then it’s as easy as calling up a friend on the phone and writing a check. Any ways, if you simply go along with what’s “normal” in your day and age, you will always be subjected to some amount of brainwashing. For instance, if you are a white male, is it really in your best interest to become a social justice warrior who hates Western civilization? Of course not, but you won’t even realize that if you just go along with the Blue pill media and educational systems.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Context is important. Without it, you become subjected to the “Change” process that was designed by social engineers like Kurt Lewin. There are actually laboratories that study this stuff. Start to develop a nose for what&#39;s valuable/pleasurable in life. Following this train of thought will make you powerful and reveal the Laws we all have to play by (whether we know about them or not.)</p>

<p>Also keep in mind the symbolism here. What is sex? It&#39;s how you create life. Understanding sex dynamics means you understand life dynamics. Ya dig?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is insight stimulating, and excellently, succinctly written.  Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>I got into a short argument with someone on reddit about how &quot;everything is relative&quot;</p>

<p>I disagreed (some things are not relative in my opinion) and asserted that there are some &quot;roots&quot; to be found.  Eternal truths.  And that not everything is cyclically dependent.  Written/spoken language is a great example of something that [i]is[/i] cyclically recursive (although i am aware of the difference between written/spoken language to the Word which makes even this complicated.)  He didn&#39;t want to think about my argument though and ditched the conversation. </p>

<p>Any thoughts on this topic?  The reason I mention it is because you said this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You start to see how things fit and move together, and life ceases to be &quot;relative&quot; and &quot;random.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By ceasing to be relative, do you mean one begins to find the &quot;roots&quot; of a hierarchy with which to base other information/knowledge off of? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy did some good posts here too... i don&#39;t have time to link so you may try to search his name there.</p>

<p>As for OP keep going, a lot of r/conspiracy people freeze when compared to this kind of &quot;over the top&quot; posts where the narrative itself is scrutinized instead of some specific events that happen because of it so they get stuck just with down/upvoting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m lucky in that i follow the 3 main communities you post into and it&#39;s good you focus on quality insight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only 17 turning 18 next week (US). And I&#39;ve slowly started to learn this over the years with what I&#39;ve been through. I have my life goals and they&#39;re gonna take hard work and effort but it will pay off. As for what I&#39;m going through now in school. I always make sure I know everything. &quot;Friends&quot; with everyone as far as they know. When your &quot;friends&quot; with everyone you find out a lot of information. I hold that information as if it were the cards while playing poker. Some may say that it&#39;s wrong but knowing all the information is a big piece of the game of life. What you choose to do with that information is your own choice. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m one of the few that have started learning this game at a young age. </p>
