       I apologize for the newish account. I've frequented this sub the last three years. I discovered this place after Chris Dorner was killed. Anyway, I've been here enough and something seems off. Is it the twitter posts? The clinton/trump posts? The comments? I'm just curious if it's just me or not. I thought I was in r/The_Donald in one comment thread.

       Fair enough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain your views. If I had to choose I would choose Trump because he is a far better choice than Hillary and at this point that's who it seems it will come down to.
      </p>

       However, there are a lot of things that he says that make me rather apprehensive. For example, he basically said something along the lines of killing Snowden for being a traitor. That is a huge red flag for me. But, the thing I like the most about him is that he wants to put America first, which he could totally pull a Obama or Bush and make a 180 as soon as he gets in office.

       Trump only cares about himself. His business dealings and political behavior are proof positive - he'll say anything to get what he wants, then turns around and reneges once he's gotten it. I can't see any major miracle or come-to-Jesus moment that would change him suddenly should he become POTUS. Tigers don't change their stripes, and hucksters don't ever stop huckstering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I was going to go find some examples and post them for you for illustration, but a Google on "Trump's broken promises" yields as many stories as "Clinton's scandals." Voluminous and daunting - and, like Clinton, there's decades of it. But the info's out there if you want to go digging. :/

       I don't understand why more people in conspiracy aren't for Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters that are strongly anti bernie seem to be either against bernie for flimsy reasons (flimsy arguments like bernie is for war or for israel--no he's not, on either); or they are very jingoistically / nationalistically anti-communist and so they conflate social democrat with communism and think bernie will put us all into gray prison uniforms at gattica style fema camps or something, when he really just wants to give everyone free healthcare and school and stop imprisoning people for smoking pot.  They attack supporters calling them 'bernie bots' when honestly bernie supporters are far more informed than any other by my estimate.

       Honestly, it doesn't matter how smart you are.  They'll still fool you.  Or they won't but it won't matter because you won't have power unless you climb their ladders and become a player, which no one wants because it means committing a bunch of crimes along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the smarter you are, the higher you generally go in education.  By the time you are at a PhD level you've been inculcated into a cult of reasoning and thinking and knowledge that is very inflexible, so they've got you.  What this ultimately means is that the smartest people are also the dumbest.  Are they going to invent anything?  No.  Inventors are almost always these outsiders who stopped college halfway because they realized it was horseshit and then they studied all sorts of things on their own and broke all the rules.  Invention is actually disruption, whereas phd culture is establishmentarianism and stasis.  I said almost always, please don't get on my case like a 20 yr old girl about generalities thank you

       As they believe their TVs again in about 8 years after the lazy dual term the next Zionist owned president will fill.  Repub or Demo, the direction of the country never changes.

       Not sure if you're suggesting I think that but I don't even like Bernie Sanders, his defenders brag that he is a pacifist because he found one war out of 10 he didn't vote for, when every other vote held on war he outright voted in favor of. So, we have misrepresentation there. So in addition to being a warmonger of maybe one magnitude smaller than Hillary, he doesn't mention the NSA jackshit, from what I can tell he doesn't mind the CIA, NSA, because he loves big government. He is just as bad as Trump, in my opinion.

       The only Bernie Sanders "enthusiasm" was 100% manufactured.  By the Same fools who regularly push the "great" Federal Reserve, that Snowden (actor, CIA) was a "hero," Bitcoin (worthless and virtually unused fiat e-currency), and unsurprisingly Noam Chomsky (lowlife zionist apologist gatekeeper liar).

       You're dead wrong about Snowden.  And about Sanders.  You're so full of wrong you might need to take a few enemas and flush it out of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who supported fed reserve do no support bitcoin or snowden; people who support chomsky don't support federal reserve and likely support snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       you're right about chomsky being a leftist gatekeeper, but your'e dead wrong about snowden.  Your only proof of snowden being a limited hangout is that you're parroting others who are equally incorrect.  There has been and will be no proof of this, only conjecture, propaganda and taint.  The evidence has been "why hasn't he released all the documents"--clearly he's a hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, he needs to keep leverage.  Also, he doesn't leak stuff, Greenwald does.  If you saw his documentary you'd understnad his reasons for slow leaking and they are valid, it would be too easy to do a media blackout if he released them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would not be able to verify eschelon without snowden, nor would you know about xkeyscore, quantuminsert, the JTRIG forum spy documents, the social media manipulation 'sensemaking' strategy, the extent to which stingrays are used and several ther projects that Snowden docs uniquely addressed.  Yes we were aware of mass surveillance efforts before snowden but the extent of them was not known.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to educate yourself before you start spouting nonsense.  Seriously, you need to focus specifically on how you're wrong about Snowden.  He IS a hero.  Say what you will of Sanders but you need to take back the Snowden remark because you're quite simply incorrect.

       Bernie enthusiasm is not manufactured either.  I've held 'honk for bernie' signs.  No one mind-controlled me or paid me to do this.  The others with me were equally excited at a candidate that was different from any other in decades

       Recently some guy posted a link to a webpage that explained the circumstances around the Irish Rebellion/Easter Rising of 1916. ..There was no actually conspiracy related to the article, it was basically a short, poorly written history lesson.
       <br/>
       However when I asked why they were posting in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       i was downvoted and nobody wanted to provide a reason for it. (nobody else commented, just downvoted)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still confused as to why they thought that was a conspiracy.

       r/conspiracy often times is a bastion of less censorship; and thus posts that are not finding an audience elsewhere are posted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all posts @ r/conspiracy are "conspiracy theories".
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why you were downvoted and found no reply; thats rather easy. Reddit is populated with a lazy audience/participants.

       some folks here have come to the conclusion that the Crown is a major player in the bankster/NWO/child sex abuse/masonic-whatever uber-conspiracy.  Hypothetically... and without getting too deep into the mysteries of the Catholic church... the Easter Rising is an example of a failure in that conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that or NWO-paid astroturfers are trying to plant fear porn into the minds of Irish and Irish Americans by reminding them of their oppression.  They want that famous Irish temper to be the spark.

       If there is a conspiracy there I'm all ears, and I like this thread when people can have discussions and bounce ideas back and forth. I found it really frustrating that the OP or any of the downvoters wouldn't weigh in on why they thought it was a conspiracy.

       People on here love to throw "shill" around, like if you disagree with something that gets posted in Conspiracy you're automatically a government paid agent hell bent on suppressing the masses. It's counterproductive to this sub.

       That's sure a nice way to describe the rampant shilling.  It's all because people disagree that the shill label is applied?  I'm afraid not.  Stick around long enough, and you'll see certain individuals responsible for posting apologist lies and attacks who strictly cover a short list of very blatant subjects.

       It most certainly is.  To believe that just by dumb luck EVERY SINGLE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT (minus 1) is directly related to John "Lackland" Plantagenet, King of England (1166 - 1216).  Yeah, not a soul on this sub has ANY relation to old John here in their genealogy, yet the shills will claim up and down that being related to him is somehow common.

       They told us the US won it's freedom through the revolutionary war.  That French bankers "helped" bankroll it.  Yet as soon as we won, we couldn't arrange full debt payment to the loser King of England fast enough.  The victor seldom if ever pays his debts to the loser of the war.

       Conspirators? Those are the "folks" who carry out the fraud, political assassinations, coups etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truthers? Still using that term/meme used to discredit critical thinkers who prefer something other than spoon fed govt/corporate think tank/ public relations talking points?
