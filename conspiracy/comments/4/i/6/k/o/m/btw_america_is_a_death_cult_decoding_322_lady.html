<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Columbia&quot; (/kəˈlʌmbiə/; kə-lum-bee-ə) is a historical and poetic name used for the United States of America and also as one of the names of its female personification.It has given rise to the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies; e.g., Columbia University, the District of Columbia (the national capital), and the ship Columbia Rediviva, which would give its name to the Columbia River. Images of the Statue of Liberty largely displaced Columbia as the female symbol of the U.S. by around 1920.</p>

<p>Columbia is a New Latin toponym, in use since the 1730s for the Thirteen Colonies. It originated from the name of Christopher Columbus and from the ending -ia, common in Latin names of countries (paralleling Britannia, Gallia etc.). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name)">[1]</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>&quot;District of Columbia&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s built into our name, &#39;Columbia&#39;.  What does <em>Columbia</em> mean and why is this word everywhere?  I mean, other than sounding nice and rolling off the tongue?</p>

<p>First of all, here&#39;s what it is not.  It is <em>not</em> named solely for <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-origin-of-the-word-Columbia">Christopher Columbus as this quora would suggest</a>, because his surname has an origin and meaning.  Let&#39;s go deeper than Yahoo Answer&#39;s nicer looking clone. </p>

<p>It means <em>Dove</em> or Pidgeon, in Latin genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae">Columbidae</a>, from columba-, columbi-. Columbarium is the best example.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Doves and Death</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbarium">Columbarium</a> is a mausoleum whose name derives from a <em>dove</em> house.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A columbarium is a place for the respectful and usually public storage of cinerary urns (i.e., urns holding a deceased’s cremated remains). The term comes from the <em>Latin</em> <strong><em>columba (dove)</em></strong> and originally referred to compartmentalized housing for doves and pigeons called a dovecote.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbarium">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each urn is a soul and each soul is a dove. The connection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_as_symbols#Judaism">between doves and souls is described in Judaism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In post-biblical Judaism, souls are envisioned as bird-like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Guf, or Treasury of Souls is sometimes described as a columbarium, a dove cote</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The imagery of the dove flying out in Christianity is often associated with &#39;the soul leaving the body&#39;, and doves have in many cultures been associated with conducting the dead to heaven (again, doves being the holy spirit)<a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/wellness/environment/galleries/a-spiritual-field-guide-to-birds.aspx?p=2">[1]</a><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2015/07/13/what-does-a-dove-mean-or-represent-in-the-bible/">[2]</a><a href="http://www.atouchabovedoves.com/funerals.htm">[3]</a>.  Therefore the dove is nearly the universal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopomp">psychopomp</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Peace symbolism</strong></p>

<p>Doves are a symbol of death but they are also a symbol of peace.</p>

<p>In nearly all religious traditions a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_as_symbols">dove is a symbol of peace</a>; but in Abrahamic traditions also a messenger, representing the holy spirit--the spirit tunnel / radio communication to God, a soul-transciever.  Note that doves are also associated with the pagan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_as_symbols#Paganism">Queen of Heaven</a> (ishtar, astarte, semiramis, aphrodite, etc)</p>

<p>They say that there is <em>peace in death</em>, which makes sense that the house of the symbol of peace would double as the final resting place of the deceased.  This is why <em>Columbia</em> has a kind of spiritual resonation that works for both Christians <em>and</em> Gnostics.  The latter of which may make you say, &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;  Well let me explain as we further decode the cult of death.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Liberty symbolism</strong></p>

<p>The liberty symbolism of the dove comes from 2 ideas: 1) the freedom of a bird in flight &quot;free as a bird / dove&quot;, 2) by the association of the phrygian &quot;liberty&quot; cap with both DC ornamentation motifs and with Lady Columbia--the personification of America--wearing the hat in late 19th century depictions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_cap#In_the_United_States">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name)">[2]</a></p>

<p><strong>The Statue of <del>Liberty</del> freeing-souls-from-bodies</strong></p>

<p>Decoding the Mashup that is <em>The Statue of Liberty</em> is not that difficult if you know where to begin.  It begins with a search for the origins of the iconography and the name Columbia.  Specifically, one place to begin is with a coin, minted in July 1776 depicting <em>Columbia</em>, wielding a pole topped with liberty cap and with caption &quot;Libertas Americana&quot;, whose iconography borrowed from Lady Liberty, which one author claimed was a combination of several dieties including Liberty, Minerva (roman athena) and Hercules, and &quot;the indian princess&quot;, assumingly a neoclassical-envisioned Pocohontus <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u91K5ZcTLCQC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;dq=%22plumed+greek+goddess%22+minerva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil-fed-sXMAhXENhoKHWjkC7kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22plumed%20greek%20goddess%22%20minerva&amp;f=false">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_(goddess)">[2]</a>.  Again, another reference to the Phrygians, an idea, an homage, steganographically woven into the fabric of culture. In this particular case, a link from the phrygian cap to the Anatolians whose import is a reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism#Bull-slaying_scene">Mithraic mystery school</a> tradition, which provides for us a link from the oldest ecclectic religious traditions on earth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism#Lion-headed_figure">gnosticism</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism#Rituals_and_worship">death ritual</a>.</p>

<p>What ideas does the mashup carry with?  Let&#39;s break it down</p>

<ul>
<li>Roman Freedom dieties : Libertas (female aspect) / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber">Liber (male aspect) of liberty goddess)</a>, in Greek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleutheria">&quot;Eleutheria&quot;</a>, etymologically connected to both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis">Eleusis</a> and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis">Artemis</a>; </li>
<li>Liber/Libertas is connected with cult of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus">Bacchas / Dionysis</a>, god of wine partying orgies...also, like the dove, another psychopompic god.</li>
<li> Columbia -- as we said before, &#39;death&#39;, &#39;peace&#39;, &#39;freedom&#39;.</li>
<li>Mystery cults -- death ritual and gnosticism</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting thing is held in this iconography--did you spot it?  The connection to Eleusis.  And therefore the Eleusinian mysteries, which were the main reason we care about Eleusis.  We will have to table that issue for now. Just make notice for later that we have at least 3 connections at this point, linking &#39;Columbia&#39; to mystery schools, that of dionysis and that of eleusis, and that of the mythraic tradition.</p>

<p>So we have the associations of justice and war (athena), war and brutality (hercules), hunting (artemis), and &#39;drinking and merriment&#39;.  Sounds a lot like America / Lady Columbia doesn&#39;t it?  A warlike entity inflicting violent judgement of death upon others in the name of justice (athena, artemis), its own heroism (hercules), and with epicurean merriment (bacchus) in order to have peace and freedom. That about sums it up.  This personification of America is apt.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Cover Story</strong></p>

<p>Or is it?  The cover story is apt. The cover story is how the world sees us and how we see us, and how we sell ourselves.  But isn&#39;t it more than that.  Look around you.</p>

<p>The point of this essay is to show you that this cover story hides the true intentions and real activity that our country has been engaged in since its inception.</p>

<p><strong>District of Death</strong></p>

<p>On the face of it, if America were a person, that person would be a hit man.  A death dealer.  By our membership in this country, we too are death dealers.  It&#39;s why we are so depressed and unhappy: we know our country is killing people and we are powerless to stop it because of the corporate profit motive.  When you think about it, 3000 people is quite literally nothing compared to 5M+.  But we are still not convinced we&#39;ve been at war for 15 yrs because our media calls it everything &#39;but&#39; war.  </p>

<p><strong>Language, at the heart of it all</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world is made of language. --<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2mBBUgh9iY&amp;ab_channel=AndrewRutajit">Terence McKenna</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see above, the cabal (&#39;the cult of death&#39;) loves to mess with language because then they can mess with the world.  Warp reality.  Win hearts and minds.  Brainwash you.  Abuse your sensemaking with neuro-linguistic programming and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3xbn3c/socal_psychology_reveals_some_disturbing_traits/?">other forms of social psychology treachery</a>.  </p>

<p>They understand that when you control language you can control reality, because as the bible says, &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot; --John 1:1</p>

<p>This seems to be the only line that the cult of death people got from the bible.  That language is technology of creation.  What they&#39;ve created though, is only death.  But you see, in death, they&#39;re liberating you, liberating your soul.  They are helping.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t they?</p>

<p><strong>322 :: Death and Easter</strong></p>

<p>322 is the number of the skull and bones society, the Yale secret society associated with masonry to which GWB and Kerry belong.  Along with Sr. Bush and Prescott (&quot;trading with the enemy:nazis&quot;) Bush.  The latter whom ostensibly stole the bones of Geronimo, a great warrior, just &#39;cuz&#39;.  (just cuz he was a dick)</p>

<p>Knowing who these guys are...(too long to explain that...let&#39;s say VITRIOL, bones in the room of contemplation, etc).  I believe the 3/22 is a reference to the death cult again.   </p>

<p>Death worship is part of gnosticism (ecclectic mashup religion)--part of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ceafm/the_empire_of_the_citys_knobelisks_have_origins/">universal serpent/death worship religion</a> well before Christianity.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> reason is that that March 22 is a pagan holiday, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele#.27Holy_week.27_in_March">Arbor Intrat</a></em>, part of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanguem">Sanguem</a>, commemorating the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attis">Attis</a>, phrygian consort of &#39;the mother of all goddesses&#39;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele">Cybele</a>.<a href="http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/ostarathespringequinox/p/Ostara_History.htm">[1]</a></p>

<p>We know the surreptitious cultural significance of phyrigians through cultural meme of the liberty cap, mithraism (bull on wall st), carrying over from greece to rome to france to the us and uk and infused within our modern DC culture through a currying of neo-roman, neoclassical, authority-chic, semi-brutalist, cryptognostic architectural styles and motifs within &#39;official&#39; city planning.  A perfect example is the transgender statue of liberty that represents both cybele and attis alchemically transmogrified via <em>coincidencia oppositorum</em> into pagan goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name)">Columbia</a> (note the liberty cap), or as some might suggest more unpopularly, <a href="http://yahushua.net/babylon/liberty/pagan_statue.htm">Isis</a> (cybele was the roman borrowgoddess isis) <a href="http://yahushua.net/babylon/liberty/pagan_statue.htm">[1]</a><a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/the-secret-worship-of-illuminati-statue.html">[2]</a><a href="http://sitsshow.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-symbolic-meaning-of-isis-and-statue.html">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/140033869639035713/">[5]</a>  What lady liberty is not, is a manufactured &#39;freedom&#39; goddess, plucked from the vacuum of a French imagination.</p>

</ul>

<p>So to recap, these Queens of Heaven are all mythologies that were name-changed in different cultures but essentially are the same figure--a fertility goddess representing blood, sugar, sex, magic; plants, darkness, death, and rebirth.  She was the mother Goddess of agriculture, of nature, of the earth.  Gaia, but not sanitized to tell the half-truth of life--rather one that told the whole story that &#39;you too will die&#39;.</p>

<p>The connection with death and rebirth is not alone in the symbolism of the dove but with the the rite of Easter, which is a pagan holiday incorporated into the Christian tradition of the rebirth and ascention into heaven of Christ.  I posit that it comes from Ishtar.</p>

<p>Now some argue that easter came from Germanic Ostara/eostre the germanic goddess of fertility<a href="http://rationalblogs.org/rationalwiki/2013/03/31/no-its-not-all-about-ishtar-some-mythbusting-easter-facts-from-your-friendly-pagan-sceptic/">[1]</a>; others like myself will argue it&#39;s from Ishtar.  It&#39;s possible that it&#39;s both, triangulated from the iconographic depictions of both goddessess being queens of heaven of fertility, death and rebirth.</p>

<p>I argue that because Turkey is right next to Greece and Greece was a seafaring mercantile, it makes more sense to my mind that it&#39;s Ishtar-based, rather than Germanic, because travel by boat has no impediments like the high Swiss alps and Appenine mountain range between the two countries.  </p>

<p>Also, because of the maritime culture, Greece at the time had a very close relationship with Egypt (&#39;hellenic egypt period&#39;) in which much of the esoteric mystery school culture (gnosticism) carried over into the &quot;western culture&quot; domain, which is how we end up with black maddonnas (isis), the symbolism of the rose, madonna lilly, acacia, lotus and poppy, while you don&#39;t see the germanic yews, oaks, clovers, and thistles in motif in christian reliefs.  The common natural element is, however, the <em>pinecone.</em></p>

<p>The pine is interesting because it&#39;s the key to all this.  Many have equated the pine symbolically to the <em>pineal gland</em>, the dmt-releasing &#39;third eye&#39; that goes into high activity upon death.  Some believe this is also represented in the symbol of the eye of horus, which is the borrowsymbol on the dollar bill, the eye of providence (&#39;all seeing eye&#39; or symbol of the illuminati).  Of course, all this makes sense, if you follow the pinecone pineal backwards through time, from the pinecone fountain in Vatican city back to the obelisks of egypt and beyond.</p>

<p>One could make the argument that DMT then is the scientific material representation of that same death dove psychopomp, the holy spirit that carries one into the afterlife upon death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Ah well. When you&#39;re downvoted by many (or shills and bots), you know you are on the right path. </p>

<p>Breaking down the words and letters are the key. Probably why key symbolism is so prominent. I&#39;m glad someone delves into the etymology of words and letters and can cross-relate them among previous cultures. That&#39;s critical thinking in practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because America is Neo-Rome (rome never died, it became a corporation that is america).  Rome / Catholicism is a death cult for certain, even since constantine. Although he was a key figure.</p>

<p>America is cultural amalgam of roman (secular/pagan), gnostic (esoteric/occult), christian traditions.  The gnostic component was carried over into roman culture through mystery school tradidtions which were attacked and diminished by early militant christians (see the film &#39;agora&#39;--rape/slaying of gnostic hypatia (rachael weiss) by christian mob at alexandria egypt).  Because of persecution by jewrun romans, gnosticism then became a tradition of  spies and secret societies instead of &#39;small religions bound to an area&#39; (ie:cults)--specifically stonemasons, freemasons, rosicrucian esoteric protestant societies and their counterreaction the catholic jesuits who had appropriated the gnostic technologies for the purposes of the church, working quickly to destroy, obfuscate it, delete it from history by rewriting texts, burning books.  The early catholics a millenia earlier took the most important secrets (such as the recipe for soma) from the library of alexandria before burning it, 3 times mind you.  </p>

<p>Their philosophy and aesthetic were <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4glsty/catholic_parents_dont_know_the_history_of_the_art/">steganographically encoded into the art</a> of cathedrals as freemasons built them (google fulcanelli &#39;cathedrals as alchemical works&#39;), into the overall design, the positioning and placement upon the earth (along ley lines and aligned with stars), the ornamentation of the interior and exterior, the covert symbolism of basilicas and statuaries, and the design patterns of the stained glass windows.  For example the rose symbolism and the mushroom symbolism, the black maddonna in traditional european cathedrals and in eastern orthodox churches.  These are all &#39;hints&#39; at the pagan roots of christianity, as are the holidays (christmas is saturnalia/yule, easter is Ishtar/Oester, etc)</p>

<p>Strangely enough the Dan Brown books--although put forth as &#39;fiction&#39;--are actually 90% or more accurate historically.  It&#39;s a historical fiction, more history than fiction.  </p>

<p>But it goes back even further.  If you believed the above--which you should--this you will not believe, and that&#39;s fine.  There is evidence that there was a universal, cosmopolitan religion even before babylon that was a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ceafm/the_empire_of_the_citys_knobelisks_have_origins/">serpent-solar based religion.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points.  There was a group similar in light/dark theme to zoroastrianism was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism">manicheanism</a>.  According to wikipedia it was the competitor to zoro and christianity to replace paganism in the persian to eastern asian region (china), and was namely popular among aristocrats, with entities common to the book of Enoch.  Sound familiar?</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, because manicheanism is a strong candidate as either a predecessor or influencer of gnosticism.</p>

<p>Interesting read. You make some good points, and I&#39;m going to piggyback on a few of them. The Department of Defense has an extended history in funding or even having a hand in the production of some movies. One of the more recent examples of this would be <em>Battleship</em> I remember trying to tell my dad that that movie was propaganda, and he looked at me as if I were an idiot. We&#39;re both military vets, and he couldn&#39;t even see it. The reason that the Navy had a hand in producing Battleship, and other movies that were released the same year, is because they thought it would increase recruitment. Here&#39;s a list of all the movies the Navy helped produce in 2012.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/navy-film-list-2467/">https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/navy-film-list-2467/</a></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The thing with military vets is that some manage to break the rose-tinted glasses and see things for what they really are. Sure, you should take pride in defending your country from evil, but the Us vs Them mentality paints every enemy as evil, and we&#39;re groomed to believe that we&#39;re good. I remember going to a chapel one Sunday during the second week of my basic training, and them playing these videos laden with country music and montages of fighter jets and military personnel, and noticed that people were actually crying while this video was playing on 3 massive projectors. I assume when you&#39;re only getting a few hours of sleep and you&#39;re stressed out, you break a little--and cheesy, blatant propaganda can screw with you that way.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>When you mentioned the Black Madonnas, it reminded me of the dark skinned woman who was walking across America a few years back. She was dressed in all black robes in all the pictures and YouTube videos I&#39;ve seen her in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j6F8Eiv.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/j6F8Eiv.jpg</a>. An interesting thing of note is that she is an Army veteran and a mother--I&#39;m most likely reaching with this, but could thismake her an a kind of psychopomp or symbol of one of the many Goddesses of death/birth? Also, something even creepier:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On YouTube, a video taken in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Wise County, Va., shows the woman engaged in a heated debate with an onlooker about the book of Revelations. &quot;We&#39;ve already won,&quot; she says simply when he insists the apocalypse is yet to come. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUPKBnGBH8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUPKBnGBH8I</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, it looks like Skull and Bones did admit that they have Geronimo&#39;s skull and remains, and great grandson sued the society to get it back, but he lost the case. <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/yale_secrety_society_skull_bones_wins_lawsuit_over_geronimos_remains/">http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/yale_secrety_society_skull_bones_wins_lawsuit_over_geronimos_remains/</a></p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if those bastards were drinking from Geronimo&#39;s skull during communion rituals, similar to the Knights Templar communions, Tibetan Kapala offerings, and practices.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct.  You&#39;re dad is wrong.  Sorry. It&#39;s not just dod but the CIA embedded in hollywood.  Frances Stonor Saunders is an author of books about this very subject: how the intelligence community creates propaganda by funding and guiding &#39;the messaging&#39; of the news, tv, film, books and the paper.  It&#39;s gross</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t make out any of the discussion that lady had at walmart with the hick.</p>

<p>regarding geronimo&#39;s skull: we don&#39;t know if they have it or if they just say they have it and never took it.  Either way, it&#39;s looks bad.  Either they are unrepentent, unpunished and racist graverobbers or they want everyone to think they are--so it&#39;s a psyop on all americans either way.  It says 2 things about them is 1) they feel ivy-league entitled to do so, 2) they are dicks</p>
