        "Columbia" (/kəˈlʌmbiə/; kə-lum-bee-ə) is a historical and poetic name used for the United States of America and also as one of the names of its female personification.It has given rise to the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies; e.g., Columbia University, the District of Columbia (the national capital), and the ship Columbia Rediviva, which would give its name to the Columbia River. Images of the Statue of Liberty largely displaced Columbia as the female symbol of the U.S. by around 1920.
       </p>
       <p>
        Columbia is a New Latin toponym, in use since the 1730s for the Thirteen Colonies. It originated from the name of Christopher Columbus and from the ending -ia, common in Latin names of countries (paralleling Britannia, Gallia etc.).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Each urn is a soul and each soul is a dove. The connection
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_as_symbols#Judaism">
        between doves and souls is described in Judaism
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In post-biblical Judaism, souls are envisioned as bird-like

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The imagery of the dove flying out in Christianity is often associated with 'the soul leaving the body', and doves have in many cultures been associated with conducting the dead to heaven (again, doves being the holy spirit)

        Peace symbolism
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Doves are a symbol of death but they are also a symbol of peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       In nearly all religious traditions a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_as_symbols">
        dove is a symbol of peace
       </a>
       ; but in Abrahamic traditions also a messenger, representing the holy spirit--the spirit tunnel / radio communication to God, a soul-transciever.  Note that doves are also associated with the pagan
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doves_as_symbols#Paganism">
        Queen of Heaven
       </a>
       (ishtar, astarte, semiramis, aphrodite, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       They say that there is
       <em>
        peace in death
       </em>
       , which makes sense that the house of the symbol of peace would double as the final resting place of the deceased.  This is why
       <em>
        Columbia
       </em>
       has a kind of spiritual resonation that works for both Christians
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       Gnostics.  The latter of which may make you say, "what's that?"  Well let me explain as we further decode the cult of death.

       <strong>
        Liberty symbolism
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The liberty symbolism of the dove comes from 2 ideas: 1) the freedom of a bird in flight "free as a bird / dove", 2) by the association of the phrygian "liberty" cap with both DC ornamentation motifs and with Lady Columbia--the personification of America--wearing the hat in late 19th century depictions.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_cap#In_the_United_States">

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Decoding the Mashup that is
       <em>
        The Statue of Liberty
       </em>
       is not that difficult if you know where to begin.  It begins with a search for the origins of the iconography and the name Columbia.  Specifically, one place to begin is with a coin, minted in July 1776 depicting
       <em>
        Columbia
       </em>
       , wielding a pole topped with liberty cap and with caption "Libertas Americana", whose iconography borrowed from Lady Liberty, which one author claimed was a combination of several dieties including Liberty, Minerva (roman athena) and Hercules, and "the indian princess", assumingly a neoclassical-envisioned Pocohontus
       <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u91K5ZcTLCQC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;dq=%22plumed+greek+goddess%22+minerva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil-fed-sXMAhXENhoKHWjkC7kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22plumed%20greek%20goddess%22%20minerva&amp;f=false">

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_(goddess)">
        [2]
       </a>
       .  Again, another reference to the Phrygians, an idea, an homage, steganographically woven into the fabric of culture. In this particular case, a link from the phrygian cap to the Anatolians whose import is a reference to the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism#Bull-slaying_scene">
        Mithraic mystery school
       </a>
       tradition, which provides for us a link from the oldest ecclectic religious traditions on earth,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism#Lion-headed_figure">
        gnosticism
       </a>
       , and the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraism#Rituals_and_worship">
        death ritual
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What ideas does the mashup carry with?  Let's break it down
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Roman Freedom dieties : Libertas (female aspect) /
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber">
         Liber (male aspect) of liberty goddess)
        </a>
        , in Greek
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleutheria">
         "Eleutheria"
        </a>
        , etymologically connected to both
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis">
         Eleusis
        </a>
        and to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis">
         Artemis
        </a>
        ;
       </li>
       <li>
        Liber/Libertas is connected with cult of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus">
         Bacchas / Dionysis
        </a>
        , god of wine partying orgies...also, like the dove, another psychopompic god.
       </li>
       <li>
        Columbia -- as we said before, 'death', 'peace', 'freedom'.
       </li>
       <li>
        Mystery cults -- death ritual and gnosticism
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       An interesting thing is held in this iconography--did you spot it?  The connection to Eleusis.  And therefore the Eleusinian mysteries, which were the main reason we care about Eleusis.  We will have to table that issue for now. Just make notice for later that we have at least 3 connections at this point, linking 'Columbia' to mystery schools, that of dionysis and that of eleusis, and that of the mythraic tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have the associations of justice and war (athena), war and brutality (hercules), hunting (artemis), and 'drinking and merriment'.  Sounds a lot like America / Lady Columbia doesn't it?  A warlike entity inflicting violent judgement of death upon others in the name of justice (athena, artemis), its own heroism (hercules), and with epicurean merriment (bacchus) in order to have peace and freedom. That about sums it up.  This personification of America is apt.

        Cover Story

       Or is it?  The cover story is apt. The cover story is how the world sees us and how we see us, and how we sell ourselves.  But isn't it more than that.  Look around you.

       On the face of it, if America were a person, that person would be a hit man.  A death dealer.  By our membership in this country, we too are death dealers.  It's why we are so depressed and unhappy: we know our country is killing people and we are powerless to stop it because of the corporate profit motive.  When you think about it, 3000 people is quite literally nothing compared to 5M+.  But we are still not convinced we've been at war for 15 yrs because our media calls it everything 'but' war.

       As you can see above, the cabal ('the cult of death') loves to mess with language because then they can mess with the world.  Warp reality.  Win hearts and minds.  Brainwash you.  Abuse your sensemaking with neuro-linguistic programming and

      </p>

       They understand that when you control language you can control reality, because as the bible says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." --John 1:1
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be the only line that the cult of death people got from the bible.  That language is technology of creation.  What they've created though, is only death.  But you see, in death, they're liberating you, liberating your soul.  They are helping.

        322 :: Death and Easter

       322 is the number of the skull and bones society, the Yale secret society associated with masonry to which GWB and Kerry belong.

       Knowing who these guys are...(too long to explain that...let's say VITRIOL, bones in the room of contemplation, etc).  I believe the 3/22 is a reference to the death cult again.

       We know the surreptitious cultural significance of phyrigians through cultural meme of the liberty cap, mithraism (bull on wall st), carrying over from greece to rome to france to the us and uk and infused within our modern DC culture through a currying of neo-roman, neoclassical, authority-chic, semi-brutalist, cryptognostic architectural styles and motifs within 'official' city planning.  A perfect example is the transgender statue of liberty that represents both cybele and attis alchemically transmogrified via

       So to recap, these Queens of Heaven are all mythologies that were name-changed in different cultures but essentially are the same figure--a fertility goddess representing blood, sugar, sex, magic; plants, darkness, death, and rebirth.  She was the mother Goddess of agriculture, of nature, of the earth.  Gaia, but not sanitized to tell the half-truth of life--rather one that told the whole story that 'you too will die'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connection with death and rebirth is not alone in the symbolism of the dove but with the the rite of Easter, which is a pagan holiday incorporated into the Christian tradition of the rebirth and ascention into heaven of Christ.  I posit that it comes from Ishtar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now some argue that easter came from Germanic Ostara/eostre the germanic goddess of fertility
       <a href="http://rationalblogs.org/rationalwiki/2013/03/31/no-its-not-all-about-ishtar-some-mythbusting-easter-facts-from-your-friendly-pagan-sceptic/">
        [1]
       </a>
       ; others like myself will argue it's from Ishtar.  It's possible that it's both, triangulated from the iconographic depictions of both goddessess being queens of heaven of fertility, death and rebirth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I argue that because Turkey is right next to Greece and Greece was a seafaring mercantile, it makes more sense to my mind that it's Ishtar-based, rather than Germanic, because travel by boat has no impediments like the high Swiss alps and Appenine mountain range between the two countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, because of the maritime culture, Greece at the time had a very close relationship with Egypt ('hellenic egypt period') in which much of the esoteric mystery school culture (gnosticism) carried over into the "western culture" domain, which is how we end up with black maddonnas (isis), the symbolism of the rose, madonna lilly, acacia, lotus and poppy, while you don't see the germanic yews, oaks, clovers, and thistles in motif in christian reliefs.  The common natural element is, however, the
       <em>
        pinecone.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The pine is interesting because it's the key to all this.  Many have equated the pine symbolically to the
       <em>
        pineal gland
       </em>
       , the dmt-releasing 'third eye' that goes into high activity upon death.  Some believe this is also represented in the symbol of the eye of horus, which is the borrowsymbol on the dollar bill, the eye of providence ('all seeing eye' or symbol of the illuminati).  Of course, all this makes sense, if you follow the pinecone pineal backwards through time, from the pinecone fountain in Vatican city back to the obelisks of egypt and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could make the argument that DMT then is the scientific material representation of that same death dove psychopomp, the holy spirit that carries one into the afterlife upon death.

       Not sure (I'm in the same room with intellectual superiors) but I have long thought the bull/bear metaphors were due to the way these two beasts treat their victims (investors/traders). The bull tosses up on his horns, the bear smacks down with his paws. The casual reader may wonder why being tossed up is bad. Well then, you don't know a common speculative practice is to short, meaning sell stocks you don't have while promising to buy them back later.

       Breaking down the words and letters are the key. Probably why key symbolism is so prominent. I'm glad someone delves into the etymology of words and letters and can cross-relate them among previous cultures. That's critical thinking in practice.

       Oh I agree.  I didn't give occult stuff any value until maybe 3 yrs ago.  I thought it was some new age or satanic thing that teenagers play with, the stuff of horror movies.  Then I found out about freemasons and gnostiticsm and alchemy and was like holy crap: The aristrocrats really believe this stuff and ...they live it.   And that the cabal are basically alchemists, trying to immanetize the eschaton, more or less
      </p>

       For example, nancy reagan had an astrologer that decided like 90% of the time whether Ronnie should do a thing or not on a particular day.  If the general public knew this at the time, they'd have flipped their wigs

        The verb quite a simpler meaning than the adj. or noun; no mystic connotation.

        This apocalyptic meme was central to the Jesus character in the New Testament. Jesus was saying his followers would experience Judgement, Heaven, and Hell as real events, within their lifespans. As time went on, and the apocalypse did not come, new ideas about it had to be created. Heaven and Hell had to be put into remote locations, and happen in a remote time (after death).

       And what about the fancy formatting on the OP? How does u/911etc create the horizontal lines, and links hidden by text (like the html code with href)?

       There's nothing wrong with having some pride.  We would think differently about Columbia if we didn't go headshotting one of our most beloved leaders and then casting deep illusions like a funhouse mirror labyrinth since then, sowing chaos and confusion (their order our of our chaos), causing needless deaths of millions and putting that karmic consequence on us as a nation, ensuring that we will have terrorism and war eternally.

       I guess that's my point.  If we hadn't been such

       then we'd have a little pride looking up at columbia and we'd think more about the dove and God then about death, loss, remorse and despair

       Now we should have another post, that carries the theme here into the wars imposed upon the American people (and the world) by their Roman/ Babylonian puppet masters. Because war and death are intertwined like serpents on a staff.

       I kinda agree. This reads a lot like a numerology thread - various coincident details that are read way too far into and linked where no relationship exists.

       There are way more concrete examples of america being a death cult than relying on tenuous etymology.

       All due respect because you're entitled to your opinion, but this is history, not numerology.  If you have a problem with 322 the number, then educate yourself on what skull and bones is and their relationship to freemasonry and what freemasonry is.  That was beyond the scope of the essay, but if you don't know gnosticism, then you don't have the requisite background in the esoteric to make a judgment on this imho.   I don't mean to be insulting, rather I'm inviting you to go forth and read up on gnosticism and the relationship to the  mystery schools which certainly is demonstrable from so many different avenues that to deny it as 'numerology' really doesn't understand any part of the history of our religions, specifically the impact of kabbalism on modern culture.

       Yes, because America is Neo-Rome (rome never died, it became a corporation that is america).  Rome / Catholicism is a death cult for certain, even since constantine. Although he was a key figure.

       America is cultural amalgam of roman (secular/pagan), gnostic (esoteric/occult), christian traditions.  The gnostic component was carried over into roman culture through mystery school tradidtions which were attacked and diminished by early militant christians (see the film 'agora'--rape/slaying of gnostic hypatia (rachael weiss) by christian mob at alexandria egypt).  Because of persecution by jewrun romans, gnosticism then became a tradition of  spies and secret societies instead of 'small religions bound to an area' (ie:cults)--specifically stonemasons, freemasons, rosicrucian esoteric protestant societies and their counterreaction the catholic jesuits who had appropriated the gnostic technologies for the purposes of the church, working quickly to destroy, obfuscate it, delete it from history by rewriting texts, burning books.  The early catholics a millenia earlier took the most important secrets (such as the recipe for soma) from the library of alexandria before burning it, 3 times mind you.

       of cathedrals as freemasons built them (google fulcanelli 'cathedrals as alchemical works'), into the overall design, the positioning and placement upon the earth (along ley lines and aligned with stars), the ornamentation of the interior and exterior, the covert symbolism of basilicas and statuaries, and the design patterns of the stained glass windows.  For example the rose symbolism and the mushroom symbolism, the black maddonna in traditional european cathedrals and in eastern orthodox churches.  These are all 'hints' at the pagan roots of christianity, as are the holidays (christmas is saturnalia/yule, easter is Ishtar/Oester, etc)

       Strangely enough the Dan Brown books--although put forth as 'fiction'--are actually 90% or more accurate historically.  It's a historical fiction, more history than fiction.

       But it goes back even further.  If you believed the above--which you should--this you will not believe, and that's fine.  There is evidence that there was a universal, cosmopolitan religion even before babylon that was a

       Good points.  There was a group similar in light/dark theme to zoroastrianism was
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism">
        manicheanism
       </a>
       .  According to wikipedia it was the competitor to zoro and christianity to replace paganism in the persian to eastern asian region (china), and was namely popular among aristocrats, with entities common to the book of Enoch.  Sound familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right, because manicheanism is a strong candidate as either a predecessor or influencer of gnosticism.

       Yes.  Bavarian Illuminati and America both founded on 1776.  Illuminati created by a Jesuit Adam Weinhaupt.  It was planned in order to destroy it (like the WTC), bringing about one global statist government.

       Interesting read. You make some good points, and I'm going to piggyback on a few of them. The Department of Defense has an extended history in funding or even having a hand in the production of some movies. One of the more recent examples of this would be
       <em>
        Battleship
       </em>
       I remember trying to tell my dad that that movie was propaganda, and he looked at me as if I were an idiot. We're both military vets, and he couldn't even see it. The reason that the Navy had a hand in producing Battleship, and other movies that were released the same year, is because they thought it would increase recruitment. Here's a list of all the movies the Navy helped produce in 2012.

       The thing with military vets is that some manage to break the rose-tinted glasses and see things for what they really are. Sure, you should take pride in defending your country from evil, but the Us vs Them mentality paints every enemy as evil, and we're groomed to believe that we're good. I remember going to a chapel one Sunday during the second week of my basic training, and them playing these videos laden with country music and montages of fighter jets and military personnel, and noticed that people were actually crying while this video was playing on 3 massive projectors. I assume when you're only getting a few hours of sleep and you're stressed out, you break a little--and cheesy, blatant propaganda can screw with you that way.

       When you mentioned the Black Madonnas, it reminded me of the dark skinned woman who was walking across America a few years back. She was dressed in all black robes in all the pictures and YouTube videos I've seen her in

        http://i.imgur.com/j6F8Eiv.jpg

       . An interesting thing of note is that she is an Army veteran and a mother--I'm most likely reaching with this, but could thismake her an a kind of psychopomp or symbol of one of the many Goddesses of death/birth? Also, something even creepier:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        On YouTube, a video taken in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Wise County, Va., shows the woman engaged in a heated debate with an onlooker about the book of Revelations. "We've already won," she says simply when he insists the apocalypse is yet to come.

       Also, it looks like Skull and Bones did admit that they have Geronimo's skull and remains, and great grandson sued the society to get it back, but he lost the case.

       I wouldn't be surprised if those bastards were drinking from Geronimo's skull during communion rituals, similar to the Knights Templar communions, Tibetan Kapala offerings, and practices.

       regarding geronimo's skull: we don't know if they have it or if they just say they have it and never took it.  Either way, it's looks bad.  Either they are unrepentent, unpunished and racist graverobbers or they want everyone to think they are--so it's a psyop on all americans either way.  It says 2 things about them is 1) they feel ivy-league entitled to do so, 2) they are dicks
