       They only reason governments aren’t printing/creating their money supplies, but are borrowing their whole money supply into existence from the International Oligarchs, and then charging the People income tax, is because the politicians are ALL completely bribed off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The International Oligarchs, with Woodrow Wilson’s Unconstitutional signing of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, which gave them private ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank and an exclusive monopoly on the creation of the entire money supply because they print/create the paper money out of thin air and then lend it to the government and to the people through the private banks which they also privately own an exclusive monopoly on. The International Oligarchs also privately own all the centra banks worldwide including the Bank Of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, and they send the US military to attack any country that tries to print/create their own money rather than borrow it from the International Oligarchs, as was seen with Germany(WW2), Iraq, Libya, and now Syria and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The International Oligarchs are using the fake-worth paper money that is being paid back to them to buy everything of worth, like land and precious metals, and then they will let the fake-worth paper money crash, and this will wipe everyone out leaving them as being the only ones who own anything of real value. They are also doing Geo Engineering to cause droughts all over the world so that the farmers have to sell their land to them, and then they will control all the food. Further, they are making people stupider by making them drink Fluoride water, and eat GMO food, forcing vaccines, and breathe the Aluminum in the Geo Engineering Chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the International Oligarchs are going to try to banish cash, this will give them FULL control of all your money, and they will be able to just take it all from you in an instant, and they will just say “Oh, it was a glitch in the computer”, however, you wont get your money back from them for a very long time, if ever. NEVER accept a cashless situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The International Oligarchs also want to back the currency with gold but that is because they own almost all the gold in existence and then can give a really high rate of gold for each dollar and this will suck fake-worth paper money out of the money supply causing a depression because there will not be enough fake-worth paper money around for employers to pay their workers with. Or, they can give a very low rate of gold for each dollar, which is the opposite, which will cause a lot of inflation which makes people poor because the fake-worth dollars are worth much less.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ONLY solution is the Power To Print/Create The Money MUST be taken back to Congress so that the government can lend the money to banks and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security, thus will not be borrowing it and therefore there would be no national debt. The money ONLY needs to be backed by the fact that it is Legal Tender for the payment of the work the People.

       Not so strange when the government has been infiltrated, infected, and taken over by corporate money changers whose primary interest is enslaving the public by making them beholden to a fiat currency paradigm that makes them (us) perpetual wage slaves for our entire lives.

       Right but why do you use "fiat" as a perjorative here? Implying that if it were a gold standard, countries wouldn't be borrowing money from those that own the gold? There was a long-period of gold standard monetary systems throughout history and they all leaned heavily on those who owned and controlled the gold supply. Guess who.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, fiat currency (meaning "money declared by the state") is the only thing standing between people and perpetual debt-slavery. We are currently experiencing privatized fiat monetary system. Earlier in history we had privatized metallic monetary systems. There have been blips of nationalized fiat / token monetary systems throughout history and those have proven to be very successful (Rome, China, post-war Japan, for example)

       Perhaps I should have referred more to a fractional reserve paradigm of money lending more than strictly the fiat type.  That said, one malady easily leads to the other.  That’s why I just used “fiat”.

       when they're shilling this subject like it's back in style again.  I literally don't know a single person who "likes" the criminal Federal Reserve.  The fool last night that was trying to sell all the many benefits of the private Federal Reserve was top notch.  They behave as if we can't see atraight through them from virtually the first moment they open their mouth.

       Exactly what you said.  From the bankers position, it makes all the sense in the world to have all the countires in the world borrowing themselves into bondage.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is always the reverse are those critical issues for us.  We as people always sit and wonder why things are the way they are and few seem to think more than those surface thoughts.  They simply believe and have been told by their parents and others that things are this way, "just because".  No real answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its always the reverse, as I like to call it, because the things that seem strange to us, work out perfectly for banks and their owners.  It makes perfect sense for them to have it this way.  We sit scratching our heads and they sit and count their digits in their bank accounts.

       I agree with the overall dynamic you’re talking about here, but what exactly is it that you’re saying is the reverse?  The critical issues are the reverse?  I don’t quite understand what that means, actually.
      </p>

       I agree with your explanation - most definitely - but I’m just not seeing how this relates to saying that “it’s always the reverse”…
       <em>

       always the reverse?  The reverse of

      <p>
       Ah.  I think I see what you’re saying.  Those things that seem to be “calamitous” or “unfortunate” or bad, etc to most of us - wars, catastrophes, repossessions, house closures, etc - are generally looked upon as “the reverse” by the banks and the corporations - i.e. as
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       .  It’s good for them because they can benefit off of the misfortune and the suffering of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that what you mean?  If so, then I think I can understand what you meant better and I wouldn’t disagree with that.

       No worries.  I think I got what you mean now, and - again - I wouldn’t disagree with you one bit, sir.

       Thanks for the explanation.

       And the fact that the interest charged for these usury scam "loans" is mathematically impossible to ever pay back.  We're experiencing that right now.  The US debt, TRILLIONS UPON TRILLIONS UPON TRILLIONS is owed to who exactly again?  And they're not more powerful that the "sovereign" nations who take out perpetual loans from?  Really?

The International Oligarchs also privately own all the centra banks worldwide including the Bank Of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, and they send the US military to attack any country that tries to print/create their own money rather than borrow it from the International Oligarchs, as was seen with Germany(WW2), Iraq, Libya, and now Syria and Russia.

       Remind me when the US invaded Canada (aside from 1812.), because our central bank is not 'privately owned'. A lot of Americans seem to assume our system is like the federal reserve when it's
       <strong>
        <em>
         nothing
        </em>
       </strong>
       like that. The government of Canada -- and no one else -- owns the bank of Canada. Ofc this isn't to say it hasn't been subverted via the politicians in government. But they do not own it. Which makes the crime that much worse.

       As for Putin, if you think he isn't one  of them I've got a bridge to sell you. Tell me, have you ever looked into the Moscow apartment bombings? If that doesn't set off your bullshit alarms it seems you, like a lot of people, are just looking for a new fuhrer instead of dismantling the concept entirely.

       It doesn't matter for central banks to be privately owned to be honest. Private banks dictate the money supply anyways through private currency creation and central banks must cow-tow to this. Either the central banks meet the banks' liquidity needs or the entire economy is jeopardized via threat of deflation. You don't need to actually control the central bank, you just need the bargaining power to determine its own actions. What we have is the tail wagging the dog.

       More like fear. Every time a country does something beneficial such as "issue it's own currency" the international banking/MSM/MIC goes into full effect. Remember Germany? If we followed the Constitution and rid ourselves from the foreign/private banking cabal, we will be placed on display for the world as the demons that bully everyone. The world will turn on us. That, my friend, is why they borrow money.

       Keep preaching it Mr. Yardley7. I see your posts and upvote all. I think that we are going to have to get creative. Using the tools of the current system we're under, e.g., giving that power back to Congress, isn't just something we can do. Congress is fucked too, and our power to do such a thing through legal and legislative processes doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to imagine how we're going to live, trade and interact without money issued by anyone. It's an evolutionary step that the planet has to do or die trying; it's integral to our survival, IMHO.
