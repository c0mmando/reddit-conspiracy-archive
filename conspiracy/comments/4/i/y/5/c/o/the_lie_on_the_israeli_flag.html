       Well since I have your permission and all...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The star, formed from two triangles one pointed up and one pointed down, is represented by six points. The upward pointing triangle represents male energy, heaven, and fire. The lower triangle represents female energy, water, and Earth. This symbol was also represented as the union of Heaven and Earth, man and woman, fire and sea, and of Israel and Judah. This unification of Judah and Israel was created by King David, hence the name Star of David. In Greece this is the symbol for the great Androgyne and can be found in Pythagorean studies as well as in ancient Egyptian texts relating to the Androgyne. The Androgyne was the original Creator that was genderless. Rather than being male or female, the Androgyne had energies reflecting both genders so indistinguishable as to be unable to tell one trait from the other. The reflection of this may be found in the symbol's early representation of the soul in geometric form. In multifaceted form, it represents the multidimensional mercaba, the flower of life or the chariot of the gods, the basic spiritual expression of the soul in connection to divinity."

       So if you go by this explanation, the Star of David is really a symbol for gender-neutrality.

       You've never read hegel, not surprising but noteworthy nontheless. While the transgender movement is being pushed by the zionist you sourced a meaning later associated with the star of remphan. You didn't prove it doesn't represent as above so below just that it has another interpretation that was assigned to suit their agenda. Here's what actual proof looks like:

       "Real jews" what an entertaining and complicated term. The jews in Israel today come from eastern Europe and are khazarians in descent and were driven out by the mongols, as they were driven out of every place they've ever tried to live since 250 a.d. and further back if you believe the bible.

       Sir, before the the white expansion of Alexander The Great killing off the Muslim leader Cyrus The Great, Blacks and Muslims were like brothers. It wasn't until Esau escaped the cave did the racial war begin.

       This is why you never see black cave men.

       I am telling you this because the Bible says it would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man called Jesus was a BLACK man, the color of
       <strong>
        burnt brass
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As we know, the white Jews are the reason the Transatlantic slave trade happened. Rothschild's owned the South and the Confederacy. They are the reason the Indians were genocided and the black Hebrews were enslaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book of Obadiah or better known as the destruction of Edom/Esau.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obadiah King James Version.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Speaking of Obama (A black leader with absolute power) and Black Hebrews
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Speaking of Obama (A black leader with absolute power) and Black Hebrews
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Speaking of White Pride.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The American Flag being brought down
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Esau is so selfish that he would not even leave a few grapes on the ground.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The world would begin to see the truth, Revelations 3:9 would begin to happen. Suddenly the false Jews (Our brothers) would be under determination and discrimination when before they were hailed as the most powerful of powerful. Entire world would be against them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Speaking of the confederacy that brought us to the shores of America. Tricked and defeated the Black Hebrews. Bread meaning the social bonding between Jacob and Esau had all been a trick. Esau backstabbed Jacob and stole the knowledge. This is why they are referred to as
       <strong>
        converts
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If that sounds like fiction, maybe we are living a story book.

       Heavily rewritten but left in the fact that the Hebrews are black? That seems like a big whoopsie. Not to mention hundreds of European scholars have came forth and said the same thing. The Hebrews are the people that went into slavery.

       What makes you think Blacks (Africans) are the "real" Jews over Arabs? I can see where the Dogon tribe goes into Egyptian Tribe. But.... It's not Blacks. It's a mixture. So,  Africans have no claim, unless they want to claim they aren't African, but mixed culture of Arabs and Africans.... Doesn't make them Black or African anymore, now does it....... Also, Egyptians were not black. They were a mix. Brown skinned, sure. But not black.... If you wanna go the bible route, well that shit is far too corrupted....

       Blacks that got moved over here during the slave trade were Shamitic not Hamitic.

        A major element in the Sumerian civilisation*, says the African-American historian and researcher Runoko Rashidi, were black migrants from the Nile Valley who called themselves “Blackheads”. Research suggests that the biological make-up of the Sumerians was the same as that of the Ancient Egyptians, the Dogon of West Africa and the indigenous Australians, the Aborigines.

       Dogon, Hopi, Hebrew Bible all say the same thing, The New world order is the return of the Black Empire.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Revelation 20King James Version (KJV)
       </p>
       <p>
        1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, &lt;-------Speaking of London, The Rothschild.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more,
        <strong>
         till the thousand years should be fulfilled
        </strong>
        : and after that he must be loosed a little season.
       </p>

       Esau = Edom = Khazars
      </p>
      <p>
       Jacob = Israel = Blacks Americans, Haitians, Samoans, Panama Blacks, Brazil (think City Of God),  West Indies, Mexicans, Dominicans, Seminole Indians, Puerto Ricans, Cubans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopi, Dogon, all say the same thing as the Hebrew Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible speaks of the star coming to, just like the Dogon &amp; Hopi believed in Sirius B would come to save them.

       You've never read hegel, not surprising but noteworthy nontheless. While the transgender movement is being pushed by the zionist you sourced a meaning later associated with the star of remphan. You didn't prove it doesn't represent as above so below just that it has another interpretation that was assigned to suit their agenda. Here's what actual proof looks like:
