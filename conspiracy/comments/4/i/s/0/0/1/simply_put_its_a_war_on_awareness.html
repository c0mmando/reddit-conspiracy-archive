        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The great religions and spiritual masters have all taught that awareness (or God, the Holy Spirit, whatever you want to call it) is the one constant in the universe. You don’t really need “faith” or “revelation” to come to grips with this concept – in fact, you are always aware without even trying.</p>

<p>Awareness is simply the field in which all other phenomena arise. For example, at any given moment you might feel happy, angry, confused, excited, bored, or stimulated - but none of these feelings are fundamentally you, right? Feelings come and go. You, on the other hand, are the one who is aware of these sensations as they arise in your mind and body.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the nature of awareness can be very helpful when you want to get more in touch with the truth about this life. Indeed, underlying our biases and conditioned modes of thought is a base of pure knowing, which you can learn to consciously tap into. You certainly don’t have to be a sage for this concept to be useful – putting even a little space between “me” and “my thoughts” is immensely helpful in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Objective Truth</strong></p>

<p>Ego attachments, personal biases, and other baggage “fog up” one’s awareness and thus make it harder to perceive reality from an objective standpoint. A “foggy” awareness gets caught up on reactive thoughts, irrational biases, and future worries.</p>

<p>For example, someone firmly grounded in a state of awareness can look at a bowl of ice cream and think, “That might be tasty for a couple minutes, but it will make me fat later on, so I think I’ll pass.” People further removed from pure awareness, on the other hand, often get overtaken by their feelings in these situations. They feel like they need ice cream, even if this urge makes no rational sense. Mistaking feelings for the truth has been a problem for humanity since the dawn of time.  </p>

<p>In past posts, I’ve talked a lot about the idea of “objective truth.” Getting in touch with objective truth is the process of becoming increasingly comfortable with perceiving the world as-it-is instead of habitually filtering reality through a “firewall” of feelings and personal biases.  </p>

<p>Schools, the media, and other cultural forces (both consciously and unconsciously) are currently working to shift us away from this state of awareness/pure knowing. One reason this occurs is because one can gain power by shuttering other people’s ability to accurately discern reality.</p>

<p><strong>Feelings</strong></p>

<p>One of the main tactics the “Blue Pill” (to use a term from the Matrix) uses is get us identified with our feelings instead of with our awareness. This method works brilliantly, because we’re all prone to dwelling on our feelings any ways. Feelings can be extremely intense (both in a positive or negative way) and they are fodder for our ego, so they are easy to become identified with. For instance, suppose you’ve had a couple relationships that ended in a painful manner. You may go on to subconsciously associate love and relationships with “pain” and “heart break” and decide they just aren’t worth it. This decision is not actually rational, since avoiding relationships will make you even more unhappy, but it’s one that a lot of us make any ways because the past hurt is just so overwhelming.</p>

<p>To reiterate: feelings aren’t bad, but they should not be used as a guide for making decisions (besides extremely basic stuff like whether or not to touch a hot frying pan) since they aren’t rational. Feelings are just sensations that come and go. For instance, some people feel euphoric while taking drugs, but this feeling is disconnected from the truth – it’s a lie, since drugs don’t bring happiness in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>The War on Objective Truth</strong></p>

<p>There is a planned effort to condition people away from the awareness/knowing state. There seems to be a “spirit of evil” out there that just hates happiness. The knowing state of consciousness also makes for inefficient workers and disorderly soldiers, so it must be done away with by the few who possess knowledge about how human beings function. I mean this in a literal sense, by the way, not in a paranoid/half-true rambling sort of way. Recall that Edward Bernays, a pioneer in the public relations industry and cousin of Sigmund Freud, had this to say in his book Propaganda:</p>

<p>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country…We are governed, our minds are molded, our tasted formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.” (1)</p>

<p>To explain how real this war is, I’ll start with Benjamin Bloom and his series of educational theory books (called Bloom’s Taxonomies.) These books attempt to provide a comprehensive road map for “learning” (if you can call it that), from its basic to most advanced levels.</p>

<p>Bloom’s Taxonomies have been extremely influential in public school districts around the country. Indeed, three-time New York City Teacher of the Year (and educational-system whistle blower) John Taylor Gatto writes that Bloom’s Taxonomies were part of a program that was “inserted into every state education department in the country and moneys were inserted there to pay faculty a certain range of bribes for the school districts that would pioneer the use of these things.” (1) All one has to do is download a local school curriculum to see Bloom’s terms and methods in use.</p>

<p>So what type of learning does Mr. Bloom have in mind for America’s children? Designing not just a curriculum – but an entire methodology that determines what it means to be educated is no small task.</p>

<p>Bloom divides his model for education into three domains: cognitive (knowledge-based), affective (emotive based), and psychomotor (action-based). Each domain has its own book and provides a hierarchy of levels that students must pass through on the way to mastery.</p>

<p>Early on in Book 1 (the cognitive domain), Bloom writes: “What we are classifying is the intended behavior of students – the ways in which individuals are to act, think or feel as the result of participating in some unit of instruction.” (3) Wait a second – the “intended behavior” of students? How we are supposed to “think” and “act?” That sounds like the opposite of becoming educated!  </p>

<p>In Book 2 (on the “affective domain” – remember, this Bloom’s term for the role of emotions in education), he writes: “To create effectively a new set of attitudes and values, the individual must undergo great reorganization of his personal beliefs and attitudes and he must be involved in an environment which in many ways is separated from the previous environment in which he was developed.” (4) The “previous environment,” of course, is the child’s home. This weirdo is talking about using the public school system to change values that were learned from parents and siblings.</p>

<p>The next quote is perhaps the most interesting. Remember, the “affective domain” is your feelings. Bloom writes, “The affective domain is, in retrospect, a virtual Pandora’s Box…It is in this ‘box’ that the most influential controls are to be found.” He’s talking about manipulating emotions in order to establish behavioral controls on young Americans. Bloom continues, “The affective domain contains the forces that determine the nature of an individual’s life and ultimately the life of an entire people.” (5)</p>

<p>This last point touches on an important idea that I think many people who reflexively dismiss “conspiracy theories” choose to ignore. Someone is tasked with designing the education system for this (and all) nations. Whoever does will have an absolutely massive impact on the country. The question is then: well, what are these people’s goals? What do they themselves believe in? Do any of us know, or are we going to just have blind faith in these people? After all, the school system wasn’t handed down from God. It’s designed by men and women who have their own set of biases and blind spots (or even worse.)</p>

<p>Any how, the background to Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues is that they were/are people interested in psychology and the behavioral sciences. They were atheists who felt that science and rationality could solve all the world’s problems, and thus sought to design a curriculum where science was used to control people “for their own good.” They were also dedicated relativists and denied any concept of objective truth. Indeed, Bloom writes in Book 1 that “We recognize the point of view that truth and knowledge are only relative and that there are no hard and fast truths which exist for all time and and places.” (6) It’s truly bizarre for a person at the top of our educational system to basically declare that truth doesn’t exist, but I digress.  </p>

<p>A second bit of context people should know about Benjamin Bloom is that he cites the Frankfurt School of critical theory as one of the main influences for his methodology. Specifically, he says that his worldview was largely shaped by Frankfurt school theorists Theodor Adorno and Erich Fromm. These guys were German Marxists who Hitler kicked out of the country prior to World War II. They relocated to United States universities and continued their writings, which are extremely critical of traditional Western culture. I’ve come to disagree with this school of thought, but these men were exceptionally brilliant (in an evil way.)   </p>

<p>Any ways, after World War II the Frankfurt theorists studied why Fascism had taken over their homeland. They were appalled by the carnage Hitler inflicted on his own countrymen, and eventually came to conclude that he was an archetypal representation of the German father figure. Violent, irrational, and overbearing: this type of Father had to go, since it alienated young kids and then made them up to the State (i.e. Hitler) as a Father. Theodor Adorno in particular did a massive study on this topic and published his findings in a book called The Authoritarian Personality.</p>

<p>The theorists then faced an issue: they wanted to weaken the father’s grasp on his family (to prevent kids from becoming disaffected), but also couldn’t have this backfire and wind up with a Hitler-like figure who would act as Father for the whole nation. A form of socialism was thus deemed the best way to negate the Father’s influence while also preventing the country from descending into Fascism. What we are taught today, and I will demonstrate this further in my next post, is directly out of this Frankfurt School ideology, and its core is basically Marxist. They are using many tricks of behavioral science and Freudian psychology to adjust young kid’s minds and, basically, make them sick.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been researching enlightenment for a few years and contacting various auothors on the subject and someone suggested this guy on youtube.....think its snbeings channel......</p>

<p>He&#39;s got a free book on his vids and I downloaded it....and holy shit......I became aware of my own ego, the biases, the filters, the illusions.....and one day there was like an unmasking experience......like imagine consciousness was a non-stick frying pan set sideways....and there is no where for any of the old illusions and masks to stick to.</p>

<p>Then, by being in this non-stick state, my consciousness became freed from the head and merged in the heart with this Infinite consciousness......still happens off and on and &#39;my&#39; consciousness is no longer limited to my head.</p>

<p>Still learning and working out all these different kinks....but this stuff is legit.</p>

<p>The biggest conspiracy there is is that our own ego isn&#39;t even real....but it imagines itself to be you....its a phantom.....everyone is hijacked by a phantom illusion....and I wouldn&#39;t even ever had believed it if I hadn&#39;t seen it myself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to compliment you on an extraordinarily well-written, insightful, and valuable post. You have obviously achieved a level of enlightenment, of which most are unaware. I&#39;m convinced that while we struggle here in the flesh, truly ALL battles are fundamentally of the spirit - light and darkness, good and evil, truth and error, consciousness and hypnosis, etc...</p>

<p>For those seeking greater understanding, I would highly suggest checking out the writings of Roy Master and Eckhart Tolle, among others. Oh, and most of all - Jesus Christ!</p>
