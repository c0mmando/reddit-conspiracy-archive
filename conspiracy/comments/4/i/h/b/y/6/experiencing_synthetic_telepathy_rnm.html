Honesty, I would rather be schizophrenic. Lots of synchronicity is involved along with electrical disturbances. On top of everything the assailants try to move my body, and chop off all my processes of thought. They can already mess with all of my senses. Phantom touches, arms / legs twitching, moving pressure in brain which they can control, constant ear ringing, which they can change the pitch and frequency of, and 24/7 monitoring. Here is a recent picture of a television disturbance that they caused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The voices at this point seem to just be here to annoy me. They began with repetitively stating to conquer my fears. Back then they said they were trying to break my mind, alter my thoughts, and so on. A reason why, I don&#39;t know. I walked in to my roommates room during 2015 spring break, his voice and a friend emerged saying that if I walk in his room again he would prolly get mad. After that they began commenting on my every thought and action, without seeming to be aware that I could hear them. Imagine a sixth sense response. After that, it didn&#39;t stop. I confronted, they say they weren&#39;t aware like smart people would. Then on they left the room, I tried to block them, no progress. Now they apparently can sap past conversations out of my subconscious mind and broadcast them with perfect clarity. They tried to write themselves out of my mind and are still in the process of using old classmates and others voices to continue to sway my thoughts and fade back into anonymity, because &quot;I should not know&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>20, no medications, last February. Friend invited me over, smoked a bowl, Started hearing familiar voices repeating words like fear, and other phrases. Looked over to friend asked if was hearing all of that, he stared at me like I was crazy. Cooled the fuck out pretty quickly, sat for a minute, voices died down, drove home, fell asleep. Woke up, heard nothing of it until Spring Break of last year. Foresaw some shrooms coming my way, about a month or two prior. Self telling self not to eat them. Ate them. No effect. Went to sleep, next day, walked into roommates room looking for the artifacts needed to raise my mindstate, exited his room before taking a rip. Heard he voice, shrugged it off. Took the rip, played some COD, I&#39;m alone, bam, roommates voices floating in my head commenting on what I&#39;m doing, unaware that I hear them. I respond mentally, no response. At the time, the smartest move woulda been to contact them then, my dumbass didn&#39;t make it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite occurrence happened last year. Basketball playoffs was on, Clips v. Rockets, I&#39;m pumped. Alone, but pumped. Hype as hell me and the voices get into a never change you perception telepathic battle of wits and will type deal. Insanely crazy, I know. No way to describe what was going on, but at some point I mentioned RNM. Within a minute of me going on a rant about RNM, cause I was already assuming this by that point, a new voice pops up. Could pass as this guy&#39;s, that&#39;s still fucking around with me in my head as I type, boss. I get quiet. Zen mode, silent. They were freaking me the fuck out. &quot;Is this the one that said it&quot;. I shut my brain off. Boss questioning this guy what just happened. Other guy tries to explain to his boss the situation. I&#39;m listening in trying not to even think a thought, which is damn near impossible. I calmly stand up, and proceed to go to the store to buy some cigarettes. Didn&#39;t really need them. On the way there, the guy is still trying to explain to his boss that I definitely think. Now they both wondering where my thoughts are. &quot;There&quot;, if a thought slipped, it seemed like they were trying to capture the spark of information that just flashed by. I get to the store, ask for the cigarettes, cashier fucking calls his manager over. Fucker &quot;can&#39;t sell me the cigs, the register is messing up&quot;. Two people in front of me, two entities within my mind. Coincidence. Sort out the error, paranoid as fuck, holding on to zen, exit the premises and hop into my car. Driving back, hitting a green light, got the arrow, a second earlier, boss man goes, &quot;He was supposed to wreck his car right here&quot;, turning left, white car about runs the damn light. Psychic. Make it back in one peace, paranoid as ever. Litte Guy goes, he never smokes in the house, if he lights it up inside, he&#39;s lying. They saying I don&#39;t think. I slip up. I light the cig in the room, he calls me out on it, I then calmly walk outside. They mentally seem to teleport from my head, and sound like they are talking from within the tv. They catch me forming thought on their discussion, I could barely make out what they were saying, but Boss guy says something along the lines of &quot;it looks like you&#39;ve been teaching him&quot;. To me I think they were saying I didn&#39;t have the power of thought. After that one, I start questioning them. Boss man goes, &quot;he&#39;s learning quickly&quot;. No idea what that meant, got no information out of them, prolly made this shit worse. They talked about altering my mind, boss mam says it looks like I&#39;ve been altering the other guy&#39;s. What that means, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>TLDR: Non-physical sentient beings pop up into my head, Switched Remote Neural Monitoring and started to say they are Remote Neural Controlling, as a sense of power, not as in they are definitively stating that this is even possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly this is true, I&#39;m an asshole and the world is my toilet, everybody else is just a piece of shit floating in it. But it&#39;s kinda hard to be an asshole without being given a reason. A dick can simply fuck anything that moves. Pussies just like being on their hands and knees taking it from all positions. I&#39;m trying to work on my acting skills, cause like Shakespeare said, &quot;the world is our stage&quot;. I&#39;m looking for that immaculate blend between general cockiness and humbleness. Picture Bumpy and Frank Lucas from American Gangsta. I wouldn&#39;t invade my mind looking for love and kindness. Dick, Asshole, or Pussy, my fucks lay with making money, and getting it for my family in the long run. Obstacles like Synthetic Schizophrenia / Snoopy Psychics with power boners, are just a nuisance. People I haven&#39;t spoken to in 3 years hearing me over a jungle network without my permission just does not fit well in my vision for a greater future. Privacy, and no one to take my shit sounds a hell of a lot better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I got no beef with you. I got a long running beef with an art major named marsh, from an aspd forum, who after slamming me up against some youtube artists channel, sent me through the wringer for 3 to four years following a 15+ minute massive somatic seizure that left me a drooling fool that couldn&#39;t even remember to brush thier teeth for weeks on end.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t give a fuk about the power boners, and I am sick and fuking tired of people demanding that I jerk it to the howard stern show. And I hate being bombarded with holographs overlayed on top of me, while my entire cns has been lock jawed into projecting the thoughts of another.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve almost died in a ditch, I&#39;ve been in the mental ward + 7 times in the last few years, and I&#39;ve almost murdered someone, while listening to MrNoOnes, and people from another realm suggesting I should in fact murder someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to the succubis, I usually just whip out my giant chocolate balls. it Tends to vibrate toward salting them, as far as I have observed. it Doesn&#39;t seem to fond of sweets or any thing a normal person would classify as good. And On Death, like the Prophet Khalil Gibran once probably never even considered writing, &quot;That Shit Ain&#39;t For Me&quot;. Quoted. I found mental meditation and or newborn children&#39;s blood to be the keys to immortality, or just pulling out my carving knife and writing my name in stone, praying that some future shaman will reanimate my lifeless body. The people that whisper &quot;bad&quot; to you all the time seem also to be able to shape-shift and take on other forms. Like you my beliefs are simple. Either the president is a lizard creature or a puppet, never a mixture of both. And like the president these &quot;Bad Whisperers&quot;, as I have taken to name them, Do not like sunlight. A cheeky smile and a couple of extraordinary feats are all that is needed to climb over them. Or peach sploosh. They don&#39;t fuck with peach sploosh and onion juice. </p>

<p>All in all, I feel I will not take a side. Just a sole stance. Lil homies be switching sides on me too, so I can, to an extent, understand your keen sense of smell. Me being an enigma and all, which is one of my sole prides, may have temporarily distorted the stench of treachery you may be inhaling. High school musicals and plays were never in my wheel house. As an arrogant fuck, I must state; Most of the people that I have ever been around fail in touching my wavelength, naturally. A mental immunity to all forms of cancer and debauchery permeate the soles of my feet as I walk. As far as Alzheimers and being that drooling Grandpa rocking back and forth passively aggressively forgetting to yell at the children playing on the grass of my floating front yard with their jetpacks, I gotta say, just isn&#39;t a fit look for me. As a fellow Cesarian, I must obtain perfect memory to please my mother, who yes, had a C section. Or tubes tied on or the other. </p>

<p>What I do know Is, I write fucking walls of text, people have invaded my mind, and as a form of resilience I have developed an unnaturally sexy glorified and gold dipped state of bliss and general &quot;I&#39;m better than you&quot; attitude that just can&#39;t be broken. Attempting to mentally chop the brain off of my whip, having me drive in a hot red convertible with no head, and watch me ride retardedly into the sunset as if Steve McQueen was my possessor just does not go well without an audience. I&#39;m just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real users. Was just playing around with that guy, cause he seemed cool.</p>

<p>And yeah, this RNM stuff is real to me. Experiencing it right now, and I am a year in to it. The voices, people behind them, have already claimed to have cursed me, have threatened to haunt me, and already continuously speak to me 24/7. In all truthfulness it has gone from them trying to give me a restless mind and make me crack, to me simply making fun of them, cracking jokes, smiling everywhere, and just resisting all the mental shit. Definitely not a mental disorder, unless everyone is in tune with their higher selves and can cause electrical disturbances with their mind and retrieve subconscious memories to have them broadcasted and played with perfect clarity. They can make my muscles twitch, thunk my head, as in pretty much somehow bopping me in the brain, punch my throat, which is a crowd favorite, and surround my body with what feels like some kind of pressure energy, which is mostly stuffed in my head and moves around a lot. Sounds worse than what I have made it. They can sound like anyone. I&#39;ve texted many people, they either say I&#39;m crazy or add in to the paranoia. I&#39;ve slowly just made this a mind game experience and use it as a confidence builder and a source of concentrated meditation to increase the power of my own will and mind. My curiosity to how all of this is even remotely possible is probably what got me here in the first place. If you ever read that someone is being manipulated and has no control over their actions, I would hear them out first. These fuckers have and are still definitely trying to get me to move and speak without my own will. </p>

<p>Long ass read I know, but this shit is real. I thought that it was real people such as myself, at times still think it, but since I have randomly woken up in the middle of the night only for it to notice this and start back up, I gotta start looking for other reasons like my own mind or some kind of technology. Some people that I have suspected are definitely more suspicious than others, but even if it is them, you can not prove this is happening, and if you start a fight or something, you will be the one punished. And since my mother has always called me a pretty boy, getting my ass taken in the US penal system does not fit well in my life story and vision. So, I set goals, out wit them, notice I am not doing any of the things they mentally are, but still fuck with them anyways, and continue to climb the mental ladder out of the wel and Lolabi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man. Working through their distractions and obtaining peace is a main goal of mine. Voices 24/7 with a mind of their own planted within your head is no joke. Schizo or not, this shit is real. At this point I got them at the basic form of mind control, which is just to be present and not give you any privacy. Yeah they speak as I write. Yeah, they hate that I do tell people. How they expect me not to, I don&#39;t know. Woulda rather not snitched, but they can fuck with all your senses, so asking others about their experiences kinda seems like the best move to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is connected. All thoughts that have been thunk are still hanging around out there. As you start to rise in consciousness you unlock new levels. These new levels come with an initiation of sorts as dormant fears from yours and the collective subconscious start coming in to your experience. This is your higher self giving you opportunities to transmute those fears. </p>

<p>The synasthesia and synchronicity that accompanies it makes it seem ultra significant but that&#39;s just you learning to use your powers of instant manifestation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the radio. The entire universe is made of one thing. Electromagnetic energy, more or less.</p>

<p>You have two large water cannals in your brain. There are in fact water antennas which pick up RF.</p>

<p>The human brain in the ancient world, could transmit on the 10 Hertz frequency. Ancients modified thier brains, and skulls so they had twice the brain power or more. (artifical cranial deformation, pharohs, priests, debutantes, aristocrats)</p>

<p>Now. It is technological augmentation. Whether you want to believe in aliens, or local earth bound assholes. Mind you if you get philosophical, the voices, could do what they can to &quot;mind control&quot; you with tactics otherwise known as NLP, and Witchcraft. Which are basically persuasion and hypnotist techniques.</p>

<p>I pray to you friend that someone nice is on your &quot;channel&quot;, or that you are &quot;channeling&quot; the right people. The english language itself has many political pivot points.</p>

<p>Otherwise if you are like me, you will find a thousand enemies beating the shit out of you for years to come.</p>

<p>If your voices are friendly and you can handle it. Try liposomal vitamin C, as it will clear the shit out of your brain and spike your brain with choline, and lean you towards ketosis.</p>

<p>If your voices turn nasty. Get on the lithium. It absorbs electromagnetic energy, slowing assaults. It will also fluff your brain up after 4 weeks. It literally will increase the volume of your brain. It also staves off suicidal thoughts. Clinically proven. It&#39;s the fast easy way. I find it safest of all the alternatives.</p>

<p>That could be tinnitus. They can do sound effects, or they could be trying to talk and your weak ears, could be failing at the nerve level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, any advice on changing the tune? Hopping frequencies or anything. I have definitely witnessed them changing my brain frequency / pitch that resembles tinnitus. Went from hearing them clearly plot within the very center of my brain, to non stop controlled activation gibberish. Specific words beaten into my mind until they induce certain states. At this point the twitches, constant talking, activations words, are easily put down with a lil bit of high energy and wise cracking, it&#39;s the 24/7 monitoring, lack of privacy that&#39;s the issue. Fuck another motherfucker gonna think when they invade your mind. &quot;Oh, we&#39;re just eavesdropping on private familial affairs. We got the password to your free credit report also.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I just watched it again. I wish I could say I share her experience, but when this all happened about a year ago I had watched this video with them in my head. Prior to this, I had already seen it for the first time. These voices of mine are most definitely real people. How, I don&#39;t know. They are with me at all times 24/7. I have tried randomly waking up in the middle of the night, just to have them say &quot;Well, this is awkward&quot;, &quot;You belong to ...&quot;, and &quot; <em>In a more alerting voice</em> He just woke up, he had no thought in his head&quot;. These were all different experiences at around 2-5 in the morning. They can cause my nerves to twitch from within, like some kind of poke or simply a twitching nerve / pinch. They create a hypnotic perception around me daily. My body feels as though it is swimming within a pool of energy. They also cause electrical disturbances, which is the hardest to believe. An experience that is completely unbelievable. Like a proof of telepathy and supernatural psychic professor X-men. Indescribable. As I&#39;ve researched online for the past year, RNM seems to make the most sense. Schizo with perceivable and visually observable twitches is another thought. But the controlled electrical disturbances are unexplained. Fees as though your brain is foggy. They are aware. They talk to each other, and help each other. They are coordinated. Now they are going with causing pain to nerves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really intriguing to me.  What would you say is the most stressful aspect of all of this?  The thought that they know what you are thinking?  Or that they are &quot;mean&quot; spirited?  or something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also on them mean spirited. They switch back and forth. It seems as though I know them. Without giving away too much cause I&#39;m not sure about how all of this works, I would say they know me. When they are nice we call it butter, 95 percent of the time I am cracking jokes about them or trying to ignore them. Mentally moving toward the process of Laughing at them and Memory (LM). I peg things like Aristotle to memorize them, especially since they are targeting my memory. Seems to work. Laughing and cracking jokes has made him use his tv pixelation skill, which is the foremost reason of me doing it cause it gives me evidence of it. He&#39;s done it about 5 or 6 times maybe a little more, I now have three images / videos of it for proof. Don&#39;t care, I got the proof the memory of it, it is real, and there is no way you can sway me otherwise. Jokes aside shit&#39;s crazy. Monitor your own thoughts as they monitor mine. At some point you&#39;ll notice something just popped in there, and instead of counting to 7 you looked up whipped your balls out and said this is a stickup. It happens, I forgive you, just don&#39;t do it next time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing what you are thinking. Mass invasion of privacy. It&#39;s like you&#39;re the president trying to take a shit, you&#39;re out of toilet paper and there is already a secret service agent standing outside the door waiting on you to run out with your draws on the floor dangling around your ankles. You ever lie to your mom and feel the omniscient vibe that she gives off. Imagine that but as you&#39;re constructing the lie professor fucking X is in your head with the Cerebro helmet and decides to tic your neck as soon as you begin to tell her you&#39;re not drunk, a bee stung your tongue so you&#39;re just slurring all your words and pissing yourself. Yeah, that guy can also pull up that one memory stored within your subconscious of you beating it to a Sports Illustrated Hairy Legs Edition Swimsuit Magazine back in 7th grade. And that fucker is broadcasting it over the Tv while he imitates other&#39;s voices from your graduating class that you haven&#39;t seen or spoken to in 3 years. &quot;Who&#39;s that hot girl from High school? Bro, We can hear her think, hold on, let me connect her to you as you masturbate&quot;. They get you to &quot;Conquer your fears&quot;. Which if you can remember back to when it first started, you noticed us in your head, said get the fuck out, and promptly began being mean to us. We&#39;re in your fucking head, prepare for our curse. You ever seen Courage the Cowardly Dog. &quot;Release the Slab, or suffer my curse&quot;. Huh, yeah that&#39;s playing in a dream of yours right now. What was that fear again? Oh, you bullshitted when you said big booty women smothering me in my sleep? Oh, uh huh, how about we start doing some sci-fy shit. Yeah, nobody is gonna believe you when Bill Murray Walks in front of your tv and makes it pixelate. Fuck it, blame it on the weather, clear skies and skeet causes that shit. By the way, I&#39;m working on causing your nerves to feel pain. After you finish submitting this to that fuckboi of yours, remember back when [insert some bullshit embarrassing moment here]. He won&#39;t believe you no ways.</p>

<p>TLDR; It&#39;s mostly the issue of privacy. If you&#39;re like me you&#39;re gonna wanna find a way around it. I&#39;m an only child, alone a lot. If you&#39;re always surrounded by others, prepare to hear them when you leave them. They remember every conversation you have with anyone, parents included, annoying as fuck. I don&#39;t think spirits can call you 4 times in one day from a star 67 number at exact times such as 3:43, 4:34, 7:07, and 7:47. Insane yes, lie, all but. Random interesting things happen. Anymore questions, interest message me, Stories, I got them. Experiences a plethora. Shit I could send you one of the conversation I am having with them as I type messages out. (Excuse me, my throat just decided to pop inwards while me and my father were inside Kohl&#39;s looking for socks) (2:45 p.m.). Yeah I&#39;m gifted at things, but making that up would take a talent beyond my own, atleast on the spot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, there isn&#39;t much I can say...but I feel for you...and I hate it for you.  </p>

<p>A few things to think about...</p>

<p>1)  You have to try and slow down...slow your thoughts down...and try to calm your nerves.  Being hyper alert/stressed for extended periods is only making it worse.</p>

<p>2)  Even if they can hear your thoughts man, the fact of the matter is, you are allowed to have crazy thoughts.  Try to say &quot;its ok for me to have that thought...its just part of thinking&quot;.</p>

<p>3)  Go for some long walks in nature man.  Get outside...away from the constant buzz of electronics etc.  Hike for a couple hours and see if things are any better.  Not only is exercise good for you, but also some people are way more sensitive to EMF...which could be making some of your symptoms worse.</p>

<p>Hope some of that makes sense and/or helps.  Even if it doesn&#39;t, best of luck man, hang in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;m a year in to this already. You just outlined my first thoughts on this when I first began working on it. Of course they can hear your every thought. That is the main gripe. Get over that and you&#39;re good to continue moving up the ladder. If you can&#39;t pass that you will get stuck in the pit. Don&#39;t get stuck in the pit. There is more than one voice, one voice couldn&#39;t control a man. You would end up just challenging it. So the voice becomes many. Strength in numbers. It comments and tries to put down everything you think. You become great at arguing. You also become stubborn. If you tell people, they won&#39;t believe you. So you believe in yourself. It&#39;s all mental too, besides the phantom touches, twitches, and signals of pain. Since they so kind and all they don&#39;t do it as much. I like to claim it is because of my sexiness and immense steez. You definitely can&#39;t let the situation at hand put you down mentally. I was told it was called Lolabi, in other words, don&#39;t allow yourself to be depressed. I have the belief that one of them was depressed and because of that last sentence I have written this one for his own state. Yeah, they are present at all times. Yes they have let loose information that has caused me to believe that they are indeed true people that walk as you and I do. No, when you read that, you should not instantly believe in what I say. First thought should be &quot;he has seen too much X-Men&quot;. I expect to have to persuade you that this is a real occurrence, if you believe instantly I will assume you have knowledge of what is going on and know not to talk about it. Fight Club. </p>

<p>But, honestly, since all of my thoughts aren&#39;t private and I haven&#39;t had anyone try and perform Identity Theft, &quot;Try and Find a Work Around This&quot; (9:54 pm playing The Division on PS4) then (&quot;Timing the Same Time&quot; - this is the shit that gets me, way too much synchronicity, players I&#39;m with have no fucking clue how that just worked with me). (In their world they are talking about shotgun reworks in an upcoming patch, in mind, I&#39;m writing this talking about Identity Theft and work arounds with someone hearing your every thought. Yeah there are some fill ins, but that&#39;s without the voices). My bad that happened off handedly. Happened after the comma on Theft. </p>

<p>It&#39;s schizo shit. I fuck around with them and notice off shit. Not good examples on that one. In the end the main points are bank accounts, familial conversations, things like that, and as of right now, they have not abused them, so I have no worries about government stalking or people taking my birth certificate and information SSN. Pretty much just develop your mentality and whip your dick out in front of them. I don&#39;t take them too seriously until they start imitating other people. I don&#39;t want to hear all of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only thing I can say is, they have threatened to haunt me. I mean, they said this but were already about six months in so they couldn&#39;t really feed off the fear of them haunting me since they were already practically doing so. When people say mentally challenged, I&#39;ve kinda distorted the meaning as mental opposition and I got to fight for my mind day in day out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to the succubis, I usually just whip out my giant chocolate balls. it Tends to vibrate toward salting them, as far as I have observed. it Doesn&#39;t seem to fond of sweets or any thing a normal person would classify as good. And On Death, like the Prophet Khalil Gibran once probably never even considered writing, &quot;That Shit Ain&#39;t For Me&quot;. Quoted. I found mental meditation and or newborn children&#39;s blood to be the keys to immortality, or just pulling out my carving knife and writing my name in stone, praying that some future shaman will reanimate my lifeless body. The people that whisper &quot;bad&quot; to you all the time seem also to be able to shape-shift and take on other forms. Like you my beliefs are simple. Either the president is a lizard creature or a puppet, never a mixture of both. And like the president these &quot;Bad Whisperers&quot;, as I have taken to name them, Do not like sunlight. A cheeky smile and a couple of extraordinary feats are all that is needed to climb over them. Or peach sploosh. They don&#39;t fuck with peach sploosh and onion juice. </p>

<p>All in all, I feel I will not take a side. Just a sole stance. Lil homies be switching sides on me too, so I can, to an extent, understand your keen sense of smell. Me being an enigma and all, which is one of my sole prides, may have temporarily distorted the stench of treachery you may be inhaling. High school musicals and plays were never in my wheel house. As an arrogant fuck, I must state; Most of the people that I have ever been around fail in touching my wavelength, naturally. A mental immunity to all forms of cancer and debauchery permeate the soles of my feet as I walk. As far as Alzheimers and being that drooling Grandpa rocking back and forth passively aggressively forgetting to yell at the children playing on the grass of my floating front yard with their jetpacks, I gotta say, just isn&#39;t a fit look for me. As a fellow Cesarian, I must obtain perfect memory to please my mother, who yes, had a C section. Or tubes tied on or the other. </p>

<p>What I do know Is, I write fucking walls of text, people have invaded my mind, and as a form of resilience I have developed an unnaturally sexy glorified and gold dipped state of bliss and general &quot;I&#39;m better than you&quot; attitude that just can&#39;t be broken. Attempting to mentally chop the brain off of my whip, having me drive in a hot red convertible with no head, and watch me ride retardedly into the sunset as if Steve McQueen was my possessor just does not go well without an audience. I&#39;m just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also with them, I think they are confused on their gender, or I just say they are and then make fun of them for it. And as for the Robin Williams and celebrity disappearances, I blame Tupac. Thug Mansion go way too hard for these hoes. Death is a myth. You can create your own heaven. And if you don&#39;t believe in God, then you don&#39;t believe in yourself, cause man is God. </p>
