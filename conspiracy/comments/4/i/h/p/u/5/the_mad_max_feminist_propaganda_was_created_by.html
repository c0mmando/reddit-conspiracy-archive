       "Feminist Propaganda", if you are referring to the "we are not things" theme, possibly, but they're literally owned by the leading antagonist. How else would they have addressed that? One of the secondary characters is a strong, independent, bald woman which may be construed as feminist propaganda but I did not get that impression at all from watching the movie or from her character. Many movies have been branching out and have tried to be more universally appealing by featuring diverse demographics but that's because white males make up an obscene percentage of all character roles in film and television (most recent Oscars debacle, anyone?). If you want to attribute a conspiracy to hollywood I would start there. Or satanism, whichever.

       If that's the case, then George Miller is lying. He's repeatedly said in interviews that he'd never planned to make another Mad Max movie until the idea for this story hit him.

       I've seen it a couple times. It's pretty great. Not as good as "Road Warrior," and it misses Mel Gibson, who was better than Tom Hardy, but it's still terrific.

       Just here to say that that was one of the shittiest movies I've ever seen. 75% of it was them chasing each other on vehicles. So much CGI and constant changes in imagry I thought I was going to have a stroke. There's no conspiracy here as everything from Hollywood is meant to alter our perceptions and manipulate our minds. Keep us busy with nonsense.

       Most of the effects were practical, and the whole premise was a high-throttle two hour chase scene. What exactly were you expecting from a Mad Max movie, the Manchurian Candidate?

       I really dont understand what you expected from the film. The whole point of it from a critical pov was to compare the sparsity of the story to the sparsity of the world that they inhabit. there was very little dialogue and interaction because, if you couldnt tell, there wasnt many people around that werent power hungry warlords or fucking dying beggars. There was so much imagery because it was designed to be almost entirely visual. and it is widely accredited as some of the best action - editing and cinematography. mainly due to how they can make wild erratic action sequences flow smoothly. 
There was very very very little cgi in the movie. Its almost like you haven't read any of the press surrounding the movie. instead you paid for a movie that you wouldnt like and then made a half assed attempt at watching it and decided to blindly criticise it.

       just wow. every half baked conspiracy theorist tends to come back to this point. and just like their ideals this is undercooked too. 
The whole point of media. EVERY form of media. be it films and games right through to ballroom dancing. IS TO FILL UP TIME WITH ENJOYABLE ACTIVITIES. there is no other point. it develops a culture. and culture is 100% dependant on having free time with which to do things. A life without the media trying to entertain us would be. work. sleep .eat work sleep eat. Dont be so fucking moronic. of course they want to show us ideals and get us to rethink that which we think we know and manipulate us to see other points of view, but its not some wide spread 'hollywood' conspiracy. Its got more to do with the fact that filmmakers and directors often want to impart some form of morals or message to the people who view their films. to say that its controlled by some overarching system and also to say that its bad for us is just blind and stupid. You only dislike it because you dont like your ideas being challenged.

       Culture is a facade to have it appear we are not individuals, but are divided. Why would I waste my time with useless movies and television (watched this movie on a plane) when I could read books, paint, go camping, hiking, workout, hang out with family and friends, learn a new trade, volunteer etc. etc. etc. My gawd, what a wasted life we live in if all you do is distract yourself from the time you get home from work till the time you go back in. 
I dislike this movie because it WAS shitty. Fucking as simple as that. You don't know me personally, so you have no idea what my values or morals are.

       Its really not hard to tell what your 'values and morals' are. Even down to the username. 
And its not even worth arguing with you because you wont use evidence or logical arguments as we can see by your comment. there's no evidence or no statements to back up your shit. no references. Just what you think. And then following it up with a nice steaming pile of you don't get the right to judge me because you don't know me, meanwhile you spew your judgements of me and other people that don't have a problem with the normal culture and activities. Next you'll be telling me that western medicine does more harm than good. And how mental health is caused by the government and their control of society.

       that seems to be another comment that has no actual content. It seems i was right. You can call out to the crowd as much as you want. the truth is that you cant think of a good argument against what has been said so now you're trying to pull away.

       only commented on this one thread specifically. and only because it made reference to mad max. And only thought i would comment because ive studied mad max at school. was brought here through some drama about a different post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i assume unbegun is some sort of comment about how i am a slave to the system and haven't 'awakened' yet or something. Otherwise i dont see how it is relevant to say that something has been existing without beginning.

       Again like i said in the second comment or w/e you are incapable of making logical arguments or providing evidence in reply to what i said. As is very obviously shown by the reduction of your comments to ad hominem attacks. Free thinking doesn't mean masquerade your opinions as fact. It means take actual facts and use them to create new ideas rather than the systems we already have in place.

       Why again are you on r/conspiracy? Because you went to film school and are butthurt I don't like Mad Max? You're a poor college student who took a couple classes. Maybe delve deeper than what is being taught on the surface and think for yourself on how these images alter our perceptions. 
Also, here's the CGI before and after shots you claim are void within the movie:

       </a>
       I am beyond bored with your responses. A typical know-it-all who uses semantics so I won't see through all the bullshit. I'm actually happy you don't better yourself with more thought provoking study, or have the capacity to question authority. You my friend will be the one hurting, not me. 
Truly one of the lamest debates I've had on r/conspiracy. Go wait till your mom makes you dinner.

      <p>
       and dont act like i trivialised the debate when you wouldnt reply with anything intelligent for a few hours. 
And who said i dont better myself with thought provoking study? Hmm seems like you assumed that. well done. just another example of your inherent bias colouring your points.

       And I would except i live very far away from my loving mother. Im sure you dont have the same issue. i cant imagine she loves you very much.

      <p>
       anyways im bored of you. you're too stupid to realise how genericly retarded everything you are saying is. Its almost like ive heard it a thousand times from the same type of generic morons who think that they are better than the establishment that allows them to live their lives how they choose. How big of you. laters.

       Sure. Came on here for a solid 5 seconds bc you accidentally clicked on a link you thought you'd deliver some sort of thought provoking substance to. Still no CGI mention. Must hurt to have an extra chromosome.

       jesus you want the cgi mention so much. notice how all the explosions are real. all the crashes are real. all the vehicles are real. The article even says the film uses mainly proactical effects. Sure they didnt find a fucking firestorm in which to drive but they crashed ever single fucking car in that shit. you can see that most of the 'cgi' is just background replacements. Which they do in most films anyway. And yet. no mad max was the most notable. you noticed that shit. apprently. What i think is that you didnt look it up. you assumed that most of the crashes and explosions were cgi and are now grasping at straws to defend that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVEN THE ARTICLE YOU SOURCED SAYS THAT THE CGI WAS RARELY USED AND DISCREET. your own evidence disagrees with you.

       that seems to be another comment that has no actual content. It seems i was right. You can call out to the crowd as much as you want. the truth is that you cant think of a good argument against what has been said so now you're trying to pull away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its almost like i was right that you'd never engage with logical arguments.
