    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Feminist Propaganda&quot;, if you are referring to the &quot;we are not things&quot; theme, possibly, but they&#39;re literally owned by the leading antagonist. How else would they have addressed that? One of the secondary characters is a strong, independent, bald woman which may be construed as feminist propaganda but I did not get that impression at all from watching the movie or from her character. Many movies have been branching out and have tried to be more universally appealing by featuring diverse demographics but that&#39;s because white males make up an obscene percentage of all character roles in film and television (most recent Oscars debacle, anyone?). If you want to attribute a conspiracy to hollywood I would start there. Or satanism, whichever. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it a couple times. It&#39;s pretty great. Not as good as &quot;Road Warrior,&quot; and it misses Mel Gibson, who was better than Tom Hardy, but it&#39;s still terrific. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just here to say that that was one of the shittiest movies I&#39;ve ever seen. 75% of it was them chasing each other on vehicles. So much CGI and constant changes in imagry I thought I was going to have a stroke.

    <div class="md"><p>I really dont understand what you expected from the film. The whole point of it from a critical pov was to compare the sparsity of the story to the sparsity of the world that they inhabit. there was very little dialogue and interaction because, if you couldnt tell, there wasnt many people around that werent power hungry warlords or fucking dying beggars. There was so much imagery because it was designed to be almost entirely visual. and it is widely accredited as some of the best action - editing and cinematography. mainly due to how they can make wild erratic action sequences flow smoothly. 
There was very very very little cgi in the movie. Its almost like you haven&#39;t read any of the press surrounding the movie. instead you paid for a movie that you wouldnt like and then made a half assed attempt at watching it and decided to blindly criticise it. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>just wow. every half baked conspiracy theorist tends to come back to this point. and just like their ideals this is undercooked too. 
The whole point of media. EVERY form of media. be it films and games right through to ballroom dancing. IS TO FILL UP TIME WITH ENJOYABLE ACTIVITIES. there is no other point. it develops a culture. and culture is 100% dependant on having free time with which to do things. A life without the media trying to entertain us would be. work. sleep .eat work sleep eat. Dont be so fucking moronic. of course they want to show us ideals and get us to rethink that which we think we know and manipulate us to see other points of view, but its not some wide spread &#39;hollywood&#39; conspiracy. Its got more to do with the fact that filmmakers and directors often want to impart some form of morals or message to the people who view their films. to say that its controlled by some overarching system and also to say that its bad for us is just blind and stupid. You only dislike it because you dont like your ideas being challenged. </p>

Why would I waste my time with useless movies and television (watched this movie on a plane) when I could read books, paint, go camping, hiking, workout, hang out with family and friends, learn a new trade, volunteer etc. etc. etc. My gawd, what a wasted life we live in if all you do is distract yourself from the time you get home from work till the time you go back in.

And its not even worth arguing with you because you wont use evidence or logical arguments as we can see by your comment. there&#39;s no evidence or no statements to back up your shit. no references. Just what you think. And then following it up with a nice steaming pile of you don&#39;t get the right to judge me because you don&#39;t know me, meanwhile you spew your judgements of me and other people that don&#39;t have a problem with the normal culture and activities. Next you&#39;ll be telling me that western medicine does more harm than good. And how mental health is caused by the government and their control of society.  </p>

<p>And never mind the awards that the film got <a href="/u/Freeyoursoul5">/u/Freeyoursoul5</a> thinks that it was fundamentally shitty. rather than maybe he just didn&#39;t like it.Fact and opinion are very different things my boy maybe one day you&#39;ll realise that. </p>

<p>Again like i said in the second comment or w/e you are incapable of making logical arguments or providing evidence in reply to what i said. As is very obviously shown by the reduction of your comments to ad hominem attacks. Free thinking doesn&#39;t mean masquerade your opinions as fact. It means take actual facts and use them to create new ideas rather than the systems we already have in place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why again are you on r/conspiracy? Because you went to film school and are butthurt I don&#39;t like Mad Max? You&#39;re a poor college student who took a couple classes. Maybe delve deeper than what is being taught on the surface and think for yourself on how these images alter our perceptions. 
Also, here&#39;s the CGI before and after shots you claim are void within the movie: <a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/06/01/mad-max-fury-road-before-and-after-cgi-is-applied/">http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/06/01/mad-max-fury-road-before-and-after-cgi-is-applied/</a>
I am beyond bored with your responses. A typical know-it-all who uses semantics so I won&#39;t see through all the bullshit. I&#39;m actually happy you don&#39;t better yourself with more thought provoking study, or have the capacity to question authority. You my friend will be the one hurting, not me.

    <div class="md"><p>jesus you want the cgi mention so much. notice how all the explosions are real. all the crashes are real. all the vehicles are real. The article even says the film uses mainly proactical effects. Sure they didnt find a fucking firestorm in which to drive but they crashed ever single fucking car in that shit. you can see that most of the &#39;cgi&#39; is just background replacements. Which they do in most films anyway. And yet. no mad max was the most notable. you noticed that shit. apprently. What i think is that you didnt look it up. you assumed that most of the crashes and explosions were cgi and are now grasping at straws to defend that position. </p>

<p>EVEN THE ARTICLE YOU SOURCED SAYS THAT THE CGI WAS RARELY USED AND DISCREET. your own evidence disagrees with you. </p>
