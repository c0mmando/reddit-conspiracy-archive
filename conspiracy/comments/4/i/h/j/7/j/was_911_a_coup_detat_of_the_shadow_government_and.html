       I had long thought that the Coup D’etat happened when JFK was assassinated, however, upon further examination, I now believe that was just the first step to the full and total takeover of the powerful few. This may seem obvious, but let me explain a little bit about the full extent of this takeover.
      </p>
      <p>
       What brought me to this conclusion was a recent podcast on Boiling Frogs Post that you can find
       <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2016/05/04/processing-distortion-with-peter-b-collins-hastert-coverup-cemented-in-place/">
        HERE
       </a>
       . Sibel Edmonds discloses that hundreds of our politicians including Supreme Court Justices have very dirty secrets and all of the intelligence apparatuses know about those indiscretions. (She heavily hints that pedophilia is common among those politicians.) This is a great podcast, so I recommend listening to it in its entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was somewhat dumbfounded that I had never made this connection before that all of the intelligence arms of the government (CIA, NSA, FBI) can now wiretap and videotape anyone at any level of our government and use that information as blackmail - thanks to the Patriot Act.
       <strong>
        This not only includes all of Congress, but Supreme Court Justices and appointed Judges at the Federal level, too. And even if THEY are squeaky clean, what about their spouses, children, relatives or close friends?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, it doesn’t matter one bit who we vote for, even at the local level.
       <strong>
        EVERYONE IS COMPROMISED.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If I’m missing something let me know and I welcome your feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Happy Mother’s Day to all of you CT moms out there. Thanks for keeping your kids awake. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Quick edit - Also, think about what this means for the media as well. They, too, are all compromised.

       If you want to understand in a historical context what's happening, I suggest you start with the OSS and Allen Dulles and the import of nazi ss scientists into every research branch of the military, what would become the nsa, cia and nasa (jpl), in operation paperclip.  Find this info (and related) on the following link of

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend Mae Brussel's book "Fascists in America" and listen to her podcasts.  Her and Michael Parenti I would quote as sources of the following, along with Joan Iserbyt, Peter Levenda, and others who believe the cabal works through freemasonry, secret socieites to which only the ruling class belong, and other related ngos
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically it goes like this: The single worst thing we did to undermine america was Operation Paperclip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OSS imported Nazis into the intelligence and defense research community when they split up the scientists with Russia with half of them going into russia's defence industry, focusing on bioelectronics while we worked on mind control and rocketry.  Our spies led us down a dumb path called 'psychotronics' wherein we wasted lots of tax dollars on the occult, black magick, paranormal research, remote viewing, ghosts, etc.  Yes we did do this.  MKOFTEN is the name of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       From PAPERCLIP we went to project ARTICHOKE wherein our defense research led us to drugging soldiers and trying to do initial hypnosis and brainwashing in the pursuit of Manchurian candidates (creating 'alters', 'monarchs', mind-controlled slaves that will follow orders even against judgment even against their own survival or that of loved ones).  They were trying to create the perfect assassin (and sex slave / spy-- like 'dollhouse').
      </p>
      <p>
       ARTICHOKE morphed into PROJECT MKULTRA, which was a series of weird experiments like drugging prostitutes and having group sex with them for days 'to see if they could be brainwashed', and then dosing soldiers with high amounts of LSD and putting them in front of a screen and showing them images to try to create a new persona, serously screwing them up.  Also creating small fake towns with fake people and doing truman show time trauma on them. They screwed up a lot of people as some of these soldiers did not know what they were doing or why.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even had researchers develop a way to use electronics with direct electrodes to control minds and they were successful, but it's invasive.  This was john c lilly, who died from an addiction to ketamine, which is a superpsychedelic, which he would do too much in a sensory deprivation tank trying to communicate with ecco, the earth coincidence control office--a race of aliens he claimed transmitted to him 'commandments' that humans should follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, MKOFTEN (the occult studies), The mind control programming and drugging and raping and abusing...This is all Nazi science, expressly what they told us they would not do.  They lied to the american people.  And it was more than a lie.  They exhibited a longstanding pattern of betrayal and lying, and sinster injurious and horrific experiments.  What this means is that they felt entitled to do so, that secrecy was the most important thing, not honesty.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This secrecy entitlement, compartmenalization of knowledge and authority is the crux of the problem with intelligence cults.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fast forward to JFK-- they assassinated him.  It has to do with many reasons. One, he wouldn't let them do what they wanted, which was control the planet starting with false flags on cuba (see bay of pigs and project  northwoods in that link above).  It was also rothschild motivated because of some financial change that harmed their banking monopoly that I don't understand fully, something to do with silver bonds or some thing.  I wont bs you.  I don't get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally because he gave a speech at the hotel waldorf astoria to the press asking them to be honest and 'help him' expose the 'machine that has conscripted vast material and human resources' ... that 'operates with assassins by night' instead of 'armies by day'...the 'secrecy is repugnant to a free and open society' speech.  They did not like that.  People quote this as the reason he was killed (by rothschilds-hired knights of malta freemasons in the cia, lbj, hw bush, dulles).  I don't think it is why. I think it's a combination effect.  The fascists believed they could not control him.  Given that he's a catholic (maybe the first catholic president) it would be strange for jesuits to kill one of their own unless they had a really strong reason (money)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's the day america really got taken over,  They've defrauded the public at every election since.  Nixon's chicanery was discoverd at watergate but they covered up the really bad things (it's  a much bigger conspiracy than you can imagine).  This right-wing fascist conspiracy has just gotten bigger with reagan, bush, clinton, bush, obama...they are all on the same team: the bad apples in the CIA, the cryptofascists.  They are running a deep state that makes P2 (propaganda due) look like a fold up guide.

       Oh yeah. A lot of what you mention here I'm already familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like a game of which came first - the chicken or the egg? For example, who imported the Nazi scientists anyway? Who funded the fascist Nazi regime? I think you have to go back further to the oil, bank and railroad barons to get a glimpse of the true power brokers of the world. Let's not forget the Vatican, of course, and former Monarchs/Kingdoms. Then add in the military industrial complex, which came a bit later and you have a bigger picture of who is running the global show. The Council of Foreign Relations is probably the biggest glimpse we have into the actual people.

      <p>
       Still don't have a great handle on the implications of all this, but your idea of a 40 year slow coup is possible. It is also possible that 63 was indeed a coup and 2001 was another from a different group.

       Nice username! I just watched Invasion of the Body Snatchers for the first time this weekend and I'm pretty old to have not seen that film before. Coincidence? I THINK NOT. ;)

       Hopefully this makes it to you.  jay's analysis on "invasion of bodysnatchers" being an allegory for the cyrtocracy is brilliant.

       Thanks for the fact check!  And yes, unbelievable that the building was not evacuated or put on lock down.  Or that anti-air defenses were not used in the primary building of the most high-powered military in the world.  The most telling phone call is from the Secret Service, "make sure that the Center does not have anything above our airspace…the Secret Service is going to start shooting at anything in the air"

       Here is the problem with this line of thinking: Why would they care if it was legal or not? If the problem with not being able to surveil the people in Washington was the legality of the surveillance (and their adherence to the law...), then they would also have to make blackmail/extortion legal as well, otherwise they would still be breaking the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       They give less than zero fucks about anything written on the books for you and me and will do whatever they want/have to to get their way. If it means illegally bugging a politician's hotel room with cameras to catch him banging some campaign volunteer so that some day down the road they can pull his strings and make him dance for them, then so be it. What is the politician gonna do? Complain to the public that his private adultery was made public through illegal means?

       They don't fear us in large numbers in the streets because they know that we can't unify. Of course, they are part of the reason we can't unify, keeping us divided amongst ourselves via race/political affiliation/religion/etc. to the point that there is no possible way for us to band together against them, or any enemy foreign or domestic, for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And besides, I have my stash of weapons and ammo, sure. Lots of us do. But they have large standing armies with tanks and aerial weaponry at their disposal that they could easily dispatch against us by some contrived media campaign against anyone marching against them. They don't fear us these days any more than we fear a revolution of field mice.

       However, I'll end with this: We have countless revolutions to draw from (French mostly) where they fought of their armed oppressors with bricks. I think it boils down to - how destitute and hungry are you? Are you willing to lay down your life? When that time comes, the game changes.

       We live in a society where for 15 dollars you can get a VR headset that you can strap your smart phone to and watch VR porn. Combine that with a fleshlight and you can get as close to fucking your favorite porn star as you ever will be.

       As long as there are things like this and one dollar beefy crunch burritos at Taco Bell, there will be no revolution to even televise.

       But more to the point, the revolutionaries of old did not face opponents that had the ability to wipe out city blocks via robots controlled from a thousand miles away. And if the depopulation agenda is a true one (and I lean towards it being true), then the willingness to lay down our lives is pointless, as they will gladly accept our "sacrifice".

       It makes it easier for them to spy on the general populace if it's legal. Spying on/blackmailing politicians is just as prevalent as it has always been with or without the Patriot Act.
