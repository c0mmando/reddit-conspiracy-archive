       Understand that the money supply is not printed/created by the US, it is borrowed from a private group of people, who happen to be Jews, who print/create the money and own all the central banks including the Federal Reserve Bank and The Bank Of International Settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means they are printing/creating the money for themselves because it all gets paid back to them with interest, and no their wealth level is never published because they have 500 trillion in wealth that they transferred to themselves, by printing paper for you and then buying up everything like land and gold when you paid it back to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to print/create the money, which is the highest power on Earth, and SHOULD NOT be the exclusive power of a small group of individuals, the Constitution clearly says this is NOT Constitutional, the money should be printed/created by Congress so the government can lend it to banks and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security, and this would be without debt because the government would not be borrowing it, but printing/creating itself, as the Constitution mandates.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will always be getting poorer as long as the government borrows rather than creates the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is time to do something about this terrible, Unconstitutional situation which is actually the BIGGEST problem in the US, aside from Geo Engineering which is total other story.

       One thing: outlaw usury. They would never be able to pull a similar trick if charging interest is outlawed. Money can't produce more money unless it's invested, an investment is work (you need to be careful where you put your money and who you are investing in and still things can go south sometimes) as for interest, you can sit in your couch and make money without producing any amount of work, making the debtors feel like slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep the taxes, keep a fixed conversion rate for USD/Gold and bring the power to print money back to a federal institution owned by the public (under Congress authority).

       The interest each dollar bears goes into said fat cats pockets. Congress created money keeps the interest in the hands of WE THE PEOPLE. Yes, we pay for this interest through taxes, but then this interest paid in tax dollars gets spent on roads, bridges, education, etc. WE ALL BENEFIT. Until this happens, we all are in debt. Our children's children are in debt...

       If we never have to pay it back, then it's a legendary scheme. I am honestly thinking that we have the wrong perspective. Maybe they are tricking us to bring us into a new golden age strong.

       Absolutely not. Control is what it is all about. Governments always pay their debts, or they fall. If they fall, meh, they will move to the next hegemon to do the bidding, but still control said fallen. And I guess you don't mind the watered down currency and outrageous prices.

       All commercial banks create money out of nothing every time they make a loan, not just the top Federal Reserve banks. They don't loan depositors' money as most people think.

       Banks are lending at a ratio of up to 10x what they have in deposits. I truly think charging interest should be outlawed.

       Except it is a liberal economic ideal, it is the democratization of capital creation. Versus the opposite which is the privatization of monetary policy, which would be the conservative ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling a privatized monetary system a liberal ideal is a perversion of logic.
