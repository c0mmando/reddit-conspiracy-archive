        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Reddit posting the other day about how the driver saw the light out in the car in front of him and then shielded the car from the police, started me thinking about the true power of Reddit. What else--what bigger causes--could we apply this virtual Reddit teamwork to?</p>

<p>And it made me think about two problems we all have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No one really knows how solid the banking system is. The government says it&#39;s OK, but we keep hearing stories about how it&#39;s not OK. It&#39;s a big mystery that is super important to all of us.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone wants the Fed audited (everyone but the Fed), but our handlers (which we are not supposed to have in our society by the people, btw), will not open up their books to the public--the same public who also happens to have to pay for all the Fed&#39;s screw ups.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hear me out here. What if we were to demand the Fed be audited and the books shown to the people by 6/30/2016. No later date, no Killary/DOJ-like far away fake la-la deadlines. No excuses. We go out and demand full results by 6/30/2016 and see how the government responds.</p>

<p>And if the gov doesn&#39;t open the Fed books, we as the Reddit super borg, we all go in and withdraw $100, or $1,000 from our bank accounts on 7/1/2016 (or as much $ as we are able).</p>

<p>The above actions might accomplish one or more objectives; if they open the Fed&#39;s books, that will be a huge victory for us. And if they don&#39;t open the books, our withdrawals on 7/1/2016 will live stress test the financial stability of the banks, and find out whether the government is lying to us (again) about the stability of the banking system and the Peoples&#39; deposits. So again we win with gained knowledge of the system.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Sorry if this post is in the wrong sub, this is my first posting. Thanks for any advice on better posting, in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe knowledge of the &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve, as well as an understanding of the importance of audits and their results, is a very important part of reclaiming the nation&#39;s economy. Maybe even the most important. As long as the current financial structure exists, there&#39;s literally no escape from debt. Americans don&#39;t realize that they are officially collateral for the debt our government signs off on increasing every day. If this were more widespread knowledge, people may care. But I always encourage people to introduce sheeple to literature regarding the Fed before telling them much else, as it resonates strongly with anybody who understands numbers and may allow for the understanding of how things are manipulated.</p>

<p>The FDIC could never handle this in such a short period of time.  The government and banks would have to collude with each other to cover this up otherwise there&#39;d be a run on the banks.  It would be like <em>It&#39;s a Wonderful Life</em>, but on steroids as it&#39;d be nation-wide.  They would never let this occur.</p>

<p>How would they prevent word from spreading?  False flag?  Anything to temporarily shut down and close the banks for a few days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I think it could work. The banks are so under capitalized that even a million of us saying we are going to withdraw money would have them jumping through hoops to prevent it, and possibly even opening up the books on the Fed. It&#39;s a win-win--we win either way. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not too well versed in Reddit though... need someone to push this thing out there and get it going. </p>

<p>Is a million people withdrawing $100 - $1,000 going to be that straining on the banks? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are right. The banks only have a tiny, tiny portion of the money on reserve for their deposits. The rest of our deposits they have out there in the investment world, on mostly horrible investments that are going south. So even only a million people taking out money all on the same day would bring them to their knees. Ultimately I would hope that they would not opt for us pulling out the money, and would concede opening the books on the Fed, so we can slay that monster first. </p>

<p>Once the Fed is slayed and it can no longer suck the people of the world dry, then we work on repairing the banking system slowly but steadily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are lying to us because without that lie the big illusion wouldn&#39;t work and all would crash. I&#39;m surprised there are still people here which don&#39;t get that.</p>

<p>What do you think would happen otherwise? Unexpected Riches? Happy Hour?</p>

<p>What is happening for years, if not decades, is delaying the inevitable. That&#39;s the nature of a chain letter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think of the numbers similarly to the numbers in the US revolution against Britain. They say only around 3% of the people joined up, risked their lives, and fought off the British and kicked them out of the US, gaining our country and our freedom. The other 97% were ultra pussies. I think that ratio still exists today, so we have the numbers. In fact, I think the anonymity of the internet might even gain us another 30%, as some of those pussies are braver over the net. So now we have at least 33% instead of just the 3% our forefathers won our freedom with. </p>
