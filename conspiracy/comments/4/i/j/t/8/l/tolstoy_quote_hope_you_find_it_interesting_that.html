        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“That this social order with its pauperism, famines, prisons, gallows, armies, and wars is necessary to society; that still greater disaster would ensue if this organization were destroyed; all this is said only by those who profit by this organization, while those who suffer from it – and they are ten times as numerous – think and say quite the contrary.”. I found it in a book called &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven Is Within You&quot; while doing some personal research on pacifism.</p>

<p>Edit: on second thoughts, there&#39;s a good chance people are down voting before they click here. Thanks to anyone that made it this far.</p>

I sit here reading this thinking of a veteran friend that has been missing since Friday, and is not reachable .  before he shut his phone down I got a very coherent almost esoteric message. God help the fuckers that forment wars...may the spirits of the wounded and fallen haunt them forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have alluded to it here some where...methinks there is some level of secret society hocuspocus at certain levels of military training...and at some point when they have been through enough trauma together and survived those thatmake it use the tools they are trained to to cope. When team members start dying quickly it is a new offence to the soul that reopens old wounds. When traumas do not get processed they haunt. 22@day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The age of robotics in nearly upon us... people don&#39;t seem to realize the BS that has been spoon-fed for generations.  The current society cannot survive into the next, but it seems the world elites know this and are making moves to equalize the global population before human labor is obsolete, NAFTA, TPP, etc.  We, the non-elites of the world, seem to be stuck in the old-school mentality of just avoiding those we disagree with so we can be around those who agree with each other,which makes it is apparent that the people are not capable of intelligent conversation and adjustments to their lifestyles for the greater good of all mankind.  Having a job, owning a home, owning a business; these things historically are signs of a good successful person, yet we constantly allow business to rip of customers for profit, owning a house makes  us slaves to the house, and having a &quot;job&quot; makes your life suck so much that you look upon the jobless as losers and degenerates.  There are plenty of seriously unethical &quot;jobs&quot;, there are plenty of honestly good folks being taken advantage of for profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tolstoy was a religious fanatic. Prisons are necessary. Armies are necessary. The alternative is chaos and destruction of society. Prisons protect the integrity of a society from within; armies protect its integrity from without. To believe there will ever come a time when there are no criminals, and no foreign powers who seek to steal all we possess, is infantile. As long as crime exists, we need policemen; as long as foreign nations seek to enslave us and destroy us, we need armies. Human nature is not changing very rapidly.</p>
