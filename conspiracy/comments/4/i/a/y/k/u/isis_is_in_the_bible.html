       You should read the bible verses before you read the explanation. Everything on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it if the dragon is America, and the Beast is Isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dragon gives the beast its power.
      </p>
      <p>
       America gave isis its power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world followed the beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people will for seemingly no reason, blindly support muslims, while hating christians. 
They support refugees coming over, the refugees who got into europe, then somehow bombs start going off there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't go too much into politics, but it's just common sense that isis IS going to take advantage of the refugee situation to get into countries to cause terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The beast was given a mouth to blasphemise God."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Isis in the media, and some people going to join Isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first beast was woudned by the sword, but lived. So isis may be defeated, but the second beast will help.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth."
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this is Mexico? People are caught up with "human rights" for muslims, so they want to let refugees in, who may be isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now trump is talking about a wall against mexico, and so many people believe mexicans should be able to be in america illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       "it deceived the inhabitants of the earth."

       Speaking of Mexico, a child of Spain, It took 770 years to kick the Moors (muslim) out. Over that time there was a lot of influence and interbreeding. So you might say Mexico has more in common with that world than one would expect. Fanning the flames of racial hate can make strange bedfellows. So, the theory expounded above has some merit.

       You have the only post that was given any thought... I should have said this was from a nostradomus book, that way people that disagree would have to find another reason to not believe in other than "it's in the bible".

       Appreciate it and considering the Bible-Spasms herein on display, it doesn't give one much faith that there will be a countervailing strong religious base if and when a blindly faithful muslim opposition rises up in this country. That is, we will be disarmed, stupid, victims. Isn't this the Pike vision coming true?

       Sorry, but I don't buy it for a second. You're basically replacing words, adding your own meaning to the scripture, and attempting to find parallels between your lousy interpretation and the contemporary world we live in.

       Allot of it matches up. How are you so blind to that?
      </p>
      <p>
       America supports isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dragon supports the beast
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people are in love with muslims
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world will follow the beast
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis has the media to say all their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beast was given a moth to blasphemise God.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second beast decieved the inhabitants of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something got many people brainwashed into thinking mexicans should be allowed here illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I don't mention the countries, and just say what each of them do?
      </p>
      <p>
       One country supports another country that goes against christianity.
The country supported is defeated.
The country supported has lots of support from the whole world.
The supporting country deceives. (A dragon in the bible usually refers to satan, who is the biggest trickster)
      </p>
      <p>
       It does match up, you can't apply this to just anything.  Don't go and just dismiss something without giving it thought.

       Then you should only use words that you know what they mean.

       there is nothing schizophrenic about putting 2 and 2 together.
      </p>

       Anyways, since you can analyze my argument, can't you make sense of it, and tell me why there is absolutely no way that this bible story and what is happening today match up? It's pretty specific about how everything happens, it's unlikely these 2 match up just by chance.

       Your eyes have yet to fully open. God might be "make-believe nonsense" but religion is very real and very powerful. Dismiss all the gods you like but you cannot understand the world without understanding religion,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       when it comes to conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible is the orthodox version of real events spun to support a political position. We call someone that challenges it a heretic. The 9/11 Commission Report is the orthodox version of real events spun to support a political position. We call someone that challenges it a Conspiracy Theorist. The Bible is a political document and dismissing it as religious nonsense is to misunderstand a great many things that are fundamentally relevant to you, me, and everybody in this sub.

       I think the point they're quite right in making, is that the bible (and all of the Abrahamic religious texts), is utter horseshite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interpretation you have presented is a form of mental gymnastics of almost Olympic standard. You're taking the translation of a translation of a translation of an edited translation of third or forth generation mistranslation and trying to force contemporary subjects to fit ancient allegorical passages. It's utter horseshit.

       The translation is pretty close to the original for one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it DOES match up. What's the chance that so many of the things in this, matches up with what's happening today?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you could say it's supposed to be literal, or it's talking about something else, but what?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you just compare it to countries, then it would be this:
      </p>
      <p>
       One country supports another country to go against christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The country supported is defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The country supported has lots of support from the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The supporting country deceives. (A dragon in the bible usually refers to satan, who is the biggest trickster)
      </p>
      <p>
       So it matches up. Why have such hate for christianity? If this text was found in Nostradamus's book, then the hate wouldn't be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's just the popular thing to do... must be peer pressure

       You probably won't apply it to anything because you can't. This is quite specific. It's obvious you just have a bias against anything biblical.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have a bias, your opinion isn't valid.

      <p>
       I know it's likely that you are thinking "oh, just cause i disagree my opinion isnt valid?"

       No, your opinion isn't valid because you have a bias against anything biblical. You admitted it yourself.

       "the bible (and all of the Abrahamic religious texts), is utter horseshite."
