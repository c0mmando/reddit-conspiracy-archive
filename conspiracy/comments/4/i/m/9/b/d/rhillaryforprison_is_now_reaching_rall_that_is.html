       <p>
        I want to point out,
        <em>
         for the record
        </em>
        , that Hillary is not the only employer of shills, although her PR teams appear to be the most out-of-touch. I applaud your efforts to spread this information, but I think it could go a bit further.
       </p>
       <p>
        The governments of the US, Britain, Canada, Israel, Russia, Turkey, China and others hire propagandists to control the conversations online. Microsoft, Dish, Lord and Taylor, and many other businesses hire shills as well, and this is just what we know for a fact. Many of the reviews you read are fake. You basically see commercials on sites like Reddit disguised as normal user content. The internet is clearly manipulated by many parties and this has been going on for years. For more information, see
        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/3uoxpl/internet_shills_101/">

      <p>
       Unsurprisingly, the mods then muted me from their modmail because they know there is no justification. They are holding on very tight to the narrative that only Hillary hires shills. They are censor-happy propagandists and nothing more. People like this are the reason why so many people know about "Putin bots," yet have never heard any of the information at

         All the major sub Reddit's are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information, if you post articles that reveal crimes or lay out criticism about: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Inequality and Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media or well connected individuals. Mrs. Clinton included.

         Reddit has been censoring independent and alternative media sources for years, they are censored because they are compromising the narrative of the Corporate Owned Mass Media, they punch a hole in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, polarization and lies. The recipe for destroying the corporate propaganda is straight forward:
         <em>
          Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity.
         </em>
         Reddit is owned by
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">
          Advanced Publication Inc
         </a>
         a de facto Corporate Owned Mass Media outlet. No need to pretend otherwise.

         </strong>
         Reddit is a black box, if they don't want you to see what is going on, you won't see it. We can't see what is done by various "users", what is done by Moderators or what is done by the Administrators and we can't tell them apart. We can however observe it with our own eyes. We can take notes. Strong patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about it or criticize "them", that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch 22! No need to pretend otherwise.

         </strong>
         There is a lot of racist postings on the front page of r/conspiracy, thinly disguised as "conspiracy anti-Israel posts". They constantly make up 10-20% of the front page volume. Then there is a lot of wedge issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. Then you have all the irrelevant trivia, sports and celebrity worship, designed to distract and entertain. What you have left is maybe 5% of relevant content. This is how "they" are dumbing down the conspiracy forum and Reddit in general, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots, scratching each other behind the ears. It it by deliberate design, not accident! No need to pretend otherwise.

       This is my "little conspiracy" about Reddit, the conspiracy forum, and the corporate owned mass media in general. I hope I am still entitled to my own opinion, if not, I don't really give a flying f@@k, I won't be silenced nor intimidated by these clowns! Mrs. Clinton has an army of paid shills and pundits polluting Reddit with their lies. She also bought the loyalty of most of the corporate owned mass media. She has clearly demonstrated, with impunity, that she is above then law, when she destroyed the evidence (mails) and started lying about it after - but "they" won't allow you to talk about it...

       Mods here have recently been contacted by a would-be whistle-blower who claims as much, asking us for advice about how to best go about leaking evidence. He's apparently working with a popular YouTube channel to make the evidence doxx-free and presentable. Hopefully it will be available soon.

       Here's a quote from the aspiring whistle-blower:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The complaint against us from Hillary Clinton backing groups when control of the "project" (
         <a href="/r/the_donald">
          /r/the_donald
         </a>
         ) was lost.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I asked about that. Here's the relevant part of his reply (emphasis mine):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Simple Timeline, at least as far as I understand it:
       </p>
       <p>
        February 16th, first jobs listed. and approved the next day, even though the listers were unknown, they all paid the site in advanced, which is very rare especially for so many small projects that were all part of a bigger.
       </p>
       <p>
        They were all accepted within a few hours. They got the instructions and details a few hours after accepting. Groups were formed, leads set to lead, and project(s) started.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The next 2 weeks were a mess, from what I observed, one of the listers was part of some center super pac thing that was helping Hillary. While the directions gave away the backing (distract from and marginalize Bernie Sanders while not mentioning Hillary; decrease reddit traffic by propping up unfavorable candidates) the growth and effect on Trump was "Not what they were paying for." He threw a fit about control over content.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I replied:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From this bit it seems like you're saying that
        <a href="/r/the_donald">
         /r/the_donald
        </a>
        was either designed as or co-opted for essentially a black propaganda effort in support of the Clinton campaign, and it backfired (after /pol/ flooded into it). Am I reading that right?
