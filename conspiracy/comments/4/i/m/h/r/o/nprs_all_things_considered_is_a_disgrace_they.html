       So today, right after the 4 o clock hour, they glossed over a story about Bernie Sanders and very quickly said he's a lost cause, and that it will be Hillary vs. Trump.  Then they went immediately into a long piece about the very pressing issue of trans-gendered restrooms, complete with several interviews.  Not that we are saber-rattling war with Russia.  Not that we've put troops into Yemen.  Not any of dozens of other issues that are of much more importance to literally everyone.

       NPR is garbage.  I wonder why.

       NPR is lost.  I don't think it will ever pull its head out of its ass.  I work nights and listen to morning editon a lot, and I can't believe how bad it is most days.
      </p>

       I think the bathroom issue is only an issue to distract from real problems.  Its designed to be pointless, and to have dumb people get deeply offended and arguing.  Its like the wheel debate in the Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy book where a group of crashed aliens try to reinvent the wheel but are hopelessly deadlocked over what color it should be.

       Because after the last budget cut, (1990s) PBS, NPR, PRI, all those public service organizations, now receive only about 25% of their funding in tax money,
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority of their funding is now from corporations and foundations, mostly conservative leaning foundations.

       NPR in particular features a lot of experts from AEI and Cato, the

       NPR is pretty lame,but any news source on the level its at with the funding sources it has is going to be watered down.I'm mean look at HUFFPO,pure garbage,but thats what America considers being Left is,and i guess compared to the right it is.We need mainstream independent news as much we need a mainstream independent party.

       Well look at it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       NPR is funded by the public, the public doesn't donate a much because the government steals their money unless they are super rich. So the government then pays NPR to say what the gov wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone always knew Bernie was a lost cause 3rd alternative, Trump is the guy people love to hate, and people kinda just want to see a woman president before WWIII kicks off and humanity pretty much self destructs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       Global war is just the norm now and even it can't sell anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to distract us from all that, NPR focuses on worrying about who comes into the potty in the stall next to us. It's a divisive issue that stupid people — who think they get to decide how others live — will never tire of arguing over.

       Thanks for the link.  I'm pretty sure it shows that NPR
       <em>
        still hasn't
       </em>
       reported on US troops now on the ground in Yemen, and that goes for ALL of NPR, when I had only mentioned All Things Considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I do expect them to report on things like another country that we are meddling with over who goes tinkle in what bathroom, and at least giving more importance to the silly potential war thingy.

      <p>
       No, but I would have expected them to have reported on it since
       <strong>
        March 29th
       </strong>
       , which according to your link, they haven't.  No mention of boots on the ground in a new war zone.

       No, I did not imply that.  But
       <em>
        to lead
       </em>
       with such a long puff piece (pun not intended) with multiple interviews, is unforgivable.  We may soon be at war with Russia, and I really don't fucking care where trans people choose to go potty.  It's a silly social issue to clog up the airwaves and the minds of americans while real issues are ignored.  It's also a wedge issue, purposely foisted on the public in order to divide people.

      <p>
       No.  My concern is that Sanders is not being treated fairly, in what we are told are fair elections here in america.  It's a valid concern, especially with how the DNC has behaved. They have very clearly shown favoritism toward Clinton since the beginning, so that was no surprise today.

       Apparently, NPR didn't report on potential war with Yemen on the same day, it's been 3 days now and they
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       haven't, so why should this silly social issue be reported on so promptly?

      <p>
       No, we americans (sic) must get our real public news from Aljazeera.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a question for you: aren't you just a little uptight that our news sources here in america are propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       I stand by what I said.  NPR is crap, and they should be ashamed to call themselves a news organization.
