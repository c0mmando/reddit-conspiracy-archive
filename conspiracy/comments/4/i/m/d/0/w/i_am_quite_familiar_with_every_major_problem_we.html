       Well, when we all go and create homesteads, well, we still have to pay illegal income taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we all get vans, we still need to occupy federally owned public lands or pay service rights to private owned, tax paying, federally sponsored parks.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we buy TinyHouses, we still need to find land to live on, and see my first reference regarding homesteading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing as homesteading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing as all the above combined.  We don't 'own' a fucking thing when we permaculture, all we do is protect our lonesome selves.  We don't break the chain.

       The point is to start moving away from globalism and consumerism by living self sustainable lives (taxes are inevitable - State/Federal (however we can reform them)). Grow your own food, hunt/fish, stop using banks (use local credit unions), stop buying crap from corporations, start local, join co-ops, educate people on the local level and snowball the movement, to higher levels in the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solutions need to start local and then can be moved up the chain on the federal level. This isn't over night solutions, but generational solutions that will happen over time. May not happen in your lifetime, but possibly in your kids or grand kids life time.
      </p>
      <p>
       May not be the glorious answer you were looking for, but it's honestly the only way of changing the system that we have for generations. Voting for a president wont do shit for changing things nor would a radical revolution. The politicians we have are our fault as a corrupt narcissistic society. For those politicians come from our society. What do you expect that kind of society to produce?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents. Hope I've helped somewhat...

       Here's an idea for you and I tried and failed at it because of several things, among them I suck at social media because I'm an antisocial now and that people I asked for help have no interest in it whatsoever because they are lying to america:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's
       <strong>
        <em>
         crowdsourced lobbying
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       People create, manage, advertise and collect money for individual legislation campaigns.  One example would be like Sanders' legalize marijuana bill.  Imagine you had a 'legalize mushrooms bill'.  You'd create an 'issue', the issue is a panel that brings people who have joined the issue together with documents under revision control (like wikipedia) related to the issue.  A user (who can verified him/herself as a lawyer) on the site will draft a bill, upload it to the issue and the users will start adding money either by bank account, by credit card, or by bitcoin.  They can have a wallet on the site that lets them 'load it up' and they pay out of that wallet, so they can control a strict amount spent on politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's that money do?  Ok so the users will decide on PACs, SuperPACs, Charities, and other NGO orgs that they want to add to the 'issue' as a 'recipient'.  In a 'fuzzed' / averaged group way, people can decide by amount or by percentage how much they believe each of their donations should go to these charities.   In this way, it's kind of like a group-managed mutual fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the other people involved in the "issue" are the tricky group, the "politicians".  These politicians will have to be 'lobbied' in the real world to join the web app.   Once you have them, they can be added to the issue, and here is the killer app:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if the politician promotes the bill and passes it, then those above mentioned PACs and orgs set as recipients will receive those monies.  This behavior is the legally acceptable flow of money in the
        <em>
         quid pro quo
        </em>
        ruling of political funds and it mimicks the real world.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       None of those pacs can have any politician running them, so you'd have to vet them also, having them sign your TOS that limits your liability.  Trust me, they'll sign when they realize how much money can potentially fly through this type of site.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is getting the very first 1 or 2 politicians on the site.  Once they have their first 2M dollar donation through our site, they will induce a wave of politicians having their underlings claim their official accounts through a security process we make.  (we autocreate their accounts for them, and then give them the initial sign on to start their claim process---this way no 'general public can try to 'create political accounts')
      </p>
      <p>
       It uses
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        real money
       </li>
       <li>
        'pledges' (ghost dollars)
       </li>
       <li>
        'interest' / 'confidence' credits (no value outside of the system)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Pledges are either transactional (if the issue 'wins' then you must donate what you said or else you lose karma / get a bad honesty rating).  The issue can be set up to 'rollback' the money minus holding fees / fees to return their money like credit card chargeback fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way, it's fairly safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You draw a graph of 'real money' donated in red, 'ghost money' in dark gray below it (or in it), and then 'interest' so you have 3 axes of gauging the real commitment to the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       You unleash it and people go fucking nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will hate the idea, saying, "NO, money out of politics!!"  (I agree partly with this sentiment...I came up with this idea to destroy money in politics actually).
      </p>
      <p>
       Others will think it gives them back their power, which it does.  The ultimate success of the site would be legislation that kills the site itself, along with all traditional lobbying, forever.
      </p>

       What you want is a revelation, an abrupt change, but these go away as quick as they appear, and are usually entirely orchestrated. The Arab spring is an example of revelation, nobody won but the instigators.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need is a revolution, a slow ideological change that takes decades and lasts centuries, the last one was circa 1800, it was the financial revolution, advertised then and to this day as democracy, it didn't happen overnight, took decades of plotting and slowly changing the dominant ideology (via masons, via les Lumières, economical disruptions, wars, etc...)
      </p>
      <p>
       That slow ideological change is happening, and the good news is that the internet does it, it's almost metaphysical. You can agitate yourself if you want, it's not useless (however it does get increasingly dangerous as we reach the end of this paradigm), but the quicker you fit into our next collective ideological mold not only the better off you will be, but the more useful to the revolution you will be too, as you will be leading by example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the next thing is going to be i have no idea really, your guess is as good as mine, but I can still pick a model for ourselves and try to live by it, in the process somewhat reinforcing it against other models (and also reinforcing other models more or less close to mine in the process). I have picked a rural but tech, bitcoin based economy (or anything not privately printed, and not printed out of thin air), sustainable, decentralized, slowed down society, political less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be wrong on a few things, but whatever the next model is and however it comes about, it better focus on the planet and it better be global, otherwise it's a losing model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if this doesn't get through you and you still feel like becoming a physical and to the point agitator, I can understand that, use drones, you'll last longer, much longer.

       Get to know yourself and your family. Call your loved ones regularly and say hi for no reason. Hold the door for people, whether or not they say thank you. It's a nice thing to do. Try to find the bright side of things and see the glass as half full, in an other wise half empty world. Acknowledge that these evils exist in the world and try to do your part to limit them on you and your family. If you want to see a change in the world, start with yourself.

       I feel the trick is finding the simplest ways to share these conspiracy realities with as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But without people being able to understand that conspiracy's are simply real crimes that organizations constantly get away with and are continuously proven, there is not much of anywhere to go but retreat and take care of the largest circle of partners you can.

       It's going to be a slow and steady movement, but it is happening.

       Sadly the best strategy I can see is help the system grab more, faster and therefore force the collapse and make the reality more real for all those trying to hide from the uncomfortable truth of the reality we all live in.

       Andrew J Galambos created a system in the 1960's by which a small number of educated and dedicated individuals could create a new social system based on real, definable Freedom. Thousands have heard his lectures or later, attended classes to hear the recordings. Galambos was a physicist and based his program on actions and ideas compatible with science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, some of those taped lectures are now available at Youtube but be warned, these lectures are long and people wanting quick-fix solutions will surely die of boredom. Not for the anxious or the impatient. I took these classes long ago, and to this day, nothing since has had half the impact as the Galambos lectures. If you wish to hear any of the lectures, search at Youtube for this: "Snelson Lectures" and click any one of them. If you like what you hear, search them in order (Snelson Lecture Session 1a" oughta do it.

       This information from a book The Nazis World War II by Robert Edwin Herzstein
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hitler said even in his death he will start World War 3. one of his soldiers asked how? Hitler replied, “The day mankind finds out what I was trying to defend this nation, Germany, from then that’s the day World War 3 will start. For on that day, mankind will learn that I was trying to save my nation from The Free Masons, the Illuminati, the Jews. For if the Americans wins the war, they will conquer the world and forever be a slave to the Jews and they will try to conquer God. Do you know who America has in it’s possessions? “NO,” the solider replied.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Americans have the jewels of God. The Americans have stolen God’s precious jewels. “What do you mean his precocious jewels?” THE SOLDIER asked. Hitler said, “America has stolen the Jews. The Jews of God. His jewelry. The Negroes. They are the true Hebrews. What a foolish move and a direct challenge to God. And they plan on moving these false white Jews into a state of Israel. America is desperate in it’s attempt to win this war using atom bombs on Japan. America will destory the whole world in it’s attempt to conquer it.
       </p>
       <p>
        When America and its Jewish Slave masters conquer the world and the world realize I was right, then all the nations will begin a third world war to dethrone America of it’s rule. Every nation will soon posses atom bombs of their own. It will be the end of the world as we know it.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Why will the Jews control America? The solider asked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hitler said, “because  the white Jews knows that the Negroes are the real children of Israel and to keep Americas secret the Jews will blackmail America. The will extort America, their plan for world domination won’t work if the Negroes know who they were. The white citizens of America will be terrified to know that all this time they’ve been mistreating and discriminating and lynching the children of Israel. They will fear God will destroy them as he destroyed Egypt for doing the same thing. So the Elite, the Illuminati keeps this a secret at all cost. After I die I will one day cause World War 3 just by this message which will be like planting a seed in a people minds until it sprouts once they nurture that seed and seek more truth and learn Hitler was right. I did the world a favor by killing the false Jews before they designated a false state of Israel. But I fear I have failed. The world will fall into the hands of Satan.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's the only logical answer I can think of that doesn't involve war and bloodshed, the truth shall set us free.
