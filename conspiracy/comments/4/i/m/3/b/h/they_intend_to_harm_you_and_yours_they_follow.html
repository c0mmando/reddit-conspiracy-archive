       They are a very small group of individuals who happen to be Jews loyal to Israel, and they privately own the Federal Reserve Bank, because they conned Woodrow Wilson into signing the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which gave them a complete and exclusive monopoly on the printing/creation/lending of all money in existence to create the money supply, and then they expanded worldwide and now own the Bank Of International Settlements and The International Monetary Fund, and they will use the US military to attack any country the tries to print/create its own money and not borrow it from them, as was seen with Germany(WW2), and now Iraq, and Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       They intend to do you harm you, but in secret, so you are getting hurt badly but you don’t know from where, because they are using Geo Engineering which causes cancer big time, GMO food, and vaccines which also cause infertility and cancer, to make you sicker and weaker, lookup “Zbigniew Brzezinski”, who is the International Oligarch’s death architect and said “It Is Infinitely Easier to Kill a Million People than it is to Control Them!”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the International Oligarchs have increased Geo Engineering birth rates have gone down and death rates, especially from cancer have gone up, and they use their fake-worth money, that they printed up and lent into the money supply to create the entire money supply, to make you much poorer, while they transfer all the things of real wealth to themselves like gold, and land, then they will allow the fake-worth paper money they printed up to crash to the value of toilet paper, and they will then own everything, and you will own nothing, and this will give them total control over you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Power to Print/Create the Money MUST be taken back to Congress, so the government can lend the money to banks and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security, and this would be debt free because the money would not be borrowed from these International Oligarchs who currently privately own the exclusive monopoly on printing/creating the money supply as debt to themselves, and then lend it to all governments worldwide by forcing them to borrow it with the US military. The money should be backed by the Power of Work of the People meaning that since it is legal tender used for the payment of work, it automatically has worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money supply should NOT be gold backed because the International Oligarchs also own all the gold and if the money supply were backed by gold they would dictate the exchange rate of the paper money to gold, again allowing them to transfer all the wealth to themselves and make people poor, since they can raise or lower the amount of gold they are willing to pay for the paper money, and again this would make the entire money supply theirs.

       Money should be backed by a tangible asset though and gold is as stable as it gets. If tars sell under 1750 Oz that's their problem.

       bitcoin, peer to peer currency, on an open ledger that anyone can verify at any time, with very clear-cut rules determining the inflation (future deflation), etc. The more people who use it, the stronger it becomes, and each day it survives the closer we are to getting out of indentured servitude to the money printers.

       Those currencies would have to be build up from the ashes of a fallen system as they are not immune, nor sandboxed from the rest of society and fall victim to the same systems that corrupted our current one. It began to show when the first Silk Road became a possibly major contester to the security apparatuses dealing drugs world wide. And the Silk Road had a higher quality and better community. When the FBI caught the fall guy DPR they took over the site and others. Do you think the perpetrators of our current situation would NOT invest in BTC and others? They probably own the wallets and marketplaces. There's an underground war fought for the control over the internet. And even though i2p, onion routing and cryptocurrencies are a great harm to the status quo, it has been looked over with prying eyes since the very beginning.

       It's also a good idea to check out the Cicada 3301 - as there are probably several of those, most impossible to know of for the layman. Bitcoin has been bought as an investment by the Chinese gov and interest groups.

       Bitcoin is corrupted by now and the next cryptocurrency (if there should be one) is IMHO going to be released by a government affiliated group from the US and Israel, Indonesia or some place that could eventually be used as the fall guy for possible future investigations until it has become to big to fall. Of course that would never be publicly admitted.

       Be on the watch for controlled currencies, especially if they are cryptocurrencies.
