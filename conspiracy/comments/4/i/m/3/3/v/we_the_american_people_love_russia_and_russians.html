        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Right now the International Oligarchs/Central Bankers are trying to start a war with Russia any way they possibly can, because Russia is the ONLY country that is not controlled by them, and actually threw them off when they dumped Communism, and are currently trying to nationalize the Rothschild owned central bank in Russia, therefore, of course the International Oligarchs/Central Bankers will try to attack Russia militarily, they are setting up the war with Russia right now, so donâ€™t believe their lies.</p>

<p>Everyone already knows that the International Oligarchs/Central Bankers have the exclusive monopoly on printing/creating the worldwide money supply because they privately own all the central banks worldwide including the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank Of International Settlements, and the militarily attack any country that tries to print/create its own money.</p>

<p>The Power To Print/Create The Money is the Highest Power On Earth, and MUST be taken back to Congress so that the government can lend to banks, and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security.</p>

<p>All the International Oligarchs Banks Worldwide:

<p>Russia is part of the system. Now, they might not in the &quot;elite club&quot; sitting alongside the Five-Eyes or the likes of the Bohemian Grove, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;d prefer to bring down the system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just a different club. Russia owns most of the &quot;old world,&quot; US owns most of the &quot;new world.&quot; Russia simply has a competing set of bankers that want to be in where the US bankers are.</p>

<p>The best part is, China is playing the US and Russia, and they can&#39;t do a thing about it. China produced the Art Of War, they know what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;ve been playing the game longer than anyone, they&#39;re just playing for the end game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more. There really is this old vs new, or traditional vs progressive, nationalist vs globalist. mindset competing on a world stage.</p>

<p>And China is playing everyone ....</p>
