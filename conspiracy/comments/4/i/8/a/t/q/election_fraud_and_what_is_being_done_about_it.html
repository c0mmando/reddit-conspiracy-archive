<p>hippie bullshit.  changing myself isn&#39;t removing corrupt politicians and the corporations that buy them from my country.  getting society to take real action against them will.  however, people would rather talk and vent and talk some more than stand and do something.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hippie bullshit.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t removed any corrupt politicians, you haven&#39;t taken any real action. You would rather talk and vent and talk some more than stand and do something.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the &quot;change yourself&quot; part.</p>

<p>The &quot;change the world&quot; part comes when people <em>see</em> you doing that stuff, then they feel they can do it as well. </p>

<p>If you really want to do something positive, help someone you know personally in some way that you actually can.</p>

<li>student protests at uc berk</li>
<li>the protest of the world bank</li>
<li>2002-2003 anti war protests 8-30 MILLION protesters</li>
<li>Occupy Wall st. and occupy movements all over</li>
<li>Tea Party, Oathkeepers, ad-hoc RWA militias</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing works, no protesting changes anything.  You might get peppersprayed, tased (and die), beaten up, trampled, or go to jail.  No one wants to risk that.  It&#39;s getting increasingly dangerous to protest, especially if you are a minority.</p>

<p>But some people do.  Because it makes people feel empowered, so if that&#39;s what they need, they should do it.  it&#39;s about feeling like you&#39;ve tried, because all revolutions are built on the back of failed ones.</p>

<p>And honestly both of you aren&#39;t giving yourselves enough credit: you&#39;re spreading awareness with this debate, which means informing others of both the problems and the mechanisms of control that dismempower us.  Knowledge of both of these social forces are important things for us to know, otherwise we&#39;re not even on the court...we&#39;re stuck in the bleachers, blindfolded.</p>
