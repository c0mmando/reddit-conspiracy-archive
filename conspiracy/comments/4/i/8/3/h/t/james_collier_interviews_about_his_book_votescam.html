<p>When it was discovered that thousands of lever voting machine logs were forged, they were replaced with unopenable ones, inhibiting certified pollsters from opening the machines to verify they were working properly.  These new machines had one that jammed before it could make the &#39;carbon copy impression&#39; of votes, yet the impressions were already made, causing thousands of pollers to walk out in protest, only to be replaced by totally trustable police and firefighters.  The lever machines were replaced by electronic machines that submitted their tally to a central office where contracting companies were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to &#39;program&#39; them to determine winners.  </p>

<p>So, to recap: technology &#39;failed&#39; because of human treachery only to be replaced with more &#39;centralized&#39; technology that made it easier for the treacherous to flip votes.  In essence, your vote doesn&#39;t count and hasn&#39;t for decades.  This explains quite a lot.</p>

<p>Collier discusses how exit polls never happen at the conclusion; they are mythical and used just to &#39;ensure&#39; people through the media of their voting activity, and it gives them another data point to think about, even though the whole voting activity is bread and circuses.</p>

<p>There is no need for a popular vote, it&#39;s stolen, and the electoral college is already tightly controlled by two private companies the dnc and rnc which are bought for by powerful interests and blah blah blah you know the rest already--I&#39;m preaching to the choir on this point.</p>

<p>Anyway, give the interview a listen, you will be appalled.  Or maybe you won&#39;t be.  Maybe you&#39;ve always known.</p>
