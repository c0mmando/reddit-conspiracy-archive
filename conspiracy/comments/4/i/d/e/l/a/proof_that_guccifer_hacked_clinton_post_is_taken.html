        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here was the contents of my post:</p>

<hr/>

<p>So I created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ia4gi/here_is_some_strong_evidence_that_guccifer_did_in/">this</a> post earlier today. After spending a few hours emailing and researching, it&#39;s clear that the <a href="http://gawker.com/new-hacked-presidential-art-may-be-bill-clintons-white-1476802573">Bill Clinton doodles Guccifer leaked in 2013</a> could never have <em>originated</em> from the Clinton Library as it didn&#39;t even exist to store them when the files were created. Guccifer retrieved these from a folder called &quot;wjcdrawings&quot; almost certainly from the Clinton Foundation. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/archive/Clintonian-Doodles-Need-Public-Airing.html">Per NBC</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the Clinton Foundation -- the only people the authors could consult at the time of publication because the Clinton Presidential Library wasn&#39;t open yet.</p>

<p>Even more mysterious, our request to the William Clinton Foundation for doodles (we appealed directly to the foundation because the Clinton Presidential Library did not open to the public until 2006) was turned down by Clintonâ€™s press office.</p>

<p>According to an archives technician at the Clinton Presidential Library, &quot;We currently have no doodles on display and there are no plans for a future exhibit in the works.  As far as I know there are no doodles in our open files at this time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-on-her-private-email-server-i-had-little-to-do-with-it-2015-9">When Hillary first described how her server originated:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was already there,&quot; she said of the server. &quot;It had been there for years. It is the system that my husband&#39;s personal office used when he got out of the White House. And so it was sitting there in the basement. It was not any trouble at all.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/31/exclusive-hillary-shared-an-email-network-with-the-clinton-foundation/">We know the Foundation and Hillary used the same server</a> - pardon Breitbart, but they have the best collection of primary sources on this. </p>

<p>Guccifer described the server <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacker-guccifer-i-got-inside-hillary-clinton-s-server-n568206">as an &quot;open orchid&quot;</a> &quot;There were hundreds of folders.&quot; He also has said that the evidence that he breached the server is already online. We know he has differentiated between Sidney Blumenthal&#39;s hacked AOL account and he never described Hillary&#39;s server as a her personal server, rather &quot;For me, it was not like the Hillary Clinton server, it was like an email server she and others were using.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="/u/ecloc">/u/ecloc</a> has a great post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4icy97/update_i_am_pretty_sure_bill_clintons_doodles/d2x2nxt">below</a> that provides much deeper technical background supporting this.</p>

<p>I was extremely skeptical about this earlier today. But the original <a href="http://gawker.com/new-hacked-presidential-art-may-be-bill-clintons-white-1476802573">gawker</a> article is the only publication that initially picked up this story, for the most part it went under the radar.</p>

<p>This seems it would also satisfy the Clinton camps <a href="https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/728004341777502209">argument</a> that Guccifer would have leaked content.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> Guccifer leaked doodles from <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/198emcvczzghejpg.jpg">Bill Clinton</a> in 2013. The source of these doodles almost certainly came from the Clinton Foundation server. Which is the same server Hillary used as Secretary of State.</p>

<p>This was done during self-post saturday. A separate post on literally the exact same topic has been up for over 15 hours.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">25</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Denmark1976.html">Denmark1976</a> 2016-05-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>The Corporate Owned Media (Reddit)</em></strong></p>

<p>This is my personal conspiracy theory, my personal delusional speculations and this is my personal opinions (I am attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato). I have had my fair share of warnings, next time, I will 100% get struck with the wham-ban-awesome-hammer.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major sub Reddit&#39;s are being censored extensively. It happens behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information. It happens when you post articles, reveal crimes or criticism about the US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economy, Inequality and Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media and a selection of well connected individuals. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their methods: 1) Word detection algorithms. 2) Subtle vote rigging. 3) Removal of posts. 5) Intimidation. 5) Banning of accounts. 6) Trolling by Shills &amp; Pundits. 7) Removal specific articles. 8) Algorithms that automatically hide certain media sources. It is a very smooth and professional operation, these people are intelligent and very dedicated. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> AutoModerator Death Kneel post! This post, about the post, is soon going to disappear from the frontage. The vote patterns - comments often look a little odd! If you ask the moderators, they will deny any connections, yet it never fails to materialize itself. I AM NOT ACCUSING THE MODERATORS OF ANYTHING, I fully believe them when they tell me that they have no knowledge about such events. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Reddit has been censoring the independent and alternative media for years. The victims of this censorship all have one thing in common: They are compromising the narrative of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. They punch a hole in the official scenery of propaganda, fear and lies. The recipe for destroying the government propaganda is simple: Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity. Reddit is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publication Inc.</a> a de facto member for the Corporate Owned Mass Media. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5)</em></strong> Reddit is a black box, if they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t. We can&#39;t see what is the work of the Users, what is the work of the Moderators, what is the work of the Administrators and tell them apart. It can all be done with proxy accounts. But we can observe with our own eyes. We can take notes. We are not allowed to talk about it or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>6)</em></strong> I have seen a lot of constant racist postings on r/conspiracy thinly disguised as &quot;conspiracy anti-Israel posts&quot;. If you don&#39;t remove them they will make up 15-25% of the front page volume. Then there is a lot of polarizing issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. Then you have all the irrelevant trivia, sports and celebrity worship designed to distract and entertain us all. This is how &quot;they&quot; are dumbing down the conspiracy forum, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots and retards scratching each other behind the ears. It it by design not accident. No need to pretend otherwise. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is my &quot;little conspiracy&quot; about Reddit, conspiracy forum and the corporate owned mass media in general. And I might still be entitled to my own opinion, if not, I don&#39;t really care anymore... </p>

<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> You are not the only one. </p></li>

<p>Welcome to the echo champer my friend! Why don&#39;t you instead distract yourself with some &quot;anti-Israel articles&quot; posted by the <del>Mxxxxxxxxs</del> or maybe some celebrity news?! Or are you of an sports guy? In reality you are just a misguided soul in search of entertainment and distraction.

Going back it looks like they have been deleting several of my comments on articles without notification. </p>

<p>For example, I had the highest rated comment on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4i5i53/atlanta_mayors_column_ripping_sanders_drafted_by/d2v7gqh">this post</a>. I can see it when logged in. Here is an image of it: <a href="http://imgur.com/4bQjdx9">imgur</a> but the permalink takes you nowhere: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4i5i53/atlanta_mayors_column_ripping_sanders_drafted_by/d2v7gqh">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4i5i53/atlanta_mayors_column_ripping_sanders_drafted_by/d2v7gqh</a></p>

<p>So even mentioning Correct the Record, in an article that is talking about Correct the Record gets deleted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are most certainly mods in politics who at the best let their bias for Hillary dictate their actions or at worst are paid by ctr. That&#39;s why they have such asinine rules for calling out shills but don&#39;t bother to actually ban shills. Trolls too. They don&#39;t bother banning those despite being explicitly against the rules. Or that you have to remain civil and yet can use sexist terms like Berniebro. They can&#39;t even logically explain why their actions are as such or clarify rules. They just quash opinions that don&#39;t jive with their narrative if it calls them out on their obvious bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah right, the clinton donor and family friend who suddenly appeared on the political scene to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton, at the exact moment a clinton needed fake opposition to split her real opposition down the middle, muddy the waters, and co-opt/take over the stupid as fuck anti-establishment bloc that listens to alex jones.</p>

<p>this is called false opposition, and your billionaire bud donald is it, he&#39;s not working for you (by trying to use you to make himself president)</p>

<p>&quot;the best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves&quot; - VI Lenin</p>

<p>that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to you with Donald, you support clinton by supporting trump, just the same way you&#39;d be supporting putin by supporting his opposition if Putin&#39;s wife was &quot;running against&quot; a Putin family friend and campaign donor.</p>

<p>this should be the most obvious thing in the world but apparently its a bit too much to expect for trumpers to deal with reality - you&#39;re being scammed and the_donald is the most obviously faked/managed subreddit in existence.</p>

<p>Bernie is <strong>being shunned</strong> too aggressively to be controlled opposition.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you read there.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s more an unwritten rule to not comment as a sitting duck president on an election for your job; the same more or less goes for Biden.</p>

<p>Once the FBI investigation is concluded you&#39;ll see more people like Obama and Bernie comment about it. Obama because she was secretary for him during the period of time she was being investigated for, and Bernie because he has motive for taking her out of the race for nomination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he is only starting to do that now, and that started only a month ago, for most of his campaign, he appeased Hillary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple, Bernie was used as a wedge to prevent Biden from running. If Biden had run with Bernie also in the race, Bernie would&#39;ve won the plurality as Hillary and Biden would have split the moderate vote. If it had been 1 on 1, Biden would&#39;ve crushed Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why isn&#39;t Biden on his ticket if he has the ability to split the moderate vote?</p>

<p>The deck is stacked against Bernie with superdelegates for Hillary, If Biden had any sway in who the people would vote for; Bernie would of already had him on board.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Biden has much to do with it, Bernie has to pull out all the stops to win this now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re reading my comments properly.</p>

<p>Your last 2 replies suggest you aren&#39;t understanding the points I&#39;m making about Bernie being shunned.</p>

<p>None of it matters anyway, the democratic nomination process is rigged to allow the establishment to choose their nominees. And unfortunately they&#39;ve choosen Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The superdelegates don&#39;t necessarily have to pick Hillary, if Bernie won the plurality, there would be huge pressure to pick him.</p>

<p>Same thing happened with Trump and the Republican party, when Trump started racking up a larger and larger plurality, delegates in favor of other candidates were getting second thoughts and started feeling huge pressure to support Trump.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, neither the Republican nor Democratic establishments want their parties to split.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do care, superdelegates are loyalist party people first, they&#39;re not going to jeopardize the party, simply for hillary, like I said, look at what happened with the Republicans.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=clinton+superdelegates">Look</a> at the ratio of pledged delegates to superdelegates. </p>

<p>If they really are loyalist to the people of the party and not a candidate then Bernie would have a couple hundred more super delegates; but he doesn&#39;t, he has 39.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie was also controlled opposition by Hillary, both candidates might have started out that way, but they&#39;ve since gone rogue. Bernie was told to enter to prevent Biden from coming in. If Biden had entered the race, he would&#39;ve easily beaten Hillary, but with Bernie, the moderate vote would have been split allowing Bernie to win a plurality, hence why Biden stayed out. That&#39;s why Bernie refused to attack Hillary in the beginning, Bernie&#39;s campaign didn&#39;t even think he had a chance.</p>
