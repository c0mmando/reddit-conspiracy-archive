    <div class="md"><p>There was a long fight against <strong><em>private central banking</em></strong> for a reason in our countries history, and the <strong><em>private central banking</em></strong> cartel won in 1913 with the Federal Reserve act. Read the history and literature, the founding fathers were debating the exact thing that we are now called &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for discussing. The Board of Governors is nothing more than a puppet show to pacify the public.
The whole world has transitioned to this private system, where all money is created by a group of individuals behind these private central banks, who then loan this money at interest to private commercial banks and governments.
So think about it, all the money in the world is owed, with interest attached, to a secret cabal. Our economy is a debt based economy.
The two reasons the world is asleep to this is because ownership of the media and governments by these groups, and the cognitive dissonance involved in accepting that their comfortable cozy worldview is wrong.</p>

<p>Almost every time I try and explain this to people they just shrug it off as if it&#39;s a misunderstanding of economics. Then there are some who argue this is a good thing, because their econ professor said so. It&#39;s absolutely mind-boggling how brainwashed people are on this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a ridiculous thing to say.</p>

<p>First of all, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is <em>not</em> private. It&#39;s a federal agency.</p>

<p>Now, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks are <em>sort of</em> private, but they are nothing like Federal Express.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><strong>Federal Reserve</strong>: There is a <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2014-title12/html/USCODE-2014-title12-chap3.htm">Federal Reserve Act</a> which delineates the powers and duties of Federal Reserve Banks, how their leaders are chosen, where each can operate, what business each can carry on, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Express</strong>: There is no Federal Express Act. If FedEx wants to buy a competitor, it can. If it wants to expand overseas, it can. If it wants to buy Kinko&#39;s and get into a new line of business, it can.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Reserve</strong>: The stock of each Federal Reserve Bank is owned by all the member banks in the district. Each member bank is told how much stock it must own. The stock cannot be traded.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Express</strong>: The stock is bought and sold every day.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Reserve</strong>: Each Federal Reserve Bank has a board of 9 directors, 6 of whom are chosen by the member banks. Each member bank gets two votes, one for a class A director, who is a banker, and one for a class B director, who may not be a banker. The banks in each district are split into three groups by size, so that the large banks pick two directors, the medium sized banks pick two and the small banks pick two. The other three directors are appointed by the Board of Governors (the federal agency). Those three class C directors are not allowed to be banks or own any bank stock. The class B and class C directors then elect a President and Vice-President of the bank, subject to the approval of the Board of Governors.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Express</strong>: Each share of common stock = 1 vote. Almost anybody can be a director. The board is usually chosen by a small group of shareholders who own a lot of stock.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Reserve</strong>: Each member bank gets a dividend equal to 6% of the stock they own in their Federal Reserve Bank. All remaining profits go to the federal government.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Express</strong>: The board of directors determines what the dividend is going to be, with few limitations. The company pays taxes to various governments.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Reserve</strong>: Publishes annual reports with financial statements audited by an outside accounting firm. In addition, it is subject to review by the Government Accountability Office (with some limitations). The Chairman of the Federal Reserve must appear before Congress every six months.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Express</strong>: Publishes annual reports with financial statements audited by an outside accounting firm. Must file quarterly statement with the SEC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for pointing out the difference. On a personal note, do you support the Federal Reserve as it stands? I personally see at as a ponzi scheme, just am curious if you are defending the fed or just wanting to clarify and correct the old saying of equating the Federal Reserve to Federal Express.

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to elaborate......</p>

<p>Shell Oil acting as a multinational global conglomerate and one of the largest companies on earth were paying bribes to government officials in Nigeria. They were paying the military to conduct raids on innocent protesters homes and ended up hanging innocent protest leaders in order to suppress the protesting against Shell.</p>

<p>My username is my attempt at education via a spoof on the Human Rights Abuses by Shell Oil in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.</p>

<p>The oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians&#39; every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.[15]</p>

<p>The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $15.5 million USD to victims&#39; families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.[16] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, in order to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.[17] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.[18] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Ken Saro-Wiwa&#39;s son, was due to begin in New York.[17]</p>

<p>I can tell you what Bitcoins are. They are something no person or group does or ever can control. They are decentralized. They are the people&#39;s money. Be your own bank. Help make the Federal Reserve irrelevant, by refusing to use currency and debt arbitrarily printed by them. Bitcoins are created (think printed) at a known rate by an algorithm that is verified by the whole network and therefore cannot be changed without consensus from the network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem misinformed. Bitcoin is increasingly booming in adoption, not a fad dying out at all. Bitcoins are backed by work as their system use a Proof of Work concept. They inherently have value due to the work put into them. Bitcoin transactions take only seconds! The longer you wait, the more secure the transaction is. Each &quot;confirmation&quot; takes 10 minutes. This means after 10 minutes, your transaction would be permanently confirmed in the blockchain and safe from double spends, which one could equate similarly to a credit card charge back. To be safe from credit card charge backs you need to wait a week to a month when receiving a credit card transaction. Similarly disputes with PayPal transactions. Waiting any longer than one Bitcoin confirmation, 10 minutes, just prevents large sophisticated charge backs, like a government could do with thousands of computers worth of processing power. You might want to wait for 3 Bitcoin confirmations, 30 minutes, before feeling that you safely received larges sums of money such as a million dollars worth of Bitcoins, for instance.</p>

<p>BTC isn&#39;t worth the effort.  Its not a safe store of wealth by any stretch of the term.  It won&#39;t work during a crisis, and virtually no one accepts or uses it.  The value of BTC will continue to drop, and new user adoption is virtually nonexistent.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll gladly stick to inherently valuable stores of wealth, durable tradable goods, and as a fall back, physical fiat US currency (until that too becomes worthless). You enjoy your worthless little electronic fiat.  You&#39;re gonna be rich some day because of it.  Surely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is not fractured, nor dying. It is massively increasing in use, adoption, and acceptance, as well as every major banking institute researching into its blockchain benefits and build them into their private controlled banking system, without those pesky &#39;be your own bank&#39; and &#39;total lack of trust in a centralized authority&#39; parts.</p>

<p>You keep saying an hour or more, but even a million dollar transaction with a government sized attack should be acceptable at around 30 minutes. </p>

<p>Most transactions are fine at a few seconds. This increasing security with time isn&#39;t due to &quot;poorly designed infrastructure&quot;, it is due to the genius design of decentralized consensus. The lack of an authoritative central party, like a bank. It allows you to use the massively secure Bitcoin system for transactions that can never be reversed or forged, fixes the common double spend problem, and removes the requirement of giving all the information needed to spend from your bank account to make a transaction, all while never having to trust anyone.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is definitely a safe store of wealth and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TLs5xkG.png">has been the best preforming currency every year since creation except for one, against government currencies such as USD, EU, and gold/silver.</a></p>

<p>Bitcoin&#39;s <a href="https://bitcoinity.org/markets/bitfinex/USD">value has done very little but rise in the last 17 months.</a> We enjoyed a year of stability in value recently, a sign of a maturing currency and its ecosystem.</p>

<p>So many places accept Bitcoin that is is crazy to say no one accepts or uses it. Everywhere from Steam, to Amazon, NewEgg, Overstock, to D&#39;s Casino in Las Vegas. The list is so tremendous that people <a href="http://spendbitcoins.com/places/">have trouble keeping an accurate list,</a> and places that don&#39;t accept Bitcoins usually are covered by a third party that does, such as through selling gift cards for Bitcoins, like AMC theaters gift cards from eGifter.</p>

<p>I personally suggest diversification in investment, but investing very little in US dollars, such as standard savings accounts as they seem the most risky. Stocks, precious metals, and Bitcoins seem the best investment.</p>

<p>Yet, I mostly use Bitcoins rather than sit on them for investment. I can get good discounts and deals from some venders and they are super convenient compared to all other alternatives. I really enjoy helping to invalidate the Federal Reserve&#39;s existence with every time I use them as well.</p>

<p>You are so far beyond disinformation here, it&#39;s literally unbelievable.  You could not be physically any further from the truth on Bitcoins.  Not fractured you say?  Funny how you neglect to mention there are TWO separate and incompatable Bitcoin branches.  Coins owned in one DO NOT work in the other.  Its understandable why you would neglect mentioning that small little tidbit.  As you&#39;re not just spreading lies, you&#39;re flat out spreading some of the most reckless advice I&#39;ve ever seen lied to the public in an attempt to get then using your scam e-fiat Bitcoin nonsense.  Seems very par for the course for your objectives in disrupting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is &quot;definitely a safe store of wealth.&quot; - and with that single blatantly mialeading statement, you&#39;ve exposed yourself.  As we&#39;ve seen in this very thread even, the pro-zionist liars are busy putting out disinformation and flat out lies about the Federal Reserve (for  obvious reasons...such as their claim to a lack of Jewish directors of the usury lending scam operation that is the PRIVATE Federal Reserve), but also about &quot;the many great benefits and complete safety&quot; of Bitcoin.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s very interesting to identify the specific topics that the disruptors flock to without fail.  It makes it incredibly easy to see what topics they are forced to cover.  9/11, also for obvious reasons.  The Federal Reserve, again for very obvious reasons.  That reporter they claimed was murdered on live morning TV - also, no surprise there.  All part of the zionist backed disarming of United States citizens.  The JFK assasination - also heavy involvement of the Israeli faftion within the CIA at the time.  They quite clearly attack only the subjects that they have involvement with.  The partial surprises though (among many) were Sandy Hook (heavy mossad involvement there??), and many of the NASA space/moon hoaxes (why would this be?).</p>

<p>Thanks for your contribution of such blatant lies, we were able to instantly spot them. This makes spreading the ugly truth against these lies and misinformation that much easier for us all.</p>

<p>No, I am a crytpo currency enthusiast and developer and am VERY informed on this subject. You seem to have several misconceptions about Bitcoin. It is hard to keep up with, especially with recent nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not fractured you say? Funny how you neglect to mention there are TWO separate and incompatable Bitcoin branches.  Coins owned in one DO NOT work in the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is incorrect. There is, and can only be, one Bitcoin blockchain. If there was another blockchain, it would no longer be Bitcoin. You seem confused about the recent block size limit argument. There was some drama, arguing, and in-fighting about how best to deal with a coming technical issue. There were attempts by rouge groups to convince the community to make under the hood changes to the Bitcoin protocol supporting their proposed solution. They have failed. Bitcoin is about consensus. Unless 75% of Bitcoin users agreed, those changes would not take effect. The 2 opposing parties have booth failed to garner their 75% support and thus failed to activate. Bitcoin&#39;s blockchain has not forked. New solutions have been proposed that do not require a fork to upgrade and do not follow the solutions proposed by either opposing group. </p>

<p>Bitcoin threatens the centralized banking industry. If you feel the Zionist agenda is to control wealth with the Federal Reserve and centralized banking industry, then Bitcoin is the enemy of your enemy, and thus your friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, I am very informed on this subject. These lame tech articles always screw this up majorly and pander to nonsense hype. They can barely wrap their heads around the issues. This article is also old, from  Aug 18, 2015, and there has been some serious changes since then. This was back when the proposed forking alternatives were just being made and the height of the drama. This was before the Bitcoin developer team decide what the road map would be.</p>

<p>Mike Hearn has always been kind of an outspoken jackass, and when he went all out on his proposed fork, BitcoinXT, he basically bad mouthed Bitcoin to all these media outlets. His BitcoinXT failed. He didn&#39;t get the 75% consensus in time, and BitcoinXT permanently keeps the Bitcoin-Core features and never attempts to fork.</p>

<p>Mike Hearn also quit Bitcoin and <a href="http://bravenewcoin.com/news/30-top-banks-and-mike-hearn-have-now-joined-r3-global-consortium/">now works for the R3 Consortium of centralized banksters.</a> There is no telling if his fork threat and bad mouthing of Bitcoin was part of a farewell gift for Bitcoin the banksters paid him to do. Basically, drama-boy Hearn is suspected to be bought out and a carefully planned coup/FUD attack against Bitcoin paid for by banksters and maybe government actors.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin-Core developer team and the Bitcoin community as a whole has sufficiently rejected BitcoinXT and BitcoinClass strategies for this scaling issue. The Bitcoin-Core developer team released an <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html">official scaling road map that involves no forks</a> and lays out the plans going forward. They are focusing on the Segregated Witness and Lightning Network strategies as well as some smaller stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a quasi-governmental agency. This is to ensure that it&#39;s operational autonomy can&#39;t be influenced by the policies of each new administration, which is very important. </p>

<p>If we had every new administration decide the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve it would be an absolute disaster. I&#39;d MUCH rather it be in the hands of bankers who actually understand economics than politicians who base their policies on political ideologies and not science.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear you don&#39;t have a solid understanding of macroeconomics if you think they just give away money as free handouts. Those low interest loans are given out to businesses to stimulate economic growth during stagnation or decline. Having loans/debt is a GOOD thing, it means the economy is growing and using capital resources.</p>

<p>It is a part of the Federal Government just not in the way you think it is.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll revise the sentence though, just so you can&#39;t come up with another logical fallacy to dismiss an argument without having to refute it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, considering how this sub is a place to discuss conspiracies and a lot of people reading these posts and comments won&#39;t be too familiar with a lot of the stuff that gets posted, when somebody posts something that seemingly makes sense but is a rebuttal of the conspiracy theory discussed in the post, maybe it would be a decent idea to not gang up on them and resort to a steaming pile of logical fallacies and insult instead of arguing back.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not entirely familiar with the concept of the federal reserve being the devil, and all I see is one guy who raises a few good points and a bunch of morons who can&#39;t be bothered to argue with him and tell him to go fuck himself instead. Dismiss it all you want, but you look like an imbecile when the best you can do is &quot;you&#39;re so blatantly pro-fed that it would be a waste of time to refute your arguments.&quot; Cool story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How it is a lie? It&#39;s basic economics, math can&#39;t lie. There are plenty of real conspiracies backed by facts and evidence that do I believe and should be discussed here, but this isn&#39;t one of them. I actually used to believe the same as you and the OP about the Federal Reserve, it&#39;s part of the reason why I pursued an education in economics. Just something I&#39;ve always been interested in...</p>

<p>You have not given one piece of evidence or one logical argument that refutes what I said. </p>

<p>I am completely open and willing to take seriously any information or argument you can give me and discuss it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why people in a sub so devoted to truth are so unwilling to even CONSIDER information that doesn&#39;t fit their personal beliefs, even when it&#39;s backed up by evidence and logic. If what I said was so far from the truth, as you say it is, it should be incredibly easy for you to completely blow it up.</p>

<p>You and a few other people who responded are dismissing my arguments without having to refute them by making personal attacks on my character.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem</a></p>

<p>and read this one specifically:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_decedo">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_decedo</a></p>

<p>These are the same tactics the people you criticize (shills) use to dismiss arguments without having to refute them and everyone who has responded to me has used these. There was not a single response to what I posted that wasn&#39;t a personal attack instead of argument about the actual content of my post, this should tell you something...</p>

<p>Are you sure you&#39;re interested in the truth? Because finding the truth requires a logical discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the Federal Reserve a quasi-governmental organization? Sure. A lot of people get it wrong saying it has NOTHING to do with the Federal government because it truly does. Is it constitutional, imo? Hell no. I seriously disagree with you that &quot;debt&quot; is inherently a good thing. How is our government charging themselves and us interest on our own money a good thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a complete misunderstanding. They aren&#39;t charging themselves interest, they are charging commercial banks they loan to interest. Profits from the Federal Reserve are sent to the Treasury, which is used to budget the federal government (which means you pay less in taxes).</p>

<p>When commercial banks have problems obtaining funding to give out loans to people/businesses because of temporary market disruptions (whether it be low market liquidity/confidence, natural disasters, current political policies, market bubbles, etc) then they can receive that funding from the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>This is extremely important because if investor confidence is low and no one can get loans to start a business, pay current/hire more employees, buy a house/car, etc, then unemployment will skyrocket and the economy would be destroyed.</p>

<p>And since, as I mentioned in my second paragraph, investor confidence is not always rational (like whether or not they have faith in the current president/administration or not) and can be affected by internal AND external market forces, the Federal Reserve is absolutely necessary to address problems in temporary market liquidity.</p>

<p>If they loan too much, interest rates and inflation will skyrocket; if they loan too little, there isn&#39;t enough liquidity in the market. This is why it is extremely important that they have operational autonomy and not subject to current political ideologies at any given time.</p>

<p>Operational autonomy does NOT mean that there is no oversight. The Federal Reserve is controlled by a Board of Governors who have to be approved by the Senate. They can also be audited and investigated at any time by Congress, the GAO (Government Accountability Office), and the OIC (Office of the Inspector General). They also have to testify to congress many (usually 30-40) times a year. If at any time one of these four government agencies believes there are inefficiencies, fraud, waste, or abuse in any way of the Federal Reserve system by the Board of Governors then they can and will be subject to investigation and replacement.</p>

<p>I appreciate your response and let me know if there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like me to clarify.</p>

<p>edit: fixed a few typos</p>
