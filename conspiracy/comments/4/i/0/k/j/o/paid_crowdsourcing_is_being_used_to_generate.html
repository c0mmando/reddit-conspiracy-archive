       I use a crowdsourcing site to make money. It's mostly paid academic surveys, but the type of work varies a lot, and this was one task I found. People are being paid $0.50 to record a video of them supporting Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that doesn't sound like much, but the incentive is still significant since these tasks don't take long and they're meant to be done in bulk. I just wanted to put this out there so there's more evidence available of the fact that people are being paid to support certain views. I know it's already common knowledge, but it doesn't hurt to have more evidence.

       Pro torture of "suspected terrorists," pro targeting family members of suspected terrorists, pro broadening libel laws (which hinders free speech), pro Israeli settlements, pro using our military on behalf of Israel and now he just named a guy from Goldman Sachs to be his finance chairman after running his campaign saying he doesn't like money in politics and trashing Ted Cruz for having a wife on the board of Goldman Sachs.. In spite of that he names a guy who gave a ton of money to Hillary to be his finance chairman.  So Hillary has Goldman on her side and Trump has Goldman on his side.  As always, no matter who wins, they win.  The only difference is Trump fooled people into thinking he wasn't working for them.  He appointed this guy on his own... It wasn't out of monetary influence... Honest.  He's changing the way things are done by doing more of the same.

       People are always talking about getting money out of politics, but you like to conveniently ignore the fact that Trump is a billionaire celebrity. How do you think he got where he is? Is it due to his superior education and intelligence? Haha, good one. Is it because he truly represents what the people want? I highly doubt that. Is it because he has years of experience and a consistent voting record? What voting record?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm... I wonder if his piles of cash helped him pay his way to the top?

       Can you provide an example of that?  I have noticed the exact opposite to be true.

       It's a pretty well-known tactic. Just watch some Bernie rallies from the mainstream media. You see him, and maybe a few people behind him, but you never see a shot of the entire crowd.

       I've noticed that to be true for all candidates.  Haven't you seen Trump call out the media for not panning the camera to show the crowd?  He does it at almost every rally.

       I don't get my info about Trump rallies from mainstream news. I watch videos of the livestreams from the actually rally to where you can see reality.

       No. Feel free to point out the part where I pushed for Hillary.

       This is the problem with politics. People assume that criticism against one candidate = support for another. You're contributing the the problem with this line of thinking.

       Yes and possibly stadiums full of passionate paid folks hanging on his every word.  How much would that cost?  The point being that even if what you say is true and it might be, why would he need to do it?  He has overwhelming support.  Personally, I am not going to vote for him.

       I'm sure propaganda campaigns like this helped him gain his supposed "overwhelming support".

       His fame helped him too since he was already well-known before the election.

       I'm not even sure what you're trying to say. Your post has zero actual content.

       My point is that people respond to his message which they interpret to not be socialist like your boy Bernie.  I personally am not sure that his message is authentic while it is a certainty that Bernie Bubba is more of the same crap we have been gettin.  Finally, for you to suggest that his appeal is not primarily because of his message is laughable at best and brings your discernment skills into question.  Trump has touched a nerve among many good people and whether or not he means what he says or can even do half of what he says is another question.  Was he born on third base and thinks he hit a homerun?  Yep.  Irritating the crap out of the powers that be? Yes.  Have a very good understanding of citizens of this country and their real concerns? Yes, again.  Able or willing to stop a speeding locomotive?.............
