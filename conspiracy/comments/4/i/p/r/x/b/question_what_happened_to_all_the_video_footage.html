       Is it weird that the video footage surrounding the pentagon was grabbed up after 9/11 and never released or shown except for 2 stills from a parking camera gate? Will the footage ever be released?

       Yeah, zero evidence of plane at crash site. What are the chances the security footage would prove the same. Pretty high considering they are still classified 15 years later.

       The Pentagon has the most cameras on it than any other building in the world and all we get is a couple of frames from a fish eye lensed shitty camera. If that's enough evidence for you that's fair enough, you can go put your head back in the sand now.

       Do you understand that the plane was travelling 500+ MPH, and a standard FPS security camera will at best only capture one or two frames, due to the planes' great speed?
      </p>
      <p>
       At least five other tapes were recovered near the Pentagon crash site, and those only showed the post-impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim that hundreds of cameras were seized, than show evidence. For a decade, we've had no evidence that more than three or four tapes were confiscated. Those tapes were all released.

       Lol they don't have to "seize" their own cameras and are you trying to say it's not heavily camered?

       These shows shit. First parking one actually verifies Rumsfeld's missile. Where is that Sheraton footage?
      </p>
      <p>
       So that 757 went into that tiny hole and came out the other side? So once again we are to suspend all reason, common sense, and physics to believe this lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like Dr. Sund at NIST trying avoid the definition of free fall in a room full of scientists in hopes of making the lie true. Sometimes, the lie is so grand it exposes itself.

       He mis-spoke. "Missiles" aren't supported by any eyewitness accounts. The majority of witnesses spoke of a jetliner, and ones close enough to the scene recalled smelling jet fuel. Yes, a jetliner travelling at 500+ MPH can only
       <em>
        sound
       </em>
       like a missile, but that's not good enough if we want to be serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, a Boeing 757 does not look like a goddamned Tomahawk missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why on Earth would the planners behind 9/11 use three regular jetliners for their other targets, and then randomly hit the Pentagon with a missile?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "tiny" hole was in reality ninety-foot wide. The "tiny hole" claim originates from a cherry-picked photo which shows a firefighter spraying water, which covers up a good portion of the impact area. You're repeating endlessly debunked fabrications.
      </p>
      <p>
       After some further research, I'm not actually sure that tapes were ever seized from Sheraton. This
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/16/pentagon.video/index.html?eref=yahoo">
        CNN source
       </a>
       says that a "hotel security camera video" was seized. Sheraton Hotel's a popular candidate, but it's unconfirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, there is no reason to suspect that such tapes would show the impact. If it showed up in the database search referred to in the FOIA request, it may have been one of the videos which is said to have not recorded the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that the alleged seizure of footage, and what is contained on that footage in question, are separate but related questions.

       Yes, he mis-spoke did he? because noone in their freakin mind would believe a jetliner left all those adjacent windows intacted and sunk perfectly into several layers of fortified concrete at its most vulnerable weak part( the nose) and came out the other side of the compound. Oh...and also didn't leave any evidence, no bodies, no bags, no engines and little damage on the ground. In fact, the first actual journalists declared on air "there is no evidence that plane hit pentagon"...you don't even have to think too hard. No plane, that parking footage they released shows something a lot smaller than a boeing 757, we can do the math just by looking at height of the pentagon wall versus whatever that thing is. It was not a 757, that's 100% evident! But what hit it? I do not  know either.

       The FBI agent reviewed 29 of the tapes she believed to be in the FBI's possession and listed exactly what was contained on them. The other 56 she didn't watch, she deduced did not contain the impact. By the way, many of those tapes were
       <em>
        voluntarily sent in
       </em>
       from civilians to the FBI's Washington (IIRC) and Quantinco field offices. Not "seized" or 'confiscated' like so many like to claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Defense already released the only footage it had. There's no evidence that the FBI or DoD is hiding videotapes. In fact, there were lawsuits to release some of the footage talked about here that were initially stonewalled (Citgo gas station for instance), that were later released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if some footage existed (which is incredibly unlikely), what would you expect the tapes to show that the six-frame footage doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm honestly surprised at people who think there'd be hundreds of security cameras pointed at a very specific wedge of the Pentagon building.

       Either back up your claim that more than four videos were seized, or retract. Simple. We know the "hundreds of cameras seized" claim is false, because it was a distortion of the reply to the FOIA request. Or wishful thinking. Try again.

       You can see for yourself on YouTube. The Doubletree Hotel and Citgo gas station tapes were released nearly a decade ago. None of them show the direct impact, because the cameras were simply not pointed toward that vantage point.

       This is completely false. This is partly a distortion of an FBI agent's reply to a FOIA request, and part distortion and/or cherry-picking of eyewitness accounts.

       Not a 100% believer in the missile thing, however: the hole was too small for the plane they said it was, the damage was concetrated in one area and there was no evidence of wings hitting the pentagon, no engines or plane bits were reported at the scene, the grass was perfectly fine and had no trace of a plane careering across it but if a pilot had managed to avoid the grass and hit the building it was a damn good pilot to fly in that narrow a parameter to leace the grass unspoilt but hit the building...

       I used to think that they were going to release it eventually after using it as a "honeypot conspiracy"....after all of us here keep shouting, "where is the pentagon footage of the plane?" they would eventually release it as proof we are all batshit insane...now I don't think they ever will because no one will believe their After Effects altered footage is real!

       I perform funerals regularly in Arlington National Cemetery. ANC is literally a stones throw from the pentagon. The "Plane" flew over the cemetery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I hear planes fly over ANC all the time. There is an airport nearby. The planes are loud as hell. You can hear them very far away. I was talking to a guy who was in ANC on 9/11. He heard no plane. Didn't see one. Only heard an explosion. I have a long page of information of his first hand account if anyone wants it.

       <strong>
        The Suppression of Video Footage of the Pentagon Attack
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is striking that there is neither video footage nor any photographic evidence in the public domain showing a jetliner approaching or crashing into the Pentagon. As of May, 2006, the only video footage of the crash that has been released are clips from two Pentagon security cameras north of the crash site, one the source of 5 frames leaked in 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the release of the two video clips, the Pentagon claims to have supplied all of the footage it has of the attack. Although the number and positions of security cameras monitoring the Pentagon is not public knowledge, it seems unlikely that only two security cameras captured the attack. Isn't it reasonable to assume that there were dozens, if not hundreds, of security cameras ringing the huge building that is the heart of the United States military establishment?

        Videos Outside the Pentagon Seized
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sheraton National Hotel may be the hotel from which the FBI seized a CCTV recording.
Not only has the government refused to release footage that would clearly show how the Pentagon was attacked, it has also seized footage not belonging to the military. The FBI confiscated video recordings from several private businesses near the Pentagon in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Those recordings, if they still exist, might provide decisive evidence about the attack.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The FBI visited a hotel near the Pentagon to confiscate film from a security camera which some hotel employees had been watching in horror shortly after the attack. The FBI denied that the footage captured the attack.

       <li>
        <p>
         The FBI visited the Citgo gas station southwest of the Pentagon within minutes of the attack to confiscate film that may have captured the attack. According to Jose Velasquez, who was working at the gas station at the time of the attack, the station's security cameras would have captured the attack. (

        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In addition it is likely there is other video footage that was either destroyed or is being withheld, given that the trajectory of the attack plane took it low over a large part of Arlington, Virginia.

        Lawsuits to Obtain Videos
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At least two plaintiffs have attempted to obtain videos seized by the FBI, using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The first, documented at Flight77.info, began with a request to the FBI in October of 2004. The second, undertaken by the Judicial Watch, Inc. began with a request to the Department of Defense (DOD) in December of 2004.

       The Doubletree Hotel and Citgo videos have all been publicly released years ago. Those videos were in fact released in response to the 2004 FOIA request. None of them show the impact, simply because it wasn't in the vantage point. The Department of Defense released the only footage it had of the impact, and it clearly shows a Boeing 757 once you account for the fish-eyes lens distortion, and compare with a 757 model.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no corroborated accounts of confiscated footage outside of Citgo, Doubletree and the parking lot tapes. We can thus dismiss your supposed "extra video tapes" as unsupported speculation. The claim that "85 videotapes" were confiscated is a distortion of an FBI agent's reply to the 2004 FOIA request.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a fourth alleged seizure of footage from "a hotel" near the Pentagon, which is either Sheraton (unconfirmed) or Doubletree. The FBI denied that the footage captured the attack, and this claim is consistent with the FBI agent's reply.

       You're conflicting your earlier points that the only footage ever obtained (which is naive to begin with, to put it mildly) was released in a surprising and historical act of never before or again seen honesty. Why would the agent lie, if the FBI did not withhold any video footage?

       I was replying to the claims that more than four videos were seized. Further, that more than one video clearly shows an impact. Four videos were seized, but only
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       of them shows an impact. Why would all of the seized video show an impact? That's your speculation, not mine.

       No one has been able to prove that more than four tapes were seized on 9/11.

       No, it's consistent. The
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       footage which shows a Pentagon impact was released by the Department of Defense. People claim that hundreds of cameras were seized because:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        wishful thinking
       </li>
       <li>
        distorted the reply to the FOIA request.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Nowhere did the FBI or Department of Defense claim to have 85 videos of the Pentagon impact in its possession. The agent said that she thought the FBI had 85 videos
       <strong>
        related to 9/11
       </strong>
       in its possession. This was the result of an initial database search. 56 of these tapes did
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       show either the Pentagon building, the impact area, or the impact itself. The agent watched the remaining 29 videos, only one of which showed the impact (the parking lot footage).
      </p>
      <p>
       16 of those 29 showed the Pentagon, but
       <strong>
        "did not show the Pentagon crash site nor the impact into the Pentagon."
       </strong>
       Of the remaining 13 videos, 12 showed the post-impact damage. That leaves just one tape: the parking lot footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other videos weren't released because those
       <strong>
        did not fulfill the claimant's request.
       </strong>
       The person asked for footage of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, and the
       <em>
        closest
       </em>
       tapes
       <strong>
        to that request
       </strong>
       that the agent could find were the Doubletree and Citgo tapes (i.e. it captured
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       the impact happened, but not directly).
      </p>
      <p>
       Those tapes didn't even directly show the impact. Again, only one does, and there's no reason to think others exist. If you think such a tape exists, then document your claim with a supported account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the majority of the videos the FBI had were voluntarily given to them from private citizens. Many videos were home movies, news reels, etc. i.e. of no relation to the specific FOIA request. So a few tapes may have shown the Trade Towers burning, but it was not Pentagon impact footage. These tapes belong to the individuals who sent them in. In order to release those tapes, that person has to give permission.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why would the FBI release tapes which aren't theirs?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why would the FBI release footage that
         <strong>
          does not
         </strong>
         even show the Pentagon itself?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The FBI only seized four tapes. Those tapes were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your claim is refuted.

       Thanks, Ive never seen these before. The Citgo gas station shows nothing. The Double Tree hotel and the guard shack video are just inconclusive. The 757 analysis video, while making a good point about the white nose cone and possibly the white engine cover, when the 757 is superimposed onto the video it's size doesn't seem to fit well. I would think a 757 being closer to the ground as in the guardshack video I would expect on object as big as 757 to look much larger than the streak/smear in the video. All in all thanks for the links!

       Yes, the Citgo and Doubletree do not show the impact itself, but it captured the time the impact happened. I suppose that's why those were released.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fish-eye lens of the parking lot camera distorts the video and might give the wrong impression about the object's apparent size. You do raise a good point about the size of the superimposed 757.

       three actual accounts of confiscated videos: parking lot tapes (leaked), Doubletree Hotel and Citgo gas station. Only the parking lot tapes show an impact. There's no reason to believe other tapes exist which

       The "80, 85, 90, 100" etc. 'seized' cameras/videotapes thing is false. This is a distortion of an FBI agent's reply to a 2004 FOIA request. I explain more in my comments

       If the tapes don't show the plane, maybe there was no plane to show.  The lady named April who worked inside the area hit walked out of the building though the hole the "plane" made. She said and stlll claims, she saw no airplane parts, no bodies, no indication of a plane hitting the Pentagon. She also sad she thought t was a bomb since she could smell the cordite explosive, something she was familiar wth during her army training.

       There are only two corroborated accounts of confiscated footage outside the five-frame Pentagon security tapes: Citgo and Doubletree. These tapes were publicly released years ago. There's a 4
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       alleged seizure from a "hotel near the Pentagon", which is speculated to be Sheraton, but this is unconfirmed. Even if tapes were seized from Sheraton, there's little chance it captures the impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the claimed "85 confiscated videotapes" were
       <em>
        voluntarily sent in
       </em>
       from private individuals to the FBI's field offices, and are privately held footage. Thus, in order to release them publicly, permission would need to be secured from the individual who owns that footage. The majority of the tapes sent in have no relation to the Pentagon crash at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the DoD nor the FBI ever claimed to have eighty-five tapes depicting a Boeing 757 crash into the Pentagon, if that's what you're referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 2004 FOIA request asked for footage depicting the crash of Flight 77. The agent who replied to the FOIA request determined that the FBI "was in possession of eighty-five videotapes
       <strong>
        related
       </strong>
       to 9/11". It then went on to categorize what was contained on 29 of the tapes she reviewed personally. (The other 56 cropped up in an initial database search and didn't even show the Pentagon building).
      </p>
      <p>
       16 of those 29 tapes showed the Pentagon, but
       <strong>
        "did not show the Pentagon crash site nor the impact into the Pentagon."
       </strong>
       Of the remaining 13 videos, 12 showed the Pentagon only
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the impact. That leaves just one tape: the parking lot footage. Which was released. 14 years ago. 
The other videos weren't released, because
       <strong>
        those did not fulfill the claimant's request.
       </strong>
       The person asked for footage of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, and the
       <strong>
        closest tapes to that request
       </strong>
       that the agent could find were the Doubletree and Citgo tapes (i.e. it captured when the impact happened, but not directly).
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the agent was simply itemizing the tapes she thought the FBI had, and excluded the ones which weren't relevant to the person's request.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow, no-planers read the quotation above, and got the idea that the FBI confiscated 85 tapes that showed clear footage of the impact. This is how the "confiscated tapes" claim got started: from a misreading of a reply to a FOIA request.
      </p>
      <p>
       In complying with the FOIA request, the FBI released the relevant footage it had. This is how we got the Doubletree and Citgo videos. Up until 2006 we only had the five-frame Pentagon video (which is the only tape the Pentagon has which clearly depicts the crash).

       I'd imagine that since the Pentagon is a national defense building, the government doesn't want to have footage of it getting bombed in circulation.

       The Doubletree Hotel and Citgo videos have all been publicly released years ago. Those videos were in fact released in response to the 2004 FOIA request. None of them show the impact, simply because it wasn't in the vantage point. The Department of Defense released the only footage it had of the impact, and it clearly shows a Boeing 757 once you account for the fish-eyes lens distortion, and compare with a 757 model.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no corroborated accounts of confiscated footage outside of Citgo, Doubletree and the parking lot tapes. We can thus dismiss your supposed "extra video tapes" as unsupported speculation. The claim that "85 videotapes" were confiscated is a distortion of an FBI agent's reply to the 2004 FOIA request.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a fourth alleged seizure of footage from "a hotel" near the Pentagon, which is either Sheraton (unconfirmed) or Doubletree. The FBI denied that the footage captured the attack, and this claim is consistent with the FBI agent's reply.
