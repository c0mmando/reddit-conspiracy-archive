        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A classic three letter agency coup failed because Erdogan had advance warning and used the people to shut it down. He busted the misinformation coming from compromised media by talking to his people through a phone. This really tells you how the tentacles of monster agencies can infiltrate every aspect of a nation. NBC even falsely reported Erdogan left Turkey and was seeking asylum in Germany on Twitter, why would they report this if Erdogan faked a coup himself? Instead what we see is a &quot;BBC WTC 7 building falling moment&quot; where  a pre seeded news feed anticipating the coup is broadcast to the masses, propaganda to fuel panic in Turkish people.
<a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2016/07/26/us-general-campbell-the-likely-nbc-news-source-in-its-scandalous-false-reporting-on-the-turkey-coup-attempt/">a not so well timed, very clever media bullshit, but the coup didn&#39;t happen!</a></p>

<p>But we got an inside look at how the machine operates. And how with some fore knowledge Erdogan used the people to thwart this vicious coup. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, yeah...  most governments have a list of dissidents ready for &quot;continuity of government&quot; in case of a coup attempt.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been expecting the coup for a while.  I could go back two years in my reddit comments and find myself predicting a gulenist/CIA led coup in Turkey.</p>

<p>I even suggested last year that the reason Erdogan took responsibility for shooting down the russian plane was that he didn&#39;t want to admit that the gulenists already had control in his military, because he wasn&#39;t ready to face an immediate coup.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most likely funding of ISIS and the downing of the russian plane(s) are by Ergenekon, a turkish deepstate operation with ties to the gulenists and a certain US intelligence agency. Erdogan had the choice to either take credit or admit that Ergenekon is running the military, and face a coup.</p>

Erdogan may be a cunt leader, what will happen to Turkey in his absence will be far worse. Millions of lives will be lost like in Syria. Three letter agency coups just produce bloodbaths.</p>

<p>This is clearly a shitty coup attempt to drive autocracy and justification for a &quot;democratic coup&quot; (you know the kind where NGO&#39;s sponsor &quot;grassroots&quot; opposition groups and everyone gets a flash text to protest in front of the capital- then some merc snipers start shooting protestors and throwing molatovs and all hell breaks loose, allowing a US/UN resolution to move in the &quot;peace-keepers&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have this completely backwards, this coup attempt was the good guys trying to wrestle their country back from the corporate U.S. government and it&#39;s Khazarian Mafia overlords. Erdogan is just another puppet placed by the KM so that they can control Turkey as a vassal state. Erdogan was like a scared rat flying around trying to seek asylum in Germany and a few other countries but was refused. </p>

<p>The coup would have succeeded if not for the intervention of the U.S. forces stationed in Turkey shooting the Turkish military helicopters out of the sky. Now you know why the U.S. keeps so many bases and military forces in other countries that it is &quot;allies&quot; with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a staged coup, from start to end, organized by Erdogan himself, a calculated power grab, the final step toward an Islamic theocracy. The purge was prepared in long before the &quot;coup&quot; happened, which conveniently didn&#39;t stand a chance in hell to succeed. It gave the perfect opportunity to take control over the media, military, air forces, fleet, judicial system, education and politics. More than 10.000&#39;s of people has been purged from their jobs, 1000&#39;s has already thrown into jail, it is all so very very convenient for Erdogan&#39;s future plans....</p>
