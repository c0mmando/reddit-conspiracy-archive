       I mean common, his writers are smart left-winged people, obviously trying to prevent Trump from becoming POTUS - they're aware that most political info in the 18-34 demographic is taken from their show (believe there are studies that show how these shows shape opinions on this demographic). I believe that journalism should be corageous, and neutrally expose TRUTH, and NOT choose the lesser evil (which im not even sure what it is). He is an incredibly powerful voice in the liberal media, known for its acid humor in the style of his Father Jon Stweart, but where are the balls??? He is in an extremely priveliged position, with an established loyal demographic, working with humorous analogies that make arguments seem much more persuasive - he could destroy Hillary Clinton and the DNC AS WELL as TRUMP for sure. Why perpetuate ignorance and succumb to the new age of media censorship by omission?

       ps: im not a bernie or bust millenial bro, i like bernie, but even he doesnt adress certain issues which i think are crucial to the US and the rest of the world.

       Do you think he knows this? Or does he live in some fantasy land where he thinks he actually some sort of muckraker? Some sort of modern Ida Tarbell? Now I tend to lean towards the latter, but I sometimes think with shills like Oliver who might just actually be stupid enough to believe the things they say. Does he realize his "analysis" (if we can call it that) is actually laughably wrong? This is an interesting phenomenon to ponder.

       The way I see it it's safer for the elite to use useful idiots.  Less people in the know the better.  I'm sure the performers realize there is some bullshittery going on but chalk it up to sponsors and the nature of the business.

       I've seen some good episodes of John Oliver, with real quality info, like the one about scientific studies; the problem with his show is that those good episodes create a following and a sense of trust on the public, and then the production team and writers slam you in the face with subtle political propaganda for Hillary and the rigged system. It's all about building trust in order to manipulate, because young educated liberal millenials are way harder to manipulate than other demos

       Yeah, I agree. Any good disinfo agent has to say something worthwhile or risk losing anyone with half a brain in his audience. But once you see their real purpose (pushing narratives and obfuscating facts), it's hard to go back. One of my favorite examples was John Oliver's smashing of Trump a few months ago. The Whole "Make Donald Drumpf again" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, some of it was truly funny and based on some fact... On the other, it was presented and accepted as some sort basis for a political opinion. It was just part of a smear campaign, really, but for weeks I heard people using Oliver's cleverly crafted monologue to justify all sorts of laterally related statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's really what those guys like Oliver and momdad Colbert/Stewart are there for: guiding the public to assumptions. I used to love those shows, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Sigh, disclaimer: Not a Trump fan.)

       What makes you think young liberals are more difficult to manipulate? As a former young liberal I was impressively easy to fool! All you have to do is have one of these shows with a seemingly funny host make fun of certain topics, make faces, call out Fox News (which of course makes it appear like they're on the side of truth, but in reality they're just on the side of less blatant corruption). That's Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Some quality joke writers and funny zingers, but on content it is pure propaganda with about 1/3 truth. The truth tends to be about republicans, which is easy bait because the things people like George Bush did are laughably corrupt. They're an easy target. But what about their favorite lady Hillary? They call her a robot but also say she is "the most qualified". Is being responsible for multiple wars and scores of deaths a qualification for president? In this case, she has qualification in spades!

       What a letdown this guy has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an old saying: Once you have a reputation as an early riser, you can start sleeping late. John Oliver won his rep early, now he's abusing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       HBO is a KEY propaganda organ, all the way back to their award-winning move about the McMartin case, which did more to turn the tide against the growing awareness of pedophilia in the country than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while, you start to notice the connections among these people, the small ring of intertwined....Satanists? Luciferians? Freemasons? All of the above? John Oliver runs with a bunch of them, seems to me.

      <p>
       Colbert, Leibowitz, and Oliver, et. al. have created their shows on a purely dialectic model, and this is perhaps why they are so successful and why many people claim to get actual news and opinion from a comedy show.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Thesis: the liberal talking point
       </li>
       <li>
        Anti-thesis: Colbert’s character’s response to the liberal talking point
       </li>
       <li>
        Synthesis: Usually presented through a punchline, a dismissal by Colbert’s character, or from a “rational and intelligent” guest on the show.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The Hegelian dialectic model is perfect for introducing apparent problems into a person’s consciousness. Problems that don’t really affect them, that they have never thought before, and under normal circumstances would have little opinion either way. The Hegelian model allows these ideas to be injected into a person’s consciousness without them even realizing. It emphasizes the glaring import of the issue and conveniently provides you with a resolution in the form of synthesis before you had any chance to use your own rational thinking skills to devise a solution agreeable to you as an individual. Instead you are presented the prepackaged liberal idea and you will likely eat it up hook, line, and sinker because of the comical presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political “news” through comedy is a very refined and calculated form of propaganda.

       For you to think that the corporate propagandists in the media are Marxist is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the 1980s Unions have been almost completely busted, the government has been almost completely privatized, corporations literally write the laws that are meant to regulate them, wages have stagnated, the manufacturing sector has been destroyed due to "free trade" agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       To think that the powers that be are Marxist is mind boggling stupid. You think you are awoken but you are still peddling the elite's propaganda.

       Hey, guess what? Your buzzwords don’t mean you’re right. The Frankfurt School dictates education policy. Keynesianism (socialist) and the Federal Reserve dictate economic policy. The democrats (the LEFT wing) want no borders and no trade barriers (so… they’re fucking marxists) and the republicans (the LEFT wing, spelling is correct) offer no resistance thereto (so the neocons are fucking marxists).

       I don't even follow John Oliver as a news source, but I like to keep track of  the mainstream narrative these kind of shows produce. They shape youth's opinion, that's the simple truth, what im saying is why cant cant we ask for more? Is it wrong to expect a decent and credible mainstream source of information? It should be a human right, to really know what's going on. I guess it sounds pretty naïve ... Also, apparently comedians are not powerful voices in the media? and are not in previliged positions of public exposure?

       I had high hopes for Oliver's show after season 1. It's as if they let him cover topics that would piss a lot of powerful people off in the beginning, in order to gain the viewer's trust. He covered topics of corruption and injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that didn't last very long. Now it's just one anti-trump show after the other, all the while COMPLETELY ignoring any negative Hillary stories.

       Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert aren't much better. Remember when they had the Rally to Restore Sanity a few years back? I'll let Chris Hedges sum it up:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The American left is a phantom. It is conjured up by the right wing to tag Barack Obama as a socialist and used by the liberal class to justify its complacency and lethargy. It diverts attention from corporate power. It perpetuates the myth of a democratic system that is influenced by the votes of citizens, political platforms and the work of legislators. It keeps the world neatly divided into a left and a right. The phantom left functions as a convenient scapegoat. The right wing blames it for moral degeneration and fiscal chaos. The liberal class uses it to call for “moderation.” And while we waste our time talking nonsense, the engines of corporate power—masked, ruthless and unexamined—happily devour the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        The loss of a radical left in American politics has been catastrophic. The left once harbored militant anarchist and communist labor unions, an independent, alternative press, social movements and politicians not tethered to corporate benefactors. But its disappearance, the result of long witch hunts for communists, post-industrialization and the silencing of those who did not sign on for the utopian vision of globalization, means that there is no counterforce to halt our slide into corporate neofeudalism. This harsh reality, however, is not palatable. So the corporations that control mass communications conjure up the phantom of a left. They blame the phantom for our debacle. And they get us to speak in absurdities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The phantom left took a central role on the mall this weekend in Washington. It had performed admirably for Glenn Beck, who used it in his own rally as a lightning rod to instill anger and fear. And the phantom left proved equally useful for the comics Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who spoke to the crowd wearing red-white-and-blue costumes. The two comics evoked the phantom left, as the liberal class always does, in defense of moderation, which might better be described as apathy. If the right wing is crazy and if the left wing is crazy, the argument goes, then we moderates will be reasonable. We will be nice. Exxon and Goldman Sachs, along with predatory banks and the arms industry, may be ripping the guts out of the country, our rights—including habeas corpus—may have been revoked, but don’t get mad. Don’t be shrill. Don’t be like the crazies on the left.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Why would you work with Marxists actively subverting our Constitution or racists and homophobes who see no one’s humanity but their own?” Stewart asked. “We hear every damn day about how fragile our country is—on the brink of catastrophe—torn by polarizing hate, and how it’s a shame that we can’t work together to get things done. But the truth is we do. We work together to get things done every damn day. The only place we don’t is here [in Washington] or on cable TV.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The rally delivered a political message devoid of reality or content. The corruption of electoral politics by corporate funds and lobbyists, the naive belief that we can somehow vote ourselves back to democracy, was ignored for emotional catharsis. The right hates. The liberals laugh. And the country is taken hostage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rally to Restore Sanity, held in Washington’s National Mall, was yet another sad footnote to the death of the liberal class. It was as innocuous as a Boy Scout jamboree. It ridiculed followers of the tea party without acknowledging that the pain and suffering expressed by many who support the movement are not only real but legitimate. It made fun of the buffoons who are rising up out of moral swamps to take over the Republican Party without accepting that their supporters were sold out by a liberal class, and especially a Democratic Party, which turned its back on the working class for corporate money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fox News’ Beck and his allies on the far right can use hatred as a mobilizing force because there are tens of millions of Americans who have very good reason to hate. They have been betrayed by the elite who run the corporate state, by the two main political parties and by the liberal apologists, including those given public platforms on television, who keep counseling moderation as jobs disappear, wages drop and unemployment insurance runs out. As long as the liberal class speaks in the dead voice of moderation it will continue to fuel the right-wing backlash. Only when it appropriates this rage as its own, only when it stands up to established systems of power, including the Democratic Party, will we have any hope of holding off the lunatic fringe of the Republican Party

       Colbert was perhaps the biggest let down.  I have the idea that Jon Stewart is not really as smart as he thinks he is.  Colbert certainly is, but I suspect he's a cryptojesuit clown person who basically betrayed everyone when he sold out with his main stream show.  It's not funny, he's no longer funny, he tried to 'bring back' his colbert-iness into the new format and it's a totalfail and he looks like a retard fraud bobble head that only stupid people with bad jobs that keep them up late would watch (security guards for exampe)
      </p>
      <p>
       Stewart basically committed harakiri on air when he threw down on 9/11 truth movement.  He died and became super unfunny after that, and you know everyone noticed.  I think on some level he did too.  It's probably because he knows deep down that his whole life became a lie in that moment--that they forced him to lose all integrity in that moment.  And he lost his fire and his funny and then dredged along for the next year and a half until his true friends told him to step the fuck down before he makes more of a mockery of himself, which he certainly was starting to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then some weird black guy from south africa took over--who the fuck is this shithead?  Oh well, there's the end of the daily show.  No I won't even give that unfunny PC fuckshit a chance.  It was oliver or no one.  Then oliver got his show and killed it with the TRUMP vs POPE puff piece segment, revealing himself to be some kind of cryptoanglican (ie: jesuit) wanker as well

       I totally agree with you about Colbert. Colbert is far more talented than Stewart ever was. Back during the Bush admin, Colbert would sometimes speak truth to power. Now? He's just another Democratic party shill. He's also just not funny anymore. His parody of Bill O'Reilly was pure genius, but shilling for Hillary Clinton just isn't funny. He's morphed into yet another liberal Democrat talking head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stewart? He was never funny, he just had some good writers and Bush was so absurd it was easy to make fun of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stewart's attacks on the 9/11 families was disgusting - that's why he is always pretending to give a shit about the first responders now. But - come on - Stewart (real name: Liebowitz) is a Jew and he's just covering up for Israeli complicity in 9/11. It's expected that he would do that. Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Colbert - he's one of us and he sold us out. Too bad.

       As a moderator of Aryanskynet, your post makes so much more sense now. And just think, you go about calling people Nazis, when you are a white supremacist.  Go deal with yourself.

       Look, if you are going to moderate a white supremacist sub (r/aryanskynet) and take part in this white nationalist BS at least own up to it and stop being a little pussy. Someone just has to take a brief look at your comment history to see that you are a Trump supporting white supremacist.  Also, you keep avoiding the fact that you are a MOD for R/ARYANSKYNET.  Maybe if you left Utah County once in a while you wouldnt be so afraid of other cultures.  Did you not get to go on a mission or something?  Stop being a little bitch and at least own up to your racist views instead of hiding behind the perceived cloak of anonymity that is reddit.

      <p>
       Hate to break this to you, but mormonism is not an ethnicity, its a cult.
I just browsed your history, you are completely insane. Nearly every post is calling someone racist, making sarcastic remarks about "brown privalege", "white privalege", etc.  You clearly have some serious issues that you need to get out.  I seriously hope you can get help because you are a damaged human being who is deeply hurting. You are in denial about being a mod for r/aryanskynet, which is scary enough in itself, you cant even talk about it, you pretend it doesnt exist.  You are a white nationalist, which is basically just a more "PC" term for white supremacist clan member.  You need to get help. Talk to a family member, someone in your ward, something.  Just get help, please.

       Agav - stop projecting your hate onto other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are literally just making up shit now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You assumed I was a Mormon, was "afraid of other cultures" and that I had never even left Utah (even though I've never even lived there.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you even capable of enough introspection to realize that the HATE is coming from YOU - and no one else?

       Are there any satirical news personalities that don't show a leftist (or right wing) bias? I mean, I know there's a little bias in everyone, and that you really can't remove it completely, but I feel like everyone is riding the "trump-hate train" and ignoring what the DNC or democrats have done. It's becoming low hanging jokes and not the traditional blend of humour and substance.

       John Oliver has always been a parrot for MSM ideologies, for anything controversial.  He's admitted he's just a parrot for writers.  He doesn't profess his view like Jon Stewart.  He's more like Colbert, but even Colbert reveals his true position from time to time.

       It shouldn't have anything to do with being on the "left" or "right". It should only be about the truth vs. fiction.  That's all that really matters in the end. The left vs. right narratives do nothing besides help the elites push their divide and conquer agenda to keep the masses distracted from the real problem: the elites themselves.

       For John oliver at his best and for what could have been I recommend checking out archive episodes of his podcast The Bugle. It was very funny and very biting.

       I'd say I don't know what happened to John, but I do know. They got to him somehow.

       I love this kind of thing. Liberals have been assured they were on the side of truth, and justice for years. The media was all to happy to smugly insure them of this. Only now with the small civil war the Bernie/Hillary thing caused are any of them seeing the truth. From a right leaning person's perspective Stewart/Oliver/Colbert have always been Left wing establishment shills. Watch them shill for Clinton, and ignore your hero. Watch every MSM news channel do this to. They are mostly owned by the same people anyway.

       A true test of a comedian is to see if he/she can make fun of politicians on the Left just as well as making fun of politicians on the Right.  If not, then their comedic skills are limited.

       Yeah, I agree. Any good disinfo agent has to say something worthwhile or risk losing anyone with half a brain in his audience. But once you see their real purpose (pushing narratives and obfuscating facts), it's hard to go back. One of my favorite examples was John Oliver's smashing of Trump a few months ago. The Whole "Make Donald Drumpf again" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, some of it was truly funny and based on some fact... On the other, it was presented and accepted as some sort basis for a political opinion. It was just part of a smear campaign, really, but for weeks I heard people using Oliver's cleverly crafted monologue to justify all sorts of laterally related statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's really what those guys like Oliver and momdad Colbert/Stewart are there for: guiding the public to assumptions. I used to love those shows, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Sigh, disclaimer: Not a Trump fan.)

       What makes you think young liberals are more difficult to manipulate? As a former young liberal I was impressively easy to fool! All you have to do is have one of these shows with a seemingly funny host make fun of certain topics, make faces, call out Fox News (which of course makes it appear like they're on the side of truth, but in reality they're just on the side of less blatant corruption). That's Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Some quality joke writers and funny zingers, but on content it is pure propaganda with about 1/3 truth. The truth tends to be about republicans, which is easy bait because the things people like George Bush did are laughably corrupt. They're an easy target. But what about their favorite lady Hillary? They call her a robot but also say she is "the most qualified". Is being responsible for multiple wars and scores of deaths a qualification for president? In this case, she has qualification in spades!

       Look, if you are going to moderate a white supremacist sub (r/aryanskynet) and take part in this white nationalist BS at least own up to it and stop being a little pussy. Someone just has to take a brief look at your comment history to see that you are a Trump supporting white supremacist.  Also, you keep avoiding the fact that you are a MOD for R/ARYANSKYNET.  Maybe if you left Utah County once in a while you wouldnt be so afraid of other cultures.  Did you not get to go on a mission or something?  Stop being a little bitch and at least own up to your racist views instead of hiding behind the perceived cloak of anonymity that is reddit.

       Can you pls quote me on "lashing out at European and blonde people"? Serious, copy and paste where I did that. Also, you STILL are skating the fact that you are a mod for r/aryanskynet. Unbelievable. It's like you think we are in a crowd of your mormon buddies and you think repeating my words is a strategy that works. It's one thing to be a racist, at least own it. How do you live with yourself? Such a coward.
