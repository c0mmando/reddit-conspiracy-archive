I&#39;m a dutch 16 year old who is interested in American politics. Today I had a discussion with my friends about Hillary vs Trump ( as all foreign 16 year olds do ). It was clear that they all wanted to vote for Hillary, because Trump is such a rapist, racist etc etc. Now my question for you guys out there is: see title.<br/>
And I&#39;m posting this on /conspiracy, because I know that the most of you will cut the crap and go straight to the point.</p>

<p>PS: Sorry for the bad layout!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my summed up (moderately educated) trying-to-be-objective opinion:</p>

<p>Trump</p>

<ul>
<li>Business experience (maybe can handle lobbys and megacorps from a biz-perspective)</li>
<li>Focus on domestic issues, somewhat of a ring wing populist</li>
<li>Lukewarm approach to Russia and not fond of the ME wars</li>
<li>Politically a huge risk because nobody can predict him</li>
</ul>

<p>Clinton</p>

<ul>
<li>Corrupt to the core, corporation funded, owes favours in return (that&#39;s why they want her in the WH)</li>
<li>Experienced career politician (in some way, a positive, takes a thief to succeed amongst thieves)</li>
<li>Already been involved in the ME wars, and has already approved of the invasion of Iran and Syria (which Israel mainly campaigns for, claiming they are a nuclear threat to world peace while Mossad, the CIA and the KGB confirm that that&#39;s bs)</li>
<li>Politically not a risk because her stance is very clear. She&#39;ll just do what megacorps and lobbies paid her to do </li>
</ul>

<p>You can probably tell I&#39;m pro Trump. Although I&#39;m not a fan of Trump I favour him based entirely on the fact that Hillary Clinton is completely owned, lies to her voters, and acts entirely on the interests of her owners. She&#39;s had people assassinated, has geopardized US security, and is IMO an absolute embarassment to the idea of democracy. The fact that she presents herself as the progressive libertarian potential first female president, is just adding insult to injury. Trump hasn&#39;t killed a single human being with his bigoted populist talk. Clinton must have killed millions through her decisions as SoS under Obama.</p>

<p>Lastly I&#39;d like to add that I 100% agree with everyone who says it doesn&#39;t matter who enters the WH. The decisionmakers aren&#39;t up for election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who say Trump is an idiot or that his presidency would be a disaster are not paying attention. The man is extremely smart, perceptive, and intuitive. The biggest reason to fear Trump is that he is so successful at getting what he wants. He threatens the establishment with saying he will stop the globalization of the U.S.. He intends to curb illegal immigration thus stopping the intentional dilution of the voting population.</p>

<p>Clinton is just straight up corrupt. She works with the CIA to launder money and weapons across the world. She skims and takes bribes via the Clinton Foundation. She is a proven liar and intentionally left US personnel to die in Libya. She set up a private email server in violation of the law in order to circumvent the Freedom Of Information Act. The biggest reason to fear Hillary is she is a core part of the visible shadow government, always gets what she wants, and has never been held accountable for the fraud, murder, and corruption that she so wantonly perpetrates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might as well.</p>

<p>Might as well vote for Spider-Man or John Wayne.</p>

<p>The only reason the public is given this &quot;choice&quot; is that <em>it does not matter.</em></p>

<p>All decisions of substance are made behind the scenes by people nobody voted for. They do not encourage the public to discuss them. In fact, they expend a great deal of effort to prevent the public from even becoming aware of them.</p>

<p>These elections are like that. They are a distraction designed to waste people&#39;s time and energy while giving them the false impression that they are accomplishing something.</p>

<p>Any &quot;political issue&quot; that gets a lot of play in the news media is like that. A waste of time. Decisions that matter, policies that are really important, these aren&#39;t left to chance or the vagaries of public opinion.</p>

<p>This has never been clearer than in the current Presidential &quot;race.&quot;</p>

<p>Here we have two despicable candidates. There&#39;s no way to pick one over the other on moral, ethical, or practical grounds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought about voting for Trump just because I think he&#39;s so bad at politics that Congress might block him at every turn and never let him get his way. Hillary is an establishment creature and probably knows how to schmooze Congress and get her way. That&#39;s scary. We want a President who is lame and paralyzed.</p>

<p>Just when I think this is a good answer, Trump says something even more horrible than the last thing he said, and I&#39;m thrown into doubt once more.</p>

<p>Thank God this choice doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton is a Cuttlefish flashing colors to match the background. There is no truth in her. When we try, she or her handlers, spray black ink to darken the water, then scuttles across the seabed looking for opportunities to feed for its own benefit.</p>

<p>Trump is a shark, a great big lovable shark who will bite the heads off the smaller sharks. Sad but Trump shark will be consumed by the biggest, coldest, oldest monsters of the deep (the Oligarchs, Rothschild, Zionists) who will rise up, conspire because they must, and bite off his fins first then gut him. Sad too, because he was the last best hope against the globalist eugenics, great cull, sociopathic freaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At last week&#39;s Democratic Convention, Hillary <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/694920/Clinton-vows-to-step-into-Syria-war-if-she-wins-the-race-for-US-president">promised to re-activate the war in Syria, with the objective of removing President Assad</a>. Irrespective of your feelings about Assad, he is backed by Russia, and they will not let the US depose him without a fight. This means Hillary has essentially said she will start the ball rolling on WW3. What has Trump said that comes anywhere near that level of psychopathy?</p>
