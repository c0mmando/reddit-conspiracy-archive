       A Canadian intellectual,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">
        Marshall McLuhan
       </a>
       , once said of television,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">
        "the medium is the message"
       </a>
       .  I've been trying to decipher that
       <em>
        koan
       </em>
       for over a decade.  One can say many things about it, but what McLuhan intended to say--based on his own elaboration of this phrase--is that the platform itself--the very idea of television as a means of communication, irrespective of content--would change society in ways we can't even imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that because we are seated, staring at a box, means we have to be somewhere a box is located: meaning inside a dwelling.  Which then precludes the idea of a dynamic public setting, and human movement or noise generally.  A situation which then entrains people into being silent, still and staring; rather than turning to our fellow human and dialoguing with them.  And because the television was a broadcast technology owned and controlled by a cadre of corporations
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">
        working directly with the government
       </a>
       , society would be then shaped by national directives through programming, and steered into specific forms of consumer behaviors by advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       In retrospect, these concepts are not much of a revelation.  But in McLuhan's time, this was something that induced many hundreds of hours of public discourse and rumination.  Some people figured it out right away, and became book readers, eschewing the television.  Others fell into the trap of 80s television sitcom culture, the decade within which "TV as Craft" (cheers, miami vice, a-team), "TV as Art" (MTV) and "TV as Mind Control" (NBC News, MTV) was ultimately perfected (

       While television was first being developed commercially, Nazi scientists we imported into our intelligence research community via
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">
        Operation Paperclip

       had us compromise our collective ethics by

        sexually-torturing women and drug-torturing soldiers
       </a>
       in projects Artichoke and MKULTRA.  We did this ostensibly in order to compete with the Russians, who were developing psychotronic / directed energy weaponry.  Psychotronics didn't quite work out (or at least no evidence for it--like 'remote viewing' / staring at goats, for example), and so we did this because the US military intelligence is and has always been a

       , rivaling perhaps this author.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the faux-competition was simply the cover story for doing a type of research that would be "extremely unethical otherwise"  (in quotes because no, it WAS unethical regardless), but highly profitable, in order to maintain global dominance for their corporate masters?  I think by now, post 9/11, we know the true motive of those driving it, but we understand the reasoning of those fooled into giving consent for such morally repugnant programs.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoscine_hydrobromide">

       .  The symptoms of this type of mind control mimic many of the patsies involved in assassinations in the 60-current, including even aurora colorado james holmes mass shooting--all the patsies have the same bewildered, dissociated partial amnesia, the hallmark of scopolamine--a drug used in

       We found that LSD largely didn't work (it just fried them), or worked only in small doses.  We also learned that torture works and they can create alters that are robot sex people or assassins depending on their programming.  They achieved these ends using

       Although we discovered through unethical research many forms of mind control, the Intelligence community's biggest revelation is that that the
       <em>
        psychic driving
       </em>
       or 'playing films over and over' was the
       <em>
        killer app
       </em>
       of mind kontrol.  So when television was beginning to be adopted in households in the late 50s-early 60s, the MIC knew they could transfer their kontrol to this new medium as propaganda.  For social control, in terms of both a cost-benefit-analysis and ease of deployment, there was no contest as to whether the television platform was the best technology.

      <p>
       Why do people believe what comes over the box more than other people?  What gives the box it's authority over the primacy of experience or that of people you know very well?  Maybe it is because we now know these

        factuality
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        quality
       </em>
       of received messaging.  In other words, as a bystander, one simply accepts what is given at face-value, inhibiting a mindset of 'self-starting', 'fact checking', "critical thinking" and discerning evaluation of what is received.  In fact, EEG scans of people have shown that the television induces a state of mind akin to

       So the MIC doesn't need to chip you, hit you with ELF/LFO or microwaves, zap you with bipverts, or send babylon matrix reality waves from the moon rebroadcast from Saturn (lookin' at you David Icke).

       These memes are reinforced obliquely in advertisements or in music videos; or in hidden in symbols that mock your sensibilities and make you feel bad; while reinforcing the idea that you get to be a 'part of it' if you buy their stuff.   They call this identitity marketing.  Now if you don't play into it and buy their stuff, then you're not only a bad person, you're not a person at all.

       The torturing people with drugs like lsd, scopolamine, boiling water and pain, and video and repeating things to them like "you killed your mother" half a million times in their ear until they dissociate, becoming a robot alter that will do a handler's bidding---that's only an ancillary, albeit politically-useful byproduct of such nefarious research undertakings.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you see you can't develop that easily, or deploy those forms of mind control easily. And there's huge risks of being caught, which could potentially do more damage to public opinion than simply waiting the extra time for messages to trickle in by the osmotic glare of entertainment. It's scope is limited and its cost is astronomical given the expertise, facility, time, etc.

       So it's cheaper for them to just turn a few M dollars into a 24 like series and have the attractive and charismatic keifer southerland insert jingoistic military worship culture into your brain. Considering the scope and scale, it entrains many more people so the effects on society are wider if not immediately quantifiable with precision.

       Because a friend wouldn't create a fake persona on facebook, and then say bad things to you; or shit on your ideas publicly; or say bad things about you behind your back to influence others to dislike you and thereby discredit you.  That's kind of the opposite of what a friend does.

       People spend a lot of time on Netflix and Youtube.  In fact, Netflix is most of the traffic in n america.  That says something.  It says that whereas we may gobble on reddit or FB or Twitter, we are still talking about these shows.  Their messaging still seeps in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also means however, that alternative media is extremely powerful.  Corbett Report for example is very powerful.  His 911 a conspiracy theory video is his most popular, and for a reason. It's because it lays down the facts in a clever way that puts the absurdity of the official narrative on it's head.  Think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been trying to convince people with facts, and books, and internet comments, when someone can watch a video and then have their worldview completely undone by--what is it?  5 minutes of Corbett's time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to plug Corbett so much.  I am actually kind of mad at him, because frankly he snubbed me over questions on help for making a video of my own, couldn't even get a 'no' and not sure why not.  But I think we're in the same side of this battle, so I am going to be a grown up about it and continue to endorse his stuff because it's excellent.

       I think your potty mouth expresses my same sentiment and expands on the seriousness necessary to comprehend these topics. Without colorful language we are left with a sanitized version which lacks authenticity. Do I even need to tell you again just how grateful I am for your commitment to our challenge? I love you!

       Psychologist here. Yes, lots of mind control through TV. They change culture with the TV. For example, they used it in a way to make you look like a loser if your poor. They also use it to keep people hostile towards others. Lots of stuff.

       Just out of curiousity, did you happen to read the thing I wrote about
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3xbn3c/socal_psychology_reveals_some_disturbing_traits/">
        abusive social psychology
       </a>
       ?  I'd really like some input, additions/corrections to that list.  Someone mentioned bystander effect to add to it.  I kind of want to update it with very specific examples of how each is used in the media, as part of a larger work on anti-911 propaganda I started for AE911Truth earlier this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       When working on that doc, I found that the spooks / media had pulled out every single trick in the book to use to discredit 911 questioners.  I thought it was gross.  And wanted to expose this as part of a 'deprogramming' series

       Try the book out on google via free PDF. That sucker sold 40 million copies across 25 languages. Its in basic language and the advise inside can be experimented with to see if it works. I continue to experiment and my life is ten-fold easier now. I believe I have achieved happiness, security, peace, and all the good stuff. I have nothing to gain from you reading it except your happiness which I value.

       They are trolling you.  It happens daily.  They come in like a seagull and poop on you and fly away, unless you engage them.  Then they continue to troll you, wasting your time and making you angry because then it might shut you down, scare you, bully you into leaving or being silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing they do is "doubt".  They just keep finding one thing about your response and pile more "doubt".  This is called 'consensus cracking' and it's the most popular tool of forum spies.

       But you see, it's against the rules of Reddit to give personal info, and therefore your'e not supposed to know who this person is, so you don't know their occupation, so you take them admitting their occupation at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think debating them on their job adds to ANY conversation on reddit to spread discord and doubt, then you're bad at redditing and we wish you'd leave immediately
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe you can fuck around on voat or something.  harass them there please

       Well to use some basic psychology, your syntax, choice of words and spelling errors don't indicate you have received a higher education.

       You speak to the need of a strong new media network of some kind, consisting of primarily video but also articles to help people deprogram and spread truth. Is that a hopeless effort in futility just begging for disinformation? Surely there is a faster way to spread these important messages than just sharing Corbett videos. Wish I knew the answer.

       Primarily a field intelligence-gathering unit specializing in special reconnaissance behind enemy lines, Sayeret Matkal is also tasked with counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and foreign espionage. Modeled after the British Army's Special Air Service—from which it emulated the motto, "Who Dares, Wins"—the unit is considered to be the Israeli equivalent to the Delta Force of the United States Army and to the SAS.[1]

       As one of Israel's most elite commando units, Sayeret Matkal has reputedly been involved in almost every major counter-terrorism operation since its inception in 1957.[2]
