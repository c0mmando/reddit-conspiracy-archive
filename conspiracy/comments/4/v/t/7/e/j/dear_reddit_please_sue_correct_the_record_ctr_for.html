        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>We want answers &amp; transparency.</h1>

<p>It&#39;s getting harder and harder to trust Reddit comments and submitted posts... which is pretty much all Reddit is. CTR hurting Reddit&#39;s brand image makes users&#39; experiences much less engaging, and is why I am requesting Reddit to sue CTR in civil court for tortious interference.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/">Reddit&#39;s Content Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement/">User Agreement</a> you are not allowed to participate in vote manipulation.</p>

<p>Some examples of <a href="https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205192985">vote manipulation</a> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase or decrease vote scores.</li>
<li>Asking people to vote up or down certain posts, either on Reddit itself or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.</li>
<li>Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user&#39;s posts, posts from a domain, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CTR-type shilling allows one person to control their employees&#39; votes (who manage multiple accounts) -- clearly going against Reddit&#39;s TOS.</strong></p>

<h1><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference">Tortious Interference</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Tortious interference with contract rights can occur where the tortfeasor convinces a party to breach the contract against the plaintiff, or where the tortfeasor disrupts the ability of one party to perform his obligations under the contract, thereby preventing the plaintiff from receiving the performance promised. The classic example of this tort occurs when one party induces another party to breach a contract with a third party, in circumstances where the first party has no privilege to act as it does and acts with knowledge of the existence of the contract. Such conduct is termed tortious inducement of breach of contract.</p>

<p>Tortious interference with business relationships occurs where the tortfeasor acts to prevent the plaintiff from successfully establishing or maintaining business relationships. This tort may occur when a first party&#39;s conduct intentionally causes a second party not to enter into a business relationship with a third party that otherwise would probably have occurred. Such conduct is termed tortious interference with prospective business relations, expectations, or advantage or with prospective economic advantage.</p>

<p>In either of the above situations, the tortfeasor&#39;s conduct typically is intentional. There have been assertions that there is no cause of action for merely negligent interference with the performance of a contract or with prospective business advantage.[1] That statement is incorrect, however, for some jurisdictions recognize such claims[2] although many do not.[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the lawsuit is filed and after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)">discovery</a>, Reddit should have the ammo it needs to move forward.</p>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>Whether or not you agree with what CTR&#39;s message doesn&#39;t matter. CTR &amp; other shill groups undermine the sanctity of our votes and comments, and therefore our voice. Reddit must address this issue, as silence here seems to suggest complicit agreements between CTR &amp; Reddit. Digg proved that anonymous social networks like this come and go. I like Reddit, but I think we can all agree parts of this site are going downhill quite fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to fix this problem is to break reddit.  Sometimes to save a thing, you have to destroy it.</p>

<p>Trump should invest some of his money and make a bot army of 10 billion bots to overwhelm reddit and make it totally unusable.  And he shouldnt send the bots to just politically themed subreddits either. He should send them to every subreddit that has more than 10k users.</p>

<p>When complaints are raised about it he just has to say &quot;What? I thought that&#39;s how this game was played. I payed reddit money. Is my money not as good as Clintons?&quot;</p>

<p>The one thing reddit likes more than its leftist ideology is money (ironic huh?). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking to a bunch of stupid, brainwashed whiney babies who don&#39;t understand how websites work, much less how anything works, and that they&#39;re nothing more than a website traffic statistic. They won&#39;t get it, ever. They&#39;re just going to continue bitching about life, how they matter because corporations are BRAINWASHING them to make a sale or get them to be active on their website to increase its value. </p>

<p>Seriously, all they do is just re-post the same shit - EWW a politician did something evil. No fucking shit! THEY ARE POLITICIANS! Or they talk about how corporations don&#39;t give a shit about them! Again, NO FUCKING SHIT! For fuck&#39;s sake! I&#39;d be surprised if any of them had a brain cell. They sure as hell can&#39;t think critically. I&#39;m actually legitimately surprised that they can even operate a keyboard much less tie their shoes or dress themselves. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re dissatisfied, build a better website! This website isn&#39;t exactly built well. The only thing keeping it going is the dumbfucks who keep whining all day about how much Reddit sucks and refuse to just go to another website. You people just go on and on and on IN FUCKING CIRCLES! Christ even a chimp has more fucking brains. </p>

<p>ATTN DUMB FUCKS: IF YOU DON&#39;T LIKE IT, LEAVE! NO ONE WILL BLAME YOU! IN FACT, SOME OF US WANT YOU TO JUST LEAVE ALREADY AND STOP BITCHING ABOUT RETARDED SHIT! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, for a bunch of people that are anti-US-government, they sure as hell depend on it for a lot. Insanity!  </p>

<p>And what&#39;s even more insane is they think governments in general care what they think. I swear people are getting dumber and dumber. </p>

<p>One reason I like Reddit is, and it&#39;s very unfortunate, that it gives a good representation of the population. And yes people are in fact as insane, ignorant and hopeless as the typical Redditor. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like something, just don&#39;t use it. If you dislike government, stop depending on it to change. Just find other solutions. Maybe learn to be self-sufficient. As for websites, design your own social networking website and compete against Reddit or just give other social networking websites a try. </p>
