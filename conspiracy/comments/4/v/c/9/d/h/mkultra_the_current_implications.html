       This was just brought up to me, actually in a pretty heated discussion, I was pleasantly surprised to read such a poignant point with someone I've chosen to debate.

       If you aren't aware that the War on Terror is a fabrication, read the following books:

        Terror Factory: The FBI's Manufactured War on Terror
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then get acquainted with Hero
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._O%27Neill">
        John O'Neil
       </a>
       , he was the NY Counter Terror Chief - The arch nemesis to Bin Laden (world's foremost expert) and he also damn near solved the USS Cole Bombing, which brought him to Yemen, but
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/911-the-mysterious-death-of-john-oneill-fbi-counterterror-chief-in-charge-of-the-osama-bin-laden-investigation/5400606">
        while there the Ambassador tried kicking him out while Mossad was sending assassination squads after him
       </a>
       . No, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to that John O'Neil had arrested the Blind Sheikh, the one responsible for the 1st WTC Attack/Bombing.
       <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/thomas-campbell/search-for-a-black-goddessmemoir-of-a-gang-member/paperback/product-14959989.html">
        In memoirs, a criminal who was connected with Sheikh
       </a>
       stated the Sheikh had put hits out on O'Neil by sending messages through his lawyer, in code, to "sue" him. And that
       <em>
        the Sheikh was cheering when 9/11 fell, stating that O'Neil was there and he'd be dead finally.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       O'Neil
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       counterterrorism. While the CIA was funding and aiding Al-Q in the US, and OBL's body guard and head of security was working for CIA &amp; the FBI, O'Neil was the only person actually fighting the "NGO". He went to Yemen to get evidence from the Cole, so they could bring down OBL with it. O'Neil was a problem because he always did his job. In Yemen,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2cx0dh/uss_cole_air_force_captain_daphne_jackson_charged/">
        he linked the USS Cole attack to Abu Nidal, a Mossad intelligence asset.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He'd come home from Yemen after repeated attempts on his life. He was then essentially forced out of his 30 year career in the FBI, but offered a consolation prize to make it easier.
       <strong>
        A head security posting at the World Trade Center in NY
       </strong>
       - Two weeks before 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind any of the conspiracies that float around, the fact that key witnesses and actors were directly aligned and working together with CIA and FBI, while the "Base" was soliciting funds across the US, and even after major attacks, the only guy trying to stop them was thwarted,
       <em>
        then essentially 'placed', or lured into,  the very next attack location
       </em>
       * right after he discovered a Mossad False Flag, it's too coincidental.

      </p>
      <p>
       There's another conspiracy I don't really want to get into, but just put it this way
       <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2015/10/finally-the-cia-admits-covering-up-jfk-assassination.html">
        the CIA finally admitted they covered up the JFK assassination
       </a>
       . Those responsible? McCone and Dulles. Allen Dulles, directly involved in PAPERCLIP, and  also signing off on MKULTRA.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, Dulles who helped cover up JFK (Also -not admitted but- ~80 people died in 10 years, a 100,000 Trillion to 1 chance), who carried on Nazi research. It's important because I think JFK and after is where the American people really separated from reality. They were being told this conspiracy didn't happen, and there were markers everywhere, giant red flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nope. Didn't happen. Sorry." ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Did you check under your bed for the evil commie pinkos?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Dulles and the murderous organization that was the CIA would set up the future. Lay the groundwork. Construct the foundation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so we know America has its head up its ass. We know that from allowing a president to be killed and told "shuttup" about it. We know because they stood by while the CIA was dumping cocaine/crack into Ghetto-LA (while funds went out through B.C.C.I. to fund other wars), while simultaneously (or close enough) banging the war drums for a 'War on Drugs'. Total - cognitive - dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cold War, during the end of WWII, to the 90s, had always been a political and social tool to attack, distort, prevent, block, disparage
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       one or
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       thing = Control. It was a means to any end. It vanished at the end of the 80s. Suddenly life was looking prosperous. There was a mild blip when Bush Sr invaded Iraq, but no one was feeling it. Clinton would come in, and blue sky is all anyone could see. This wasn't working though, as the control structures were breaking down. They needed something. They needed
       <em>
        "terror"
       </em>
       , and we got it with 9/11, and we got more with Iraq Part Deux.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's fast forward to Iraq II raging on, the "War" on Terror, etc. In one of those books they talked about how in foreign Mosques, half your efforts at finding 'radicals' were wasted, as most of the undercover agents found out they were grooming agents from other nations. That's right. There were so many damn under covers that they were trying to set up each other as 'terrorists'.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you explain the ghost planes, renditions, Guantanamo, torture, water-boarding, et al - in this manufactured reality? Torture provides shit results. Results they don't even need because they already know what's going on in terror-land (they made it). CIA agents themselves, 1 on Joe Rogan, and elsewhere, all admit torture ineffective, crap, useless, bad intel, doesn't work...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...so why use it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dun dun dun. Allen Dulles &gt; Operation PAPERCLIP &gt; Nazi Research &gt; Mind Control &gt; Manchurian Candidates &gt; Programmed Assassins &gt; Hiatus &gt; Breakdown of Cold War &gt; New Manufactured Enemy &gt; Manufacturing is dangerous - too close - too much entrapment &gt; BOOM
      </p>
      <p>
       = Another round of MKULTRA, this time, producing our future 'radicals'. Keep this in mind, and every time you hear about an attack, check to see if they spent any time in Guantanamo or any Black Site prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a few people kicking this idea around, but Im not sure how many have really put it through the grinder or confirmed it with supporting info. It's definitely worth looking into though.

       Addendum: For those who ask, "Is it even possible?"

      <p>
       Sirhan Sirhan was long thought to be a manchurian candidate or mind-programmed shooter. He was totally nuts, and he noted the bartender and others were doing weird shit the night of the action. Making hand gestures and signals at him, etc.
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/28/justice/california-rfk-second-gun/">

       <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article165721.html">
        Here's a link
       </a>
       . Essentially, it's impossible for Sirhan to have killed RFK because his gun only hand 12 rounds, and I think 13 were fired. Not only that, but the bullet that killed him was discharged at short range (1.5 Inches). Sirhan never got close enough. The only other person to fire a bullet was Thane Cesar, a security guard who had been working for Lockheed Martin, and previously at Hughes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cesar himself had worked at Lockheed and Hughes Aircraft... William Turner and Jonn Christian have produced a powerful case indicting Cesar for the crime. They concluded that Sirhan may have been firing blanks
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'll end it off saying that maybe it's all coincidence that the guy who likely did kill RFK, happened to work for an aerospace contractor. But then again, if you read Jim Marrs insight into the Marilyn Monroe murder,
       <a href="http://exopolitics.org/new-evidence-emerges-that-monroe-planned-to-reveal-jfk-saw-crashed-ufos/">

       <strong>
        Backstory
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's back history for those who aren't aware: After WWII, the Allies knew the German's had the best psych/science research around, they had been experimenting away with 'lesser' peoples, and launching V2 rockets, plus ringing
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Glocke">
        a Bell playing a Die Glocken jingles
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Allen Dulles, who was tied to German business and some wealthy families, personally involved himself in Operation PAPERCLIP, which brought over the best Nazi scientists &amp; their research. They became an intricate part of NASA, but beyond that Dulles also green lighted continued study into some of their
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       interests, like mind control, manchurian candidates, truth serums, programming and hypnotizing assassins, etc - This was all in
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
        MKULTRA
       </a>
       which also had various offshoots and sub projects, MKDELTA, MK54, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny enough the head of one of the sub projects was the head of the American and Canadian Psychiatric Association. This guy was fond of injecting so much LSD or using so much electric shock treatment, that patients thought he was their Dad after (And Tom Cruise is the nutty one refusing pharmaceuticals....Okay, yeah he's still bats hit insane but c'mon, he gets points deducted).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the crazier experiments involved poisoning an entire town with LSD. I think 7 people committed themselves and a couple dozen were committed. In any case, the only reason we know about it is Watergate. When that happen they ordered the destruction of all the records, somehow 20,000 got lost in the panic.

       You nailed it. It all comes down to trauma based conditioning, both for Americans and their enemies. Trauma enables control. Control is the objective. People get lost in the details of how this all plays out at ground level, but the overriding objective always remains the same: control. Not oil, not money, not guns... control. Those other things are just tools to get to the real objective. MKULTRA was a science of mass control. That is the world we live in. A world where powerful elites use behavioral control technologies to manipulate reality itself.

       Excellent work!  Interesting hypothesis about why they would be so into torture when everyone knows its intelligence-gathering utility is so low.  I wish I could say I didn't find it so plausible.

       I'm not entirely convinced it's happening, but I remember hearing about a few attacks that involved past Guantanamo prisoners. That really kicked it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the people who would be most likely to be 'agents' would be those who spent time in the black sites, rendition network, though idk how well documented they are.

       It's definitely a place or theme we should keep eyes on though. Thanks for the kind words.

       Anyone think there is any truth to the theory I've came across here and there over the years that within Guantanamo and other black site prisons they could be expanding on mk ultra? I read a gnarly thing about some drug they forced on prisoners called mefloquine or something, an anti-malarial and they gave them ludicrous doses and the side effects are reportedly dreadful and the half life is considerable. 
I've also read that malaria is not a threat around there either. Apparently the advised dose is 250 mgs but they gave arriving prisoners 1,250 mgs... combine that with the interrogations and everything it makes you wonder.

       I've long suspected Abu Zubaydah was subjected to "Voice of God" weapons.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2009, it was reported that Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded at least 83 times.
...He was able to withstand the waterboarding for quite some time. And by that I mean probably 30, 35 seconds...and a short time afterwards, in the next day or so, he told his interrogator that Allah had visited him in his cell during the night and told him to cooperate.

      </p>
      <p>
       So, the 83 waterboardings didn't get him to talk, but a late night conversation with "Allah" did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Army website described one of their Voice of God Weapons as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals. NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio subliminal messages. One application of V2K is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports.

       Do you have any links to past work, posting, stories, etc? This is basically what my OP is pushing at. I may not come out and say it exactly, but it is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what Im hinting at.

       Something seemed very off. I've read almost all the popular or 'must read' books on the topic of terrorism. None of them made sense overall, as an endgame, or larger picture. It's always very small groups controlling each other, intelligence agencies entrapping mentally challenged to turn them into 'terrorists' etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesnt make sense torture was needed, whatsoever. Now, if torture was being used for some other purpose. If they were re-establishing the MK projects, well, hold on. Suddenly there's a reason for it. Anything you got is a welcome addition. Thanks for adding to it. :)

       My father volunteered at Edgewood, and I believe they never quit. They just refined their methods. And they learned that none will really do a fucking thing about it. And it is hard to really point at anyone thing, but apparently the beta programming was a much bigger thing than ever suspected.

       Psionics works. Paperclips proved it.  Trauma based splitting of the psyche lets others take control and use you for their ends. With or without the use of electronics.
