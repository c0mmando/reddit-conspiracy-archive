       I was browsing reddit when I found a /bestof thread about the "white noise" devices that are just some Cisco AP. I was going to dismiss it, but then I saw several comments mocking this sub. I laugh at some of the comments because were funny, but I realized that those comments may be were designed to destroy this sub reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, you can find some really good threads here about real conspiracies, and this was the first place where I saw the Clinton Cash documentary. If you keep digging this sub, you'll find really good information about what is going on right now. This sub is now a threat to the Hillary campaign, and it has to be put under control immediately. Am I just too paranoid? Read this:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Media manipulation is real. How this YouTube video got so popular so quick? Do you know how hard it is to get viral without any money? We will see more threads against this sub, because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is now on their target list, and I strongly believe the DNC leaks was what triggered this. (It was the first place that covered it)

       The very term 'conspiracy theory' was weaponized by the government to discredit folks looking into discrepancies around the JFK assassination (CIA 1035-960).  It's meant to be immediately dismissive of the speaker without engaging with anything he/she puts forth, and has become an ad hominem attack.

       Its pretty much public knowledge that JFK was the victim of a conspiracy.  So the people won that battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today the conspiracies are confirmed within hours after being hatched, much to the chagrin of beloved leaders around the world. Take Erdogan, hes recognized as the biggest ass in the world after his fraudulent "coup", he can fire everyone and his ass will only get bigger.

       Please report suspected "trolls and shills" rather than "call them out". No one wants the sub to devolve into a giant name-calling rabble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that engaging with " trolls" is playing into their hands, and "calling out shills" is a slippery slope. They can just turn around and do the same if we didn't have a rule specifically against personal attacks. Just report anyone violating the subs rules. Use modmail if you want more hands-on feedback.

       Ya, this has been going on for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       How long ago was it that we realized we were in the bottom tier for subreddit and could never make the front page.

       Maybe the new algorithm changed things tho?

       It was a few years back? I know when I started going on here a lot, we were banned from r/all. I'm not too sure if things change because I've never been subscribed to that subreddit, but I do believe that it's almost impossible for us to get on r/all unless something huge happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO they are trying to make r/conspiracy a containment sub but that's my personal theory that might anger a few folks on here.

       Because they are all controlled.  I can't even post on TIL orAskreddit anymore without it being instantly autoremoved for a violation that didn't happen, everything I put to

        /r/funny

       You're definitely right about that. Any remotely popular sub is controlled and any alternate thought is stamped out. It gets to the point that I don't even care if we get on r/all or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the best things I did was unsubscribe to default subs and unnecessary meta subs like r/circlebroke or r/SubredditDrama. Now I mostly go on here, hobby subs like gardening, and survival stuff.

       Of course. There are a number of subreddits devoted to disparaging/discrediting
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - and there have been for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you start reading their "critiques" of this sub, you'll find that they rarely if ever offer any substantial challenges to the material posted here, rather, they are just circle-jerks of mockery on the level of a Middle School locker room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of the Mock Subs often use alt accounts to make shit-posts in this sub that are over-the-top racist or otherwise extremely offensive / ludicrous just so that they can make accusations about the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been several occasions where such users have been busted (or have outright admitted to) doing just that - including the former POWER MOD

       Just look at the #1 post on all from us right now. Don't get me wrong, I've been harping on and on to people about Soros' connections to BLM and Hillary for a while now - but he did not donate $25 mil to Hillary. He donated $25 mil to various super PAC's, some voter registration, some down ticket ones... It was more like $5 mil or less to Hillary. That is the kinda stuff that makes us look like idiots, and honestly, I'm starting to think that this sub is comprised of gullible racists, with all the "da jooz" comments along with the "racism is good" shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose I'll get called a shill for this. Trust me, I've tried to get paid to write shit on social media. Hasn't worked, and honestly if I couldn't just say
       <strong>
        my
       </strong>
       opinion I wouldn't do it.

       No, you actually see there's a concerted effort to push a political agenda. Look, it's not a coincidence HRC was investigated on Benghazi longer than 9/11 was. It's not a coincidence she's considered anti-Zionist and she is considered anti-Semite in Zionist media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also no coincidence she has had a dozen "hacks" and "leaks" against her. And that its all being pushed out non-stop on all alt-media, across reddit, in all conspiracy forums, everywhere. People think its a "cover up" it doesnt get picked up by MSM. Or that its 'corruption.' No, the real story is that MSM only reaches a few million these days, internet reaches
       <em>
        billions
       </em>
       , and online, the story is the fact the MSM isn't covering it, and HRC  = corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        When the Alt message becomes mainstream does that mean the mainstream message is alt?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is talking about Trump. His misdeeds, his crimes, his plans, policies, etc. If you mention one without the other, you end up pushing an agenda. Politics should really be banned from conspiracy websites. It started in 2004, got really bad in 2008 and hasn't eased up. I think '08 was the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the reality is, people keep talking like there's a big effort to suppress HRC-neg in the media. The traditional media only reaches tens of millions. Internet, news aggregators, forums, etc-reaches billions of page views. Trump is killing it right now by the shear scale of neg-HRC being pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what
       <em>
        Im a shill
       </em>
       because I mention it. It's so blatantly obvious though. 1-"Leaks" are all controlled information, and operations. 2-Benghazi was investigated more than 9/11 3-Bhengazi OPs were also against Bibi's wishes apparently (possibly why it happened) 4-HRC is hated by Zionists (even though they tell you she is working for them-she is forced into pro-Zion policy
       <em>
        everyone is
       </em>
       ) 5-Trump-tards are winning propaganda wars currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is even talking about Trumps connections to Zion, which are deep I might add. And I don't mean to make it entirely "the evil Zionists" (Ill also note, I do not mean Jews, big difference. In fact, HRC's advisor is called 'anti-semite' even though he's a Jew simply because he's anti-Zion.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion:
       </strong>
       to me it seems like Trump is actually the establishment favourite. Personally, I think
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       should vote. People should refuse to vote until you have enough people you can say the gov does not represent the people.
       <strong>
        Politics should also be banned from conspiracy forums.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since neither are going to happen, I am not advising anyone vote for HRC. But if anyone currently thinks voting for Trump is anything different than voting for Bush (or any other Zion puppet) or that they're "uncovering conspiracies" being fed co-opted, manipulated, controlled "leaked" from wiki~official~leaks, no. People are dumb. So dumb they can't see the most obvious manipulation going on.

       You aren't getting it, soon as you think better/worse, him/her, you've admitted defeat. There is no winning. The system is broken. The system needs to be turned over. The best you can do in the meantime is analyze the situation.

       Whether this was deliberate disinfo, or an error by a slightly excitable California Bernie delegate, I don't know. However, the way this played out was very typical of a disinfo story, because much of the reportage of this woman seemed to be accurate (the DNC did replace Bernie delegates with paid stooges). But there was one element that was provably false - the "white noise machine" was obviously a wifi transmitter - and this harms the credibility of the entire story. For want of a better term, I would call this a
       <strong>

       I definitely didn't intentionally spread any disinfo.  I was unaware of what kind of machine was being referred to in the video and was just spreading it because I honestly felt like the convention was being manipulated physically, visually, and auditorily for the viewing public.

       The odd part of those posts to me is that often seem to play into the very hand of Puppeteers. In one aspect, it plays into the control game through division. It also elevates the concern about who will be President. It's a concern I find frustratingly fictitious.

       No, I brought up the fact people think they found something in the emails. That they 'uncovered' something. It's hand fed information and they ignored everything else. It wasn't about Trump per se, it was about people ignoring the big picture.

       Eliminating politic BS would help her? No. It would hurt all politicians. Llimit conspiracy sites from being co-opted by political campaigns. There was a time when conspiracy sites had zero political discussion, unless it involved an actual conspiracy. The only conspiracy in politics right now is who is behind the hackings and why, but no ones talking about it. (also, likely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       Russia) However, if
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       topic becomes a headline story, move on, there must be a deeper conspiracy. Conspiracies are not headlines. All in all its what's missing from the emails. Not whats in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Everyone is just reposting headlines.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy forums (not just this one) just look like regular news aggregators during election season now.

       You think 20 threads all superficially bashing a candidate is adding substance to a forum based on conspiracies? Are you new? It's election season. It's literally the same thing as turning on CNN. It's worse actually because people here think they are discovering some kind of 'hidden knowledge' while being used as lab mice.

       Uh, no. That's what you are being told. Holy shit. SMH.

      <p>
       How old are you? The only reason any of you even give a s## about politics right now is because of the election. And if its in-between elections its because of a lobby group striking down a politician because they didn't give into demands. The political stuff being posted here and everywhere else is superficial bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 years ago no one researching these topics gave a flying f## about politics. When an actual conspiracy drums up, that's fine. It would get discussed. But the conspiracy in the current story is not whats in the emails, what is being 'hacked' or 'leaked' it's what's
       <em>
        missing from the emails
       </em>
       . How is everyone so blind to this?

       You can't eh? Until you can you are being manipulated and co-opted, and anything you discuss related to leaks is just BS meant to put a puppet into the White House.

       I dont' think it's a campaign.  For example, no one is paying me to post politics related, and I have posted several.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just do it because---surprise surprise--Hillary is one big conspiracy.  COG is a conspiracy, Comey's decision is a conspiracy.  Loretta lynch meeting with Bill is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's important to remove specifically these people from politics because they are dangerous people with weird partly unknowable loyalties that are in contravention of loyalty to the people of the US.  We don't want someone with mixed loyalties as our leader.  And that's the
       <em>
        very least of the problems

       If you don't believe in real conspiracy theory why are you even here? You don't think it's strange that we got to the moon with 1960's technology and haven't been 1/10th as far out since on a single manned mission? None of the van-allen belts radiation seems strange to you? How did the astronauts avoid the radiation in these belts, and why is it admitted it would be impossible to survive these belts for prolonged bouts? Have you not seen the footage of the people orbiting the earth that are clearly lying about being 1/2 way to the moon?

       We can't let that happen. This sub is one of my favorite places to come  read and discuss conspiracies. I have seen people mocking it elsewhere but I really don't care too much about what sheeple say. And I think it's important that we keep this community tight.

       You're right, we should. I had that same perception of theorists many years ago until I decided to do some of my own research and open my own eyes. But a lot of those people making us look like tin foil wearing humans are so far gone and indoctrinated. What can we do other than encourage critical thinking skills?

       This sub was discredited in the eyes of reddit a long time ago. "Conspiracy theories" have been discredited in the eyes of the public for even longer. All that being said there is a constant influx, of shills and trolls spreading misinfo, or straight up asinine shit like flat earth. This is constant, and nothing new really. Honestly this sub and conspiracy in general will not become mainstream or even acceptable for a while. Lets be honest we have proof that the CIA coined the term "conspiracy theorist" to discredit individuals and people still refuse to entertain even the most mundane and likely conspiracies, and use the term to mock people. Unless there is a overwhelming amount of evidence like Snowden  people will not believe. Lots of people end up here when some conspiracy is proven true (because of tons of proof) or if a conspiracy effects themselves.
      </p>

       Anyways slightly off topic but the DNC leaks are an important topic to some people. If TPTB want to stop us talking about it they are doing a poor job as censorship in other subs is pushing more people here. However there is a huge flood of it sliding everything else its kinda annoying.

       The term "conspiracy" has always (especially recently) been going hand-in-hand with crazy people who have no idea what they're talking about. So of course people would try to discredit those that firmly believe in some of these theories. I'll even admit, some conspiracy theories go a little overboard. But just because some do doesn't mean other theories shouldn't be considered.

       There's a healthy disrespect for this subreddit. This isn't some secret federal "psyop", the average Reddit just thinks most people here are crazy and irrational.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come here for the political shit, but some of the stuff folk here up vote definitely lets me see from the average redditors perspective. Nassim and his holofractal bullshit, bizarre freemasonry shit, "hurr the pyramids were made by aliens " kinda stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll believe anything as long as there's proper evidence and proof. Spouting nonsense and linking random ass documentaries can make this sub look bad sometimes. On the other hand a lot of mainstream average folk will literally just believe whatever they are told and that pisses me off too. Critical thinking everyone.

       Its pretty much public knowledge that JFK was the victim of a conspiracy.  So the people won that battle.

      <p>
       Today the conspiracies are confirmed within hours after being hatched, much to the chagrin of beloved leaders around the world. Take Erdogan, hes recognized as the biggest ass in the world after his fraudulent "coup", he can fire everyone and his ass will only get bigger.

       The special term for a propagandist that
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       pair real legit facts with bullshit is 'failure'. Propaganda cannot work without a kernel of truth to lend credence to the claims.
