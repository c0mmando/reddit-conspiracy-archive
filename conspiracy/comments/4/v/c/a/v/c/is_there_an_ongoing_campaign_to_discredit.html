I was going to dismiss it, but then I saw several comments mocking this sub. I laugh at some of the comments because were funny, but I realized that those comments may be were designed to destroy this sub reputation.</p>

<p>Think about it, you can find some really good threads here about real conspiracies, and this was the first place where I saw the Clinton Cash documentary. If you keep digging this sub, you&#39;ll find really good information about what is going on right now. This sub is now a threat to the Hillary campaign, and it has to be put under control immediately. Am I just too paranoid? Read this:</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/</a></p>

<p>Media manipulation is real. How this YouTube video got so popular so quick? Do you know how hard it is to get viral without any money? We will see more threads against this sub, because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is now on their target list, and I strongly believe the DNC leaks was what triggered this. (It was the first place that covered it)</p>

<p>Keep in mind that engaging with &quot; trolls&quot; is playing into their hands, and &quot;calling out shills&quot; is a slippery slope. They can just turn around and do the same if we didn&#39;t have a rule specifically against personal attacks. Just report anyone violating the subs rules. Use modmail if you want more hands-on feedback.</p>

<p>Because they are all controlled.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. There are a number of subreddits devoted to disparaging/discrediting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - and there have been for years.</p>

<p>But if you start reading their &quot;critiques&quot; of this sub, you&#39;ll find that they rarely if ever offer any substantial challenges to the material posted here, rather, they are just circle-jerks of mockery on the level of a Middle School locker room.</p>

<p>Members of the Mock Subs often use alt accounts to make shit-posts in this sub that are over-the-top racist or otherwise extremely offensive / ludicrous just so that they can make accusations about the sub. </p>

<p>There have been several occasions where such users have been busted (or have outright admitted to) doing just that - including the former POWER MOD <a href="/u/Bipolarbear0">/u/Bipolarbear0</a> <em>(who deleted his account, and *is rumored</em> to be working for Hillary full time now)* and the infamous <strong><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/11/terrorist-troll-pretended-to-be-isis-white-supremacist-and-jewish-lawyer.html">Joshua Ryne Goldberg</a></strong>, who was busted by the FBI for terrorism and other crimes.</p>

<p>When you see serious shit-posts in this sub, consider that the source may well be clowns like these.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you actually see there&#39;s a concerted effort to push a political agenda. Look, it&#39;s not a coincidence HRC was investigated on Benghazi longer than 9/11 was. It&#39;s not a coincidence she&#39;s considered anti-Zionist and she is considered anti-Semite in Zionist media.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also no coincidence she has had a dozen &quot;hacks&quot; and &quot;leaks&quot; against her. And that its all being pushed out non-stop on all alt-media, across reddit, in all conspiracy forums, everywhere. People think its a &quot;cover up&quot; it doesnt get picked up by MSM. Or that its &#39;corruption.&#39; No, the real story is that MSM only reaches a few million these days, internet reaches <em>billions</em>, and online, the story is the fact the MSM isn&#39;t covering it, and HRC  = corruption. </p>

<p>No one is talking about Trump. His misdeeds, his crimes, his plans, policies, etc. If you mention one without the other, you end up pushing an agenda. Politics should really be banned from conspiracy websites. It started in 2004, got really bad in 2008 and hasn&#39;t eased up. I think &#39;08 was the worst.</p>

<p>But the reality is, people keep talking like there&#39;s a big effort to suppress HRC-neg in the media. The traditional media only reaches tens of millions. Internet, news aggregators, forums, etc-reaches billions of page views. Trump is killing it right now by the shear scale of neg-HRC being pushed.</p>

<p>And you know what <em>Im a shill</em> because I mention it. It&#39;s so blatantly obvious though. 1-&quot;Leaks&quot; are all controlled information, and operations. 2-Benghazi was investigated more than 9/11 3-Bhengazi OPs were also against Bibi&#39;s wishes apparently (possibly why it happened) 4-HRC is hated by Zionists (even though they tell you she is working for them-she is forced into pro-Zion policy <em>everyone is</em>) 5-Trump-tards are winning propaganda wars currently.</p>

<p>No one is even talking about Trumps connections to Zion, which are deep I might add. And I don&#39;t mean to make it entirely &quot;the evil Zionists&quot; (Ill also note, I do not mean Jews, big difference. In fact, HRC&#39;s advisor is called &#39;anti-semite&#39; even though he&#39;s a Jew simply because he&#39;s anti-Zion.)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> to me it seems like Trump is actually the establishment favourite. Personally, I think <em>no one</em> should vote. People should refuse to vote until you have enough people you can say the gov does not represent the people. <strong>Politics should also be banned from conspiracy forums.</strong></p>

<p>Since neither are going to happen, I am not advising anyone vote for HRC. But if anyone currently thinks voting for Trump is anything different than voting for Bush (or any other Zion puppet) or that they&#39;re &quot;uncovering conspiracies&quot; being fed co-opted, manipulated, controlled &quot;leaked&quot; from wiki~official~leaks, no. People are dumb. So dumb they can&#39;t see the most obvious manipulation going on.</p>

<p>Whether this was deliberate disinfo, or an error by a slightly excitable California Bernie delegate, I don&#39;t know. However, the way this played out was very typical of a disinfo story, because much of the reportage of this woman seemed to be accurate (the DNC did replace Bernie delegates with paid stooges). But there was one element that was provably false - the &quot;white noise machine&quot; was obviously a wifi transmitter - and this harms the credibility of the entire story. For want of a better term, I would call this a <strong>Poison-Pill Hangout</strong>.</p>

<p>Eliminating politic BS would help her? No. It would hurt all politicians. Llimit conspiracy sites from being co-opted by political campaigns. There was a time when conspiracy sites had zero political discussion, unless it involved an actual conspiracy. The only conspiracy in politics right now is who is behind the hackings and why, but no ones talking about it. (also, likely <em>not</em> Russia) However, if <em>that</em> topic becomes a headline story, move on, there must be a deeper conspiracy. Conspiracies are not headlines. All in all its what&#39;s missing from the emails. Not whats in it.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone is just reposting headlines.</strong></p>

<p>Conspiracy forums (not just this one) just look like regular news aggregators during election season now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I have to ask you why you are suggesting to harm this <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub by pushing to remove politics,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think 20 threads all superficially bashing a candidate is adding substance to a forum based on conspiracies? Are you new? It&#39;s election season. It&#39;s literally the same thing as turning on CNN. It&#39;s worse actually because people here think they are discovering some kind of &#39;hidden knowledge&#39; while being used as lab mice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...when it&#39;s clear that the most salient conspiracies right now are POLITICAL?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, no. That&#39;s what you are being told. Holy shit. SMH.</p>

<p>How old are you? The only reason any of you even give a s## about politics right now is because of the election. And if its in-between elections its because of a lobby group striking down a politician because they didn&#39;t give into demands. The political stuff being posted here and everywhere else is superficial bullshit.</p>

<p>20 years ago no one researching these topics gave a flying f## about politics. When an actual conspiracy drums up, that&#39;s fine. It would get discussed. But the conspiracy in the current story is not whats in the emails, what is being &#39;hacked&#39; or &#39;leaked&#39; it&#39;s what&#39;s <em>missing from the emails</em>. How is everyone so blind to this?</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2379">Care to explain why the entire CFR text is redacted from this email?</a> - (See PDF Version)</p>

<p>You can&#39;t eh? Until you can you are being manipulated and co-opted, and anything you discuss related to leaks is just BS meant to put a puppet into the White House.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont&#39; think it&#39;s a campaign.  For example, no one is paying me to post politics related, and I have posted several.  </p>

<p>I just do it because---surprise surprise--Hillary is one big conspiracy.  COG is a conspiracy, Comey&#39;s decision is a conspiracy.  Loretta lynch meeting with Bill is a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>And it&#39;s important to remove specifically these people from politics because they are dangerous people with weird partly unknowable loyalties that are in contravention of loyalty to the people of the US.  We don&#39;t want someone with mixed loyalties as our leader.  And that&#39;s the <em>very least of the problems</em> with the clintons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub was discredited in the eyes of reddit a long time ago. &quot;Conspiracy theories&quot; have been discredited in the eyes of the public for even longer. All that being said there is a constant influx, of shills and trolls spreading misinfo, or straight up asinine shit like flat earth. This is constant, and nothing new really. Honestly this sub and conspiracy in general will not become mainstream or even acceptable for a while. Lets be honest we have proof that the CIA coined the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to discredit individuals and people still refuse to entertain even the most mundane and likely conspiracies, and use the term to mock people. Unless there is a overwhelming amount of evidence like Snowden  people will not believe. Lots of people end up here when some conspiracy is proven true (because of tons of proof) or if a conspiracy effects themselves. </p>

<p>Anyways slightly off topic but the DNC leaks are an important topic to some people. If TPTB want to stop us talking about it they are doing a poor job as censorship in other subs is pushing more people here. However there is a huge flood of it sliding everything else its kinda annoying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a healthy disrespect for this subreddit. This isn&#39;t some secret federal &quot;psyop&quot;, the average Reddit just thinks most people here are crazy and irrational.</p>

<p>I come here for the political shit, but some of the stuff folk here up vote definitely lets me see from the average redditors perspective. Nassim and his holofractal bullshit, bizarre freemasonry shit, &quot;hurr the pyramids were made by aliens &quot; kinda stuff. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe anything as long as there&#39;s proper evidence and proof. Spouting nonsense and linking random ass documentaries can make this sub look bad sometimes. On the other hand a lot of mainstream average folk will literally just believe whatever they are told and that pisses me off too. Critical thinking everyone.</p>
