        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">223</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-07-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of the recent developments around reddit, there has been a large user uprising 
regarding what have been deemed &quot;unfair practices&quot; on the part of the reddit admins. This outrage
centers primarily around the curious case of an Donald Trump&#39;s AMA from <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, which quickly fell from the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> within minutes of being posted.</p>

<p>Users were quick to point out this strange behavior of the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> listings, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uygib/heres_what_happened_with_donald_trumps_ama_on_rall/">which induced a response from reddit ceo Steve Huffman (/u/spez)</a>; in which spez detailed how the post had not in fact been
subject to outside influence by the admins, but instead had fallen naturally as a result of 
voting patterns. However, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4uygib/heres_what_happened_with_donald_trumps_ama_on_rall/d5txf5f">some users were quick to point out that other submissions which has been posted simultaneously, and had far less voting activity,</a> were still at the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> as the AMA was falling from view.</p>

<p>In a misguided attempt to quell user anger, spez was quick to point out that only 4% of reddit&#39;s overall traffic is driven from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. This relatively innocuous statement may have been otherwise left to fall by the wayside, were a few quick thinking individuals not inclined to look a bit more into the ramifications of such a claim.</p>

<p>Staffers at the long running publication, Assuredly A News Agency, were able to reach out to a former reddit admin  for comment. Asked if this pattern of behavior, only limited traffic being driven for reddit from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, has been in existence for more than five years, the reply from this unnamed source was simply &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>In light of these circumstances, the only conclusion that can be reached in such a situation is that the reddit admins are acutely aware of the fact that the &quot;logged out front page&quot; (which consists of content culled only from &quot;default subreddits&quot;) drives a majority of traffic for the site, therein rendering the votes and opinions of the sites
most active users (those with accounts) irrelevant to the majority of the content on the site.</p>

<p>The danger of this type of situation exists when default moderators are given &quot;special access&quot; to the admins, via  private communication channels, in such a way wherein reddit users have little to no say in the way content is curated for a majority of reddit&#39;s readership.</p>

<p>As of now, a request for comment from the reddit admins has gone answered at the AANA offices. We will update this story with any new developments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets see if I can get shadowban.</p>

<p>First off many here know how reddit works and some don&#39;t so lets outline the methods.  Number one is reddit makes money or its goal is to. So how do they do it? Well reddit gold that is give. By admin isnt tallied in the percentage of goal each day.</p>

<p>I know this because an admin on the way out gave me 6 years cause he and I are good friends. So seeing as gold is just a way to seed posts into view we can assume much is given away more so then bought. </p>

<p>When I got it I checked daily percentage for a jump in the amount. It never did. Thats how I came to this reasoning.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s another way to get money? Well clicks and views from ads. There is almost always a promoted post now each time I get on a page. </p>

<p>So then how is it that they can make the money? Its simple exposure to the user base from the ads. This is where it gets tough to explain . </p>

<p>Some subs existence is toxic to say the least. Well SRS is one of the worse. Thing is they are not normal users on the mod team. Its admin and the way you can tell is how they are still here.</p>

<p>They also defend reddit standing by attacking other sites like voat. When the last exodus happened (after the blackout when chooter left) voat got a massive spike in membership. Well SRS went full defence. </p>

<p>They tried to take over many defaults.  It didnt work because of the methods akto set up. So they had to cut the money since voat worked on donations.  They did this by planting child pornography onto a subverse and instantaneously reporting it to paypal. </p>

<p>It happened within minutes of the report to akto saying the paypal donate was gone because they didnt want to be associated with that. </p>

<p>That was a massive hit to voat because it was on everything they were part of. Then SRS laughed and joked about it in a post. The post was quickly deleted from reddit. I saw that shit and just shook my head.</p>

<p>Then after thst slowly more and more subreddits that were against reddit got taken over it was and is always SRS. Reddit is controlled by them in so many ways. They wanted to make a common enemy because its much easier to unite a group with a common enemy then it is a hero. </p>

<p>They made this to generate controversy within each community. Like punishable faces. A message sent to agentlame and flytape?  Yeah we dont know what message was sent first. Its just them always.</p>

<p>Now they control every default in one way or another. Its no free speech anything reddit never was. It is media control. Many users have admitted to using reddit as a source for news that is breaking. </p>

<p>Think about that and how sad it is you would use this place as a source for news. </p>

<p>Not really. Soon as reddit banned coontown I was only coming to view this page and all. Before you go with the reeeeeee you are racist. Ask my reasoning and I will explain as I got nothing to hide. Also I moderate the equivalent to coontown on voat. I hate the name. Wish we could change it.</p>

<p>How many people do you think really care enough to dig for shit of substance on reddit?  How many really just are here to pass time while they are on the shitter? </p>

<p>I have burned thru two accounts. One you might know adhdferret as I was shadowban when cupcake1713 cut the sandy hook thread where the user linked all the home owners info and family history.</p>

<p>She said something cant member what but pissed me off. I called her on it and boom ban. Later asked her she said I was a creep. Likely bans so many she doesnt member. I went and looked into her username. </p>

<p>Found out why she was involved in the thread. </p>

<p>Uhh well I wont ask you to go into detail, but you&#39;re always welcome to come chat on irc sometime if you&#39;d like to dig into the issue more. Cupcake has always been interesting as a reddit persona, but she has left the company at this point fyi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The banning of coontown was because of theyllowrose. She mods many subreddits based on black community.  Thats fine actually as I see it.</p>

<p>She and her marry band of sjw saw fit to rid reddit of coontown soon as it got popular. Well coontown was always said to be stormfront run. It wasn&#39;t and it was heavily moderated. The slurs are just stupid people being stupid. </p>

<p>My role as I saw it was middle ground. People keep saying I am racist when all thruout my adult life its always been black people that caused problems. And its somehow ok to allow it. </p>

<p>When you notice it and say something you are a racist. Just instant. Screw that. Now I for one know killing anyone isnt going to help. Either is deportation.  The only way is with kids and education.  Thats my main deal and I push that. </p>

<p>Recently there was a story about kids mowing lawns in poor areas. Well fuck yeah! They wont take money either they do take gofundme which I did donate too. Because that is the tyoes of shit we need.</p>

<p>On via we have a problem which we are trying to keep in check. The Jews hate angle. Its tough and when I see it i always delete the post. Its got no place there as its not even the topic of the subverse. </p>

<p>So? Blacks aren&#39;t an institution. How many times does that to be explained to the less intelligent among us? The police are part of a broader institution run by the government so many around here whine about. And they are paid by us - but protected by others.</p>

<p>You can influence an organization you technically control (and that you employ) but only an idiot believes that you can do the same with every individual in the country.</p>

<p>So you protest and work for change in a realistic manner.</p>

And I don&#39;t have to walk about telling people shit, you simply vote for and/or support those with the same ideals as you.

<p>I refuse to go into Chicago until the murder rate drops to less then 5 a week. Every week it averages around 12 killed. Unless they do something drastic even the 5th generation welfare mommy&#39;s cant hatch them fast enough to keep the ranks up.</p>

<p>You realize welfare has time limits, etc, right?</p>

<p>It is there to help those in need and most get it when they need it. </p>

<p>And remember, conservatives have been telling us that thanks to obama there aren&#39;t any jobs for people to get, unless they are making that up.</p>

<p>You racist dimwit, ever head of the Assyrians ? You know what they used to do the the people they conquered ?</p>

<p>Or how about Chinese ? Ever heard of them in your silly little life ? Just look up how many peoples were erased from the face of the Eart by the Han people. </p>

<p>Or how about the Mongolians ?</p>

<p>Or the fucking arabs who massacred their way across Northern Africa, from the Sinai all the way to Gibraltar. </p>

<p>There have been countless wars of <strong>EXTERMINATION</strong> throughout human history, the vast, vast majority of them being waged by people from other continents besides Europe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it that you imagine a group of people who wield the least amount of socioeconomic power in our society could possibly be causing most of the problems? Why, when you factor in the vast numerical odds against them as well, black people must be among the most efficacious humans in all of history to be majorly responsible for our society&#39;s problems! </p>

<p>Because of course black people aren&#39;t the source of problems in society. If society is wrecked(it is) and you are searching for the culprit, look for those who wield the power that could cause the damage you see. You are very likely focusing on a symptom of our broken society(I&#39;m guessing crime rates in the AA community) and confusing it for a cause.</p>

I don&#39;t think affirmative action is an ideal solution, but neither can I see any balanced assessment placing it anywhere near the top of the fix-it list. Focusing so strongly only it seems like a classic wedge issue tactic, to be honest. Divisive and distracts from the real issue and obvious solution, which would be focusing on the crushing income inequality currently robbing us all of a future.</p>

<p>Making excuses doesn&#39;t get you into a better situation.  I see no reason to complain about such things as I have the ability to change. Those that I cant yeah I will. </p>

<p>Bunch of black people blocking the road so that it impedes my travel or say an ambulance with a dying man in the back yeah that is some shit we can change thru bringing it to light with sources. </p>

<p>Bunch of BLM activist telling white people to get behind them at a march for the DNC? I can show that shit too. </p>

<p>People say it should be fair. Well fuck that it isnt nor will it be and forcing people thru threats or riots is bullshit. </p>

<p>You see me as something that is easy to label and I doubt you will ever agree with me because its just an argument to you. I would rather a discussion without your pandering to those you say are less fortunate.  </p>

<p>I have had no fortune in my life save finding the woman I married and her and I having a son. That is the ONLY fortune I have ever had. Everything else I busted my ass for and I dont mind continuing to do so cause that is what americans have always done. </p>
