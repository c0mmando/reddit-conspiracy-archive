        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I feel like all these alien movies and superhero films which all seem to have beams of light shooting into the sky are prepping our minds to accept the biggest false flag attack ever.</p>

<p>First it was Communists, then terrorists.  The next enemy propped up by the military industrial complex and lawmakers will be aliens.  </p>

<p>Aliens would be perfect. They just use the latest secret military aircraft technology and weapons which have never been made public, shoot a huge beam of light into the sky during the attack, and position operatives in various locations to shoot shaky cell phone videos.</p>

<p>they&#39;ll edit their phone videos with special fx to make it look even more alien-y, and block any videos which may show that the attack doesn&#39;t involve aliens. what&#39;s that you say? it&#39;ll be obvious that cgi was used?  well first, they&#39;ll likely have cutting edge cgi fx tech which even the movie studios don&#39;t have (they&#39;re secret government spy organizations remember), and also, who&#39;s gonna believe you that it&#39;s fake cgi?  It&#39;s your opinion vs their slew of fox tv talking puppet experts.  </p>

<p>&#39;oh, it&#39;s clearly unedited and genuine footage.&#39; says hollywood cgi expert...</p>

<p>Dramatic hollywood movies glorifying the soldiers and citizens who defeated the aliens will be produced.  </p>

<p>The new world order, 1 government, 1 military, to fight future alien attacks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have come to the conclusion that this will be the final false flag used to usher in the New World Order. I believe it will be a staged alien attack on multiple major cities around the world simultaneously. They will use it at as their last epic grandeur act, at a time when the entire world is in financial ruin, with everyone feeling completely defeated, demoralized, and losing all hope for the future. At this hopeless time, the threat of dealing with an alien attack on top of everything else going on will just be too much to bear. Cue our friendly neighbourhood globalists to the rescue!  </p>

<p>They will use the UN to create a one world government and band together all the militaries of the world under one central command to fight off the scary aliens, they will create a one world currency that they have full control over to further control and enslave the masses, and the people of the world will rejoice and welcome our &quot;saviours&quot; and new overlords with open arms. It&#39;s all leading up to this, and there&#39;s nothing we can do to stop it now. Even if we were to somehow alert every person in the world to this reality, the &quot;alien invasion&quot; fear propaganda lie is too strong and too ingrained into everyone&#39;s minds at this point that the majority will believe the lie hook line and sinker. All that&#39;s left to see is whether or not there will be an &quot;Anti-Christ&quot; to lead the one world government or not... </p>

<p>Minus the aliens and big lights, didn&#39;t we already see this on 9/11?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yri3ZSVjjnA">Dr. Judy Wood</a> thinks it was a technology we&#39;ve not seen before that works on an atomic-level to destabilize.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t put it past the conspirators to do something along these lines.  I&#39;ve heard, but I don&#39;t have hard evidence for, that some chemtrails were leaving particles in the atmosphere that makes it possible to project realistic images against the sky. </p>

<p>The theory at the time was that this could be used in psyops to artificially inflate the perceived presence of troops in an area. Much like in the world wars where inflatable tanks and fake planes painted to look real were left to be targeted by the enemy, wasting their time, effort, energy, ammo, resources, etc. Projections into the sky could make a handful of attacking aircraft look like dozens, having a more impactful psychological effect.</p>

<p>If it more benefitted the conspirators to project an extraterrestrial threat, I wouldn&#39;t put it past them at all.</p>

<p>Good theory. Look into chemtrails and projections to see if you can make some connections.</p>
