<p>Which is the fault of the people observing, not the members of the group.</p>

<p>Then you need to educate yourself on what they actually believe.</p>

<p>Uh, no. Making it illegal to hate their race is one of the ways they keep us controlled. There’s a lot of D&amp;C shilling going on here (meaning shilling where the shill says that D&amp;C is the opposite of what it actually is); I don’t want you getting caught up in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between being anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish. If one is anti-Semitic they simply hate the Jew because he is a Jew. An anti-Semite believes the Jew has no way to change because he&#39;s a Jew and inherently evil. This is racism. Now someone who is anti-Jewish is one who rejects the Theology of Jews and its effect on society. The Jewish religion is inherently a rejection of the order of the universe. The Jews rejected the Christ at the foot of the cross. Christ was the the Logos, which is the reason/order of the universe made flesh. Since then they have been revolutionaries against the moral and social order and should be treated as such. That is why I am anti-Jewish, not an anti-Semite.</p>

<p>It’s disrespectful to just make a fly by comment and say I’m wrong and not even try and explain yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explained myself perfectly. Learn how to read. Your definition is invented. You set it up and knocked it down. Your strawmen are made of fucking blue supergiant, they’re so blindingly obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If one is anti-Semitic they simply hate the Jew because he is a Jew.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Utter fucking bullshit based in zero evidence whatsoever. Even jews don’t believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An anti-Semite believes the Jew has no way to change because he’s a Jew and inherently evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is racism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t even know what <em>racism</em> is. You’re using jewish buzzwords while claiming to fight against them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now someone who is anti-Jewish is one who rejects the Theology of Jews and its effect on society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that’s anti-semitism. You’re inventing a bullshit term because you’re a fucking coward, too afraid to actually speak his mind and too afraid of what others think of you to actually believe what you claim to believe. You openly embrace the evils of the talmudists as fact, despite claiming to work against them.</p>

<p>DON’T. BE. AFRAID. There is nothing wrong with combating zionist shit. There is nothing wrong with wanting to undo what the jews have done to every country but their own. That’s anti-semitism, because they’ve either committed genocide on or operationally kicked out the rest of the semites. So fucking what?! Who gives a shit what they call it if it’s correct?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jewish religion is inherently a rejection of the order of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a rejection of all order but their own. The goal is to rule over a commune of mongrelized goyim from a central government in Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jews rejected the Christ at the foot of the cross.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look how that worked out for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I make a distinction between being anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic because the Jews want us to lump the two together. Whenever we are critical of something the Jews do or something they are subversively trying to impose on society, they can call us anti-Semitic. They can claim we are just criticizing simply because of their DNA instead of their ideals and their corrupt morals. They use the anti-Semite tag to smear all criticism. I&#39;m Making a distinction that I am actually against their theology and philosophy, which corrupts all that it touches. Have you ever read Dr. E Michael Jones.? He explains this in great depth. Also, how do you make it so that what I say shows up grey then you respond to it? Are you just copy and pasting or doing something else? Thanks.</p>

<p>Exactly, so who gives a fuck what they think as long as we have fact on our side?</p>

<p>That’s Reddit’s quoting format, and you do it by putting a &gt; before the text you want to quote.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;Sample text

<p>Ashkenazi Jews weren&#39;t genetically isolated. They are a mix of Southern Europeans and middle eastern populations (maternally and paternally, respectively). </p>

<p>There is an evolutionary strategy for Jews. Dr. Macdonald goes into much depth on this subject. See The Culture of Critique and A People Who Shall Dwell Alone. </p>
