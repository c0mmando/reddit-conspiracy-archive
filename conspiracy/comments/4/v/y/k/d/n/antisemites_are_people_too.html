       Yes they are. But with all hate groups comes the perception of ignorance. So while they may be people they are viewed as ignorant by most. Myself included. Hate based on religion or race is one of the ways they keep us divided.

       Uh, no. Making it illegal to hate their race is one of the ways they keep us controlled. There’s a lot of D&amp;C shilling going on here (meaning shilling where the shill says that D&amp;C is the opposite of what it actually is); I don’t want you getting caught up in it.

       There is a difference between being anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish. If one is anti-Semitic they simply hate the Jew because he is a Jew. An anti-Semite believes the Jew has no way to change because he's a Jew and inherently evil. This is racism. Now someone who is anti-Jewish is one who rejects the Theology of Jews and its effect on society. The Jewish religion is inherently a rejection of the order of the universe. The Jews rejected the Christ at the foot of the cross. Christ was the the Logos, which is the reason/order of the universe made flesh. Since then they have been revolutionaries against the moral and social order and should be treated as such. That is why I am anti-Jewish, not an anti-Semite.

       Ashkenazi Jews weren't genetically isolated. They are a mix of Southern Europeans and middle eastern populations (maternally and paternally, respectively).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an evolutionary strategy for Jews. Dr. Macdonald goes into much depth on this subject. See The Culture of Critique and A People Who Shall Dwell Alone.

       An insult is to speak with disrespect towards someone. It's disrespectful to just make a fly by comment and say I'm wrong and not even try and explain yourself. I see a lot of your comments are just telling people why they are wrong and not much else. Can you please explain you position and why you believe I wrong? All us here need be a little more open to dialogue with each other.

       No, that’s anti-semitism.

       DON’T. BE. AFRAID. There is nothing wrong with combating zionist shit. There is nothing wrong with wanting to undo what the jews have done to every country but their own. That’s anti-semitism, because they’ve either committed genocide on or operationally kicked out the rest of the semites. So fucking what?! Who gives a shit what they call it if it’s correct?

       I make a distinction between being anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic because the Jews want us to lump the two together. Whenever we are critical of something the Jews do or something they are subversively trying to impose on society, they can call us anti-Semitic. They can claim we are just criticizing simply because of their DNA instead of their ideals and their corrupt morals. They use the anti-Semite tag to smear all criticism. I'm Making a distinction that I am actually against their theology and philosophy, which corrupts all that it touches. Have you ever read Dr. E Michael Jones.? He explains this in great depth. Also, how do you make it so that what I say shows up grey then you respond to it? Are you just copy and pasting or doing something else? Thanks.
