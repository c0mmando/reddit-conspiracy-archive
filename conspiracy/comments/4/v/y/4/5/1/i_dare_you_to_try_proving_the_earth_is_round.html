    <div class="md"><p>The sun sets.</p>

<p>The law of perspective is very well understood, and we can apply it with some trigonometry.  Let’s just use some high school math, and the assumption that the world is flat, and prove that the earth can’t be flat.</p>

<p>I’m standing near the south pole which, on a flat earth, is actually a rim around the edge.  I’m looking directly toward the north pole, which is now the point in the center of the circle.  It’s the equinox, so the sun will be directly above the equator (a circle with half the radius of the southern polar circle).</p>

<p>I have my friend standing at the 45 degrees longitude to make a measurement for me.  He’ll measure the angle to the sun at his local noon, but it doesn’t really matter where he is, as long as he’s at the 45 degrees longitude (north or south won’t matter).  He’ll measure that the sun is 45 degrees in the sky.  This means that we can construct a right triangle to the sun, and get a figure for the height.  We’ll draw a line from my friend to the point on the equator closest to him, and then draw a line from there to the sun, then from the sun back to my friend.</p>

<p>Because a right triangle with one forty five degree angle must, by definition have a second 45 degree angle (because the angles have to add to 180 degrees), we know that the two legs of the triangle have to be exactly the same length.  We don’t care about the length of the hypotenuse (for the curious it’s the length of the leg times the square root of 2).  A quick google search tells us that it’s about 3000 miles from 45 degrees to the equator, which means the sun must be about 3000 miles in the sky.</p>

<p>Great, now I can use that information to predict where the sun should be from where I’m standing.  But, I’ll wait until midnight my time to do it.  This way, the sun will be as far away from me as possible.  It will be on the opposite side of me, but still over the equator, since it’s still the equinox.  A quick google search shows the distance to the equator from the south pole is about 6215 miles, so we can triple that figure to get the distance to opposite side of the equator, 18645 miles (once to get from the south pole to the equator, again to get from the equator to the north pole, and a third time to get from the north pole to the opposite side of the equator, where the sun is).</p>

<p>We know the sun must be 3000 miles high, so we can construct another right triangle and get the angle we should expect to see.  We can take the arctangent of 3000/18645 (the ratio of opposite over adjacent on our right triangle) and get that the sun should still be about 9 degrees over the horizon at midnight on the south pole.  The sun, at its farthest point, should still be about the width of your fist at arm’s length above the horizon.</p>

<p>By the simple laws of perspective, the earth can’t be flat.</p>

<p>There&#39;s &#39;proof&#39; of a ball earth. Lots of it.  You don&#39;t accept it. So how about this?</p>

<p><strong>You</strong> claim a flat earth. That burden of proof is on <strong>you</strong>. So prove the earth is flat. And I swear, if you send me some hours long video instead of explaining how it&#39;s flat then I&#39;m done.</p>

<p>Also, do you think gravity is real? Or are you an &quot;aether&quot; kinda guy?</p>

<p>Please if the earth is flat, tell me how these things occur:</p>

<p>Mountain building events (orogenies)</p>

<p>Volcanoes</p>

<p>Earthquakes </p>

<p>Hurricanes</p>

<p>Tornadoes</p>

<p>Day/night</p>

<p>Seasons</p>

<p>Rain</p>

<p>Edit:  23 hours and no response.  Hmmmm....maybe because you know it&#39;s BS?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could never prove it to you, because you are determined to believe it is flat. Here&#39;s why I KNOW the Earth is a ball. I have flown around it many times. In most cases there&#39;s an in-flight map which shows where you are in relation to where you&#39;re going. That is always a &#39;great circle&#39; route which looks curved on a 2D map but straight on a globe. To fly from Hong Kong to London means flying over Siberia and Russia, not India and the Middle East. It is impossible to reconcile that route with a flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean, how could a pilot not see the edge when flying near there?  Antarctica is pretty expansive.  Not only that, 12 countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 that bars most flights from getting near it.  Anywhere below the 60th parallel is subject to the treaty.  There are some flights that approach the shores of Antarctica but they never circumnavigate by flying across it.  You can&#39;t go to Antarctica as an independent explorer either.  You can only visit the approved sites under supervision.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people talk about the expeditions made by Admiral Richard Byrd in which they think he may have actually reached the edge.  The treaty was signed shortly after his death.  I haven&#39;t looked into it myself though.</p>

<p>Edit: Woah, I just looked into the treaty a bit and, &quot;As of 2015, there are 53 states party to the treaty&quot;. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Antarctic_Treaty_parties.svg">Every country that isn&#39;t red</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused that there are people who find the Antarctic Treaty sinister. There has to be some kind of usage agreement since no humans naturally live there, and it&#39;s such a valuable spot for scientific research. It would be a gigantic mess without some kind of internationally-recognized rules.</p>

<p>Also, you can absolutely explore Antarctica. Børge Ousland crossed the continent solo in 1997. Most people don&#39;t do this because it&#39;s costly and incredibly dangerous, even for adventurers and experienced explorers. </p>

<p>Anyway, there have been flights over the South Pole. <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-06-16/news/8702140358_1_calin-rosetti-arctic-tern-le-bourget-airport">These guys</a> flew around the world, over both poles, back in 1987. It took them 20 hours and 25 minutes to fly nonstop over the South Pole. Again, it&#39;s dangerous and requires a ton of preparation, all to cross a mostly-empty continent that is totally inhospitable to human life. The lack of people going to Antarctica is understandable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not much of an international conspiracy if it doesn&#39;t actually stop people from going there/crossing/flying over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you know what gyroscopes do.  Partially because of the Earth&#39;s rotation, gyroscopically driven directional instruments need to be reset to a magnetic compass to correct for the rotating Earth beneath the aircraft.  Generally, these are slaved to a flux gate compass out on one wing so pilots don&#39;t need to constantly reset them, but should that compass fail they can fall back to free-gyro mode wherein they need to be corrected regularly again.</p>

<p>Any instrument rated pilot, most private pilots and many student pilots already know this.  Look up an &#39;HSI&#39; or horizontal situation indicator.  They&#39;re often found in aircraft as small as Piper Seminoles (small twin-engine trainer).</p>

<p>By the way, can you link me to the &#39;gyroscopic data on planes?&#39;  I&#39;ve been a commercial pilot for over a decade and I wasn&#39;t aware that our gyro records were accessible.  Also, when you link that, please also show me what a curve would look like in those data, as I don&#39;t actually understand what that would look like.</p>

<p>Also, just to help you out with the curve issue, magnetic compasses in all aircraft (not flux gate, but the free mag compass in the center of the cockpit) need to be counterweighted to correct for magnetic dip to account for the fact that the compass wants to line up with the magnetic field lines.  Without this counterweight the compass card would be tilted up and you wouldn&#39;t be able to read it, nor would it properly pivot on axis.  The result of that counterweight is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUz09IpYCuY">East-West acceleration error</a> and <a href="http://williams.best.vwh.net/compass/nturn.png">Turning Error</a> which is so absolutely incredibly fundamental that it shows up in the very first hours of instrument training.  The errors can get as great as 30 degrees and absolutely <strong>must</strong> be accounted for in rolling out when flying by compass alone.  It&#39;s one of the reasons we installed gyroscopically stabilized instruments in the cockpit.</p>

<p>I guess while you&#39;re at it, can you explain how the Earth&#39;s magnetic field works in a flat earth environment?  The ball environment model explains the observed phenomena in nature extremely well.  It makes testable predictions which reliably come true to the point that we&#39;ve built entire systems of operation around those predictions.  If the lines merely emanate out to infinity I&#39;d really hope you&#39;d publish your data to show the existence of a magnetic monopole in direct violation of Gauss&#39;s Law in Magnetism and collect your Nobel Prize for completely upending physics more than most anyone since Newton.</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve posted multiple times how Eratosthenes&#39; experiment didn&#39;t prove the earth is a ball. He pre-supposed that all light arrives to earth in parallel rays due to its distance from the sun <a href="http://funnel.sfsu.edu/courses/gm309/labs/seasons/images/SunsRaysDecSolstice.jpg">like so.</a> His experiments work out the exact same way on a flat earth if the sun is smaller and closer <a href="http://www.eratosthenes.eu/spip/IMG/jpg/module-guide-figure-2.jpg">like so.</a>  We see this evidenced in things like <a href="http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/enhanced/terminal01/2011/4/25/17/enhanced-buzz-24705-1303768458-0.jpg">crepuscular rays</a>.  The math works out the exact same way on a flat earth.  7.2° angle (1/50<sup>th</sup> of a circle) while the cities are 800km apart makes a circle of about 40,000km on both models.  All he did was roughly calculate the circumference of the equator based on the sun&#39;s path.  Some people made up the lie that earth was round thousands of years ago and then went about trying to come up with math to trick people into believing it.</p>

<p>First off, <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/A12b1nO8OML._SL1500_.jpg">flat earth is &quot;round&quot;</a> so start calling it an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot; if you&#39;re defending that.  Secondly, they have no proofs other than pictures.  All of their &quot;proofs&quot; are circumstantial like the Eratosthenes example.  It&#39;s the same for flat earth but the government still brainwashes you with images of the ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they did.  And you act like Eratosthenes was the only indication we had that the Earth is round.  Ancient Greeks understood Geometry almost as well as we do and sorry, but you can&#39;t explain Eratosthenes&#39; results when you assume a flat Earth: the trigonometry returns absurd results when you do.   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flatearth/comments/4oqiob/foolproof_test_of_the_flat_earth_lets_assume_the/">I&#39;ve detailed it 100% with the math here</a>.</p>

<p>So you are wrong about Eratosthenes.  And of course, the ancients could also see distant objects be obscured by the horizon in direct proportion to their distance just like we can.  And they also noted the existence of 2 Celestial Poles.  And they also saw Northern Stars dip as you approach the equator while the Southerly ones rise. -- All of these observations make no sense at all on a Flat Earth but are required if the Earth is round.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flatearth/comments/4t3dqg/flat_earth_daily_debunk_22_anticrepuscular_rays/">Crepuscular Rays</a> are great and clearly demonstrate that the sun is Distant and the rays that reach us are essentially parallel.  Funny how anti-crepuscular rays show us the Sun is below the horizon at precisely the two times of day when Round Earth tells us the Sun is below our horizon.</p>

<p>And sorry, but the proof is in the pudding.  Your model can&#39;t even explain why the Sun sets bottom first.  You can&#39;t explain the South Celestial Pole&#39;s mere existence.  You can&#39;t explain moon phases.  You can&#39;t even explain why the sun, moon, and Earth have the relationships they do.</p>

<p>Your model can&#39;t make predictions.  I can tell you EXACTLY where Venus will be visible from the surface of the Earth on December 2nd, 2048 at 5:43 AM GMT.</p>

Impossible, but thousands of people have witnessed this fact too. Couple this with known facts of the physics of water&#39;s properties, water must always level. Random static bulges of water in the middle bodies cannot exist, water is moving and dynamic, and must level.</p>

<p>Any honest person can prove this scientifically easy fact by flying small plane over any lake in question and see there is no 6 feet of water bulge after 3 miles of flight on this lake. Ships don&#39;t disappear over curvature. You just cannot see beyond the angular resolution of your eye or telescope.</p>

<p>Curvature of water bodies like lakes is the stupidest myth taught to us as children like Santa Claus. The fact that Stephen Hawkings and others are peddling this debunked stupidity is proof that science like religion will hold old false dogmas to protect itself rather than the scientific method&#39;s  integrity . But, modern science is about to discredit itself. The age of technology and average joe doing their own tests. PBS recently took down youtube video showing this bad science after thousands on youtube called it bullshit. Even you will be shocked when you  discover no curvature. The Chicago skyline story exploded the curvature debate on youtube , when people looked into it, they realized the lies were obvious. Look into it. When it comes to the curvature debate, people either fear the truth or accept it. The truth will bring more questions to the mind like, if there is no detectable curve,  is the earth bigger? Does the curve apply to atmospheric layers only? The scientific mind must not be like the alter boy of science  who repeats it&#39;s disputed dogmas, it must challenge all science and prove it correct where possible. If you cannot measure, see and detect a curve, you have to do away with this false science. This ishow science works.</p>

<p>Toronto to Ajax is 20km. If you&#39;re 2m above sea level (So, just standing next to the sea), there will be 17.5m of the Toronto skyline hidden. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been, but I imagine the Toronto skyline boasts buildings taller than 17.5m - The buildings should be visible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how aircraft used to avoid detection by radar (before stealth technology) by flying really low?</p>

<p>Do you know why that works, even over the ocean?</p>

<p>Radar is a line of sight technology. By flying really low the aircraft stays below the horizon until it is much closer to the target and thus the radar doesn&#39;t see it until its too late.</p>

<p>The earth is round, which is what allows this technique to work.</p>

<p>Q.E.D.</p>

<p>This is such a well know fact, that the term &quot;below the radar&quot;/&quot;under the radar&quot; has entered in to common usage to mean &quot;unnoticed&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is more information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_horizon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_horizon</a></p>

<p>Nope. It&#39;s a fact that was discovered very soon after radar was invented.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LORAN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Works via a totally different principle. LORAN does not reflect radio waves off a target like a torch. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LORAN#Basic_concept">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LORAN#Basic_concept</a></p>

<p>Because of how it works, LORAN can use radio frequencies that bounce off the ionosphere and the earth, thus &quot;bending&quot; around the globe.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The simple fact is, flying low to stay below the radar horizon and not be seen by line of sight radars is a concept over 70 years old. It is well known and well understood. Just because you are ignorant, that doesn&#39;t mean its not true.</p>

<p>If the earth was truly flat, there would be no range limit to radar systems. Yet there is. It&#39;s a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, waves do mess with the signal... in the article I posted that is called &quot;clutter&quot;, however it&#39;s not the only thing that affects radar detection of low flying aircraft. If it was, then radar could never be used to detect ships.</p>

<p>As for proof of things bouncing off the ionosphere, ask people who work in radio. There are hobbyists who spend their free time trying to detect radio broadcasts from extreme distances. When they hear a signal they will fill out a card and send it to the radio station they have identified for confirmation that they heard that station.</p>

<p>My father owned a low power AM radio station that could not be picked up the next town over only a hundred miles away, but people from the other side of the world had picked it up due to the way the signal bounces between the ionosphere and the surface.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vkpckRS.png">Here is a very simplified sketch of how it works</a></p>

<p>The green area is the planet. The small black lines are radio antennas. The blue line is the ionosphere. The red lines are the line of sight radio signal. As you can see, because of the curvature of the planet, the radio antenna in the middle does not receive the signal, but because the signal bounces of the ionosphere, the further away antenna does.</p>

<p>Certain radio signals will actually bounce several times, leaving alternating bands of the surface where the signal can and can&#39;t be detected. This is another well known phenomena and is actually part of the reason why broadcast radio frequencies can be reused in other areas. For example the radio station in the middle could broadcast on the same frequency and not interfere with the local reception  of the other station.</p>

<p>I have personally experienced this effect. So no, it&#39;s not &quot;just because I was told it&quot;.</p>

<p>Your ignorance is not proof that the earth is flat. It is simply ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 Celestial Poles.  Every FE attempt to explain this is laughably bad.   Two visible axes of rotation from the surface of the same object is only possible if that object is a sphere. </p>

<p>So there you have it.  But of course, you will kick and scream and deny BASIC GEOMETRY, but that&#39;s the case.  And of course it doesn&#39;t hurt that we see curvature everywhere we expect to find it, that we compensate with it in our engineering and aircraft and surveying.  </p>

<p>It really is that simple.  Also, I can debunk FE in any number of ways.  Go ahead and take a crack at any of the 24 debunks I&#39;ve submitted over at <a href="/r/flatearth">/r/flatearth</a>.</p>

<p>But if you think differently, go ahead and explain the 2 Celestial Poles.  I guarantee I&#39;ve heard every laughable argument you can make about it.  Most Flatties are so scared of the S. Celestial Pole that they have to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. LOL</p>
