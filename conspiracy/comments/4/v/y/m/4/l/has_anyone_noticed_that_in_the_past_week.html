<p>Edit: And someone actually posted this about Clinton:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because she has some modicum of respect for the rule of law and the Constitution. Because she doesn&#39;t support policies that would absolutely wreck the economy. Because as lousy as she is, she is stable, level headed and knows how to be president. The same is completely not true for Trump. Remember, we are electing somebody to the most powerful office on the world.</p>

<p>I told them the first sentence was so laughably wrong that I can&#39;t read the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good analysis. I think your min wage rate could be correct, however I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s less generous. I&#39;m sure the managers are working at CTR HQ, however the trolls are likely outsourced to virtual asst countries such as the Philippines- where English is common. The cost per day would be about $15-$35 a day from my experience looking at outsourcing. It may even be less.  I&#39;m not condoning paying ppl this much, it&#39;s just the rate I&#39;ve seen. For a bulk digital labor order - the cost per person may be even lower through a troll agency. </p>

<p>Remember, Hillary fought to keep the min wage down in Honduras - $0.37 per HR. </p>

<p>From the amount of scripted posts, it wouldn&#39;t be far fetched to have a lot of non-native English speakers on the pay roll. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are a lot of higher level trolls too, but those are few and far between. The lower ranking trolls probably flag a post or account that needs more advanced shilling. </p>

<p>Plus they have almost complete coverage now - essentially all threads are about how bad Trump is. There&#39;s no where to even discuss how horrible Shillary is.

    <div class="md"><p>first of all, it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that the politician who the owners of reddit have given their bribes to become the politician that they want to win and moderate their content to support.</p>

<p>secondly, I&#39;m &quot;voting for&quot; the hope that people like you will realize that it&#39;s totally irrelevant who wins the election because Bush II vs his own frat brother Gore, or Clinton II vs her own campaign donor and family friend, tv personality Donald Trump, is not real competition and is only put on as a show to keep you  focusing your angst and frustration on two random individuals every 4 years, focus is kept on them, their hair, their lies, their fake electoral rhetoric, their clothing, their money, their families and wives -- and people spend their time whining and gossiping about these 2 false-opposition game-show personalities --  instead of on the greater political realities facing your country and the world.</p>

<p>This is how democracy is used to disempower the masses and control the political discourse of an entire country using mass propaganda networks like TV - the democracy has been turned into nothing more than a transparently misused management tactic.</p>

<p>only complete retards believe either trump or clinton II is going to help anything. sorry infowars, go away. It doesn&#39;t matter AT ALL, not one single bit, who you vote for. The votes have already been tallied by a bit of malicious code on the central tabulation machines anyway (for the primaries on both sides), and now it doesn&#39;t matter which fake politician wins (Clinton&#39;s wife, or WWE Raw actor and hospitality businessman and Clinton campaign donor Trump), because they are false opposition. It&#39;s the American equivalent of Putin&#39;s wife vs. Putin&#39;s billionaire campaign donor who mysteriously appeared on the political scene to take over Putin&#39;s wife&#39;s &quot;opposition&quot; at the exact moment the Putin mafia needed to control both sides. It does not matter at all which one &quot;wins&quot;. This is a show put on to distract morons from real issues and bait them into thinking that &quot;if they just get behind one individual and vote for him, somehow that will save everything for them&quot;.</p>

<p>this way you morons are kept &quot;fighting trump&quot; or &quot;fighting Clinton&#39;s wife&quot; (random individuals from social climber families bathing in the limelight and hoping to score a little line in the history books), instead of spending your time worrying about the dangerous corporate infiltrators and anti-democratic forces that have infiltrated our national financial/political establishment (who are the ones who insert the same &quot;advisers&quot; into every presidency -- who Trump&#39;s campaign is already taking in).</p>

<p>tip: this democracy-as-seen-on-TV is not how the country is actually run, this is a side-show to keep the misinformed majority thinking that this is how it&#39;s run so that they don&#39;t try to actively participate in any other way, and instead spend their entire lives thinking that democracy is &quot;voting for some random person once every 4 years&quot; and sticking a sign in their yard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool I learned a word.  I like how the ancient Greeks would hold basically &#39;anti-elections&#39; (ostracisms) where the person with the most votes would be honorably exiled from Athens for 10 years.

<p>Something is very fishy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really.  The primaries have end ( this past week ), the time for infighting in the parties is over.  We are now in the general election
which means each side will now focus all their shit flinging 100% at the other side.   The politics sub has always had a left leaning majority, so no this does not seem fishy.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Prove it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His efforts to build the wall? You know why he hasn&#39;t been talking about it at nearly the clip he was before? Because he has realized that Mexico paying for it is a pipe dream and the thing will most likely never be realized.</p>

<p>Nah, he explicitly outlined a plan for making them pay for it that can be implemented on day one without Congress. You continue to prove that you know absolutely nothing about what you believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is almost no chance of Trump being allowed to be President.  He has been controlled opposition all along.</p>

<p>People are hilarious.  Look at what Obama said about Hillary in 2008 and then look at what he did once elected, handing her SOS.</p>

<p>Look up Bernie talking about Hillary throughout the primary and then look what happened.</p>

<p>I am amazed over and over and how dumb people are.  Politics is like a nonstop WWE show with huffing and puffing onstage and congratulatory pats on the back offstage.</p>

<p>Trump and Clinton go back a long way.</p>

<p>BREAKING: Leftists are mentally ill and operate based on cognitive dissonance. Also, water said to be wet.</p>

<p>What’s your point?</p>

<p>So who better to defeat her than someone who’s known her for decades?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, they&#39;ll swing a few thousand votes here or there but most people are already stuck into their dualistic mindset. &#39;I&#39;m voting left because I care about others&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m voting right because I think others should care for themselves&#39; or whatever other reasons they&#39;ve been conned into believing. Ultimately corporatism is the only victor as neither party can or will do anything to change anything that might benefit Joe Public and his rapidly diminishing opportunities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hilarious, isn&#39;t it? Cheeto Jesus attacks <em>the family of a dead soldier</em> and <em>a baby and its mother</em> within the space of, what, 48 hours? And still the only explanation they can think of for a backlash is shilling!</p>
