       Either it was the plan all along, or Trump will get tired of the presidency and find a way to get out of office on top.
Maybe it was the plan all along. The RNC knew an establishment Republican couldn't win the presidency, so they paid Trump to run on the off chance he could work his warped juju charisma and inflame the Republican base to get out the vote. Maybe it was a joke, "Hey Donald, you should run for President, if you win I bet the RNC would pay good money for the Presidency if you can snag it for them"....

       Even on the off chance Trump is legitimate in his love for America, the powers that be will JFK him and we'll get Pence.

       Wake the fuck up Trump lovers, you're almost as pathetic as Bernie supporters who've fallen in line and are now trying to win votes for Clinton.

       People seem to not understand the word none I think. Just to clarify when /user/ItsAJackOff says "None of these people give a fuck about you" he is saying none as in, zero, 0, no one, not a single person, nobody, is there to represent us it's a sham. Nobody cares don't even vote.

       Just look at the recent AMA Donald did, he didn't answer anything in to detail. It was quite eye opening to see how people suck ass so much and worship him as an idol. The amount of zombies who think they aren't zombies is mind numbing to say the least.

       What about Trump makes you think he is a good person? Evil is relative. His business practices have hurt thousands of people. What has he done for the benefit of his fellow man? If we are working with similar views of right and wrong, it should be apparent why over 85% of America do not trust him.

       He's literally saying he's going to prosecute all of the corrupted fucks in this regime of criminals we call a government. No one has ever said anything like that before, especially running for president. So if he gets elected on those terms and he doesn't follow through then we'll all know its time to strap up and hit the streets.

       Dude. Look at his poll numbers. He had a 13% approval rating last I read. I've been a Berniecrat since last August. 
I believe very little of what most politians say. The only one I have trusted in recent years is Bernie Sanders. Why? Because you can go back through his "post history" and see he has been fighting for the same stuff for over 25 years. The Donald has been a Republican for less than 2 years. He has switched views on everything his had previously supported as a longterm Democrat.
He has lied to THOUSANDS of people in order to take their money. Trump University? Trump Condos? 
How can you honestly believe he's going to follow through with his "campaign goals"  and prosecute corruption?
