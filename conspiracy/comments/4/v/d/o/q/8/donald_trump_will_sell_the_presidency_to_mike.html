Maybe it was the plan all along. The RNC knew an establishment Republican couldn&#39;t win the presidency, so they paid Trump to run on the off chance he could work his warped juju charisma and inflame the Republican base to get out the vote. Maybe it was a joke, &quot;Hey Donald, you should run for President, if you win I bet the RNC would pay good money for the Presidency if you can snag it for them&quot;....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t give a shit about any of that.</p>

<p>He&#39;s literally saying he&#39;s going to prosecute all of the corrupted fucks in this regime of criminals we call a government. No one has ever said anything like that before, especially running for president. So if he gets elected on those terms and he doesn&#39;t follow through then we&#39;ll all know its time to strap up and hit the streets. </p>

<p>Hillary is basically folding your hand and saying fuck it.</p>

<p>Its pretty cut and fucking dry.</p>

<p>The only thing apparent is your blatant shill speak. &#39;85% of America do not trust him&#39; WHAT IN THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, KID? lol get the fuck out of here. No one is that dumb, you&#39;re obviously getting paid here. Lets check your post history shall we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. Look at his poll numbers. He had a 13% approval rating last I read. I&#39;ve been a Berniecrat since last August. 
I believe very little of what most politians say. The only one I have trusted in recent years is Bernie Sanders. Why? Because you can go back through his &quot;post history&quot; and see he has been fighting for the same stuff for over 25 years. The Donald has been a Republican for less than 2 years. He has switched views on everything his had previously supported as a longterm Democrat.
He has lied to THOUSANDS of people in order to take their money. Trump University? Trump Condos? 
How can you honestly believe he&#39;s going to follow through with his &quot;campaign goals&quot;  and prosecute corruption? </p>
