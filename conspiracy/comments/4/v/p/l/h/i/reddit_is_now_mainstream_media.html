    <div class="md"><p>The last presidential election was 4 years ago. Internet culture has changed quite a bit since then. I wasn&#39;t on Reddit back then, but I&#39;m pretty confident that things were very different when Obama was running for re-election in 2012. At the very least, we didn&#39;t have Correct the Record publicly announcing that they&#39;re illegally working directly with the Hillary campaign to astroturf social media. Yeah, I&#39;m sure there was astroturf, but the impact this election has had on the Internet feels a lot different than any other election the Internet has seen yet. Probably has a lot to do with all of Hillary&#39;s and the DNC&#39;s scandals involving hacks, leaks, and emails and the fact that as each year goes by more and more people &quot;live&quot; on the Internet now. </p>

<p>Indeed. Reddit was created as a community to give people a voice, now what we got is a repeater for content from &quot;reputable media&quot; aka big money corporate media. It&#39;s sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And freedom to choose.  That&#39;s what gets me into problems on Reddit. I&#39;m not pro or against vaccines I just want to have the right to choose what goes in my body. I am not against GMO&#39;s I just want to know so I CAN MAKE THE CHOICE to eat them. The mods here think they like the government should make the choice for everyone. Most people like that on Reddit. They don&#39;t want to think. They would like the government to do that for them. Like lemmings they want to be told what to do, how to behave and how to think. Never ever think outside the ordinary. Yikes!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing that this is the reason why they flooded Usenet with warez and crap; Usenet was decentralised and had no moderators.  Of course, most Millennials probably don&#39;t know about Usenet, and would probably consider it too hard to use if they did.  Google is trying hard to create a single central Usenet server as a means of destroying the network, as well; just as it is doing with DNS.</p>
