    <div class="md"><p>You have existed forever, and you always will. There is no end to you, (and there is no beginning either). I know that sounds a bit hippy-dippy, (as we used to say in the 60s), but it is true.</p>

<p>Allow me to explain - prior to this life, you existed as a spirit intelligence, gained knowledge, and prepared yourself for this difficult and confusing mortal existence. We call this state of being &quot;the pre-existence&quot;. You were schooled and tutored and prepared, likely through eons of time, by those who had already taken a similar mortal journey themselves.</p>

<p>This beautiful world where you now find yourself was prepared by a loving God specifically for you to make progress and achieve personal growth, and most importantly, gain truth in a different realm or phase of yourself existence.</p>

<p>You now find yourself in the second major &quot;act&quot; (if you will) of your personal &quot;play&quot;, and are now having a mortal experience. Your spirit (your core essence) is now incorporated (literally &quot;in the body&quot;). </p>

<p>Being mortal presents all kind of new challenges and opportunities for you to learn, grow, adhere to truth, and most importantly - find God&#39;s purpose for you and obey his laws. Your search for truth is yours alone - you will have to sift through falsehoods, competing voices, violence, deception, sickness, struggle, and physical appetites in order to find the path. It&#39;s up to you - there is truly one path, and many will be willing to guide you or deceive you, but your quest for truth and light is ultimately between you and God.</p>

<p>Your mortal sojourn will be very brief, but hopefully you will use your time well and continue your progression and grow in knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p>Now, to answer your original question - when you die, you will pass back to being a spirit entity, but only for a relatively brief period.  Eventually you will be resurrected, but your existence and progress and learning will never end - it will continue eternally, and so will you.</p>

<p>Finally, here&#39;s the best news - your Father will reward you more than you can imagine for the conscious and willing choice you made to come to this earth, to progress, to suffer, and to learn. (You followed the same path he did, and he will reward you accordingly.) You can&#39;t imagine what awaits you, and how much he respects the decision you made to have this experience. That&#39;s why he provided a perfect example and Redeemer for you - because of his love and respect for you.</p>

<p>I know this world is tough, and that things appear to be melting down. You are surrounded by lies, violence, greed, and falsehoods, but guess what? - the only reason you find <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> compelling is because you know that things aren&#39;t as they seem. Keep searching! What an opportunity to prove your mettle. Keep your chin up - it&#39;s just school, it&#39;s just a test!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of the argument comes from people trying to define God. My belief is that &#39;God&#39; is essentially literally everything. On some level you and your consciousness exist as pure energy, and you can interpret that to mean E=mc<sup>2</sup> or think of it as your &#39;soul&#39;. While everything appears as separate from our personal perspectives, everything in existence is connected and exists in a sea of energy (or a singularity, same thing <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>). Plus, if consciousness is just specific patterns of energy which allow for recursive thought/self awareness, who&#39;s to say the universe as a whole isn&#39;t structured similarly and conscious on a scale we can&#39;t even imagine? </p>

<p>Every atom in existence is influencing the atoms that make up you and everyone else in subtle ways since gravity/electromagnetism are infinite. To me, everything that exists is a part of God. Everything that happens is driven by this force in the background which sustains reality and keeps it moving in a sense. The very concept of God to me is indefinable as any words or concepts you may think up to define it are inherently part of it by their very existence. It&#39;s not some judging old man in the clouds, it simply is. Good and bad. Both are subjective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seriously hate this type of talk.</p>

<p>It might be possible in a world where everyone is born into the same circumstances, with the same genes, in the same environment, but it&#39;s completely illogical to believe this nonsense in a world like ours.</p>

<p>There are many &quot;thugs&quot; that stay in the inner city and gangbang their entire life because it&#39;s what they grew up with and it&#39;s all they know, what about them? </p>

<p>There&#39;s so many examples that I could come up with but I just don&#39;t care, I absolutely despise this religious propaganda bullshit.</p>

<p>To say this you must have the most sheltered life imaginable, likely never going outside to see what circumstances other people live in, it&#39;s pathetic and selfish. It&#39;s also egotistical because you view yourself as &quot;better&quot; than others because you act the way your religion wants you to, so you look down on others, it&#39;s hypocritical, egotistical, selfish, and in fact, against everything your religion supposedly stands for. But of course, blind religious fanatics will never see that hypocrisy even if it&#39;s told to them in the clearest way possible.</p>

<p>Read about other&#39;s near death experiences, they meet their chosen god, some see buddha, krishna, jesus, etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the comment I originally replied to. Godly quintessence is inside all things, so yes in that way God is you and you are God. But God is also very independent, He is doing something that I have yet to figure out. All the actions, set ups and organization. What would God need or want to do? If one can do anything, what would one do? He is adaptive so when you meet him be yourself. A lot of negative stigma comes attached with God, like he is a tyrant or a uber Dad. He has human attributes far more advanced than our humanity, purer and more Distilled. Everyone knows their own fuck ups and for the most part had some sort of justification, even if it&#39;s a bad one. And God obviously gets this, He understands mortality and the universe. He made it. God will be your favorite once you meet him. I can totally get why many people who die, stay dead. It&#39;s nice, pleasant, fuck it even smells great and you don&#39;t even have a nose!</p>

<p>Then people get all bent out of shape because of the Devil. Devil is a joke, there is not some battle between good and evil going on in the heavens. We have been duped by actors in this reality and control mechanisms of religious dogmas posing as the real deal.</p>

<p>Even people who slam DMT or Ayahuasca have only a intoxicated blurred lens into that world. Same with lucid dreaming. It&#39;s a drab shade of the full color palette. Only in death.</p>

<p>Ask questions, I asked God if I would be breaking some sort divine law if I spoke of this, and He wanted people to know and did not signal me to stfu.</p>

<p>Another sect in one of the thousands of religions, saying that the devil doesn&#39;t exist, yet most sects of christianity says that &quot;it&quot; does.</p>

<p>Not to mention, if god is everything, then it is also the devil.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re showing your ignorance by calling this &quot;god&quot; a &quot;he&quot; when everything doesn&#39;t have a gender.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Same with lucid dreaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I lucid dream ALL the time, it&#39;s simply taking control of your dreams. The world around you is set and you can manipulate the things inside of it, this has nothing to do with spirituality and everything to do with your brain. You will never see anything that you haven&#39;t seen before in your waking life in a dream, this includes things you&#39;ve imagined (like if you&#39;ve pictured C&#39;thulu and then dream about it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He wanted people to know </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you go again with assigning a gender to an apparently god being. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s also just ignore the simple fact that this god being should be able to just appear right in front of us and be like &quot;hey bro this is how it is&quot; and doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You have no idea how many times I&#39;ve asked and commanded it to tell me these things you speak of. The answers I get are not from an entity outside of myself, and I&#39;ve confirmed this many times throughout experiments over the last 12 years when I started questioning my religious upbringing.</p>

<p>The consciousness creates the world around you, not a god being. If you really want something, within a period of a few days to a couple months you will have it, it has nothing to do with god and everything to do with you.</p>

<p>Your experiments won&#39;t do much dude, since we are talking about death here. If you can find a way to die and come back in an experiment then maybe. </p>

<p>It looks like your set man. You&#39;ve made up your mind and like I said it&#39;s ok. </p>

<p>&quot;Consciousness creates the world around you, not a god being......&quot; Uh no- consciousness has a strong influence, yes, but your Mario bro and Gods hooking you up with killer maps, stages, obstacles, etcetera. I wish I and others could &quot;really want something&quot; so much that we get it, what a world that would be! No tho, earned moresoover, paid ahead or will pay later. </p>

<p>Whatever floats your boat man, if believing in the flying spaghetti monster gets you through the day then more power to you. I don&#39;t need beliefs to enjoy life, I enjoy it for what it is, and find the world fascinating even with it being utterly completely corrupt.

    <div class="md"><p>To accept any ideas of the possibility of life after death, one must first have convincing evidence of the possibility. One source comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/4uo5sy/consciousness_cant_exist_without_a_brain/d5ts1yx">theoretical physics</a> which doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility of an afterlife. Then there is the phenomenon of near-death experiences and related phenomena which supports the <a href="http://www.near-death.com/science/evidence.html">Afterlife Hypothsis</a>. There is also <a href="http://www.near-death.com/science/research/science.html">scientific and metaphysical evidence</a> suggestive of the existence an afterlife. And for those people who cannot accept the concept of an afterlife without proof of God&#39;s existence, there is <a href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/cbenzmueller/papers/C40.pdf">Gödel&#39;s ontological proof</a>.</p>

<p>Knowledge of what happens after death can best be found from <a href="http://www.near-death.com/">those who have crossed over</a> to the realm of the afterlife and returned to tell others. Surveys have shown that <a href="http://www.near-death.com/resources/faq.html">millions of such people</a> worldwide have had a near-death experience (NDE). One such person who has spent more time in the afterlife realm, and wrote more about it, is the famous 18th century Swedish scientist and Christian mystic <a href="http://www.swedenborg.com/emanuel-swedenborg/about-life/">Emanuel Swedenborg</a>. The parallels between his <a href="http://www.near-death.com/science/research/out-of-body-experiences.html">out-of-body spiritual experiences</a> and NDEs are quite remarkable. So remarkable, in fact, that in <a href="http://www.near-death.com/science/experts/raymond-moody.html">Dr. Raymond Moody&#39;s</a> ground-breaking book on NDEs, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062517392/?tag=iandsorg-20">Life After Life</a>, has an entire section devoted these parallels which <a href="http://www.near-death.com/experiences/triggers/psychic-visions.html">you can read here</a>.</p>
