        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think most people who post here would agree that we have a government whose goals is to use the populace as a cash crop and exploit them for their own personal gains.  We have domestic spying, a federal reserve system of monetary slavery, and increasingly tyrannical behavior.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I propose that this will all end one way... with massive amounts of violence.  This is the way it has always been and always will be as long as there are individuals willing to use violence to get their way.</p>

<p>Take for instance, this idea:  Two men, Bill and Tom, have a disagreement about who owns a pencil.  Bill says it is his.  Tom says it is his.  Tom is not willing to kill Bill over his claim to the pencil.  Bill, on the other hand, is willing to kill Tom over his claim to the pencil.  </p>

<p>If Bill is willing to kill and Tom is not, then simple logic dictates that since Tom is not willing to reciprocate the level of aggression that Bill is, then Tom will cede ownership to Bill.</p>

<p>This is how government treats its citizens in all instances.</p>

<p>Try not paying your taxes because you are against making military contractors rich.</p>

<p>If you claim that you are the sole owner of the fruits of your labor, then you will be killed if you resist.  The same goes for every injustice that those in power force on the citizenry.</p>

<p>We are seeing this play out right now.  Democracy is being subverted and those in power are more than happy to let people stomp their feet and protest because it will not actually change anything.  They know that they have the force of violence on their side that the populace has been told on a bad thing.</p>

<p>Why should the government have a monopoly on violence?</p>

<p>No amount of hand-waving, feet stomping, and protesting will change anything.  Only when enough people get angry enough to take direct action against those who use violence to control them will we ever see anything change.</p>

<p>They are willing to kill you to get their way.  What are you willing to do?</p>

<p>[disclaimer]  I&#39;m not a violent guy and am only giving my opinion on how this will play out based on what has happened over and over again throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing a component to your theory.  The aspect of mind control.  The illusion that Bill gives Tom to make Tom believe letting Bill have the pencil is justified.  Otherwise, Tom will hate Bill and seek revenge in more subtle ways.  The illusion can be something as simple as &quot;I need the pencil so I can write stories about the poor.&quot; or &quot;This pencil is going to be given to a needy student.&quot;.  It does not matter if the pencil is actually used in these manners, it just gives Tom the illusion of self respect.  &quot;I was told the pencil was going to be used for good.&quot; even though deep down he knows Bill is an asshole.  The shame created by the lie keeps Tom from exacting revenge, because he knows he&#39;s a coward.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>They are willing to kill you to get their way. What are you willing to do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same unfortunate conclusion that I came to several years back. It’s something that has weighed somewhat heavily on the back of my mind and something so powerful that I rarely, if ever, reveal it.</p>

<p>There are some who draw a certain pleasure from this conclusion, and it is something that should only be spoken of in whispers or not at all. I take no pleasure in the idea myself, but <em>it boils down to the total extermination of certain families around the world, down the last unborn infant.</em></p>

<p>It’s not something to be proud of and it is not something that the history books should remember. It is a task for people who are ready to disappear with and for their deed. Playing the same game as our enemy only ensures their victory. No amount of protesting, whining, complaining, lobbying, investigating, or truth will ever put them out of business. Only cold and ruthless action will.</p>

<p>Just saying this honestly makes me a little sick to my stomach, because I already know that while it is one of our choices, it’s a choice they made for us. It is the most heinous option and effectively the only one we have. This will not end until either the Earth is destroyed or they are exterminated down to last man, woman, and child.</p>

<p>If it was as easy as executing a few, appealing to their “good” side through protests, writing laws, or sending a few to prison to get the message across, we wouldn’t be in this position. But now it seems that the only viable option is the only taboo one.</p>

<p><em>War.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed your whole post because it really accentuated the &quot;I hate to say it and I hate that we are put in this position and it makes me sick... &quot; aspect of the whole issue.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the worst part about it for me... I&#39;m not a killer.  I&#39;m not the guy who can do anything of the sort.  So knowing that it is the only choice makes me feel really neutered and helpless in the situation.</p>

<p>On another point, I believe this is why we are so heavily indoctrinated with the idea of &quot;non-violent protest&quot; being the only way of bringing about change.  Those who are in power want the people they control to be helpless and neutered and teach them to be that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing about violence is we are taught at an early age that violence is wrong. Then in school you learn through your own experience that it is the only way out of a situation if you are bullyed. 
Boxing, and martial arts are still very popular and a lot of people train to be able to handle situations that arise where violence may be the only way out. </p>

<p>When governments disagree they go to war and grow to new heights of violence. Yet the individual is taught violence is not the way civilized society should be. </p>

<p>The media is pushing the whole population of USA to violence. 
It&#39;s black vs white or police vs citizens. 
This is their plan. 
Start a conflict and then the solution will be globalization. 
Violence is likely to happen but I think that is what they are hoping for. They know we are their enemy but we&#39;re not really sure who really is our enemy. I&#39;m guessing when the violence goes down they real enemy will be hiding somewhere while they have soldiers fighting for them. </p>

<p>The better option to violence is intelligent moves like firing every single congressman and senator and reform the system to exclude the influence of private interests. We need the best people to want to lead the country not these asshole sell outs we have right now. 
I would prefer to not participate in the violence because we will only be tearing our cities down while the machine remains in place. </p>

<p>How often has congressional approval rating been above 50%?  <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx</a></p>

<p>And yet the same people and their facsimiles continue to be voted in.  Almost everyone can be manipulated in some fashion by those who are willing to do so.</p>

<p>Further... the investment to control the actions of 500 or so people in congress, the senate, and the president means that you only have to control about .0000016% of the population.  That&#39;s a pretty good investment to control the largest economy in the world.  </p>

<p>Maybe the best option is to not give people power over other people.</p>

<p>If you think that people turning on each other is what we are talking about, then I don&#39;t think you get the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence against who exactly? You need to know who your true enemy is, or else you&#39;ll commit violence against the innocent.</p>

<p>The true way out is through mass awareness. A well informed population capable of critical thinking will withdraw their consent for the state and fiat money itself, and this false reality will crumble. The beast requires our consent to exist, and so withdrawing it on a mass scale will starve it to death.</p>

<p>But the cowardly PTB operate on stealth and deception through their control of the mainstream media, so nothing will change as long as the truth is withheld from us.</p>

<p>Violence against who exactly?</p>

<p>I would never name individuals who I would personally think deserve retaliation with the way our &quot;security&quot; state operates nowadays.  Furthermore, I am simply commenting on the situation using history and logic as a basis for discussion.  I am not an agitator or provoker of violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true way out is through mass awareness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have discussed elsewhere in the thread... this will do nothing.  You can be aware of something all that you want, but unless you are willing to escalate the level of violence to meet government force, then they will win.</p>

<p>The Clintons, for instance, are more than happy to let people stomp their feet and throw fits because it results in no change to the status quo.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The beast requires our consent to exist, and so withdrawing it on a mass scale will starve it to death.</p>

<p>Or they will escalate the use of force to keep the citizenry in line, as has been seen with oppressive regimes throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are describing an extreme form of  <a href="http://sociology.about.com/od/Sociological-Theory/a/Conflict-Theory.htm">Social Conflict Theory</a>. Karl Marx was a big believer in this theory.</p>

<p>While I won&#39;t share my personal thoughts on the matter, I will say that there are many other competing theories. One of the criticisms of Social Conflict Theory is that it doesn&#39;t take into account the need for stability that seems pervasive in every human society. In other words, people are willing to live in horrible conditions as long as those conditions offer some sort of security. Look at a place like North Korea, with horrible civil rights violations and citizens who often go hungry. It&#39;s all &quot;good&quot;, though, because they are told that going hungry is all for the glory of the Great Leader and their sacrifice is not in vain. They are doing their civic duty, after all.  Clearly, there is some mechanism in human psychology/sociology which prevents a massive uprising in North Korea, something that Social Conflict Theory doesn&#39;t explain.</p>

<p>Violence against who exactly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would never name individuals who I would personally think deserve retaliation with the way our &quot;security&quot; state operates nowadays.  Furthermore, I am simply commenting on the situation using history and logic as a basis for discussion.  I am not an agitator or provoker of violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The true way out is through mass awareness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have discussed elsewhere in the thread... this will do nothing.  You can be aware of something all that you want, but unless you are willing to escalate the level of violence to meet government force, then they will win.</p>

<p>The Clintons, for instance, are more than happy to let people stomp their feet and throw fits because it results in no change to the status quo.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The beast requires our consent to exist, and so withdrawing it on a mass scale will starve it to death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or they will escalate the use of force to keep the citizenry in line, as has been seen with oppressive regimes throughout history.</p>
