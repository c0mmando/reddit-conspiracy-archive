    <div class="md"><p>Only 7 weeks ago it was all the rage in this sub.</p>

<p>Omar Mateen was the alleged terrorist that shot up the Orlando Night Club.</p>

<p>His wife went missing right around the time she started talking to reporters and saying the FBI was lying about her and her intentions. The FBI tried to make it seem like she knew he wanted to kill people and she aided him in purchasing guns as well as staking out the club beforehand. Then, mysteriously, the FBI lost track of her.</p>

<p>Did police apprehend/kill him (I don&#39;t remember anything/I&#39;m garbage) or did they wait for SWAT/Military?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a hazy story, but apparently the police were there within minutes and there was a standoff / hail of gunfire. Apparently patrons were shot by police. Then the police sat around for something like 2 hours waiting for SWAT. This is not standard procedure as far as I know. Usually they will act swiftly and de-escalate an active shooter situation within 10 minutes. This is strong evidence (to me) that the scene was tampered with and a cover up of some sort took place. Then there&#39;s that story of the other guy Howell who was caught on his way to a gay parade in LA and apparently told authorities he was working the same operation as Mateen, for the CIA. It&#39;s all very fishy to say the least.</p>

<p>I&#39;d encourage you to do a search in this sub on the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the death certificate I found for omar mateen. 
Says at the bottom void if altered, and it has been.
According to this he was white though other sources say he was middle eastern. And his time of death was 9999.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is something I haven&#39;t seen yet. Thanks!!!</p>

<p>When is it proper to use 9999 as time of death?</p>

<p>Maybe the shooting had something to do with his father running for president in Afghanistan and holding pro-Islamist views. Maybe he father is running against US interests which were installed there after we invaded. His father has a TV show that criticizes Afghanistan&#39;s government and Pakistan. He also met with officials (John Kerry) at the White House.</p>

<p>Does the following interview with Omar&#39;s father seem like their family was a bunch of radicalized terrorists? Or does it just raise more questions?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/us/orlando-gunman-father/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/us/orlando-gunman-father/</a></p>

<p>Another article, check out the part about Osama Bin Laden, Ronald Reagan, 9/11 and Mujahadeen:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/06/20/document-reveals-omar-mateens-father-tied-radical-islamist-groups/">http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/06/20/document-reveals-omar-mateens-father-tied-radical-islamist-groups/</a></p>

<p>Maybe it goes a lot deeper than an AR-15 mass shooting at PULSE nightclub...</p>

<p>Was Omar set up to be there at PULSE through his security job, then assassinated?</p>

<p>What explains the 2 hour SWAT delay and extremely fake sounding phone call Omar supposedly made while inside the club, pledging his allegiance to Allah and ISIS?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you had to wait so long for what is probably going to be a disappointing answer.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain the father in terms of his leanings. His interview leaves some questions.
If my son had just died I wouldn&#39;t be doing interviews though I&#39;m not sure of how close they were. He seems relatively genuine but I&#39;m no profiler.
I&#39;m also not much of a sleuth, I focused on what I could find on social media which seemed to reveal some inconsistencies, in regards to mina justice and christine leinonen, being that they seemed to have very little association to their supposed &quot;children&quot; and neither did any other members of the family. 
There was the omar page that got pulled straight after the events that had one post of a picture saying &quot;there is no power on earth that can undo pakistan&quot; could have just been a fake page, but why pull it? 
It also states he was from Islamabad, pakistan. Which doesn&#39;t line up with him being either Saudi Arabian or white(?) 
All seemed very sloppy.
Christine leinonen had a couple of photos with her &quot;son&quot; from 2014 and apparently its not hard to alter a timeline on FB,
But prior to 2014 she doesn&#39;t exist in his timeline at all.</p>

<p>Plus one thing which I just noticed on the death certificate is it states omar died in a public building? I assumed (could be wrong) nightclubs were private buildings because they are not government owned in full or in part. It&#39;s actually more annoying than you&#39;d think to find info on what buildings are classed as private and public.
I&#39;m under the impression public buildings are things like hospitals, schools government buildings etc. Though I&#39;m not from the U.S. and things might be classed differently there.</p>

<p>If I think of, or find anything else I&#39;ll let you know.</p>

<p>Again sorry for the lack of insight in regards to your questions, but it seems no matter how you look at this event things don&#39;t add up. </p>
