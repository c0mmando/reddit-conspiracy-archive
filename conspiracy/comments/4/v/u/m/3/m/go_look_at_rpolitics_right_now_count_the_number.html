       I didn't ask you. However, I agree. Most people that like Hillary, usually blindly accept her because they think Trump is a bad choice, yet only read the 140 characters that are given to the headline space. (Meaning, those supporters are operating under false pretenses) 
Which makes matters slightly worse. 
Not only is it stupid for being ignorant on just how god fucking awful Hillary is, the reasons for accepting the ignorance are also ignorant.

       TIL trying to keep jobs in America, for Americans is racist as fuck. How is securing our borders racist? I mean you probably have a fence in your backyard, and you probably lock the doors while you're asleep or away.

       I'm paraphrasing but you get the point. You can't deny trump doesn't say racist shit, just like how you can't deny Clinton lied to us. Don't make me find sauce... cause you know it would take me like 5 seconds to prove trump says racist things.

       It seems like youre entirely missing the point. On the subject of refugees, he says that terrorists could very easily slip in with them, and they have been (france, US, literally all of europe). That isnt racist, terrorists isnt a race, and neither is islam. As for the mexican statement, it is a geographic coincidence that many illegal immigrants are mexican. Trump has an issue with the illegal immigration aspect of it, not the mexican aspect. There would be no issue if they immigrated legally.

       In that DNC email leak there was correspondence relating to spinning the entire trump campaign in collusion with the MSM as racist. I stand by my earlier statement. Trump has not said anything racist during his entire campaign. Just because I know it will come up, i'll talk about that mexican judge debacle. If you listen to the interview, trump is voicing concern about a conflict of interest with the judge appointed to the Trump University case, saying that he has mexican heritage and ties to mexican political groups. Which, by the way, was true.

       Its everywhere.  Dont bother watching any mainstream news show.  The daily show is particularly bad... they used to rip on hillary about 35% of the show and trump the rest.  Now its a pro hillary show that rips on trump nonstop.  You can see everyone rallying to stop trump.  This election is one hell of a show to watch with open eyes.

       The more they push people, the more they will push them into Trumps camp. I mean, honestly speaking here; if there was no collusion between the DNC, Hillary and the mainstream media against Bernie, no 250000 speeches to Goldmen Sachs, no Email scandal, and no shady past with foreign funds I might very well of voted for her. However the more the MSM  (the same one that colludide with HRC) tries to spin trump the more I (a former Bernie supporter) check out r/the_donald. The more I check that sub out; the more my support shifts to Donald Trump, and every time I say to myself "This is madness, I can't vote for Trump" i remember everything HRC has done and my inner thoughts say "I might actually vote for the guy" and I know I am not the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the MSM colluded with HRC against Bernie, it's more then probable that they are doing the same thing against Trump. I'm not about to let the media hijack the democratic process and if they lied about Bernie; there's a pretty good chance they are lying about trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence, they've played their hand, the public is aware of it. The next leak will be the nail in the coffin for her campaign, and the only person to blame is Hillary Clinton.

       You're not man. I share your same sentiments. Bernie supporter here. But this onslaught against Trump when Hillary has done worse crap is just too much for me. I'm with Stein at the moment, but I'm really starting to think that I will vote for Trump just to send a message to these dopes. The MSM is just a joke right now. And the more they focus on these nontroversies the more it pisses me off and want to vote for the guy.

       I am definitely not going to vote for Hillary, but I cannot vote for Trump either. Looking at his VP pick and the other people who were possible VP picks, and listening to any of his speeches or interviews, gives me the impression that he most definitely unfit to be president. I will most likely vote for Stein because it appears the Libertarian party is going to get at least 10% of the vote, so they will get federal funding for the next election, and if we can get the green party to 5% they will be able to get federal funding next election too.

       If you're like me and you believe Trump is just there to disrupt the GOP in order guarantee Hillary's win in November, then you shouldn't be surprised. The MSM is already ramping up the anti-Trump rhetoric and I fully expect him to make it easy by saying even more idiotic/offensive things in the coming months.

       I think you're both right. It started out as a prank to help his friends the Clintons, but then the monster he created started liking the attention, and at some point in his 'big brain thinking' he thought he could actually do it for real. But his only goal is winning; he doesn't want to be president and there's already talk of him handing over all domestic and foreign policy creation to his VP Pence. He is so unqualified for the job, that's almost a relief, except when you realise what a religious nutter Pence is.

       LOL what warped reality do you live in? The MSM doesn't give a fuck about candidates having verbal slip ups. The fact that you think Trump's racist, disrespectful rhetoric is comparable to Hillary misspeaking is seriously troublesome to me. Trump is in the media right now for insulting the parents of a fallen war hero, as I am sure you are aware. That is on a whole different level than a slip up.

       Hillary has made pretty severe gaffes of her own, but this is not one of them.

       What is this 'misspeaking' you're talking about. Hillary straight up lied about everything involving the email scandal, and continues to do so
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the FBI told everyone she broke the law. She lied under oath. That's
       <strong>
        <em>
         treason
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one small part of the whole Clinton clusterfuckery. How can you possibly not be 'in the know' about how corrupt she is whilst simultaneously subbed to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? To suggest that Trumps rhetoric is far worse than Hillary's careless and dangerous actions is just plain delusion.

       I think that part of the conspiracy here is that Trump is a Hillary plant. There are lots of negative articles because he says dumb shit constantly, he's purposely throwing the election so she can win. She knew that he was the only person she could beat.

       However, this is in no way condoning the pro-Hillary articles, or saying that there is no mod bias or Hillary shills/bots.

       Well it makes sense, OP. It's demographic isolation - part of what they do is create echo chambers. That's why /pol/ is super Trump, and why most of reddit super Hillary. They designed it that way. Remember Cruz hiring an ex CIA meme expert? Yes.

       Shills' very nature is to make reality appear different from how it really is. Think about that.

       Couldn't you say the same about this sub too though? The number of anti-Hilary posts vs the number of anti-Trump posts is astounding.

       It sort of reminds me of when people still thought Bernie Sanders had a chance...

       Where were all of you complaining then, when Bernie spam dominated the entire subreddit?

       It seems like youre entirely missing the point. On the subject of refugees, he says that terrorists could very easily slip in with them, and they have been (france, US, literally all of europe). That isnt racist, terrorists isnt a race, and neither is islam. As for the mexican statement, it is a geographic coincidence that many illegal immigrants are mexican. Trump has an issue with the illegal immigration aspect of it, not the mexican aspect. There would be no issue if they immigrated legally.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that DNC email leak there was correspondence relating to spinning the entire trump campaign in collusion with the MSM as racist. I stand by my earlier statement. Trump has not said anything racist during his entire campaign. Just because I know it will come up, i'll talk about that mexican judge debacle. If you listen to the interview, trump is voicing concern about a conflict of interest with the judge appointed to the Trump University case, saying that he has mexican heritage and ties to mexican political groups. Which, by the way, was true.
