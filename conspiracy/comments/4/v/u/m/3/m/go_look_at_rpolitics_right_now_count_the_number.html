    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t ask you. However, I agree. Most people that like Hillary, usually blindly accept her because they think Trump is a bad choice, yet only read the 140 characters that are given to the headline space. (Meaning, those supporters are operating under false pretenses) 
Which makes matters slightly worse. 
Not only is it stupid for being ignorant on just how god fucking awful Hillary is, the reasons for accepting the ignorance are also ignorant.<br/>
Seems like a solid foundation of muck we have here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like youre entirely missing the point. On the subject of refugees, he says that terrorists could very easily slip in with them, and they have been (france, US, literally all of europe). That isnt racist, terrorists isnt a race, and neither is islam. As for the mexican statement, it is a geographic coincidence that many illegal immigrants are mexican. Trump has an issue with the illegal immigration aspect of it, not the mexican aspect. There would be no issue if they immigrated legally.</p>

<p>In that DNC email leak there was correspondence relating to spinning the entire trump campaign in collusion with the MSM as racist. I stand by my earlier statement. Trump has not said anything racist during his entire campaign. Just because I know it will come up, i&#39;ll talk about that mexican judge debacle. If you listen to the interview, trump is voicing concern about a conflict of interest with the judge appointed to the Trump University case, saying that he has mexican heritage and ties to mexican political groups. Which, by the way, was true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more they push people, the more they will push them into Trumps camp. I mean, honestly speaking here; if there was no collusion between the DNC, Hillary and the mainstream media against Bernie, no 250000 speeches to Goldmen Sachs, no Email scandal, and no shady past with foreign funds I might very well of voted for her. However the more the MSM  (the same one that colludide with HRC) tries to spin trump the more I (a former Bernie supporter) check out r/the_donald. The more I check that sub out; the more my support shifts to Donald Trump, and every time I say to myself &quot;This is madness, I can&#39;t vote for Trump&quot; i remember everything HRC has done and my inner thoughts say &quot;I might actually vote for the guy&quot; and I know I am not the only one.</p>

<p>I mean the MSM colluded with HRC against Bernie, it&#39;s more then probable that they are doing the same thing against Trump. I&#39;m not about to let the media hijack the democratic process and if they lied about Bernie; there&#39;s a pretty good chance they are lying about trump.</p>

<p>In essence, they&#39;ve played their hand, the public is aware of it. The next leak will be the nail in the coffin for her campaign, and the only person to blame is Hillary Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am definitely not going to vote for Hillary, but I cannot vote for Trump either. Looking at his VP pick and the other people who were possible VP picks, and listening to any of his speeches or interviews, gives me the impression that he most definitely unfit to be president. I will most likely vote for Stein because it appears the Libertarian party is going to get at least 10% of the vote, so they will get federal funding for the next election, and if we can get the green party to 5% they will be able to get federal funding next election too.</p>

The fact that you think Trump&#39;s racist, disrespectful rhetoric is comparable to Hillary misspeaking is seriously troublesome to me.

<p>What is this &#39;misspeaking&#39; you&#39;re talking about. Hillary straight up lied about everything involving the email scandal, and continues to do so <em>after</em> the FBI told everyone she broke the law. She lied under oath. That&#39;s <strong><em>treason</em></strong>. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just one small part of the whole Clinton clusterfuckery. How can you possibly not be &#39;in the know&#39; about how corrupt she is whilst simultaneously subbed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? To suggest that Trumps rhetoric is far worse than Hillary&#39;s careless and dangerous actions is just plain delusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that part of the conspiracy here is that Trump is a Hillary plant. There are lots of negative articles because he says dumb shit constantly, he&#39;s purposely throwing the election so she can win. She knew that he was the only person she could beat. </p>

<p>However, this is in no way condoning the pro-Hillary articles, or saying that there is no mod bias or Hillary shills/bots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like youre entirely missing the point. On the subject of refugees, he says that terrorists could very easily slip in with them, and they have been (france, US, literally all of europe). That isnt racist, terrorists isnt a race, and neither is islam. As for the mexican statement, it is a geographic coincidence that many illegal immigrants are mexican. Trump has an issue with the illegal immigration aspect of it, not the mexican aspect. There would be no issue if they immigrated legally.</p>

<p>In that DNC email leak there was correspondence relating to spinning the entire trump campaign in collusion with the MSM as racist. I stand by my earlier statement. Trump has not said anything racist during his entire campaign. Just because I know it will come up, i&#39;ll talk about that mexican judge debacle. If you listen to the interview, trump is voicing concern about a conflict of interest with the judge appointed to the Trump University case, saying that he has mexican heritage and ties to mexican political groups. Which, by the way, was true.</p>
