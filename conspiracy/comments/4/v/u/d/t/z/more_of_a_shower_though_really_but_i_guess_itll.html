        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I get in a lot of &quot;trouble&quot; with my friends for my opinions and wanting to discuss and analyze stuff. I am not the &quot;dude,  you gotta wake up&quot; kinda guy but I&#39;ll always state what I believe to be true and disagree with the group if it comes to that. I do listen to what everybody has to say, respectively and quietly, and when it&#39;s my turn to speak I try to be calm and clear. </p>

<p>Like I said, these are (some of) my friends and it has always been like this. I&#39;m the crazy guy and we all get along. They consider themselves to be really open minded and modern people. </p>

<p>Thing is it&#39;s not working like that anymore. Some topics are untouchable. I&#39;ll get labeled something right away with a strawman argument and that&#39;s that. 
It&#39;s like religious taboo or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a learned method to stop dialog and has been the model to copy for several decades now.  </p>

<p>If you stop polite discourse, you stop discourse and if discourse is stopped there are no bridges to unity or even understanding, acceptance and compromise.  </p>

<p>That means we have been carefully taught by our media, all of them, books, newspapers, magazines, and of course especially television and movies to be disrespectful, rude, belligerent and adversarial and confrontational. </p>

<p>It was once considered socially and  politically ostracizing to be so aggressively controversial and belligerent.  If you were  you were excluded, now </p>

<p>we have a Presidential candidate who personifies, embodies and glorifies the technique.</p>

<p>The second I bring up ANYTHING that&#39;s related to this sub, &quot;that&#39;s crazy conspiracy shit&quot;. Then I ask him to define conspiracy, and he never can. It&#39;s routine. I bring up the 28 pages that got released? &quot;That&#39;s BS. It&#39;s made up. Where are your sources?&quot; Then I show him the mainstream sources he wants then reverts to &quot;I don&#39;t care. It doesn&#39;t affect me.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s irritating as fuck. I can&#39;t even finish my thought without being labeled as a nutter. It&#39;s not just him, his two brothers are the same way. These are guys who have traveled the world, seen a lot of shit. They refuse to acknowledge that bad shit can and does happen in this country. And they won&#39;t care until it&#39;s right in front of their faces by which point it&#39;ll be too late.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay you&#39;re still in that first reactionary stage, move on to accepting that everyone can be an idiot (including us) yet we can eventually all come to the same level of understanding. There isn&#39;t a solve-all solution, what brought you there won&#39;t bring them. Learning is individualized not rigid in structure and locked a certain way.

    <div class="md"><p>A liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in an argument.
<strong>– Robert Frost</strong></p>

<p>To argue with a person who has renounced the use of reason is like administering medicine to the dead.
<strong>– Thomas Paine</strong></p>

<p>clung to liberal fantasies as long as I could.  It is pleasant to feel oneself superior to mean-spirited conservatives.  Agreeable delusion fought a slow, losing battle against disagreeable reality.
    <strong>– Jared Taylor</strong></p>

<p>Tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society.
<strong>– Aristotle</strong></p>

<p>It is not the evil itself which is horrifying about our times–it is the way we not only tolerate evil, but have made a cult of positively worshipping weakness, depravity, rottenness and evil itself.
    <strong>– George Lincoln Rockwell</strong></p>

<p>Nope. It’s pointed at idiots who can’t be taught.</p>
