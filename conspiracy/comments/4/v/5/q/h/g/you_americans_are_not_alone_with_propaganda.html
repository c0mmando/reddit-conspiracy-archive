       Just heard part of Hilary's speech from radio and I was fucking disgusted by her voice and blatant lies and we do it together bullshit. After the speech trailer news anchor told something like hillary is liberal Muslim lover and Trump is next Hitler, the dictator.

       Edit. Presidential election should be between many super fucking intellect people with many different views, instead it is a pick between lesser of two evils. I am sick and tired of this hypocrisy we live in worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2. 
I am surprised to see that so many countries have pro shillary propaganda. What's the point of that? We don't vote in America. I understand that all western countries do somewhat follow America's global politics but it still feels like shooting a fly with ICBM

       I heard the leaks mentioned on the Beeb, but only to say that the Russians had hacked the DNC - nothing about the actual content of the leaks! Not a single mention of the protesting Bernie supporters though.

       The BBC are completely manipulated, but sooooo many people I know still think of them as unbiased. They were awful around Brexit too... constantly pushing the "all Brexiters are right wing racists" narrative (completely ignoring the likes of the RMT union leader, and other left wing-advocates for Brexit).

       The BBC are horrendously biased on most issues. You could see it in the council elections this year. They rehearsed scripts for heavy labour losses. When it turned out Corbyns Labour won by a significant margin, they reported it asif the Tories had won... and labour was on a knife edge?! Bringing up irrelevant party disputes to distract from their win.  It was utterly disgusting to watch.

       He knew what the world was turning in to, he told everyone, then killed himself. Wonder where we'd be today if he hadn't. Could you imagine a HST presidential campaign? I mean I know he probably wouldn't have ever done it, but still interesting to think of considering his Freak Power days.

       First, I want to thank everyone from different "democratic" countries for commenting. It's important that we stay connected and communicate as to what is taking place in our regions. Each country is a piece of the puzzle that the globalists will try to fit together to become one world governance...NWO.

       George W. Bush significantly lowered the bar against the "super fucking intellect people with many different views". The way in which he was elected, again fraudulently, and his painfully obvious low IQ and moronic attitude set a precedent. W paved the way for obscenely high levels of corruption, incompetence and war mongering around the world. US government does not, in any way shape or form represent AMERICA. It represents elite global society, high level financial corruption and the criminality of premeditated and preempted war.

       As an American that was once proud of that fact, I feel sick when I look at this freak show of an election. The election of Hillary Clinton's presidency is a staged event. The primaries were rigged by the DNC and

       The last 16 years have been a beat down on the American people. DHS, "Patriot" Act, Militarized Police State, TSA, NDAA.....and the like are all points of control over the people. Until the American people rise up against this tyranny and honor the founding fathers, we're fucked. Tragically, at this point in time many Americans still don't care as long as they have their TV and their shiny objects of mass distraction...they won't even notice.

       I think more and more people are realizing just how staged it all is because of the Internet and social media. The speed to which things are brought to attention is insane now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember how there were pictures of something in the back of bushs jacket during the debates? Like someone was transmitting to him what to say so he didn't have to think? It was staged back then, and probably many elections before that but we didnt notice as much. if one or 5 people saw something awry and tried to tell their friends, who are they going to spread the message to pre internet? The media? They would just label them crazy and discredit them. Or told shut up and toe the party line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when someone points something out its via cell phone video broadcasted live so you cant deny it ever happened as shit like the white noise generators at the dnc went viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the shenanigans at the DNC are being reported by the MSM today and imagine a world pre cell phones. If i came home and started to tell people they were confiscating signs and had white noise machines theyd probably think im crazy and it would become a conspiracy theory years down the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would be told if that was true then  why are people on TV not talking about it? Youre just making shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       No longer, but the Internet and social media is the biggest threat to the elites right now. The control of information.. Even with all the censorship of Twitter, Facebook, google, reddit can't stop all of the information from leaking out and its a huge threat to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy the Internet while its still somewhat free.

       The "Clinton Cash" book/video really shows how the Clinton's are screwing people all over the world. It's one thing if we are stupid enough in The States to vote for her here, but the fact that their foundation ruins lives globally is more than an American problem. So Sad.

       Same in Canada. Was in a religious studies class one day, and the prof decides to go off script and talk about trump. Told everyone how scared she was about him and invited debate. Out of everyone who decides to say something (probably 5 or 6 people - maybe a little more) only one kid decided to defend trump. I was impressed with him cause
      </p>
      <p>
       a). That was brave
b). He held his own
      </p>
      <p>
       But you wouldn't believe how left wing our society is up here. I really feel it's more automatic now. People don't think, they just blame trump and call him hitler. And the ones that do like trump are too shy to say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Obama was running for president in 2008, I was hearing rumours that people up here were sticking "vote Obama" signs on their lawn. About a month ago, some students in my class (summer school) said how they wish Obama could run for a third term! I honestly feel that a lot of people up here just run their mouths and don't understand what they're supporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not people still like Hillary is almost irrelevant now. So long as trump doesn't get elected its all gonna be okay. I honestly hope he does get elected! Not only do I not trust Hillary or the Democratic Party now, I would rather try my luck with a big mouth in office than a crook. But either way, the predominant view is Trump is somehow the worst and would screw the world over. I suppose it's the residue of globalist sentiments that haven't even been reflected on.

       They're doing it in Canada too! I've got CP24 on the entire workday behind me  and they keep playing stories portraying her in a positive light. Haven't heard much in the way of Trump and nothing about Bernie at all. It's disgusting how much they're idolising Shillary.
They reported a little bit on the DNC leaks but only to the extent of fear mongering about the Russians.

       propaganda here last night was saying how the democratic convention is showing a completely 'unified' party.
      </p>
      <p>
       No mention of the walkouts. No mention of the Bernie signs being confiscated. No mention of the protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then tacked on to the end, something about 'dark' Trump and how evil he is because he is encouraging the Russians to 'hack' more emails...without even mentioning the contents of the emails.

       Dude I see the same thing. I am not even voting and it's very weird. Even liberal news outlets atleast TALK about the DNC leaks or hillary's lies. 14 lies in her speech. Media here: "Well Trump makes good speeches. but he is a liar. Hillary is more honest." I was like... "What?" You can't look at all these scandals and say hillary is "honest". What are these guys smoking.

       Why are people not realizing Trump is the reverse side of the same coin? Stop thinking that he's a savior. It's all a set up, one that's so blatant that it's laughable. We've been so conditioned with skewed human interaction in the media that all this seems plausible (the smiling woman vs the frowning man) but when you're on the outside looking in, it's easy to see it's all one big show, or better yet a circus. I don't think we're even in the audience. No, we're part of the circus act as much as the dancing bears are. And then you have to wonder, who
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the audience enjoying this farce?
