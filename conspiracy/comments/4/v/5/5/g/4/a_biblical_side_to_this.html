       It's pretty obvious to me now what's unfolding. It has being for the past 2 years. Most people here in the UK are oblivious, lack critical thinking and seemingly have lost the ability to question anything. On topic we know what's coming for a starter. We know the NWO is basically going to try implement a one world government via a world war, most likely a devastating economic collapse and the spread of disease. My question is do many of you guys see the biblical side to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imo the Bible clearly depict's a one world government, one world currency type system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world wondering after the new world government. Because to the masses it seem's like a wonderful thing that's brought peace and prosperity while the people whom are awake know exactly what this is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This beast will rule over all nations and peoples. Arguably we know this NWO system is a one world government that intend's to rule over us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 13:17
      </p>
      <p>
       17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also debatable that we're going to be transitioning into a new economic model. A model which is completely controlled by the NWO beast system. A model in which people who speak out against this kind of thing you cannot buy or sell goods. They will have total control over us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately everyone has their own idea on exactly what their ultimate motive in this is. To me without the biblical side it seems kind of illogical. Why are they rushing this so much and causing people to wake up and resist? If they did this slowly over 500 years no one would have a clue. The only reason people are waking up is due to the speed in which they see these event's unfolding.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ultimately I'm asking whether you guys have considered this from a Biblical perspective. Either way God bless you all and I hope if you haven't you consider a Biblical perspective of this. Take care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Just going to clarify that I was not born into a religious family. The result of my Biblical outlook is solely looking into all the evil on goings,lies,war mongering and corruption that people are too blind to see. Mix that in with Occult symbolism, Masonry and the fact we're always told to belive in God is ridiculous. It seem's pretty obvious from my perspective their is something bigger than them simply wanting control over us.

       When hundreds of millions of people push very hard to create a situation where they can force their God  to 'return'  on their own schedule  then that situation can be made to appear but if they can actually force their God to do anything then he isn't as powerful as a God should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       When those hundreds of millions are putting their effort into causing the end of civilization,  Armageddon, I consider that insanity.

       God isn't 'forced' to do anything. My point is that, this is clearly showing the New world order in the Bible. This is portraying a one world government. Controlling the people economically,politically and most likely militarily (Revelation 13:4). Which is exactly how the NWO is going to be implemented. The NWO is literally a beast system.

       The situation today  developed with the fervent help of millions of adherents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it weren't for Revelations I firmly believe we wouldn't be in this insane scenario. Belief in the supernatural is  not a good basis for one's life and does no real  good for mankind.

       I disagree with your links. I cannot be bothered going into detail explaining the links are wrong but I will leave you to your own view.
      </p>
      <p>
       ' Belief in the supernatural is not a good basis for one's life' Let me guess, you got that from the government which is actively trying to ridicule and demean people with faith. If religion/faith is a vain thing that means nothing why do they actively try and discourage people to think outside the box and consider their is something bigger than us. And that we're not just lucky to be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       'does no real good for mankind.' And believing that these people do it simply for money, or power makes no sense because they already have that over us. And they could retain that forever in it's current manor because the sheep for the most part will never wake up. So why are they intent on turning society into a cesspit of degenerates who lack critical thinking.

       I have no problem with your following whatever you believe. After all, in order to be in the government or in the masons or... you have to profess a belief in God.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most powerful group in the world may not be on exactly  the same side as you but their belief in the supernatural is evident.

      <p>
       The ultimate power on earth is  the coalition of the central banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a point to ponder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central bank of the central banks is the Bank for International Settlements. Their power is that they can create money, then decide where it goes and for what purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one would ever need more power than that to rule the world. They do in fact rule the world by the use of that power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because THEY believe in Bible verses as you do, that organization apparently considers itself as the new Tower of Babel. The reason I say that is that they  occupy an office tower where they speak many different languages with the natural difficulty in communication  that comes from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tower is located in Basel Switzerland and it's design is, well, let me show you.

       The tower of babel reportedly ended up being destroyed by God. Building a new Tower of Babel from a position of such world domination appears to me as an act of defiance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The BIS seems to believe they have so much power that they can challenge God to try to destroy them, again. That is what's creating the situation that you describe.
      </p>
      <p>
       ◄ Genesis 11:4 ►
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth."
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelations is being created by man, Not God.

       Biblical prophesy happened long before the situations you describe where people were creating event's 'just because' There's many event's that came to pass before a certain 'group' were controlling the majority of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Prophecies of Babylon, Nineveh, Tyre and Edom
Let's take a look at a few Bible prophecies that were fulfilled about 2500 years ago when the ancient kingdoms and cities of Babylon, Nineveh, Tyre and Edom were destroyed. The Bible makes the assertion that these entities were destroyed because they had sought to destroy the Holy Land of Israel and the people of Israel (the Jews).
      </p>
      <p>
       Babylon Will Rule Over Judah for 70 Years
You can read the first such prophecy in Jeremiah 25:11-12. This prophecy was written sometime from 626 to about 586 BC and was not fulfilled until about 609 BC to 539 BC (approximately 50 years later, depending on your calculation)
      </p>
      <p>
       Babylon Will Be Reduced to Swampland
In Isaiah 14:23 (written between 701 and 681 BC), the prophet makes yet another prediction that does not come true until 539 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 14:23
"I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction," declares the Lord Almighty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews Will Survive Babylonian Rule and Return Home
In Jeremiah 32:36-37, (written from about 626 and 586 BC), yet another prophet makes a bold prediction that was ultimately fulfilled in 536 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 32:36-37
"You are saying about this city, 'By the sword, famine and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon'; but this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       It get's to the point where if you suggest these prophesy's were also self fulfilled by man and occultist's following the Bible. Then you're suggesting the largest conspiracy ever in existence. And I'd need some solid evidence of your claims to prove this. Of course as I stated before I'm fine with your opinion. However I will ultimately disagree.

       I read the book.  Sorry. There's massive destruction and killing and virtually no good or love.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my considered opinion, it's an insane tome of holy babble. I can't take it seriously and plan my actions by it. I'd rather just believe in using all of my energy in  making the world a better place instead , not in trying to end civilization so I can die and worship the feet of a psychopath, forever. I believe you should believe however you care to but the result of so many others doing so has had an overall awful outcome. I'm not supposed to and didn't intend to be this uncharacteristically offensive but you did ask

       All other righteous individuals say they communicated with God and we have to take their word for it. Jesus said he WAS God, and we can either believe him or not. I choose to believe and have seen the results and personal relationship in my own life.

       Why do people interpreting the Revelation see a beast with multiple heads and then come up with a theory that it represents a single entity, like "The NWO One World Government"? If it says that it has
       <em>
        seven
       </em>
       heads, doesn't that mean that there are multiple parallel decision-making entities?

       The seven heads are the seven cities are the seven seals are the seven bloodlines. It's more of a fragment of truth about the old world power system that was already in place before Judea ever came to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my own personal interpretation of course. I have this theory that centers around a pact that 7 rulers made before the downfall of civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys intentionally took civilization back to the stone age after a great war in order to preserve their rule. All we have left are legends and stories. The 7 cities of gold, the tower of babel, Atlantis, all hail from a time that's lost to our history.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the bible there is even mention of these 7 hidden kings right below OP's reference to the beast
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are also seven kings. Five are fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Once you start looking into the number 7 things start to get really weird. I've been slowly writing a novel around this concept.

       What I see a lot of people doing is looking for the threads that tie these sort of organizations together, whether they be a banker's cabal, anglo-zionism, Freemasons, Jews, The Vatican, crypto-Nazi's, international communism, or The Open Conspiracy. They say that one or more of these elements has their hand in all the big governments and inter-governmental orgs like the one you mention, the G8.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think that Revelations is written from the simple point of view of a post-collapse survivor:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Yeah, back in those days, it was like a
        <em>
         beast
        </em>
        had taken over the whole entire Earth.
        <em>
         Everybody
        </em>
        had a hand in it, taking away some of our freedoms, making us sick, dumbing us down, keeping us isolated and bitter towards one another. They were
        <em>
         all
        </em>
        like that, all them goddam corporations and governments. And they had it all locked down, too. They had all the power. It had been a long time since the people had any sort of power at all."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Early on, they had us believing in a lot of fool nonsense. Stuff about democracy, and how we all had rights, and how there was somethin' called a 'social contract' which meant that each of us had our interests taken care of, like, if you had to go to court you'd get justice, even if you were just one of the little people."
       </p>
       <p>
        "But that whole thing - all that stuff which made us
        <em>
         feel
        </em>
        good, but didn't really do much to change the situation - all that stuff went away, eventually. Someone told me before it all happened that it was gonna happen - had to happen - 'cause supporting all that 'feel good' nonsense was just gonna get too damn expensive. And it did. And they just shook that off, like a man shaking off his coat before he goes down good on his opponent. And then the beat down really got started."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You know the rest.

       Yeh I agree, I'm just trying to tie the loose ends together. Or attempt to provoke people to think and question things. I might not be right about certain things. But I belive we can find the truth in all this mess if we at least question what's going on. And even if I am wrong about certain things. Posting my expressions might lead to someone  linking the puzzle pieces together themselves. That's at a minimum, all I'm attempting to do.

       I don't think that it's as useful to tie all the pieces together define a single entity as "the enemy", as it is to define a
       <em>
        guiding spirit
       </em>
       as a real danger to your soul. Some say that the story of Revelations is a metaphor for the spiritual journey of the soul, struggling to be released from bondage. Maybe that's true -
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       it's the story of a future civilization (or even ours) struggling to break free of that which keeps the souls of all men bound. Like a fractal world, where the inner journey of the o.ne is paralleled in the historical journey of the many.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's the "spirit" of The Beast, and the "spirit" of The Harlot,
       <em>
        within you and I, first
       </em>
       , which must be defeated, first. And in so doing, we contribute to the collective fulfilment of the story. When you identify the
       <em>
        spirit
       </em>
       of The Beast, then you can see it clearly in the actions of persons occupying positions of influence in the world, who recreate that
       <em>
        spirit
       </em>
       in the hearts of those which they lead.

       had an interesting take on this when he wrote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When hundreds of millions of people push very hard to create a situation where they can force their God to 'return' on their own schedule then that situation can be made to appear but if they can actually force their God to do anything then he isn't as powerful as a God should be.
       </p>
       <p>
        When those hundreds of millions are putting their effort into causing the end of civilization, Armageddon, I consider that insanity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think he's close to the truth. No one is
       <em>
        forcing
       </em>
       a "god" to return. But collectively, we can enable "god" to return ourselves, through ourselves. If that happens on a global scale, that's the end of civilization as we know it. But it's arguably a better world.

       Speaking of bible prophecy, I remember a passage in the book of Isaiah that describes a war between Syria and Israel. The war begins one evening with Syria attacking Israel with a devastating attack that wipes out the majority of the population of Israel and the war is over by the next morning with Israel the victor. Damascus is completely destroyed by fire and will never rise again.

       I'm not sure if it directly infers Israel is doing all the damage. But certainly Syria is decimated and the country is in ruins. But tbh that's how I see ww3 starting anyway. Something kicking off in Syria. Because their's that many country's involved bombing different;t targets with different ambitions. It's just waiting to literally explode.

       I'm looking in Isaiah 17 but personally cannot see it stating how the city is destroyed. But it does say it will be ruins. Looking at recent pictures I'd say it's not far off from being ruins.

       Yeh I changed my comment. A nuke doesn't seem logical either, either way if this happens (when for me since I belive the Bible) then we can look into what happened. Until then it would be a guessing game.

       Well, OP, I happen to somewhat agree with you. Five years ago,  had someone tried to get me to believe...I would have had them considering a change in belief. Since that time, my eyes have really been opened. Now, we're not the first to relate current events to biblical prophecy. But, just as soon as you try to attach a timeline or a face to any prophetic happenstance, you will be wrong. For our God to be who we believe he is, the substance of faith is required. Anything (short of his return) that would provide positive proof of His existence, would disprove His word and disprove God himself. See the signs, recognize the season, pray, and spread the goodnews.

       It's been the "End Times" for two thousand years now.  It will be the "End Times" for the next two thousand years, or for however long that resonates with people that the religious establishment wants to control.  When that fails to work, they'll find something else to threaten people with.

       Even people who believe in prophecy agree that it's extremely unreliable, easily misread, easily misunderstood or manipulated in order to fit the confines of the readers' world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing in the biblical prophecies is silly. Many have come before you with different interpretations that "proved" their own beliefs of the future. More will come along with their own interpretation. Who is correct? None of them. They are just words intentionally crafted in order to hide behind ambiguity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, from my own viewpoint, if you are studying prophecy in any seriousness you must study prophecy from all religions as well as the prophecy of the non-religious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a discussion on the ambiguity of prophecy and why it's utterly useless.

       Every time a Democratic president is elected, Conservatives call him the Antichrist. (I remember when they called Bill Clinton that, and of course Barack Obama. I don't know if they called JFK that as well, but probably, who knows, these people are insane.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's a woman, so they can't call her the Antichrist.  They're forced to call her 'Jezebel, The Great Harlot' instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that's no more true of her than the lies told about Barack Obama being the Antichrist.

       They ARE all "antichrist." All of them have aspired to be THE Antichrist, but nobody's reached it yet. Maybe one of these new aspirants will make it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will note: If the Antichrist is the total opposite of Jesus Christ, then, well, it would be a woman, right?

       I don't think that it's as useful to tie all the pieces together define a single entity as "the enemy", as it is to define a
       <em>
        guiding spirit
       </em>
       as a real danger to your soul. Some say that the story of Revelations is a metaphor for the spiritual journey of the soul, struggling to be released from bondage. Maybe that's true -
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       it's the story of a future civilization (or even ours) struggling to break free of that which keeps the souls of all men bound. Like a fractal world, where the inner journey of the o.ne is paralleled in the historical journey of the many.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's the "spirit" of The Beast, and the "spirit" of The Harlot,
       <em>
        within you and I, first
       </em>
       , which must be defeated, first. And in so doing, we contribute to the collective fulfilment of the story. When you identify the
       <em>
        spirit
       </em>
       of The Beast, then you can see it clearly in the actions of persons occupying positions of influence in the world, who recreate that
       <em>
        spirit
       </em>
       in the hearts of those which they lead.

       had an interesting take on this when he wrote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When hundreds of millions of people push very hard to create a situation where they can force their God to 'return' on their own schedule then that situation can be made to appear but if they can actually force their God to do anything then he isn't as powerful as a God should be.
       </p>
       <p>
        When those hundreds of millions are putting their effort into causing the end of civilization, Armageddon, I consider that insanity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think he's close to the truth. No one is
       <em>
        forcing
       </em>
       a "god" to return. But collectively, we can enable "god" to return ourselves, through ourselves. If that happens on a global scale, that's the end of civilization as we know it. But it's arguably a better world.
