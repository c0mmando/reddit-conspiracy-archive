<p>There is no one news source that is always true because there are shills everywhere. Even marxist-owned news is a good source once you know what’s actually true, because you can just know that reality is the opposite of what they say. You just have to get the baseline first.</p>

After all his experience you have to question why he is unwaveringly pushing Trump? He&#39;s most peoples starter point though which does give him a lot of credit but for me theres no 50/50 when you proclaim to be a truth telling source of alternative media. I think people are downvoting cos hes one of the most vocal from the conspiracy camp and hes a bit suspect himself no reflection on the question</p>

<p>But that&#39;s how a gatekeeper operates - they sprinkle a bit of truth on top of a load of regurgitated bullshit. </p>

<p>In order to be successful controlled opposition, one must put at least a bit of truth out to gain credibility. Once trust is gained you can control the narrative and shill your apocalypse survival kits for extra profit.</p>
