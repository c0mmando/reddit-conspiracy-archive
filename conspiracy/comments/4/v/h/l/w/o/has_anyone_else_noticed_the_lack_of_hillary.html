I&#39;m not sure if people aren&#39;t posting new stuff, or if we are really being censored that bad...
I also feel like the credibility of this site has crumbled. So many shills and since the finding out of the &quot;correct the record&quot; Clinton superpac I feel like I&#39;m not too sure who to believe anymore. </p>

<p>[Is this like the &quot;deleted comments&quot; which I checked and found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4vdygb/theres_currently_11_threads_antihrc_on_main_page/">87% were benefitting Trump by being deleted?</a></p>

<p>And before you call <em>me</em> a shill, note your user history spouting the same tired lies repeatedly. I don&#39;t give a shit about who wins the election, I only care about people spewing bullshit. We come to conspiracy forums for truth. Not getting the next puppet in office.</p>

On the Apple TV feed, Clinton and all the hacks are smiling and spewing ironic rhetoric, while on the periscope feed it was all people getting Bernie signs taken away, lied to, roughed up by security, all sorts of crazy shit. It was like some North Korean documentary or something.</p>
