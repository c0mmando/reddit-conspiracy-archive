       becoming a shit storm and was constantly getting called for censoring, I feel like I haven't seen a dnc or Clinton post hit the front page of all for a few days and it's kinda scary. I'm not sure if people aren't posting new stuff, or if we are really being censored that bad...
I also feel like the credibility of this site has crumbled. So many shills and since the finding out of the "correct the record" Clinton superpac I feel like I'm not too sure who to believe anymore.

       Almost every mainstream social media network is censoring the leaks and any news related to wikileaks. Facebook filters anything with Clinton and wikileaks in the same sentence. Pretty sure Twitter is doin the same, we all know Google s blacklisted wikileaks site etc. Reddits just as rigges. Just another propaganda outlet.

       Let's see, threads deleted... quickly scanning over them I see 6 negative threads on Trump: How is this protecting Clinton again?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/donald-trump-fire-marshal-colorado-springs-brett-lacey-civilian-of-the-year">
        You think Clinton is taking down Trump attacking a fire marshall?

       so is he like Voting Clinton now?

       [Is this like the "deleted comments" which I checked and found
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4vdygb/theres_currently_11_threads_antihrc_on_main_page/">
        87% were benefitting Trump by being deleted?

      <p>
       And before you call
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       a shill, note your user history spouting the same tired lies repeatedly. I don't give a shit about who wins the election, I only care about people spewing bullshit. We come to conspiracy forums for truth. Not getting the next puppet in office.

       Big Media really has been going all out to put up a protective force field around Clinton. Right now, the only question is whether or not enough people will see through it.

       I was watching the DNC corporate coverage on Apple TV and watching the convention from the "people's feed" on Periscope at the same time, and the disparity between the two was terrifying. On the Apple TV feed, Clinton and all the hacks are smiling and spewing ironic rhetoric, while on the periscope feed it was all people getting Bernie signs taken away, lied to, roughed up by security, all sorts of crazy shit. It was like some North Korean documentary or something.

       I comment in that sub a lot. The sub has suddenly turned from hating Clinton for 8 years (yes look up how angry we were with her horrible attacks to Barry O) to people pretending to be flabbergasted that anybody has even a mild criticism for her. It's not natural and it's in the middle of the DNC Leak.

       I listened to MPR yesterday. They spoke all about the dangers of a cyber attck. How important Cyber Security it. Blah blah blah. 'Experts' point at Russia. Not once did they speak about the content of the emails. Not even a little bit. All to deflect. So people can think/say I heard about it. Russia hack us, right?

       Russian hacks can't be substantiated anyway. More likely it's an inside job from somebody else considered expendable. What better way to distract from the content than to use the old gaslighting technique to which Americans have already been conditioned...

       I rarely see anything news or politics related show up on my front page these days. I resorted to making a news multi-sub. The front page has gone to shit as well. Every post is stale. There's no need for a post to be in the top 5 for 20 hours.

       I've been seeing a lot of clintons enjoying balloons pics up, so there is that. Worthless distractions I know.

       No, never go to the front page of Reddit. That's like asking people if they've heard of the latest Justine Bibber song.

       It's scary, when Bernie had a "chance" to win the whole sub was anti "she who shall not be named", all the way until the cunt got the nominee. Now, not a peep, this whole place is corrupted. Certain power users automatically get hundreds of upvotes, and soon you'll see sponsored posts.

       Nope, you're right, it almost seems like the vast majority of political news, especially anything mentioning the myriad of clinton scandals never makes it to the front page or r/news.  Even today I was looking at the New section of the front page, and there was a post about clintons IT admin posting on reddit looking for ways to modify archived exchange emails and wipe emails without leaving evidence.  It had several hundred upvotes in a very short amount of time.  I checked the 'New' section of the front page about 40 minutes later and the article was nowhere to be found...
