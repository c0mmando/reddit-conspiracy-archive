<p>Perhaps the strategy is to have her selected with much resistance from the people. Then, when things go south, it can be spun that they had the right person in charge, but the nation was not united behind her, putting the blame for catastrophe on the people. (Just like the Brexit vote led to cries that the British people were stupid and that financial disaster waiting in the wings was all their fault.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was supposed to be a landslide for Clinton. But things are now back firing on her. Trump has been trying to pull out from the race. He says things like the Russia hack headline to distract us from the real issue, what those emails contained all while trying to discredit his own name  and diminish his own support.</p>

<p>Ultimately trump was used to dismember the Republican Party and divide it. While causing such outrageous hate for himself that people would obviously choose Clinton over trump. Why? Because trump sounds like a racist crazy mofo and Clinton, well Clinton only needs her last name to win an election</p>

<p>The establishment (since when have we ever used that term before this election btw?) republican congresspeople have to support Trump because their base either supports him <strong>strongly</strong> (if I could bold that any more I would) or hate Clinton. The thing is though is that the establishment also hate trump to a lesser degree (and most sure as shit won&#39;t admit it publicly). There&#39;s now a choice between party loyalty and trump loyalty. It seems Cruz made his choice. </p>

<p>So no, there isn&#39;t a 0% chance of it happening...it is unlikely to happen, but technically could still happen. And with this country at the boiling point it is, is it so hard to believe that civil unrest could happen, thus requiring Martial Law? </p>
