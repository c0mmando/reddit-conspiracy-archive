       People think trump is working with Russia and people also think Hilary is corrupt and terrible. Is it possible that all this is a huge charade? Didn't trump have a relationship with the Clinton's and maybe all this is an illusion to make you think you're fighting for change?

       People here on /con love trump, notice how they downvote almost any and all articles about trump that doesn't make him look like a hero and upvote anything with the word hillary in it (try it, make up a story about her killing babies on an altar and the bots will upvote it).

       I can see Trump being the scapegoat, but not Hillary. Not at first blush, anyway. I just don't see any possibility of Hillary being cast as being anything but "good" and "right".
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the strategy is to have her selected with much resistance from the people. Then, when things go south, it can be spun that they had the right person in charge, but the nation was not united behind her, putting the blame for catastrophe on the people. (Just like the Brexit vote led to cries that the British people were stupid and that financial disaster waiting in the wings was all their fault.)

       If she doesn't comply I could see her being thrown under the bus. But she's been a good little servant to her overlords so I guess that won't change if she's president.

       It was supposed to be a landslide for Clinton. But things are now back firing on her. Trump has been trying to pull out from the race. He says things like the Russia hack headline to distract us from the real issue, what those emails contained all while trying to discredit his own name  and diminish his own support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately trump was used to dismember the Republican Party and divide it. While causing such outrageous hate for himself that people would obviously choose Clinton over trump. Why? Because trump sounds like a racist crazy mofo and Clinton, well Clinton only needs her last name to win an election

       Funnily enough, her last name is on her foundation which she actually
       <strong>
        needs
       </strong>
       to have to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment (since when have we ever used that term before this election btw?) republican congresspeople have to support Trump because their base either supports him
       <strong>
        strongly
       </strong>
       (if I could bold that any more I would) or hate Clinton. The thing is though is that the establishment also hate trump to a lesser degree (and most sure as shit won't admit it publicly). There's now a choice between party loyalty and trump loyalty. It seems Cruz made his choice.

       I believe. I just thought the conspiracy was Hillary and Co. engineered Trump to be the Republican candidate so that the alternative to her is so repugnant, people HAVE to vote for the lesser of two evils? What's easier to accept, this whole thing is rigged or that a majority of America truly believes that Clinton and Trump are the two most qualified individuals to run this country.

       There's a theory that Trump may have donated to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for a favor or favors. It's believed this is his trump card (no pun intended) should he fall in the polls or if he wants to finish off her credibility. However, that would expose him being as corrupt as her, but it might be the final nail in HRC's coffin of ever seeing politics again.

       Actually, if by some chance (albeit, a VERY small chance) something happened that sparked Martial Law in the U.S, the President would remain the same until Martial Law was lifted. Regardless of how many terms they've served.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also important to note; Obama signed an executive order some time back making it much easier to declare Martial Law. I'm not at all saying that it's going to happen. Just an interesting tidbit to ponder over.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, there isn't a 0% chance of it happening...it is unlikely to happen, but technically could still happen. And with this country at the boiling point it is, is it so hard to believe that civil unrest could happen, thus requiring Martial Law?

       Alright, I see where you're coming from now. I thought you were trying to suggest he'd change the constitution. I would agree that we are headed towards that, but I don't think we're quite there for a few more years, maybe even another couple decades. I think we are in the preliminary setup phase of in acting martial law.

       I honestly think, provided things continue on their current course, that we are within 5-10 years of that point.

       They sure seem to be expediting the process by any means necessary. I hope and pray everyday that this is another "side" to the fight we are unaware of that will eventually win out.
      </p>

       Don't get me wrong though, I hope you are correct and it is decades off. By then, who knows what could happen?

       So Trump is connected to Russia. I know Hillary sold the rights of our biggest Uranium deposits to Russia. Russia must have finally won the manufactured "Cold War". Does that mean a Hot War is coming?

       The only reason MSM is pushing that trump and Russia are in cahoots is because he said he respects Putin and they would get along. It feels like they're grasping at straws now. Honestly, it's been a year since this campaign started. Where are trumps "email server" types of scandals? Where's all the dirt on him?
