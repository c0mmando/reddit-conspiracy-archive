        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Evolution is an explantion for where life comes from, it posits that life emerged from inorganic molecules billions of years ago. </p>

<p>I will briefly explain why I believe this to be false.</p>

<p>First of all. The only way for a living cell to be produced is by cell division. </p>

<p>There is no evidence for example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>That organelles can be combined to produce a living cell.</p></li>
<li><p>That amino acids can be combined to produce proteins. </p></li>
<li><p>That inorganic molecules can be combined to produce amino acids.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Evolutionists claim that the latter (molecules to amino acids) has been acheived in a laboratory, they cite many experiments, the most famous of which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment">Miller-Urey Experiment</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Miller-Urey_experiment-en.svg">picture</a> summarises the experiment.</p>

<p>The graduate student Stanley Miller and his professor, Harold Urey, used water vapour, methane, ammonia and hydrogen to simulate earth&#39;s atmosphere during the period when life is thought to have originated.</p>

<p>To simulate lightning, two electrodes were used.</p>

<p>At the end of the experiment, 10-15% of the carbon in the system was in the form of organic compounds and amino acids.</p>

<p>There is one big problem with this experiment:</p>

<p>Amino acids are <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&amp;q=optical+isomers">optical isomers.</a>Many amino acids produced by Miller-Urey were right handed. </p>

<p>Living organisms only have left-handed amino acids, right handed amino acids are <em>toxic!</em>. </p>

<p>Just as a thought experiment, what is the probability of 500 randomly assorted amino acids forming a protein molecule?</p>

<p>This will be part 2.</p>

<p>Right off the bat you got it wrong. </p>

<p><em>Abiogenesis</em> is the explanation about how life arose naturally from non-living matter, <em>Evolution</em> is how life changed through time. </p>

<p>So your entire post is an argument against abiogenesis, not evolution. This matters because there are quite a large number of religious people who believe that god created the first life (So no abiogenesis), but that human life arose through natural selection over billions of years (evolution). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand what evolution is. You are scientifically ignorant. Scientific ignorance is the belief that a person who has never studied astronomy, cosmology, physics, chemistry, biology, or geology, and who has never read any of the tens of thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers describing the evidence for</p>

<p>(1) Big Bang theory,</p>

<p>(2) the theory of abiogenesis, and</p>

<p>(3) the theory of evolution,</p>

<p>and who doesn&#39;t understand that these are entirely separate theories and that none of them has anything to do with atheism, is somehow qualified to criticise and dismiss these three fields of proven science and replace them with the unproven hypothesis that their &quot;God did it&quot;.</p>

<p>Just so you know: The theory of evolution does not include an explanation to where the first life came from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to summarize:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s just one problem: Purchase of home video systems occurs as different standards. Half of all home video systems were VHS, the other half were Betamax, which is incompatible with VHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This logic fails to recognize the propensity of life to build new amino acids and to impact the generation of them. It&#39;s a crapshoot: One standard will win out while other fails into obscurity.</p>

<p>Edit: Another example is that in the big bang, matter and antimatter were generated at nearly the same level, there is a 50% chance of each forming. The two reacted and provided energy to the expansion of the universe almost instantly, and all remaining matter is actually descended from the tiny fraction of a fraction of excess matter generated by the big bang: The ratio was likely something like 50.000001% matter to 49.99999% antimatter. 
We only recognize matter as our building block because it is what we are made of, there is nothing inherently better about it than antimatter: Just as life with the oppositely chiral amino acids is possible, but simply incompatible with our biology.</p>

<p>But the probabilities involved in proteins are mind boggling. Not only do you have to get the right amino acids, in the right sequence with the correct optical isomer, you also have to get pepetide bonds between all of them.</p>

<p>The area is labelled as cooled water &#39;containing organic compounds&#39; and this is a clear example of external manipulation.</p>

<p>Miller and Urey heated the water to produce vapour and then cooled it, would such a mechanism have been available on an early earth?</p>

<p>Miller-Urey are basically isolating the amino acids as soon as they are formed. Think of the gases and electricity as being the atmosphere, the cold water is an entirely artificial construct.</p>

I wish there were more people exposing these false doctrines of evolution instead of trying to argue a flat earth since this can actually be proven. A distinction to be made though is that slight changes within a species can and do occur, but they will always remain the same species.
