       After the Wikileaks emails, and Schultz's resignation, I think this needs to be put on the locc. There's enough hard evidence by now that Schultz, Hillary, and other members of the DNC were working together in secret to undermine the rules of the DNC, undermine the democratic process of our nation, and force upon the American people a presidential nominee.

       I second this. It's not like we can wait until the MSM "confirms" this one, considering they play a massive role in this DNC conspiracy.

       Considering that Schultz emailed MSNBC anchors and demanded that they stop running stories on her and demanded apologies, I'm not too sure the MSM is going to "confirm" it because that will implicate them as accomplices.
This is a taste of the politics+MSM conspiracy proof we've been waiting for

       The MSM really is the most important piece to the puzzle. The whole reason people don't question 9/11 or any other major conspiracy theories is because the media doesn't, and people just assume that if there was anything worth reporting, it would be reported. We obviously know this to be untrue.

       So true. But here's what I'm wondering.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much is red team channels and pundits going to report on this? Because you have to consider two things: if one side's doing it, you know the other side is. And number 2, reporting on it may awaken people to question and inquire if red team is doing it.

       They're pigeon holed.

       Yeah like, I don't know if everyone hating Trump is all just a ploy at this point, because the more they hate him, the more I like him. Am I falling into a trap?

       The RNC itself colluded to shut him down. That's the guy I want.

       Exactly. Thats basically what confirmed for me that he was the people's choice. The right choice. With all the cheating and downplaying the RNC did to Trump (i mean, look at what happened in Colorado) and he STILL won? He won against all odds, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING was against him, except for one thing, the people. The people were for him and the people are for him, he is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       candidate who is
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       us, so we are for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not be able to vote due to imperialism. But if i could, me,  and everyone that i talk to, would vote for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, from the get-go, i knew something was off with Hillary, (too reptilian hahaha) and now im
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       that
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       is the number one enemy of the united states of america, its morals, its way of life,  democracy, the liberty and hope it supplies to everyone born on this earth.
      </p>

       I have never felt so negative towards a candidate, not even local ones.

       Very very stark difference between what CNN was broadcasting and what people were tweeting. Just search the hashtags "demexit", "dncwalkout", or "fuckthednc" on Twitter and you'll see tons of footage of what the CNN broadcasts conveniently left just out of the frame.

       I have to be somewhere in 30 minutes so I best move  my ass. Search this sub, a lot of people were posting links to the protests , walkouts, paid seat-fillers, police confrontations and other  stuff that was going on at the DNC convention. A lot of the stuff was only able to stay posted without deletion in

       Watching the livestream (C-SPAN or twitch to avoid commentary, commercials, etc) and following Sanders delegates on twitter proved useful to k owing exactly what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really wasn't much reporting about the dissent, there was quite a bit though. Sadly, like the Nevada convention, it was something you really had to follow in real time to get the full story on..

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On May 18, "Morning Joe" co-host Mika Brzezinski said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz "should step down" because she had favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders throughout the primary. One week later, Brzezinski doubled down, saying, "My contention all along has been that [Wasserman Schultz] has been in the tank for Hillary from the get-go, and it's been quite obvious."
       </p>
       <p>
        The repetition seemed like no big deal at the time, but now hacked DNC emails show that in between Wasserman Schultz and her staff flipped out, pressuring MSNBC to make Brzezinski and partner Joe Scarborough tone down their criticism. Clearly, it didn't work.

       Hasn't that been covered? And since when do we take Trump as a source of reliable Intel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said that he thought that the Russians had Hillary's emails. (And probably so do several other groups) and that if they have them they should release them because it'd be helpful (a half joke but would be nice if it happened).
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC Leak (separate issue) was blamed on the Russians by the Dems. There were even a couple of posts here and one or two on twitter who said that they would deflect away from a whistleblower by blaming the russians. Then on cue, they did. Coincidentally not long before the leaks a Dem staffer was killed in a burglary gone wrong - but nothing was stolen. He was on the phone to his gf who said that he told her everything was fine before ending the call. A few people have suggested that he was connected to the leak. It seems that he would have had the appropriate access, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he did it.

       From the DNC Bylaws
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In
the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee,
particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the
Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and
campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the
Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party
Presidential nominating process.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The DNC's own rules state that they must remain impartial during the nominating process. "Backing the Democrat of their choice" as you put it is exactly against their own rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what do I know about elections or political parties, I just have a degree in Political Science and have worked in political campaigns before. Definitely an ignorant child that has never voted.

        Thanks for facilitating Luis coming on today, and bearing with us through a melee of GOP nonsense and cancellations and all that.  Any particular points he'll want to make? We're gonna stay Dem focused...

       When you're a journalist, you do ask your sources if there's anything you didn't ask that they would like to say something about. The object is to gain an abundance of information that you then can use to write your reports and fuel investigations. No collusion. Just standard interactions between sources and reporters.

       That's not the journalist. That's a DNC staffer asking others within the DNC what oppo research can be disclosed about Sanders in the interview on CNN. That is evidence of the DNC itself not being neutral. But that is not evidence of CNN colluding with the DNC. 
Journalists asking for questions and saying they're focusing on the democrats for that particular segment is not collusion. It's SOP.

       You claim this is "just standard interactions between sources and reporters" and your coworker claims it's "common knowledge". Great. Let's see all the emails made public showing the pre-interview arrangements between the media and the people they're interviewing. If it is standard, if it is a common and accepted practice, then there's nothing to hide. Let's have the interviewers and interviewees release to the public ahead of time, or even concurrent with the interview, the emails with the negotiations over what will and won't be discussed in the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       If those aren't open to the public, then they are
       <strong>
        secret
       </strong>
       . They're definitely
       <strong>
        cooperation
       </strong>
       , you don't dispute that. And if the image presented is that it's just an interviewer asking "the tough questions" to an interviewee, and we can't see what goes on behind the scenes to arrange those questions, then that image presented is
       <strong>
        deception
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Which makes it the dictionary definition of
       <strong>
        collusion
       </strong>
       .

       You're really stretching here. And good luck getting someone in authority to subpoena the internal emails of news organizations because some Right-wingers and Bernie die-hards think DNC and MSNBC collusion were what gave Hillary the Democratic nomination.

       Who said subpoena? If they aren't a secret, the organizations should have no problem
       <em>
        voluntarily
       </em>
       releasing those, in the interest of nonbiased transparency. If they have nothing to hide they have nothing to fear.

       There's no evidence that Hillary was involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP suggested that there was collusion to "undermine the rules of the DNC, undermine the democratic process of our nation, and force upon the American people a presidential nominee". There is no evidence for any of that.

       If we can get a good paragraph summary, I'll add it to the wiki (I'm authorized by mods to add to it).  I am not the one to write it up, because I've not been keeping up with this issue as well as others here have--I have a general idea but I'd rather get the synopsis exact and not miss anything, because we can't risk getting any part of that particular summary wrong, if you know what i mean.

       Can you provide a link to this? Political parties are private corporations and aren't required to do anything. They could decide to appoint a candidate and skip a primary if they wanted. 
While the Clinton emails are unsavory they are business as usual for both major parties and the sooner people realize this isn't just a Clinton/DNC problem but a problem with the entire system the sooner we can try to fix it.

       From what I've seen from the DNC email leak, the DNC pushing for Hillary and derailing Bernie is fact and should be put on the locc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I have not yet seen any emails where they confirmed collusion between the DNC and Hillary (your second sentence).  I consider that a second conspiracy (at the very least an addendum), and that one is not yet definitively proven.

       If we need a third, I will third this nomination. If you just look at the at the available evidence of voter suppression and wholesale disenfranchisement in the California primary alone, not to mention what occured in Arizona and Iowa. If you take that together with the Stanford study on the statistical
       <del>
        probability
       </del>
       unlikelihood of so much of the exit polling differing so often from the 'official' voting results, most notably in the electronic voting states, and that's before we even talk about what Wikileaks has shown. I think the conspiracy to coronate Hillary Clinton is clear.

       I wouldn't say it's wrong of them to point out the fact that the Stanford study wouldn't hold water. The entire point of the conspiracy community is to question what you're told. Not just question what you're told from one source.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd much rather know that the study didn't hold water and look for other sources that may provide more scientific proof.

       To be fair, our problems (Arizona) were unintentional.  They were mostly Republican officials trying to suppress poor and minority voters.  There was some funny business but the long lines that were a huge part of the problem were Michelle Reagan and this other woman's fault.

       Do you really believe the problems were unintentional? That sounds a lot like spin. Why were there so many people demanding a re-vote? That to me sounds like a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       problem. To explain voter disenfranchisement and election fraud away as something that was just some unintentional accident makes it sound like you succumbed to a media narrative you liked the most.

       Living in Arizona doesn't make you  immune to media manipulation and whitewashing of the events within your state.

       Look asshole, I live here.  We have a Republican controlled state House and Senate.  We also had two officials by the name of Michelle Reagan and Helen Purcell.  One is Maricopa County Recorder and the other is Secretary of Arizona.  Our voting locations in Phoenix were decreased from the 400 in 2008 to 200 in 2012.  They were further deceased to
       <em>
        80
       </em>
       for this primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a lot of problems with registrations getting switched for our primary but the huge lines were a death knell.  We had
       <em>
        32,000
       </em>
       people vote in Maricopa county as opposed to the
       <em>
        112,000
       </em>
       from 2008.  Bernie was winning about 67% of the in-person vote.  You cannot tell me that wasn't impactful.

       I'd say it's much more than just a republican issue.  Both parties are clearly corruptible.  That's why we get reports of the koch bros and bush family supporting hillary.  The powers that be are rallying behind hillary,  dems and repubs alike.

       I see your point, but if we get that technical, we'd probably have to get into different types of conspiracy and start citing law to make these determinations.

       Never said we should ignore it. Just saying it's not a conspiracy. There's a difference. I think it should be talked about in politics and other places. But if anyone thinks this is a conspiracy, you need to pay better attention.

       Is there a difference between the DNC agenda to push Hillary and collusion to outright rig the primaries for Hillary? It seemed pretty obvious the DNC would go with Hillary 4 years ago, Bernie is an independent who declared himself democrat for the election. I guess my question is, does what the DNC did actually equate with rigging the primaries? Because political parties are a part of the democratic process, they're just another interest group and if you read the federalist papers, it's pretty clear they are inevitable and a side effect of the type of government we have. So as an independent institution, they have an agenda and Bernie was not part of it. Maybe I'm confusing something but if someone could clear this up for me, that'd be great.

       It seems that fraud may be the one reasonable allegation, if the Party claimed to be neutral, leading Sanders supporters to donate to a campaign that was only allowed to continue for show. As for the rest, people seem confused by the plain fact that the DNC would've been well within its rights to ignore the primaries and decide the whole thing backstage before starting the show last Monday. They're a private organization, not a government body. They don't have any obligation to internal neutrality or democracy.

       Yeah it absolutely seems like sanders supporters and sanders himself knew it was an uphill battle but definitely thought he could get the nomination, I can definitely see that conclusion you say in the beginning. The part where it gets tricky is that they do receive federal funding, I'm fairly sure Jefferson vehemently opposed this for good reason where now the government and our tax dollars are dragged into this whole debacle

       exactly.  the sanders media blackout was realized last summer, and it set the tone for the primary.  First debates solidified the assumed biased.  Voter purging, disenfranchising, provisional balloting, exit poll suppressing, and dnc state convention hackjobs showed election fraud.  And the wikileaks proved it (minus incriminating communications with voter machine companies).  All that's left if a video of hillary eating a baby or some smoking gun like that. haha

       The fact that you knew they were lying doesn't mean they weren't lying. The shift from "no we're not" to "no shit Sherlock" is as old as politics.

       I've moved on and chosen from between the remaining two candidates. This is an old story that could be told about both Parties going back for generations. But we don't have to pretend everyone is as smart and cynical as you and me. Plenty of folks thought Bernie might really have a chance, in part because the Party left that distinct impression.

       The dnc's job is to get a Democrat in the White House, that's the prime directive, is there anything illegal about them having a preference? If Bernie was younger maybe, but he's too old and I'm not even sure he could live through a four term anyways. And for the record I was hoping Bernie would take the nomination but now only an idiot would want trump instead of Hillary, no offence, he has neither the experience or the patience to do this job.

       Hillary Clinton as president though... Literally the poster child of corrupt politicians at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to be an idiot to want Hillary more than trump as well. Both options suck. You're voting for the candidate that actively stole the nomination from the candidate you know would have been better though. Trump does seem like an asshole through and through but I prefer that to this darth sidious/emperor palpatine act that Hillary Clinton is all about.

       You shouldn't support Bernie either at this point because he is also quite obviously a sellout

       You are unintelligent, think more highly of yourself than you should or just have a terrible memory. Clinton isn't the poster child for corrupt politics, that's every president before her too. Don't think she's worse than any other corrupt politician; she's not. She's the same. Bernie Sanders was the one true exception to corrupt politics, but besides him, everyone at hillary's level is pretty much equal in corruption.

       Right, with the 1984 ref, but how is voting for Hillary vs Trump have anything to do with it? While people are busy trying to get a third party 5%, Trump may walk into the white house. When people say Democrats are the SAME and JUST AS EVIL as the reich wing, it makes me puke

       It's hard to be successful in business, you're right! But Trump is successful, 98.3% so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump hasn't had any experience in a political office - that's correct, but Hillary has for 35 years, and that's how we know she's a terrible candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had plenty of choices excluding Trump; 20 other choices. 16 Republicans in total, and 5 Democrats. I've been a vivid Trump supporter since the beginning of his campaign. I'm highly enthusiastic in voting for Trump. You've made it clear you're voting for Hillary because she's the best pick in your opinion.

       Can I see some of that proof that the HRC Campaign and the DNC were in communication with eachother?  As far as I can tell the WikiLeaks emails prove only that DWS and the DNC had a bias against Sanders and said mean things about him.

       You mean DWS running $hillary's 2008 campaign, Kaine heading the DNC before her then being picked for VP, DWS then being forced to resign because of the scandal, then $hillary blatantly obviously and immediately rewarding her directly into her fold all constitute unrelated coincidence?

       Is it really so surprising that the head of HRC's nearly successful '08 bid for the Democratic nomination would be promoted to Chair of the DNC?  DWS is the best fundraiser the Democrats have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no Hillary supporter but lets be rational here - show me where HRC or her campaign communicated with DWS or the DNC during the primary and encouraged them to rig the primary and shit on Sanders.

      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the possibility that fraud was NOT committed is roughly the equivalent chance of a giant meteor exterminating life on planet earth today, why does it even matter if there was collusion between Hillary and DWS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume there wasn't.  If the candidate was a giant mute inanimate toad, then that candidate would still not be legitimate as the process itself was fraudulent.

       Everyone who wishes to remain asleep continues to trot out the same bullshit excuses while ignoring the fact that who the actual candidate is is irrelevant to their blatant ignorance of how WHICHEVER candidate was placed at the head of the corrupt snake.

       the DNC was colluding with the media HRC Campaign was not directly. But they didnt have to, the former DNC chair stepped down in 2011 to give the job to Former Clinton Campaign Co Chair DWS, that former DNC chair was VP nominee Tim Kaine. If you cant smell the shit you need your nose checked. That is when the Clinton Party rose from the Ashes of the Democratic Party.

       It quotes their charter and the emails which demonstrate that the charter was broken. Specifically DWS's requirements were not upheld.

       What is sad is that this is as far as it gets for punishment for Hillary. People should be outraged and willing to revolt over that kind of treason. Not only is she not being jailed, but this is fuel for Trump supporters, Vote none, vote for yourself. Act as people, not as fake voters. Nothing will change unless people take over.

       I have the most success bringing up problems that affect them, and bring up ways it affects them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: someone who hates the current media monopolies, bias, net neutrality or is sick of not having internet/cable provider options - tell them about how the monopoly problem came about bc of Bill Clinton's
       <strong>
        Telecommunications Act of 1996
       </strong>
       . Clinton tried to sell it as a 'job creating' and 'competition creating' act. In reality it just fucked us over and moved media comp ownership from about 70 companies to just 6 monopolies. A repeal of the New Deal Communications Act of 1934.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton's destroyed a lot of New Deal reforms, regulations, and relief programs that came after the Great Depression. I'm a fiscal conservative - but know that these programs were vitally important to our countries economic growth and stability. Clinton undid a ton of them. Most catastrophic was repealing the Glass-Steagall Act - that deregulated Wall Street and led to the 2008 recession and bank monopolies.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - use the Socratic method to lead HRC supporters to the truth that matters to them. Don't fight them or insult them, just speak about the points that matter to them. And why HRC will shit on those things that matter to them.

       Thank you! It's important to open the dialogue. For older generations who are entrenched in partisan thinking and trust tv, it may be a harder battle. Always monitor your expectations on your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, I wouldn't argue pro trump - for ppl entrenched in est. media and haven't woken up, I'd take this on slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most clear argument is playing the original Russia quote in full, and perhaps that whole rally - then play how top officials responded after spinning the story out of control saying trump is working with Putin to rig the election.  It's a great example of how fascist our media is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently had success just telling my close friend who fears trump to just watch CNN as it is - the Clinton Narrative Network.  It's on nonstop in his office, and I told him to just look behind the curtain when he watched next time. Know that CNN is a huge Clinton donor, and a result of the TelComAct of 1996.  He volunteered a few days later, "Omg, you're totally right, it's all negative trump news all day, everything about Clinton is skewed to her advantage, but it's mostly anti Trump hysteria"
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really pleased to hear that he took the time to look critically. The same way psychologists let ppl come to the realization/opinion on their own,  the more impactful.

       Hate to say it, but i think Bernie was in on it the whole time. The DNC knows Hillary's a center-left hawk and needed a dove to catalyze the liberal base, then hand them over to Hillary for a decisive win in november.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie was always too "radical", meaning of course that the general population from both sides of the aisle loved him for his common-good policy plans, but he'd be horrible for the Big Interests.... that decide elections.

       yea but knowing Hillary, shes very unlikely to push Sanders' progressive agendas. IMO she just said she would for party unity. Sanders does get some support, but his voter base is split between those who now resent him for giving into the establishment, and those voting for hillary. Plus, he's also going back to the independant party

       Now is a good time to hold politicians accountable for their misdeeds. It is true that this type of bs has been going on for years, but it's more difficult to hide stuff from the public than it use to be. We need to take advantage of this time in history right now to make a change for the better; most people were unsure anything was happening, there wasn't any proof. Well, right now it's in
       <em>
        everyone's
       </em>
       faces. We should be taking advantage of this.

       Do Americans really want to live in a democracy instead of an oligarchy? I'm beginning to think no. In this case, there should be a separate party (not the Democratic party) for all of the lazy asses who want people to make all the decisions for them.

       Then you'll have no trouble showing us instances in which the collusion you allege actually had an effect on acquiring a second party's compliance in putting an illegal scheme into practice. I'll wait right here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC leaks do show the DNC staffers broke the organization's charter, which requires neutrality in the primaries. I think Sanders or his voters probably have legit civil lawsuits for fraud. But collusion and conspiracy requires evidence of two independent parties arranging to defraud. The most egregious of the leaks just don't show that.

       With his comments over the last few days, I would argue Trumps entire campaign has been a key cog in this Hillary president plot. He is actively throwing the election at this point. With Mr and Mrs Khan, "wind power kills birds" and now today "why cant we just use nukes?" I have no doubt that he is a paid plant meant to derail the GOP and get Hillary into office easily.

       This isn't a "rightwing circlejerk" -- anybody that has been paying attention for the past 20 years know that this involves both parties. The current DNC mess is just the latest incarnation of a special relationship between politics and the media that has existed for a long time.

       You get banned from there even if you're conservative, though. Chabanais spends all day just looking for people he disagrees with or dislikes to ban. Guy has to be flat out mentally ill to be so committed to what he does.

       Well she was working for her in 2008, then they realized they needed someone on the DNC to lock up the 2016 nom, so she took over for Tim Kaine at the DNC, and what's Tim Kaine up to these days?

       Exactly. Thats basically what confirmed for me that he was the people's choice. The right choice. With all the cheating and downplaying the RNC did to Trump (i mean, look at what happened in Colorado) and he STILL won? He won against all odds, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING was against him, except for one thing, the people. The people were for him and the people are for him, he is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       candidate who is
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       us, so we are for him.

       I may not be able to vote due to imperialism. But if i could, me,  and everyone that i talk to, would vote for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, from the get-go, i knew something was off with Hillary, (too reptilian hahaha) and now im
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       that
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       is the number one enemy of the united states of america, its morals, its way of life,  democracy, the liberty and hope it supplies to everyone born on this earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never felt so negative towards a candidate, not even local ones.

       Republican pundits typically are more critical of their candidates, but in the end they shit on the democrats so much more that it doesn't matter.
