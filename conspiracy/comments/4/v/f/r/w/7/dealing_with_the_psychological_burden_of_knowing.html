      <p>
       I've been here for 8 years on reddit, and things sure have changed a lot.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is one of the few remaining places on reddit for real news. This sub looks like what the front page of reddit looked like for the first 3 years of its existence. It was about exposing things, the real truth, and learning about the world. This is what Aaron Schwartz wanted, before they killed him and killed reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the uncomfortable truths are delegated to this ridiculous-sounding "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       " which drives people away who are on the fence. These things that are often talked about on this sub
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       conspiracies, but they're also news, they're speculation or facts about how the world actually works beyond the face of things as we see them. This label of "conspiracy" is a form of censorship in itself, it pushes all the big deal stories to this one small corner of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're newer to reddit, 4 years or less, I bet there was one day when you found this sub. I bet you went through the frontpage of this sub and couldn't believe what you were reading. You probably thought "Why aren't these things being discussed on the news subreddit or the politics subreddit, if they are true?" You may have looked in to a specific story or two, and started realizing that there is something to many of the things talked about here. So you subscribed to the sub, you started reading it regularly. Maybe you decided you don't care about this divisive label of "conspiracy theorist", that it means nothing to you. What idiot would be afraid of theorizing about potential conspiracies, given the endless
       <a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/53_Admitted_False_Flag_Attacks/43969/0/38/38/Y/M.html">
        lists of historical examples?
       </a>
       What kind of sheep is so trained to be afraid of the truth that they run away from it thinking they're doing themselves a favor? You start to question things in a deeper way once the tricks of culture become more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously not everything in this sub is true, far from it. But there are some startling facts that have been presented over and over and have basically been proven to be true. Things like the actions of the intelligence agencies in overthrowing and controlling governments of foreign countries. The funding and support of ISIS by the US and Israel, via Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The fact the BRICS banks and the IMF/World Bank are run by overlapping groups of people. The fact central banks and corporations have far too much control over government, wresting control of it away from the people. The US-Israel connection of funding and arms and police training. The connection of Greater Israel with Zionism and the six-day war. The drug trade from Afghanistan, where 90% of the worlds poppies are grown, for US pharma and illegal drug trade profits. The drug wars caused by the US in Central and South America, for profit. The way the biggest oil companies have infiltrated the governments of the world for their own profit. The demolition of Building 7. Regulatory capture. Compartmentalization. Divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things are very real. These things matter, and drive current events. They are generally provable to be true. They are "open secrets."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the difference between the MSM (including the front pages and main subreddits of reddit) versus places like this subreddit that actually care about the truth, is that they will actually
       <em>
        look in to
       </em>
       those open secrets. They will expose certain interesting tidbits that are selectively ignored by the corporate media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start to realize this is the case, and that
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       sinks in, then if you're anything like me you experienced a psychological trip of sorts where you realized how bullshit many aspects of our society really are. That deep down advertising is actually predatory and evil, it's not that people just say that as a funny cliche. That there really are a bunch of psychopaths with no morality or compassion in many many positions of power, because those are generally the only people with the motivation and willpower to go to the terrible depths necessary to acquire a billion dollars or a high political position. They will sacrifice anything for it, including their morality and the lives of others. They have no problem sleeping at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see the ideologies people believe in, like Christianity, or nationalism/patriotism, or sports, or even scientism (belief in the findings of the scientific establishment above scientific theory itself). You see the greed, people borrowing and spending their lives away, trying to get some sort of emotional perk out of it to make up for the hours of drudgery they had to put themselves through to get the money in the first place. People trapped in cycles, in bad patterns that merely reinforce how fucked we are as a society. You see the denial, you see people shut down when you try to talk about the edges of what they think's "allowed" to talk about. You see people safeguarding their emotions beyond what's reasonable, beyond facts themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while, it crushes you to see it too openly, how many people fall for the bullshit. Everything is so messed up. It's practically unbelievable. If you were like me, you are probably
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       in some stage of disbelief at certain aspects of reality even though they are provably true. Cognitive dissonance is something we all suffer from after living in this bizarre culture, the only difference is some of us try to rectify it and others just essentially distract themselves until they die.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is serious business. These topics strike at the heart of what we think about society, how we think we should treat each other, and what we think of ourselves. What we should be honest about, and what we should hide. What we consider important, and what we consider frivolous.
      </p>
      <p>
       We here are lucky to have the emotional motivation to seek out true important information, even if it is uncomfortable to digest. Others are not so lucky and hide from the truth out of fear, generally fear of losing social standing or losing income. You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. You cannot save the willfully ignorant, they must save themselves. All you can do is actively make important information available to those who have not been exposed to it yet. There are many thirsty people out there who simply can't find water, so to speak. If you're "in the know", it's your job to share this information with others so that we can see our world and our human behavior more clearly. This is the information that our culture, media, and schools deliberately ignore despite being true. Once we can clearly see what we as humans
       <em>
        are actually doing
       </em>
       , then we can start to make adjustments and modifications to it that will have an impact. Otherwise we are just shouting at mirages and illusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that 40,000 people worked on the atomic bombs that blew up Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but only a few hundred of them actually knew what they were making? This is the power of compartmentalization. Everyone makes their little part, and only certain people have the knowledge to see how all the parts come together. Those people are playing the rest, in a sense. Human society is like this in a way, we are all "making our piece" and the pieces come together in ways many of us don't anticipate that profit a very few, like a war or bank bailouts. We each only see our little world, our motivations and fears in our daily lives. We react correspondingly to the avalanche as best we can. Few question where those motivations and fears came from in the first place, and fewer question if they're even necessary at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We program ourselves like a computer, our actions in the present create the conditions that allow the future to occur. "Be the change you want to see in the world" as Gandhi said. But also be the change you want to see in yourself. You can do it, you've been doing it your whole life. Just take their reigns of your own mind for yourself. Take off the training wheels of mainstream culture. It is not your friend, it is there to control you. To put your motivations and fears in to little pre-defined boxes that serve the corporate and governmental machinery, all through your TV or internet connection. 5 corporations own 95% of American all media, from TV to movies to magazines. And it just keeps getting more propagandistic and consolidated, week after week.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first casualty of war is the truth. The time to talk is before there is a war. Now is the time to spread the truth.

       Believe it or not what has really helped me cope with reality has been nature documentaries and also that guy on YouTube "primitive technology". Anyone that is having issues coping go for a walk in a forest. Go to the beach. Just go outside and breathe. Music has also played a major role in me coping with the harsh reality. It's all about acceptance and getting over the fear of the unknown future.

       I have found the same things. I will second your recommendation of Primitive Technology, that is a great channel. Nature documentaries are wonderful. I also have gotten really in to gardening the last year, it's a fun hobby and it makes you yummy food.

       Good stuff. Yeah i think next spring i will also get into gardening as well. But no joke, one day i was at the peak of my anxiety/depression from being awoken, thinking about "What if my bank account closed down tomorrow" so i started looking for survival videos lmao. I came across the Primitive Technology videos and it really gave me a sense of comfort. It forced me to realize that we dont need all this bullshit society has forced upon us. We are perfectly fine being one with nature. At this point I am very accepting of the coming fate and it doesnt bother me at all. I am confident that survival is not out of reach so long as you keep a sound mind and think logically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost want to write a letter to the Primitive Tech guy as he really changed my outlook on life.

       Dude me to! I wish there was more people like him on YouTube. All the other survival channels are crap people trying to get a show on tv. His is so informational and I think it shows that we as humans are more than capable of surviving off things nature gives us

       Until you see chemtrails and find it hard to breathe.  The shit is always around to remind you to worry, but I agree with you wholeheartedly.  Getting out takes you away the first 80% and then that last 20% is forcing our minds to think about more important things, like our momentary happiness.

       I post things on FB and get a few likes and maybe one share....maybe. I blatantly say that if it were something about Kanye West or a new gadget, the post would be liked and shared by way more people. I told my sister how scared I am for my niece and nephew, for the future is looking very grim. I'm glad they don't have much access to MSM or anything corporate as she does a good job of keeping them outdoors to play. But there will come a time when they will be exposed to this filth and I worry for them. I want a good future for them, myself, and everyone in this world.

       I know exactly what you mean, I do the same. Just realize that lots of people are reading those posts on facebook, but many are afraid to like them because for whatever reason they don't want to have their name be associated with that, so it's not quite as bad as it appears. Your message is probably reaching more people than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       But certainly, there is an undercurrent of apathy and anti-intellectualism that allows for deeper issues to go unnoticed by the general public. And it is very disturbing once you're aware of it, after you've seen past the veil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take comfort in knowing that you're seeing what has already been there for thousands of years, and you're lucky enough to live in an age and speak a language and have enough time to realize these truths about how society and our day-to-day lives relates to leadership and power. This is really a blessing, probably less than 1% of the people in world history have had any clue at all about most of how it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       works. Count yourself lucky you live in a time period in a country where you can speak out about these things, and the worst that happens is you don't get likes, instead of being executed or going to jail for eternity. This has happened many many many times. But you're in an age where all you face is being socially ostracized by fearful people that cling to the narratives of authority to sate their fear. We sit in a golden opportunity of knowledge and ability, that gives us the chance to awaken humanity that next step. Maybe we can help change that 1% to 2%, and maybe it starts an exponential growth in awareness that changes society dramatically over the next 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a LOT of afraid people out there, and many of them don't even realize how afraid they are. They are controlled through politeness, social niceties, and PR. They will not have an opinion, because it terrifies them and the last time they did it caused them a lot of heartache. But deep down everyone is a thinking, feeling person. Deep down everyone knows truth when they hear it. And though they may try to be asleep, some people can't fake it anymore. The more people that stand up and point out the reality of the situation we all live in, the more people will have the courage to do the same.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8z7f7a2Pk">
        One person taking a stand can start an avalanche that removes fear and allows others to participate.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people are on the brink, but are too afraid to commit to this line of thinking because they don't want to stand alone. The more people that stand, the more we can stand together. It's why I write the things I do, and I encourage others to voice their feelings too. If we don't speak up now, then when? What will the people on earth 100 years from now think of the actions that we're performing today? Don't you want to be one of those people your great grandchildren's generation can look at, who saw some of the train wrecks coming and tried to say something? I do. This keeps me posting, despite all the bullshit from the people who are clinging to fantasies. There ARE people out there listening, and the more of us that stand up, the less fear those people will feel, and the more likely they will be to stand up too.

       If they're going to do that, they're going to do it. What are you going to do, hide your opinion for your whole life out of fear? If you silence yourself for life, then they win without even lifting a finger. This is the fear that controls us, that keeps us from moving forward as a culture, and allows powerful people to control the narrative for themselves. You can step outside that box, or you can stick to your comfort zone. Up to you

       I talk to people in person. I don't use the internet to talk to friends about political stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys know that facebook censors content based upon keywords? Hell, they censor the messaging app as well. See how long you can keep up a conversation with a friend while dropping some keywords.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that it's not effective. You probably aren't reaching as many friends as you think. If you insist on speaking with your friends online use a messaging app and speak with them directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise I encourage you to actually socialize with people either at your home or their place. Take some friends out to a bar or a pool hall. You will find that your message is much more effective in person and your friends will be more likely to ask questions since it's not a public conversation.

       That might seem true, and I do both.  (not on facebook)  But here's the thing.  Ill make a post on reddit that is viewed by 1000 people, and that has an impact.  Not much of an impact if I am preaching to the choir on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but if I do it elsewhere, it can have a lasting effect.  I know other people do that same thing.  If you aren't reaching people on the internet  then you aren't trying very hard. End of story.

       Not being stupid when you see how facebook is used has nothing to do with fear propaganda. It's fact that the platform is the first thing media goes to in order to solidify a profile for their latest mass shooter.

       Upvoting the fuck out of this... over the past year, lurking on Reddit, and as someone who's now been using Reddit for the past month now, and then seeing how fucked up the world really is has been eye-opening, to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's allowed me to put behind all my personal baggage and self-loathing and reconnect with my family.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's allowed me to overcome my addictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's allowed me to have faith once again, to have hope for a better future for the world around me, and to think about my own actions, the consequences of my actions... to just THINK, period!
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrifying, but from that terror and existential dread I need to keep my chin up, if only for the sake of my family and everything else I hold dear. And from there, even the smallest things feel like massive blessings.

       This resonates with me greatly. I have experienced much of the same. I have been able to let go of many of my vices, my self-doubt and (sometimes) hatred. I have deepened my relationships with both family and faith.

       Having the distractions pointed out in truth makes it easier to focus on the truths that actually bring us happiness.  I'm going through the same stuff.  Family over the years has grown more distant while entertainment and work seem to take up the importance.   Learning more changed that for me.

       Thank you so much for this. From the bottom of my heart.
      </p>

       I got into an arguement the other night with a friend who is so totally brainwashed. He basically screamed at me and said I was crazy. But my other friend told me "Don't worry. I know you are not crazy." Meeting the people in real life who understand the cabal really helps me feel better about the world. People are awakening...slowly. But you are right. You cannot force someone who refuses to even entertain the slightest possibility of an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing and reading the truth seekers words around the world empowers me to speak my truth and stop being afraid of what anyone thinks about it. I have to try. There is no use in keeping this information to ourselves...even though we have an almost impossible job of correcting perceptions. But the facade is fading. You can see it very acutely now. Even if people don't understand the occult and super sinister side of things, they understand that something is deeply and fundamentally wrong with the system.

       You are welcome, it means a lot that my words resonate with others as deeply as I feel them myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your friend only resists so hard because he knows deep down you have a point, and actually considering it scares the bejesus out of him. So he fights it hard to convince himself there's no gray area. This person may come around someday, but don't hold your breath or waste too much time. Spend your time finding people who are open to what you have to say, it's much more productive and less frustrating. Once you know someone is closed-minded all you can do is drop hints here and there, because full-on debate makes them too defensive and worked up so they can't consider these counter-intuitive (for them) ideas. That's my approach anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, we cannot force anyone to think or feel anything they do not want to. You cannot force a flower to bloom. This is where patience is on your side. Plant the seeds, then wait. Water them once in a while, but mostly wait. Maybe a year later something will click about something you said after something that happens to them, and it may change their perspective. They may never admit it to you either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know that when you're giving out truth with the intent to help humanity, if it's done with kindness and love (even if it's tough love) then you know you're working for the betterment of humanity, and you've put that tiny bit of additional positive inertia on the world's culture. This is a good thing that will outlast all of our lifetimes. People talk a lot about "building a future for our children" and they often mean in a financial or technological or environmental sense. But what about the culture we are leaving our children's children? Every interaction we have very slowly changes world culture in the direction that we focus it. It's a drop in the bucket, but a bucket-full is made of drops. One drop of ink can make the whole bucket black. One kind action or profound truth can spread like ripples throughout the culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when we start hitting on these bedrock truths that have been hidden from us, it's unsurprising there's a lot of kickback from the majority who still believe in the system (or else it wouldn't be the system, if a majority no longer believed in it at all). So there's going to be this ideological battle, and we're all participating whether we like it or not. So we might as well do some good, even if there's a lot of idiots and jerks throwing stones at us along the way, that doesn't mean we have to stop traveling towards where we want to go. We don't have to stop and throw rocks back, we can just walk on by. More and more people are gathering together to head toward this higher level of cultural awareness, and it is very exciting. Focus on those people, because the "followers" will flip positions long after the ideological trendsetters have won the battles. I like being on the ideological front lines even though it can have social consequences, because I know it's the right thing to do. No one will ever figure out this mess by using the same type of thinking that got us here in the first place. We desperately need new ideas about how humanity should conduct itself, and we need people brave enough to have them and say them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who is brave enough to try and look reality square in the eye, I applaud them. Anyone who is brave enough to say to others what they actually feel when it comes to the truly big things in life, I applaud them. We need more of this type of thinking if we are to break ourselves out of our authoritarian-designed ideological-cultural chains. This is the future of humanity, and we all get to play a part in shaping it if we choose to.

       The way I like to think about it; you ever hear of that "fun fact" that everyone is only ever 7 people removed from knowing/meeting (not sure which. One) the president? Everyone is much more connected and closer then we think.  I think that if I can just get through to two people in my life with this information, they will know two people that I would never be able to tell this information to someone I could never reach intellectually or physically.  It's hard to stay positive, but anytime you reach out you do change a life.

       When I discuss murky events with people who don't really research much (why wouldn't anyone want to actually educate themselves and explore outside of the cattle pen?? It's looked down upon as ''sad'' by many) I often encounter an argument along the lines of; 'Why isn't it reported in the newspapers or on the tv then? If what you're saying is true, it'd be in the media, where are you getting your information from, sounds like another conspiracy.' I even invite them to conduct their own research and they don't really show any curiosity...
      </p>
      <p>
       I often get into discussions with my brother, who is an intelligent guy but he has this kinda veil draped across him permanently where he always comes back to 'well there's a lot of people out there who make things up'. I even ask him how government operations can be made up when they're declassified but he doesn't seem to make the connection. We always get into semi-heated debates about september 11th, he has this weird thing where he goes ''you have a different version of events, I have the official version, investigated and presented by the government, which one is more authentic?' always cracks me up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought up the possibility of madeleine mccann being sedated by her parents and something going wrong and was treated as though I'd just punched a kitten in the eye or something, I don't know how the poor girl met her demise/was abducted, I am open to all possibilities and have researched the case for many hours over the years, it shocked me how this person reacted though, when it is perfectly logical to be receptive to any potential branching out of an event we were not present to witness.

       I agree completely with the sentiment encapsulated here; i also believe that the visibility of these information types (the type of information that informs us of our situation, and allows us to grasp a "larger picture" view that modifies actions) should be raised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above being true (and i know i'm asking for change and not "being it" in this instance) i really wish this re-post came with some actionable response provided. you started out strong in your assessment of a site like reddit (that by all means should be more dedicated to truth telling, and less to self indulgence), but how do we unite redditors/reddit brass to get this type of material the revered position on reddit that it deserves?

       I don't see it as a burden, why would it? I have this knowledge and many people don't but it's not like it's hidden, if they don't want to open their eyes I won't force them to open them, I'll do what I can with this knowledge though.

       That might seem true, and I do both.  (not on facebook)  But here's the thing.  Ill make a post on reddit that is viewed by 1000 people, and that has an impact.  Not much of an impact if I am preaching to the choir on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but if I do it elsewhere, it can have a lasting effect.  I know other people do that same thing.  If you aren't reaching people on the internet  then you aren't trying very hard. End of story.
