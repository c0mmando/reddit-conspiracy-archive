       So...whos behind the total control and push in social media,  alternative media, conspiracy websites for the Donald Trump campaign. That's the real question.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do they co-opt every single forum/sub-reddited, each one with dozens of anti-Hillary posts, but expect people to believe this is an organic movement?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong either, I'd love to be hating on HRC instead of Trump right now, but it's obvious there is a control effort here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaks, hacks, leaks, hacks. Oh btw, just coincidence the CFR docs are covered up. Wikileaks and Assange are controlled disseminations. They are state actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the information in this thread and others is just pushing an agenda. Why should anyone who follows conspiracies give 1 shit more than another re:any topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       2006-07-08 = Subprime mortgage crisis. Literally = fraudulent market. How many leaks, hacks and 'data dumps' were involved in that? Yeah... how many people went to jail? 0 = you don't say.

       Well the leakbproved what everyone had been saying for 8 months; the DNC colludide with HRC in order to give her the nomination and it cut the democratic process in two. Donald Trump on the other hand took a shattered GOP that couldn't get it's head out of it's ass after John Boehner resigned and United the party.

       Sure buddy. Because you have all the communications behind his rise to where he is now? No, you don't have shit. In politics, when you have an unequal insight to two diametrically opposed political opponents, you are being used. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no different to when a police agency teams up with the local mafia/gang. They start busting (from information given) any potential opponents or free agents. Before long they have an illegal mafia using protectionist laws as a means for aggression and control.

       You're right; i don't have all the communications dealing with all back door politics I'm just using the one's presented to me. Donald Trump does exactly what you just described, but with policy against an establishment that doesn't want him to win. Which is exactly what we as a people should be routing for. He's not perfect, but I fell for hope and change which was supposed to be the presidency we needed to change things; it wasn't. So even though you can present the argument that trump says some nasty things; actions speak louder than words and crushing all validity of a political system to win POTUS seems a bit more important then saying "let's build a wall and kick out all the muslims".

       He doesn't though. In fact he does and says things that fall perfectly in-line with pro-Mossad &amp; pro-Zionist direction. He wants to attack Iran, why? Iran hasn't done anything and the last time they were at war was with a US-Plant/Saddam Hussein who they went themselves and removed years later. Iran

       To anyone that thinks this is racist, anti-semitic or any other bullshit, keep in mind I have nothing against Jewish peoples. Zionist policies are most damaging to Jews, and the lobby attacks those critical calling them 'self-hating Jews' and 'anti-Semitic', it's an absolute disgrace.

       Correction: I said Zionists hate HRC. Zionists are Jews+Christians that believe in Zionist Israel. She also does show she's pretty anti-Zionist too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are various facets of  Zionist powers and globalist powers, and the actual 'powers' behind them. There's also a rift in Israel basically splitting the future of the nation down the middle (literally).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is talk about a two-state solution and
       <a href="http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/328404/palestinian-population-to-pass-jews-by-2017-in-israel-and-territories/">
        Palestinians will outnumber Jews very soon
       </a>
       - the reaction this this is mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I think it's incorrect to say "Jews rule the world" or to think that. They are just like every other nation, and there are 'power brokers' that control or manipulate every nation including the people running them. Israel is just leveraged far beyond many other nations &amp; many of their people are positioned to wield an ungodly amount of power and influence around the world (media, etc). Israel also splits the Middle East down the middle (figurative and practically).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a belief, not just Judaic belief, but also a Christian belief that Israel plays a part in bringing forth the next Messiah and the return of god basically. (not even joking, I wish I were...) The worst part is it's directed tied in to what world leaders believe and do, as well as the power brokers. Whether or not they truly believe it, or it has anything to do with their motives, no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, this is where it gets really hard to know exactly what's going on. Some people say there's an actual fight amongst the powers, rooted in the Jesuits vs Masons, or something like that. I have no idea. I can't answer that. What I can say is you will 100% be able to recognize a difference in opinion between the left-leaning Jews, secular Israelis, compared to the right-leaning Zionist (includes Jews and Christian Zionists) who believe Israel must exist as a nation and the contrast it represents not only should remain but be increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros I think is diametrically opposed to the hard line Zionists, and he fits in with the Rockefellers and a few other globalists, who have other ideas of how globalization should occur. Soros is quoted as saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So he at least recognizes or publicly recognizes the potential blowback of having authoritarian power over all dissent to Israeli foreign policy. Israel has a wanton disregard for almost anyone it steps on in its game of Risk. I don't think he's going to give up
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       globalist agenda, but in the face of the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       globalist agenda it might not be as bad (?or maybe worse?) Personally I think the bold actions by the state (Mossad False Flags, Incursions on Palestinians, Deception in the Media, hardline control over US policy) a lot of this has the potential to turn the entire nation against Jews where it should be against Israel(the state-leaders-actors). It's not totally unlike the US. How many nations is the US going to fuck up, before the Radical Islamic Jihadi-Hate  deception becomes a reality? (Maybe that's the point?)
      </p>
      <p>
       So is there a 'good' or 'bad' side? idk. The hardest part for regular people is that we don't get the full story, so we don't even know who's doing what or who's behind what. The stuff you read is also lobbed from other sides, at each other. All the negative you read on one person, that information was likely disseminated by their opposing force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is what makes me suspicious of everything that's come out on HRC. I don't like HRC, but I also know the
      </p>
      <p>
       I know AIPAC is traditionally seen as hardline Zionism, and so is the Bush dynasty, (Christian-Zionists) and we saw exactly what's happened when they push their agenda. You can also see what's happening to their enemies. They don't ever seem to be out of power, even when they their people aren't holding the office of POTUS.
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/we-re-going-to-take-out-7-countries-in-5-years-iraq-syria-lebanon-libya-somalia-sudan-iran/5166">
        Remember the 7 Country Plan?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Global Warfare: “We’re going to take out 7 countries in 5 years: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan &amp; Iran..”
       </em>
       They are nearly done. And Trumps blabbering about Iran is almost prophetic when you remember this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of prophetic, the Bush dynasty:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1844, Christian restorationist George Bush, a professor of Hebrew at New York University and distantly related to the Bush political family, published a book entitled The Valley of Vision; or, The Dry Bones of Israel Revived.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe the Zionist agenda is going to happen no matter what and we have no choice but to let it transpire, simply so we can move into the next epoch of human civilization. In which case it's good than? Beats me.

       Great post man, and thank you for taking the time to explain all the to me (I did read it all I'm not patronizing you). Thank you for not attacking me, and I think we have the same issues: we have all the information in the world, but it's hard to say what is fact, who it comes from, and why it's been presented. I think the power struggle is real, and that's the real reason we've seen so many false flag attacks as one power elite playing another ( mostly Israeli massad).

       If you read my last post, wait will you finish this one, it's a doozy!

       Thanks for the kind words. It's ironic you might expect an attack (for being mildly critical-not even really), because the questions you posed/asked
       <strong>
        are exactly what people
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         should
        </em>
       </strong>
       <strong>
        be asking!"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't give a proper explanation as to who's running or controlling the planet, but I can pick out manipulated thought and controlled actions. I see it right now (the majority) as for the push for Trump.  I would love it if Trump were truly "an outsider"...its clear he isn't thought. And if I actually witnessed an effective campaign against him, Id acknowledge it, there simply isn't one currently. Trump is winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm usually just left sitting around with my thumb up my ass getting down voted but it's nice to see someone who questions the narrative, even if it's the "alternative narrative".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just want to reiterate to other readers, I am
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       saying Zionist-agendas are better/worse than other globalist agendas. Im still trying to figure it out myself. The Zionist-agendas however seem to be very brazen, and they just plain
       <em>
        scare the shit out of me.
       </em>
       Not only for the people they target, but in the long run I can see the blowback being very, very, very, (did I mention "Very!")
       <strong>
        bad
       </strong>
       for regular, secular or anti-Zionist Jews (which there are actually a lot of.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally exactly how Hitler came into power. Certain banking powers were exerting unbridled control over Germany. The rich power brokers fled, and the
       <em>
        common man
       </em>
       (no different from you or I, was left behind) Hitler leveraged the manipulation over his people to wield extreme power. He was a very likeable and loved leader also, and well respected. I am
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       tying to build him up, or justify his reign or actions or beliefs or anything like that, in fact, Im trying to do the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       . Im warning people that if you allow a people to have complete control over another people, and they abuse that position, there is only one inevitable solution to the problem...and its not good. (It will always involve racial incitement if indeed races and policies towards them are drawn in the sand prior)
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing Mossad to operate without oversight, commit false flags, perpetuate lies, etc-in the long run its really going to threaten Jews. (even though the actors are acting on behalf of Zionist-Israel, who do not care about Jews.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And here for the anti-Hillary, anti-Soros, anti-anti-Zionist glory, let me let you in on a secret. Remember how Bush went into Iraq with the UK but didn't seek UN approval? Anyone privy to why that was? Ill explain. Just as described in other posts, there are diametrically opposed powers who see various routes or paths to
       <del>
        world domination
       </del>
       globalization. ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I hit on it in a previous post, but the Bush dynasty is an old-Christian-Zionist family. Their religious beliefs are that Jews returning to the holy land = next Jesus (I wish I were kidding.) they are the ones who are anti-HRC, and they start wars and they believe in fucking Arabs up the ass. That doesn't mean HRC is good or better than them, but if you acknowledge the 'leaks' and 'hacks' against her, and the fact she was investigated for Benghazu more than 9/11, it makes you say "HUH?? WTF???"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's take a breather...Who's the opposite power to the Zionists? That's Soros and HRC. This is why Fox News attacks Soros and Clinton. From my understanding, the "Arab Spring" was a Soros venture, and it overturned the very long standing Hasni Mobarek, an Israel stool pigeon, likely playing a part for Zionism. The "Spring" however, is very similar to Bolshevism, which is directly tied in to the opposite of Zionist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros is aligned with Noam Chomsky, the Rockefellers, the United Nations and others. They are non-Zionist globalists. Diametrically opposed to them are the Zionist leaders. This includes the Bush dynasty, Karl Rove, Fox News, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait... did you just say "the UN".....?...... Yes, I did. The 'UN', the agency George Bush ignored during 9.11  and went into Iraq anyway because 'god' told him to. I'm going to give some frightful information:
      </p>
      <p>
       [
       <strong>
        UN
       </strong>
       WRA indoctrinates kids in Palestine to kill random Jews, at any time, anywhere, should you see them and have access to a knife. Here's the rub: the UN is a very non-Zionist Jew organization. It was created after the short war between Israel and Palestine, in the 6 day war.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnLIzNGb9gI">
        So why are they allowing this to happen in UNWRA schools???
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't fully wrap my head around this, but I would assume a rich, traditionalist Palestinian or Arab, or Muslim, would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       want their kids brainwashed like this. It doesn't help them in any way. Incubating and fostering radicals doesn't help your people. I would (hopefully) assume Arab leaders can recognize this, and I'd hope they were somehow tricked into this approval of the abhorrent behaviour, but maybe they are just bought off... who knows(??) but can you imagine your government approving the message of
      </p>
      <p>
       = "blacks are inferior and they should be stabbed with a knife because they threaten our existence and hope to take over America" -this is the message UNWRA was pushing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the message coming out of  Israel. It's also the message coming out of Soros/banking-hidden Israel. (based off information I cannot disseminate). Let's look at it overall though... UNWRA is anti-Zionist although seems to be playing off anti-Semitism accounts. UNWRA is the UN, funded by member nations. UNWRA is radically 'terrorist' but its likely being co-opted by or influenced by Israel and Palestinian leaders are too shortsighted to see this is going to negatively affect their youth.
      </p>

       Your whole post leaves out Obama. With no offence ment, it just seems like your post focuses a lot on Bush admin, and now here we are at the 2016 election. Here's the vig; an American populace was on the verge of dissent after the Bush era so they put a black man in office, and everyone sat down, like they won the prize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was anything but a true liberal president. And you can make examples of both sides of the agenda you proposed that Obama supported. Mainly the lifting of sanctions on Iran (let's call this pro-Arab) and the rise of ISIS (we can call this pro-mossad). We saw a lot of false flag attacks during an Obama presedency, and they bombed the crap out of Lybia. We can look at The Brexit as being an anti globalist movement, but does that mean it's move was actually pro-is real by insiting rage against Muslims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's talk the refugee crisis because this gets convoluted as well. I've heard the refugees into Europe is actually a plan to eventually wipe out the white race (seems silly as science proves a wider gene pool makes a stronger organism) and is orcadtrated by the Zionist Elite. I've also heard George Soros has his hand in that pie as well. So you have an agenda to populate European countries with refugees that is pro-mossad (easier to pull off false flag attacks and blame those dang syrians, in site state amongst Europeans towards arabs etc.) But the one thing I have to ask you to speculate on: if that was the grand fascad, then why would these liberal career politicians force the refugees on their people even though it is ending their careers?

       Yes, because I was focusing on the Zionist-Agenda. This is directly opposite the Marxist-Agenda. Both are globalist agendas, both directly tied in with Israeli policy, just different influences at the top and behind the players.

       I don't think anyone can analyze Brexit properly as of yet. It will become more apparent once the fallout/reaction/end game is realized. Until then its impossible. For all we know it was engineered simply so something bad would come out of it, to teach voters &amp; other countries the lesson (don't back out).

       The reason people get confused is because no matter who's in power, they are being leveraged by the other side. But you can tell by following the money, Obama and HRC are supported by the traditional leftist powers. Regarding globalization you have Rockefeller, Soros, the UN on the left (Marxist, Bolshevism, etc) and on the right you have the Christian &amp; Jewish-Zionists, like the Bush dynasty, McCain, Bibi Netenyahoooo!
      </p>
      <p>
       The two slightly disagree on how the world should be taken over. I addressed the Zionist agenda, because even when Obama was in office, they still have traditionally more power than the other side. AIPAC I believe is aligned with more traditionally Zionist-policies and influence. Just look at how many investigations and attacks, partisan investigations, etc on the current administration. Then consider Bush's presidency, which included an illegal war and likely a lot of stuff worse we don't even know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean to make it a right/left issue either, because it's clear there's a larger agenda at play and it seems to progress no matter who's in power. I think it comes down to 'who will do the least damage'. Though Id also say it appears the agenda moved forward the most with Bush in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought up the UN and what UNWRA is doing as a counterpoint and caveat to everything I was saying about the right though. Soros I think left his fingerprints behind in the Arab Spring. Maybe his idea is to overthrow nations from the inside, as opposed to military intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see why the right prefers the latter though as they are aligned with defense contractors.

       Well, they are currently pushing that "race" doesn't exist, while in Israel they are moaning about the purity of the Jew (From their own papers). Humans are complex organisms, we are not talking about evolution we are talking about social-evolution. Social strength is different from biological strength. A nation with a clear racial and cultural identity, with nationalist pride is very dangerous. And it's not a "conspiracy" it was literally laid out as a plan and ideology.

       There's an irony this ideology that race doesn't exist, but 'whiteness' is the cause of racism, so it needs to be removed by mixing of peoples (while maintaining the purity of their -the proponents- own race).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they have neo-nazi groups pushing "white genocide" simply to be offensive as possible to get people to instantly ignore it, or if its just a visceral reaction some have. The racist underpinnings in this ideology is blatant and abhorrent.

      <p>
       I don't know how people completely ignore this when there are so many obvious markers of it transpiring exactly as it was laid out in books, many years ago.

       conspiracy, I think it's globalists and power brokers, operating out of Israel because they have the most influence from media and social engineering done. Whether or not the most influential people behind this are Jews, Christians or Green Lizards from Outer-space (sarcastic nod to David Icke) I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretending none of this is happening though is not healthy. People are going to wake up eventually and Jews are going to get blamed. It kinda seems like Christian-Zionist take advantage of that because they do their dirty work using the face of Israel. I can see it blowing up in everyone's face eventually. They've made it so any criticism of Israel/Mossad/Zionist policies, someone gets labelled anti-semite, discredited, attacked, socially ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is authoritarian rule and that type of thing only ends one way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't even "conspiracy" talk either, there are scholarly works out there citing totally mainstream and official sources, official policies, etc-and it all shows extreme control over the US to support a Israeli/globalist agenda. The authors are denounced of course, but they are literally talking about actual facts and realities. It's truly bizarre. Just as it doesn't make sense the Palestinians allow their children to be indoctrinated, it's almost similar, and equally bizarre influential Jews allow their name &amp; face be attached to all these truly disastrous policies and racist bigotry aimed at anyone outside the Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact it can't be discussed is going to breed some really bad shit in the future. Imagine if the Chinese owned all our media companies. Would people not say something? Fox News pundits still call them "red China"  FFS. Russia? Would CNN and MSNBC not say anything if Russian companies own and produced 90% of movies and each one were favourable to Russia? The worst racism today is unrecognized racism. Where its okay for one group to be treated differently, better or worse than another, where customs, cultures and race are not respected equally. And for sure, both sides of the globalist coin are not helping in this department. This seems to be where both globalist agendas meet in the middle too. Though both sides have disastrous intentions overall.

       i actually believe the push, because hillary is certain doom, and trump is possibly on our side.

       considering we dont have much of a choice, his plan is DEFINITELY BETTER.

       globalism is a serious danger, that and depopulation are real, not conspiracy theories.

       the reason behind the push is because its the only option before moving to a true revolution.

       we need to peacefully oppose globalism at the grass roots.

       hillary is the one FIXING the election, so obviously its the most intelligent choice to resist, whatever that means.

And for sure, both sides of the globalist coin are not helping in this department. This seems to be where both globalist agendas meet in the middle too. Though both sides have disastrous intentions overall.
