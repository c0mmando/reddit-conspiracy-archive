<p>Department of War</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a thing. It still is, in fact - just renamed for the sake of doublespeak:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_War">United States Department of War</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The War Department</strong> existed from August 7, 1789[1] until September 18, 1947, when it split into Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force and joined the Department of the Navy as part of the new joint National Military Establishment (NME), <strong>renamed the United States Department of Defense in 1949.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since then the US has &quot;defended&quot; itself from no one, and has <strong>MADE WAR</strong> on almost everyone.</p>

<p>But hey. what&#39;s in a name, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant. I&#39;m pleased to see you&#39;re not being steamrolled and downvoted. I do want to add to this (although stating simply that &quot;you own your own body and no one should be able to forcibly inject you against your will&quot; should <em>end the fucking argument</em> (akin to when socialists/communists/facists/statists list the &quot;benefits&quot; of said economic policy: it doesn&#39;t fucking matter if it &quot;works&quot; (it doesn&#39;t), I am a free individual, you <em>don&#39;t have the right to enforce it</em>) .... but I digress.) There are mounds and mounds of &quot;studies&quot; (which IMO are questionable, and the studies were designed to prove a presupposed conclusion) that &quot;prove&quot; rather conclusively that vaccinations are not correlated with autism... What... about... double-vaccinations? Did the studies include those? Because I have firsthand experience showing rather conclusively that it does. My sister-in-law&#39;s son (nephew by law) was double-vaccinated when he was 4. Very soon after, a few months, I believe, he had a seizure that nearly killed him... it was probably closer to a stroke. My brother was with him at the time of the episode (not his son) - and he was charged with shaken-baby, although none of the signs of shaken-baby were present... the doctor &quot;diagnosed&quot; it and that was that, my brother was arrested and charged and is now a felon. His mother has the records of double-vaccination.  They have had an expert neurologist look at the x-rays and he says it is absolutely <em>not</em> shaken-baby, that there is old, dry blood in his brain. Anywho, fast forward 6 years, the child was diagnosed with autism. He is an 10 year old who behaves like a three-year-old. Truly sad.</p>

<p>So - double vax &gt; seizure/stroke &gt; autistic. While I cannot directly connect or correlate the two myself, I can ascribe my own intellectual assessment and say it&#39;s... curious. <em>In any case</em> the benefits/drawbacks of vaccinations <em>doesn&#39;t fucking matter.</em> As <a href="/u/drewshaver">/u/drewshaver</a> so brilliantly put it, again, you own your own body and no one should be able to forcibly inject you against your will. Fucking period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s absolutely horrible what happened to your brother and nephew-in-law! Thanks for sharing your story.</p>

<p>While I haven&#39;t done enough research to comment on the possible dangers, particularly with regards to autism and its mysterious etiology, I do have to respect the free individual argument in this case. I was a stark supporter of vaccinations prior to this thread for reasons that I still consider valid, but I see that my information was incomplete and (as long as it truly doesn&#39;t put others in harm&#39;s way), I&#39;d be a hypocrite to <em>not</em> consider mandatory vaccinations wrong. I appreciate your input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main idea is that anti-vaxxers believe that vaccines have negligible impacts on improving one&#39;s life and some instances make it worse (i.e. vaccines =autism). They also believe that government agencies and medical organizations have no right in implementing vaccination policies for all Americans (although its more of an encouragement then a requirement).  </p>

<p>They often advocate that holistic and spiritual healing practices are safer and better options (even though both cover broad definitions). And of course, they do not trust Big Pharma and manufactured drugs.</p>

<p>While I personally sympathize their concerns with Big Pharma, one has to understand that the technology is neither inherently good or bad but how and who its implemented can have positive or negative implications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the anti-vaxxer arguments is: you have the right to vaccinate yourself, (and your children) in order to make yourself immune to a disease. Great. Now that you&#39;re immune, what business is it of yours whether or not someone else chooses to vaccinate in order to make <em>themselves</em> immune? How is their susceptibility to a disease which vaccines are supposed to immunize you from, any danger to <em>you?</em></p>

<p>Edit: clarity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>saying marijuana has no medical value is really quite ignorant</p>

<p>if &#39;anti-depressants&#39; have a medical value, then marijuana does because it is a very effective anti-depressant at the least.  </p>

<p>It stimulates appetite, there another medical use.  It combats nausea.  It treats epilepsy.  </p>

<p>Really gtfo with your ignorant troll comment.  </p>

<p>Also, for those claiming that these websites are government run, and they&#39;ll obviously be lying. Here&#39;s a website that&#39;s not government run, and is a somewhat &#39;conspiracy website&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theness.com/index.php/fear-not-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/">http://www.theness.com/index.php/fear-not-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/</a></p>

<p>For those too lazy to read, here&#39;s the quick summary and stated by the website:</p>

<p>-&quot;As the follow-up studies started being published, however, it became more and more clear that there was no link between MMR and autism.&quot;</p>

<p>-&quot;There are other data and arguments, too complex to explain here. The bottom line is this: Yes, there is reason to believe that thimerosal, in sufficient doses, could be toxic and cause neurological damage. But the best data we have so far indicates that thimerosal probably was not given in high enough dose to be neurotoxic&quot;.</p>
