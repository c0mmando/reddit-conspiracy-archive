       Obviously this is part of a larger problem. I used CTR in the headline because we all know who they are. I'm against all types of shilling and I don't really know how it can be stopped, but it most definitely is affecting our experience here.

       Its quite interesting seeing the front page be all anti-trump hit-pieces as opposed to the anti-Clinton stories we saw leading up to the nomination.  You don't hear anything about the DNC emails or false Russian government blaming even though those threads got tens of thousands of comments.

       Ever wonder why the "Soviets" were so willing to go along with the whole converting of NAZI prison/work/internment camps (mind you, many had brothels AND full size pools), to DEATH CAMPS - murdering an entire "race" highly inefficiently, yet their scientists, the best in the former free world...had a great idea.  Use the previously unknown (and since unknown) using human blood as an accelerant to cremate bodies.

       i know all about that man. all the "concentration camps" with relatively small number of casualties (in the thousands up to low tens of thousands) were in West Germany. All the "extermination camps" with million of people who supposedly went up in smoke were on the Soviet occupied East Germany.

       Conversation I had with an apologist a few weeks back.  He couldn't accept such truths until this one critical aspect came out.  Putin has been just recently released information that some 90% of the Bolsheviks were all ethnic Jews.  These are the same disgusting people who murdered the Tsar and his family in cold blood, then wiped out how many millions of Russians?   More than the so-called Holocaust (the one they demand be capitalized)  Seems very strange, to say the least.

       Why is this not discussed ever?   Bring this up in the default subs, and the truth will immediately be silenced.  Certain people don't want this highly inconvenient truth to cross people's ears or lips.

       The International Red Cross Report on the Victims of War from 1948 numbers the victims of all german camps at 275000. Now, one must remember that the Red Cross had access to the German camps, but not to those in the USSR. The number of people that went up in smoke didn't even break 1 million until the 50's.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Europe it's a crime to say these things. In my country, for example, I can go to jail for up to 2 years if I talk about these things on a public platform aka in the press, at a rally, on radio/tv . Nobody was ever convicted or charged, mainly because most of the population (after 50 years of communist utopia) at least suspects these things are fishy. People here, in private, have a much better opinion of the German Army then of the Allies.

       "The Nazis might have killed the Jews, but the bad guys won WW2" is a common thing to hear among Romanians.

       Veyr likely the "right" way to view it.    I can'treally blame them.  Ao, who were the real "monsters" a f WWII.  What happened after the so-called end of the war seals the answer to that in my mind.  It makes me sick still just thinking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I wish I was joking.    This very inconvenient truth is not something widely discussed.  Id someone today heard it, they would very likely discount outright as "conspiracy theory."  ZThese very easily verified tidbits spell out a lot to the world.  They still resist learning or accepting these truths.

       As were witnessing it fall apart all around us now, will they learn this time?  How many engineered financial collapses does one need to go through to determine, 1. Those running the finance world flay out SUCK.  JOB #1...hey can't even do they right.  2.  When the cui bono is answered as "THEM," when will the masses recognize the difference between eomething just innocently outside of their control... again..."sorry guys!"...and an outright attack AGAINST us.

       The loser, if he endorses the winner, always has his campaign funds transferred to the DNC (and thus the winning campaign). More than election fraud, you really ought to be considering the idea that your bolshevik jew hero WAS NEVER ACTUALLY RUNNING and always intended this to happen.

       “SANDERS” make sense there? I omitted “more”, because the former makes zero sense. What better way to hide your crime than to accuse your opponent of doing it? That has been used innumerable times in the past by… well, you won’t like this, but jews.

       Reddit is capital-generating private property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which wouldn't exist under marxism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the Reddit owners
       <strong>
        can't
       </strong>
       be marxists, QED.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, Hillary Clinton is super not a marxist. The Democrats aren't anywhere close to marxists. I'm an anarcho-communist, I know marxism and marxists. Look around on any of the communist-oriented subs here on Reddit, and see how much support you find there for Clinton or even for the default Reddit subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats are a capitalist party, same as the Republicans, and have been for
       <em>
        at minimum
       </em>
       the last 116 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that as a result of the Cold War, the default term for somebody politically that you don't like is "Marxist!" without any thought or consideration to their
       <em>
        actual ideology
       </em>
       . Even Bernie Sanders isn't a socialist, much less a communist, as he's not calling for worker control of the means of production. At best you could call him a social democrat, and communists take a very dim view of social democrats as it was German social democrats who killed Rosa Luxemburg and basically held the door open for right wing fascists.

       But CTR is not being suppressed anywhere on the internet. On the contrary, most of Silicon Valley is probably helping them pro-bono, because "Right Side of History

       To be honest it doesn't really matter if they shill for Trump or Hillary. They are both terrible nominees and they are both part of the establishment (as Sanders would be). The game is already lost by the Americans, politics is a charade, it's all irrelevant.

       Thing is, it does not matter what they claim they will do (or what they've done so far), once in the office, their actions will be the continuation of Bush/Obama (sucking the cocks of the corporations, eroding the liberties etc.).

       How does this address what CTR does? I didn't think it was allowed on Reddit to manipulate votes with multiple accounts. If one individual is paying for CTR and they are all voting based on what they are told to do how is that not breaking any Reddit rules?

       Bullshit. Reddit is only "open and accessible" for their paying corporate clients. The average user can go fuck themselves.

      <p>
       True, but actually very dark. More freedom from "attack or ridicule" means less freedom for people to express themselves, ask tough questions or have a dissenting opinion. All they have to do is continually expand the definition of "attack or ridicule" until it includes anything they don't want you to say.

       Would it be possible to set up a script or RES filter than hides all posts from accounts that only post in specific subreddits? IE
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . Most real users have other interests and post outside of political subs, I feel this would be the easiest way to filter out the shills.

       I think the issue is simpler than the content of their comments. One person isn't supposed to be allowed to manipulate the votes, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I were to create a few hundred accounts to upvote my posts then I would probably get banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I pay for Reddit users to upvote my posts it's fine. It's really a double-whammy. They help control which posts get visibility and also what comments get visibility.

       it was known for a long time that 90% of Bolsheviks were jews. In my country, there were less then 50 non-jewish communists before the Red Army took over.

       Reddit is capital-generating private property.

       Which wouldn't exist under marxism.

       Therefore, the Reddit owners
       <strong>
        can't
       </strong>
       be marxists, QED.

       On top of that, Hillary Clinton is super not a marxist. The Democrats aren't anywhere close to marxists. I'm an anarcho-communist, I know marxism and marxists. Look around on any of the communist-oriented subs here on Reddit, and see how much support you find there for Clinton or even for the default Reddit subs.

       The Democrats are a capitalist party, same as the Republicans, and have been for
       <em>
        at minimum
       </em>
       the last 116 years.

       The problem is that as a result of the Cold War, the default term for somebody politically that you don't like is "Marxist!" without any thought or consideration to their
       <em>
        actual ideology
       </em>
       . Even Bernie Sanders isn't a socialist, much less a communist, as he's not calling for worker control of the means of production. At best you could call him a social democrat, and communists take a very dim view of social democrats as it was German social democrats who killed Rosa Luxemburg and basically held the door open for right wing fascists.

       Is that enough of an argument?
