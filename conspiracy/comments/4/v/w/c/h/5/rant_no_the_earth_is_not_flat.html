<p>I proposed that you ban any conspiracy that a reasonably equipped person could disprove. </p>

<p>Examples: </p>

<p>-Magnets don&#39;t work (lol)</p>

<p>-Florida does not exist (anyone can drive there)</p>

<p>-Earth is flat (anyone can put an iphone on a high altitude weather balloon and film the curvature)</p>

<p>Flat-earthers on here are, AT BEST mentally-ill people who need help and at worst flat-out (lol) disinfo shills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely not a flat earther, but to be fair, the curvature in those videos can at least partially be explained by the optical distortion caused by the extremely short focal length of the lenses they use. This can be seen as the curvature becomes negative at some points when the camera is moving around a lot. </p>

<p>If it was centered (which it isnt btw) the curve would actually be near flat meaning; the thing about these round lenses is that only the absolute center point is not distorted, everything around it will have some curve, obvisouly the further away the more curve.</p>

<p>And by rational you mean taking everything for granted that has been spoonfed to us since we first started learning things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the edges exaggerate the curvature when near the edge.</p>

<p>However you can clearly see curvature even when the line reaches the near-center of the screen. Additionally the distortion at the top of the lends will not cause a left or right distortion </p>

<p>All of that orbital tech can work with towers, no need for some thoysand of miles away device that somehow shoots right at you while it is dragging through atmosphere that some doesn&#39;t degrade it&#39;s orbit ever. </p>

I do acknowledge the bubbles, but that has nothing to do with ISS, the Chinese spacewalk that had those was with their own vessel and indeed the footage was full of those bubbles. ISS spacewalk footage sometimes have stuff floating around or going by, but I have yet to see air bubbles rise. I would not be surprised the least that the Chinese faked or partially faked the footage, just like they do with big events and have computer generated graphics just in case something goes wrong and so on.</p>

<p>I could go through the vid point by point but I doubt that makes any difference. He hasn&#39;t thought through how people moving and forces acting on them work and look like in microgravity, and that (movement) was one of the major points he had. From my point of view the video was built on ludicrous ideas that would be even harder to fake than the real deal, things he didn&#39;t understand and mostly had not researched even a bit, cherry picked footage (which would be fine if it had something real in it) and lack of common sense.</p>

<p>I do see how a video like that can affect people, and unfortunately that may mean they will then start avoiding any media outlet on the non-conspiracy side, like NASA / SpaceX videos, forums discussing current / past space exploration, etc, and might not get to see any explanations for things they think are faked or think those through themselves.</p>

<p>Obviously the same works the other way around too, and like me I likely won&#39;t read / watch more of ISS hoax related material unless something surfaces that gets my attention. I&#39;m not on the conspiracy sub without a reason, but this one just does not seem likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing, the Flat Earth theory is laughably wrong and this discussion is some sort of manufactured distraction. We agree on this. However, I do have sympathy for the people caught up in this  because NASA is so clearly corrupt, and there are many legitimate claims to fundamental fraud concerning many of our aeronautical feats. People who have come to this conclusion that the earth is flat have simply arrived at a very poor conclusion based on the logical assumption that if NASA is a fraudulent organization then we must distrust everything they say. People simply extrapolate these new-found assumptions to the (n)th degree and come out believing everything science tells us wrong. While much of what the poor excuse for modern science tells us is based on flawed conclusions based on a lack of willingness to rethink the Copenhagen Interpretation and every contribution to physics after quantum mechanics, most of the theoretical achievements that came before this were based in reality and have a lot of merit. We do not need to jettison all science, just most of the modern stuff that comes off as more magic-based fantasy than anything based on a mechanical understanding of the world around us. Afterall, that is what physics was intended to do, to explain the world around using observations we can repeat.</p>

<p>Based on this reality, I don&#39;t even really mind the flat earthers, I find them to be wasting large amounts of time and to be a very large distraction -- but I see them as misguided allies rather than a nemesis. <strong>I&#39;d rather people having such a fundamental distrust of modern society that they believe the earth is flat rather than people having an religious-like illogical trust in society that does not waiver even when all evidence points to the contrary. Do you see how this duality emerges? I find myself in kinship with these people even they are so clearly being for an extraordinary ride.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well put - in fact you have explained the most common logical fallacy of conspiracy theories, not just flat earth. </p>

<p>As alternative thinkers, we are very good at seeing through official/government/media/NASA bullshit. However, knowing that you have been told a lie, and even being able to prove it, doesn&#39;t mean you then know the truth of what actually happened, and we tend fill this void by developing multiple alternative theories (often aided and abetted by the actual conspirators who want to muddy the water as much as possible) most of which must be wrong, or only partially true.</p>

<p>Flat Earth raises interesting questions, and it&#39;s a venerable old conspiracy theory. I think everyone on this sub should have at least considered the arguments (some of which are quite interesting) and not dismiss it without consideration, as this is precisely what we accuse the mass unwoken of doing in relation to &quot;real&quot; conspiracies.</p>

<p>Finally, for anyone is considering Flat Earth, the simplest and most compelling arguments against it involve the sun. For instance, the FE model can just about explain 24hrs of sunlight in the Arctic during the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice, but has no means of explaining how this same phenomenon is recorded by those working in Antarctic research stations during the Southern Hemisphere summer. This simple fact kills the FE theory stone dead, in my view.</p>

<p>I am sure your comment falls in the realm of a philosophical fallacy.</p>

<p>Every snowflake, every dew drop and every drop of rain started it&#39;s existence based around a mote of something. That something is a chemical or element, at least. </p>

<p>You are just showing your age or level of observance to admit you deny there has not been a marked difference in the leavings of planes since the &#39;70&#39;s. </p>

<p>The fuel is very similar, the altitudes are as well. I don&#39;t believe atmospheric humidity has changed on average. This leaves only one other factor in the production of persistent <em>con</em>trails.</p>

<p>Somehow thee is more particulate matter in the &quot;plane traffic&quot; area of the sky.</p>

<p>Just because I have noticed this does not mean I believe the gubbermints is spraying us with mind controlling nanobots.</p>

<p>At the least it is a sign of air traffic pollution. But if you have read Dr Eastlund or Dr Begich  you might have a more educated and enlightened approach.</p>

<p>How far away are the sun and moon? </p>

<p>What is their shape then?</p>

<p>Seriously, there are so many different flavours of flat earthers you need to narrow it down so I know what direction this is going. It only fair as you know my take.</p>

<p>As for Kansas...</p>

<p>If you erected a 200&#39; tower on one side of Kansas and the same on the other you could use a theodilite and a little math to be aware of the curvature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;m denying heliocentrism. It&#39;s just a theory, and a flawed one at that. The sun, moon, and stars orbit the earth--geocentrism. I can&#39;t spell everything out to you, I&#39;ve done over a hundred hours of research on this. The documentary Journey to the Edge of the Universe (which doesn&#39;t mention flat earth even once) walks you through all the theories and how heliocentrism was essentially disproven once we had technology to do the proper experiments. Geocentrism makes much more sense, particularly when you watch time lapses showing how the stars revolve around a fixed earth. The earth can&#39;t be flying through space in a corkscrew fashion while people for thousands of years charted navigation under the stars. </p>

<p>Yes, of course the space program is fake. There&#39;s ample evidence to support this.</p>

<p>An endless universe is still possible with a flat earth, but I don&#39;t know if I believe it or not. There could be many more earths just like ours, but not the way we&#39;ve been told with other planets in outer space. I don&#39;t believe we can travel to any of the planets, or to the moon.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether I believe in a divine creator, but it seems more possible with a flat earth than with the big bang theory.  I know a lot of Christians are flat earthers because it validates their religion, but I don&#39;t share their religious outlook.</p>

<p>I just shared scientific evidence that Kansas is flat, so you can&#39;t turn around and tell me there&#39;s still curvature. </p>

<p>Is it really that hard to believe that the most powerful and corrupt people in this world would lie to the masses for their own agenda, whatever that might be? </p>

<p>I know how crazy flat earthers must seem to you. I felt that way once too. I can&#39;t convince you, only you can convince yourself. And you may not be ready now or ever. But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the world is much different than we&#39;ve been told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been a FE skeptic (as in I&#39;m skeptical of the entire theory), but I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s a guise to cover up perhaps additional land that we&#39;ve never been told about.</p>

<p>One theory as to why they would screw with us about our planets real state.  Albeit a weak one.</p>

<p>edit: there was something I watched on flight paths and how some of them seemed to make a huge triangle on a globe, but were suddenly a very straight line on a FE-type model.  I&#39;m still not convinced, but it&#39;s interesting to think about.</p>

<p>edit2: lol, I love how I even say that <strong>I don&#39;t believe in it</strong> yet still get mass downvoted.  I&#39;ll entertain a theory even if I know deep down it&#39;s bullshit.  I guess having an open mind does get you into shit these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth basically puts humans back in the position that we WERE created by a god, gods, creators. Which in turn would bring an awakening of the people that basically everything we know is a lie and we have been manipulated by secret societies, through science and everything else, for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>Flat earth does not bring about a new religion or a political party, or really any negative effect on anyone&#39;s personal lives. So I don&#39;t understand why people get so worked up about it. If you say it doesn&#39;t matter, why do you care so much? I dont believe in aliens but I dont go raging about it. Also, the whole disinfo thing is really a bs excuse. What could possibly be the disinfo about the earth being flat? Are they hiding the earth being round or something?</p>

<p>Anyways, you asked so I thought I would help answer your questions. I&#39;m not here to debate, and I don&#39;t really care what shape the earth is, but I don&#39;t trust nasa, or freemasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good answer. If the earth is flat then everything science has been feeding us is a lie. </p>

<p>We already know that school doesn&#39;t teach us the real truth. 
Our government isn&#39;t up front with everything they have going and we pretty much know that the official 911 story is not the whole truth what ever the truth may be. We knew from the beginning of the primaries clinton wasn&#39;t really winning but the media was presenting false information. </p>

<p>So school, government, and the media lie. A lot. 
Where does the truth begin and the lies end? We have been lied to about so many other aspects of history,foreign policy,and betrayed by so many shitty politicians that we don&#39;t know what to believe. 
Many people on reddit like to think they are above average iq and science has become the new religion. When faced with the possibility of any of the things I&#39;ve already mentioned most redditors go into self protection mode. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a flat earther but I&#39;m willing to examine even the most widely &quot;known truths&quot; because the establishment is full of shit. </p>

<p>To the op. 
What is the most convincing side of the pro flat earth argument you have heard and what it the most convincing fact that makes you believe the earth is round?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there are independent scientists and researches who have come up with their own unbiased conclusions. </p>

<p>Also, if the earth is flat, you could fall off the edge, or if its some kind of rectangle you would definately go over some rough 90 degree angles while on a ship.</p>

<p>And every person ever in space is lying in an NWO conspiracy, even ex USSR cosmonauts who would be the antithesis to the modern establishment. And those guys at NASA who spent their entire lives working to get their jobs by grinding through classes are all lying and compromising their scientific integrity along with all astronauts, even the ones who are about to die and have no family and could easily &quot;expose&quot; the truth without fear of serious repurcussions. </p>

<p>Then there is the question of what we look at through our telescopes. Clearly when viewing objects in space we see circles, which becomes a sphere in a 3d existence (i.e our fucking existence). So according to basic physics and gravity and the process of planetary and solar formation the flat idea is fucked. A star couldnt even form without gravity pulling shit into a spherical shape. Are FE(ers) going to claim that everything in the universe is an illusion or that the Earth is the only thing thats flat? Both are insane but one has to be true according to these lunatics. </p>

<p>These people have taken &quot;be skeptical&quot; to such levels of seriousness that they are disbelieving the fact that the earth is round (something confirmed over 500 years ago) just because their teacher told them that (and all teachers are part of the NWO dun dun dunnnnn) and all teachers must be lying or stupid or both. What happened to trusting basic science? If earth is flat here is a list of things that are all wrong, fuck physics.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gravity</p></li>
<li><p>Our fucking eyes</p></li>
<li><p>All people who have ever beeb in space</p></li>
<li><p>All pictures ever taken from space</p></li>
<li><p>All known observations of the cosmos through telescope over the past 600 years</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I researched it for a couple months and was almost convinced about it until I started thinking if they are indeed hiding the true nature of our reality then why would they allow you to figure it out so easy? There&#39;s legit 100s of flat earth videos on YouTube now.  They want you to think it&#39;s flat.  However the lack of real pictures of the earth are indeed very disturbing which begs the question what are they hiding then? Why can&#39;t they go take a picture of earth that isn&#39;t manipulated? Also to debunk flat earth all you have to do is use perspective against them. They say the sun setting is perspective, yet it never shrinks or enlarges and you cannot bring it back into view with a zoom like you can boats on the horizon (which is true perspective).  The reason people buy into FE is because they make some unfalsifiable claims like it looks flat and is relatively flat and you can&#39;t detect the curve from the ground, if you say you can you&#39;re lying. Also the horizon does indeed rise to eye level if you been on a plane which most people have you would notice it rises to your eye level. But FE can be debunked just by using perspective against them like I said but they don&#39;t really want to hear that lol. I do think they&#39;re lying about the globe tho because we&#39;re definitely not spinning and hurling through &quot;space&quot; but hey that&#39;s just me :) </p>

<p>We absolutely are. Everything we know, and can intuitively reason, about how gravity works results in a body of large spheres in an orbital model. It&#39;s literally the obvious outcome when mass is attracted to other mass. </p>

Go to the coast and get up into a lighthouse or other tall structure and watch some ships come in with a high-power telescope.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The youtube link was in a comment I made yesterday <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4vs5xc/what_cant_you_believe_still_exists_in_2016/d61onk4">here</a>.  I&#39;ve been looking into this for a few months and I haven&#39;t kept an instance of a mainstream scientist admitting you can&#39;t see the curve at 20,000ft.  Mainly because I&#39;ve never even seen one argue you <em>could</em>. The only people I&#39;ve ever seen suggest it&#39;s possible have been scoffers in forums.  No offense.</p>

<p>Well my whole point is that the evidence for the shape of the earth is circumstantial.  They cannot prove a ball earth without NASA and that information is fraudulent.  The only &quot;real&quot; images came from hoax moon missions.  There are a lot of reasons to keep that a secret.  Some of these work into what I believe to be the greatest conspiracy of all which is attempting to hide or disprove the existence of God.  But there are many other reasons for it.</p>

<p>To build a lie, you have to build upon a foundation.  You don&#39;t have a Big Bang on the flat earth.  You don&#39;t have evolution on the flat earth.  You can&#39;t impose carbon taxes over global warming on a populace that&#39;s aware of a flat earth.  And another big one is that you cannot stage a fake alien invasion if people know that planets aren&#39;t other worlds.  There are no aliens.  There is no &quot;outer space&quot; as it&#39;s portrayed in Hollywood. Organizations like NASA also stand to make a lot of money to simply produce some photoshop paintings every now and then.  There are more aspects that the lie lends itself too, but I think you get the idea.  This lie has been in the works ever since Pythagoras, Galileo, Copernicus, and Newton.  All &quot;Freemasons&quot; or students of hermeticism and the occult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.</p>

<p>This an excerpt from the wiki page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force#Ballistic_trajectories">Coriolis force</a>:  &quot;The Coriolis force became important in external ballistics for calculating the trajectories of very long-range artillery shells. The most famous historical example was the Paris gun, used by the Germans during World War I to bombard Paris from a range of about 120 km (75 mi). Similarly, a bullet does not fly straight from the barrel to a target. The Coriolis force minutely changes the trajectory of a bullet, curving the path of the projectile into a more arched &#39;semi-circle&#39; shape. This effect only affects accuracy at extremely long distances and is therefore adjusted for by accurate long-distance shooters, such as snipers and other trained professionals.[18]</p>

<p>The effects of the Coriolis force on ballistic trajectories should not be confused with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the Mercator projection. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. <strong>The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the spherical nature of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The effects of this force are noticeable, measurable, and undeniably present. Explain how these forces would act like this on flat earth model, because I am fairly certain we would see and measure different effects were the earth not curved. </p>

<p>I also fail to see how the shape of the planet proves or disproves the existence of God. Or how the shape would dictate how <strong>any</strong> taxes would or wouldn&#39;t be levied.  Also, Pythagoras was a good 500 years (approximately) before the Jesus and Judaism was barely an influence at the time of Pythagoras, so how could the conspiracy be about disproving the existence of God? Why does a flat earth refute the big bang theory (a theory, btw, that was given to us by a priest)?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>None taken. I know what I have seen with my own eyes. Have you tried climbing a mountain and look at the curve of the horizon?  Btw, I never looked at the curve of the horizon and thought: &quot;There is direct proof of no god existing.&quot; I don&#39;t know why that leap is made but I am pretty sure they are not related in the way you are relating them.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are trying to imply that this is being used as a control mechanism for the populace? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually a good deal of debate around the Coriolis effect.  I&#39;d ask you then, if they have to account for the earth&#39;s spin with a bullet, why not with a plane?  The reason given for why a plane doesn&#39;t have to account for the spin of the earth is because the atmosphere spins.  Ok, then why does it affect a bullet?  I&#39;ve seen videos with snipers that say they&#39;ve never accounted for it and things like crosswinds are what makes long distance sniping so difficult and unreliable at long range.</p>

<p>How about this, lets say I was on the equator and flew to Michigan. Earth&#39;s spin at the equator, according to Google, is 1037mph. At the 44th degree latitude, the earth&#39;s speed would be cos(44) * 1037 = 0.719 * 1037 = 745mph. So there would be a 292mph difference in horizontal velocity of the earth beneath when you go to land. Even if the atmosphere is spinning as well, you should still maintain most if not all of that horizontal momentum in the air. Or reverse it so you&#39;re travelling south to the equator.  How do you manage to catch up to the earth that&#39;s now moving nearly 300mph faster?  Why don&#39;t they account for this?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve climbed a few mountains but all before I was interested in this issue.  I&#39;ve flown in a plane since and seen no curvature.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to say that the ball earth <em>disproves</em> God by itself.  It&#39;s a stepping stone for concepts like the Big Bang, old earth, evolution, and climate change.  I can&#39;t tell you how many atheist friends I have that like to chime the mantra &quot;we&#39;re just a spec on a spec, orbiting a spec that&#39;s on the edge of another spec in the universe.&quot;  They have no idea that visualization is just a manufactured concept that&#39;s been fed to them without any real proof behind it.  It&#39;s put out there so people that want to reject God can indulge themselves in delusions of a world where earth isn&#39;t at the center.  You could still deny a Creator and believe in flat earth, but I think it requires more mental gymnastics.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;d definitely characterize it as a control mechanism.  It locks a person&#39;s mind from ever stepping outside the box and critically looking at the world they inhabit.  They feel insignificant and think of themselves as a spec.  It also lays the groundwork for those other deceptions.  That&#39;s why Freemasons place their globe and cosmos models on their two pillars while portraying the sun and moon as being the same size and height underneath heaven <a href="http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/freemason-emblematic-chart-granger.jpg">in their artworks</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s why flight paths appear curved on the Mercator.  And why Greenland looks as big as Africa lol.  The thing is that people think these curved paths on the Mercator are because the earth is a sphere.  They appear as straight paths on a globe after all.  But it works out the same way on a circle as you can see.</p>

<p>The Azimuthal Equidistant Projection that is generally used as the flat earth map (<a href="http://www.abodia.com/fe/images/flat_earth_UN_flag.png">and the UN flag</a>) is said to have distortions as well in the southern hemisphere but is accurate north of the equator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off... what kind of bullshit post is this? You are without a doubt looking to start a heated debate with people who disagree with you... and perpetuate a sense of security from people who agree with you. There is nothing intellectual about this at all, and I will limit my response accordingly.</p>

<p>The point of the flat earth theory is the utmost form of anti-authority. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve never been to space. You don&#39;t measure the earth. You&#39;ve never been to Antarctica. You don&#39;t fly airplanes for a living.</p>

<p>Instead, you believe what the authorities tell you. You look at pictures, and see articles and think that these billion dollar organizations must be using that money for something good. In reality, if you can agree that the mainstream media and news are lying to you, why would you not think NASA and other Federal organizations would do the same?</p>

<p>Completely rejecting the possibility of a flat earth is kind of like saying &quot;yeah, I know they lie to us, but not about this.&quot; Writing it off as completely false without any evidence other than what you have been told by someone, reporting on what a federal organization has claimed, is a very immature way to reach conclusions.</p>

<p>Tell me this... the ISS is such a marvel right? Why can we not find one bit of video evidence of them building it? Where&#39;s the photo evidence of them welding or bolting the sections together? How on earth did they put that thing together in those bulky space suits? We assume that everything was 100% successful and no errors occurred? </p>

<p>One of the most &quot;amazing pieces of space technology&quot; exists in our skies above, and no one can find any evidence of how it came to be?</p>

<p>Before you discredit things you can&#39;t prove... try to prove thing&#39;s they don&#39;t want you to discredit. </p>

<p>Sure, as an intellectual exercise, okay. Flatheads aren&#39;t capable of treating it with such maturity.</p>

<p>Flatheads ban people from their sub for asking questions</p>

<p>Flatheads don&#39;t respond to queries</p>

<p>Flatheads don&#39;t use things like math, evidence, logic</p>

<p>Flatheads ignore simple concepts like gravity, perspective and angle of incidence.</p>

<p>I fly <em>in</em> them regularly.</p>

<p>Invoking scientific uncertainty about the shape of the earth is as ludicrous as saying... well, we don&#39;t know 100% that the moon isn&#39;t made of cheese.</p>

<p>Yes, sure, according to pure logic/rhetoric this is true. This does mean that it lends uncertainty any kind of credit.</p>

<p>You speak of one photo, which looks like any old &quot;space walk&quot; that they conduct of whatever reason (in a giant pool). That&#39;s what you choose to counter my claims with? Your very example is the point I&#39;m arguing against... NASA falsifying evidence.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t a harness, that was his fucking underwear.  Also, there&#39;s no evidence of a blue screen. You&#39;re comparing it to movies which are rendered by MASSIVE compute clusters offline (not-real-time). Scenes like you see in transformers or even interstellar take weeks to render sometimes. You&#39;d have to be completely ignorant of modern computer graphics to even think that.

<p>He keeps pointing out &quot;harnesses&quot; and &quot;wires&quot; that aren&#39;t there. </p>

<p>Also, people seemingly have no idea how video compression works. Blocking, tiling, and distortions are a common result of something that&#39;s been encoded again and again then thrown in an editor (to make this crack&#39;s video) and then uploaded to youtube where it&#39;s stepped on again. </p>

<p>Seeing pixelation/common compression (artifacts) is perfectly normal. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not fucking jet engines, that&#39;s the life support systems/ventilation. </p>

<p>Do you understand that the dynamics of gas mixing in zero g is totally different? </p>

<p>In fact, if you sleep in 0g you can suffocate because a CO2 bubble will build up around you and you can die in your sleep. To combat this you have to mechanically agitate the air (fans) and force it to mix/flow as much as possible. </p>

<p>This is all common stuff, like anyone who&#39;s even remotely studied this stuff knows everything I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>As for the &quot;chinese bubble&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9PAkbT4kTpI?t=1m20s">Here</a> shows DEBRIS moving around in all sorts of directions NOT CONSISTENT WITH BUBBLES. Bubbles go up, not left right, sometimes up and sideways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thinking like that truly means to me that you couldn&#39;t be bothered to entertain the idea that God may or may not exist.</p>

<p>And the conspiracy theory of NASA hiding this idea and replacing it with accidental meaningless creation from an explosion from nothing is no more retarded than blindly accepting and avoiding any counter-questioning to the &quot;official story&quot; that NASA assures us is accurate. Their billions of dollars truly proves that.</p>

<p>What other way do I personally benefit from sounding like a &quot;retard&quot;? Why would someone make these claims, just to announce to the world that one has jello for a brain?

<p>I don&#39;t care if you look up through a telescope and see a light in the sky... the telescope companies are mocking you as well. LOOK AT THEIR LOGO: <a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/goodsearch/image/upload/v1436891875/hi_resolution_merchant_logos/orion-telescopes-and-binoculars_coupons.jpg">http://res.cloudinary.com/goodsearch/image/upload/v1436891875/hi_resolution_merchant_logos/orion-telescopes-and-binoculars_coupons.jpg</a></p>

<p>Oh my! Is that a flat plane with a dome above it? No... It couldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>As for your math argument... that is the EASIEST thing in existence to prove that the numbers are fuckin wrong mate!</p>

<p><a href="http://flatearthwiki.com/images/f/fb/Bluemarb.jpg">http://flatearthwiki.com/images/f/fb/Bluemarb.jpg</a></p>

<p>Based on the numbers they give us for the earth circumference, this is the curvature formula:</p>

<p>8 * miles-in-question * miles-in-question = answer / 12</p>

<p>So when I look at the NYC skyline from my marina in Norwalk, CT ( a distance of 23 miles away) the objects do not appear to be 352 feet below the horizon.</p>

<p>8 * 23 * 23 = 4232 / 12 = 352 ft</p>

<p>In fact, when I use a telescope to zoom in on the skyline (something I know exists), I can see directly up to the waters edge near the shore where boats and docks reside.</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t these objects be 352 feet below the horizon? How on earth can I see them if the curvature is supposed to hide it from my view?</p>

<p>The math is the most obvious form of false information given to us by our authorities. Math does not lie, you are right. It also does not explain or prove  the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>TRY... AGAIN... BUB</p>

<p>No way man. When they give you earth&#39;s circumference of 24,901 miles, you can do math to solve the equation. Are you saying that NASA is lying to us about this number? If not, then why would a formula not exist to discover the calculation of curvature. You claim I&#39;m wrong, but you supply no proving rebuttal. Are you a lazy scientist or did you just do the math in your head?</p>

<p>It actually detracts a lot from what you&#39;re trying to say. I understand that there is a lot of shady stuff that happens and that we need to pay attention to but trying to say that math is a lie is downright silly. The earth is not flat and there are far more important things going on that deserve attention.</p>

<p>More than a couple times in this thread it has been brought up that these kinds of conspiracy theories is what makes conspiracy theorists look like a bunch of crazies and I agree with that. You&#39;re making a very bold statement about something that is easily disproven when. Your time would be much better spent on trying to figure out who actually runs the world, when and how there has to be an 80% die off of humans for the world to continue to be sustainable and how they&#39;re going to do that.</p>

<p>As far as images of the ISS being built: it was (and is continually) built in components in clean rooms. Are you really looking for pictures of scientists laying wires and tightening bolts? Because I&#39;m sure you can find them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, I just knew those last 3 words in caps would derail you from my mathematical argument and focus on a childish digression that has nothing to do with disproving my point. You counter my debate about math and evidence with an answer of stop giving into &quot;conspiracies&quot; or to focus on more important things. If you agree that the elite are actively killing of 80% of the population, what forces you to draw the line on your &quot;world&quot;  as you know it? Are you ashamed to admit you have been duped your entire life? Is this secret we&#39;re trying to uncover (if it exists) just too great for you to buy into?</p>

<p>You are advising me to stop looking into possibly one of the biggest lies we have ever known. Trying to prove that the earth is flat will only help others see the evidence at hand and question if it is indeed flat. I provided mathmatical formulas for you, and you attack my character.</p>

<p>How dumb would everyone feel if they all realized they were lied to about where they were living? Talk about a mass enlightenment to the secrete forces that control our lives. Would that not be earth-shattering enough to expose all the sub-level lies that you suggest I focus my time on? Wouldn&#39;t one great big lie trump all the rest, and make swallowing the red pill a little more bearable?</p>

<p>It would prove that a God exists! It would prove a purpose for us. People would stop thinking me, me, me and focus on the how, why and what created this area for us to graze.</p>

<p>...And most importantly, it would prove that the &quot;people who run this world&quot; most definitely have been hiding this truth from us for reasons of pure evil.</p>

<p>NASA just confirms the theory of us all being an evolutionary accident of a big bang, and therefore our lives are meaningless. </p>

<p>We spend 601 billion dollars on blowing up other countries for profit, and only give nasa 17.5 billion to further our understanding of &quot;life&quot; as they explain it. Do you see the problem here? It&#39;s almost like they are setting themselves up with a lack of potential. </p>

<p>Again I ask... show me video evidence from 1990 - 1999 of the ISS being constructed. The greatest feat in outerspace exploration, and all we get are photos of masons in a while capsule smiling for a camera and giving masonic hand signs. Give me a break.</p>

<p>Facts and mathematical evidence are the only things we have to use that make us sound less &quot;crazy&quot;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep in mind though, that these numbers are given to us by the authorities. The average person will blindly acknowledge this data as being valid and just go right back to playing Pokemon Go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only when people care enough to take the time to conduct these experiments and apply the numbers to the real world, that we realize something doesn&#39;t add up. We are all so quick to substitute what our eyes see for an indoctrinated theory given to us by our Federal Government.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need millions of dollars to do science experiments. I only wish more people would use the hard facts instead of continue to wildly speculate and call those speculations proof. Some people poison the well without even realizing it. Math don&#39;t lie :P</p>

<p>For the sun to be that close the earth would be little more than a burnt crisp.</p>

<p>We know how much mass it takes to form a star, we know the energy output from fusion. </p>

<p>For he sun to be as close as you say, fusion would have to be possible at an immensely smaller scale than it is. The Coulomb repulsion barrier prevents fusion, and something many thousandths the mass of the sun doesn&#39;t have the mass to cause it&#39;s inner particles to fuse.</p>

<p>We have extensive measurements from particle accelerators on fusion, and it&#39;s an extremely hard process to sustain (requiring extreme pressures and ultimately temperatures). </p>

<p>We also know fusion is occurring by studying the radiation profile from the sun.</p>

<p>For what you say to be true the sun would be far too small to initiate fusion and would produce no light at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there could be many possibilities for why they have lied about the shape of the earth. for one money. what agency gets billions a year and makes nothing but fake videos about space? hmmmm.. I wonder. </p>

<p>two the real reason because money is only the second most desired thing. Second to power. The power of controlling the outcome of our reality. As in if we know god and the true creator of the universe. Personally i&#39;m christian but every major old religion says the same thing earth is flat, doesn&#39;t move, etc(I mean they can be interpreted that way). and the main thing is the the negative side whether it is satan or what have you is trying to convince you that god doesn&#39;t exist. because if you deny the reality that god does exist you will be going to hell after you die. and thats what satan wants. or whatever negative entity is responsible. </p>

<p>it&#39;s pretty obvious though that is what the whole god vs satan this is about anyway. satan wants to convince you god doesn&#39;t exist so he gets your soul. meanwhile all the evidence points to the existence of god.</p>

<p>and how does flat earth prove the existence of god you may ask?
it proves intelligent design because there is no other way to explain a sealed world that isn&#39;t moving and why the sun and moon keep rotating. it&#39;s pretty spooky really so people would turn to god.</p>

<p>and now if you want people to turn away from god tell them it&#39;s all a big bang and it just happened your life is basically insignificant. Its really sick how they lie to our kids.</p>

<p>and furthermore. I don&#39;t post links to youtube videos because people will think I have something to gain from the videos but just search youtube for flat earth videos made in the last 24 hours. this isn&#39;t a passing trend.  dozens of videos made every day. more than enough evidence is there and youtube has made a great platform for sharing research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre so unbelievably braindead. Im going to break your shitpost down right quick m8.</p>

<p>Point 1, NASA for profit.</p>

<p>NASA is an agency that, year in year out, is extremely underfunded. The budget of the F35 fighter plane was over 500 billion dollars ( for research and developement mind you, not even for the planes). The budget for NASA is currently 19.3 billion dollars annually. Which isnt even half of a percent of the overall budget. So point one in your post is cooked already. One plane has an R&amp;D budget of over 500b, an entire agency gets 19.3b, NASA is clearly on a cash grabbing mission for the (who exactly? Oh you didnt say!). Point 1 broken.</p>

<p>Point 2</p>

<p>The bible was written 400 years after the death of Jesus, by people going off of oral traditions, these people were also men with their own ideas of what made a good story. There are missing and edited sections of the bible for fucks sake, its clearly not the direct word of god nor the direct word of men in the know regarding the ideas of Jesus Christ (who is probably shaking his head somewhere in heaven at the parody of his life and teachings that is featured in the bible). Your book means nothing in terms of religious values or scientific values so if it says anything about earth being flat, I, and everyone else, shoud completely ignore that part and so should you. Also, many religions in fact do not stipulate that the earth is flat, thats completely incorrect. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the belief that god is going to create a universe that makes no sense is completely insane. Are you arrogant enough to think that god cant create a universe that makes logical sense? Because thats where youre going with this. By saying that the universe is made by god and that said universe has no natural law, order, or logic behind it, you are claiming that god has the creative power of a four year old with link n logs. God is fully capable of creating a universe bound by natural laws and rules that can be then interpreted by scientists who, by the way, are as holy as the priest due to their efforts to decipher the physical nature of the universe (i.e gods design) in contrast (or compliment) to those who pursue the understanding of the spiritual and metaphysical (the mirror world, fifth dimension) aka the prists, gurus, spirituals and prophets. The universe makes sense when broken down, as it should, god is a logician, a master craftsman, why would he make an engine that runs on fairy dust and magical fucking spice from the desert planet in dune when he can craft a perfect v12 racing engine, savvy? The world makes sense through natural law which is proof in and of itself of intelligent design you moron, we can break down the universe and make it make sense which means that everything runs smoothly and functions and has a cause and effect which means that the universe wasnt just some dumb drawing made by a two year old like you suggest.</p>

<p>Point 3</p>

<p>So believing in science makes me a satanist then, because its clearly all satans work behind this science stuff right? FUCKIN WRONG M8. </p>

<p>Two people are in a room right, on the table is a fuckin quarter coin right. Person 1 and Person 2 are siting at this table and talking to a group of people who have never seen a quarter.</p>

<p>Person 1 is explaining to a group of people what tails looks like and Person 2 is trying to explain the the group of people what heads looks like. Both are trying to explain the same thing (what the coin looks like) from a different point of view, but both are describing the same thing. The priest explains the spiritual side of things, the yin to the yang and the scientist tries to explain the physical side to things, the yang to the ying, but both are explaining gods will, just a different side of it. The most understanding person in the world of religious matters is a scientifically minded person of deep faith, not a blind idiot who believes in fairy tails nor a hardcore athiest physicist, because the scientific believer understands and appreciates the true beauty and intricacy of a universe that makes perfect logical and harmonous sense, i.e true intelligent design you lump.</p>

<p>Point 4 </p>

<p>Science makes our life insignifigant how exactly? As I said, god can exist, satan can exist, souls can exist, the fifth demension definately exists, a holy war can be raging right now and right here on this earth within the shadows, yet science can still be right. Two sides, same coin, one light and one dark both equally true and equally present. Open your horizons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you are emotional. I don&#39;t expect you to drop all your brainwashing instantly and become a flat earther. the fact that your post was so emotional proves you are in the first step of realizing the truth. That is anger. You may or may not proceed further in your journey, but that is up to you. </p>

<p>let me make a rare rebuttal about that nasa budget and all these other questions you have that I didn&#39;t answer. 
First you shouldn&#39;t insult people when you are trying to make a point. you have become emotional and none of your post is valid because you have resorted to insults. so obviously you are the troll.
Secondly, no one knows everything... even globe believers...
heres a good one for you.. why is it still called the &quot;theory of gravity&quot;? add why does the earth supposedly maintain a 23 degree tilt? Why does the orbit of the earth and moon and all the stars stay the same? Why does the moon reflect the suns light? when we all know that spheres are poor reflectors and would have a hotspot in the center.
Why does water appear flat always? and that is the nature of water to rest level. ie, water level. level meaning flat. 
if the sun is 93 million miles away why such drastic temperature differences over a few thousand miles? </p>

<p>you dont really need to answer those questions all you need to do is look up amateur weather balloon videos and you can see at 100,000 ft. it&#39;s still flat. You should learn about fish eye lenses and how cameras behave, and the laws of perspective.</p>

<p>Notice how I refrained from name calling(almost). I could easily call names, I&#39;m more mature than that though. 
and finally about your point on science not making us insignificant I will elaborate. Not all of science is wrong.. just like not everything Fox news or other bullshit news station says is wrong. Just large chunks of things they say is wrong. If anyone just put out complete nonsense 24/7 then obviously they wouldn&#39;t gain any credibility. I&#39;m not saying Science is completely wrong and lying about everything. It&#39;s just the space part and the nature of our earth. Just try to find some information about space without a space agency name attached to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point 1 Gravity</p>

<p>Its the Theory of gravity because of technicalities regarding what constitutes a scientific law. I hate when people bring that up as if it provides any kind of proof against the &quot;Theory&quot;.</p>

<p>A scientific law is a basic observation of a natural event right, so this would be a scientific law.</p>

<p>&quot;When I take a shit, the water makes a splashing sound&quot;</p>

<p>A theory is an explanation of why my shit makes a splashing sound. </p>

<p>&quot;So my shit hits the water which then sends vibrations through said water and then into the air creating soundwaves that my ears then interpret as the splashing sound I hear&quot;.</p>

<p>Even though that theory is completely correct its still a theory because its an explanation of why not a statement of what. A &quot;Law of Gravity&quot; merely stipulates that matter falls towards matter.</p>

<p>Point 2 😂 no.... just no</p>

<p>The Earth does not maintain a tilt, if it maintained its tilt we would have no seasons and one side of the world (northern and southern sides btw) would be in a perpetual ice age while the other is in a perpetual desert state. Our world constantly changes tilt.</p>

<p>Orbits do not stay the same, the moon for example is slowly getting closer to earth every day by aa quarter of a millimeter or so, orbits change for planets as well, there is a reason why we have some years where we are closer to things than in other years.</p>

<p>The moon reflects light because the moon itself is a light grey color, without any kind of atmosphere whatsoever that is being beamed with the light of 10,000 nuclear weapons, of course its going to have a small amount of reflective power and what we see is that small amount in full force when its multiplied by a fucking star. It probably also looks so bright because surrounding it is pure blackness when we see it (usually).</p>

<p>Water doesnt rest level, it rests how gravity pulls it, if a small sphere with the density of earth was put into a big half full container of water and suspended over said water, the water would form a sphere around it. The only reason why water seems flat to you is because you are looking from your flawed tiny perspective and cant put any stock in basic science (opting for blind faith). Water isnt flat anyway, there are lumps and dips in the ocean, there is earth curvature and there is high and low tide (courtesy of the moons gravity). </p>

<p>Also the reason why Earth looks flat is because 3d objects when viewed from far away look flat. Of course pictures of earth look flat herb, its a sphere 🌍 viewed from far away, the fuck</p>

<p>are you missing man.</p>

<p>You cant trust basic third grade level observations to dictate reality. &quot;Hur dur it looks flat from here must be flat&quot; wrong.</p>

<p>We know the world is a spherical shape BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A FLAT CIRCLE FROM SPACE.... man.</p>

<p>There are no flat circles that exist as anything more than shitty little asteroids savvy (the only flat circles out there are tiny space rocks homie)? If something of size and mass looks circular it means its a sphere or close to it. The biggest point of FEers actually helps out my argument.</p>

<p>To your last point I just watched several videos that showed the curvature of the earth, your lost man.</p>

<p>And finally, as an FEer, your are discounting almost all science regarding nature and physics, but hey, you know better right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the Earth does maintain a constant tilt, this is exactly what causes seasons. The tilt is maintained by the Earth&#39;s angular momentum which exerts a force opposing any further tilting in either direction.</p>

<p>(Side note: this property of angular momentum can be tested IRL in your backyard! Grab a lone bike wheel, hold it vertically, give it a spin, and try turning it 90 degrees in different directions. You&#39;ll notice that when trying to rotate it across the axis of revolution there is a force working against you.)</p>

<p>Because the tilt is maintained throughout Earth&#39;s orbit around the sun, one side of the Earth is closer to the sun for part of the year while the opposite side is closer during the other part of the year. This difference in distance causes seasons.</p>

<p>PS. Not a flat earther (I guess that&#39;s obvious lol), I&#39;m a physics undergrad trying to spread a bit of knowledge. Hopefully someday I can join NASA and experience the conspiracy from the inside ;)</p>

<p>Yes, the tilt causes the seasons. No, the earth does not maintain a constant tilt. It&#39;s believed that the change in tilt is a contributor to glacial formation.</p>

<p>&quot;[The] angle between Earth&#39;s rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit (obliquity) oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing.&quot;</p>

honestly it&#39;s right in front of all of us all the time. You just need to stop being such a consumer.

<p>Well the reason is that <a href="http://septclues.com/UNIVERITY/GlobeBlueMarbleNASA_01.jpg">they&#39;re photoshop</a>.  NASA doesn&#39;t deny this. The only ones they claim are real are the shots from the Apollo missions. Gimme a break if you believe in that junk.

<p>The flat earth theory has an entirely different cosmology as well.  Generally it&#39;s geocentric with the sun and moon much smaller and closer than mainstream science theorizes.  Besides, the idea that other spherical bodies mean that earth is a spherical body is as logical as a person in Japan assuming that all people are Japanese.  Now add in that those are just lights in the sky and aren&#39;t proven to be other worlds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no complete photos of a sphere earth from space. There are composites, and fish eye camera videos and pictures from &quot;space&quot;.  So there is no visual proof the earth is a sphere. (click on any blue marble pics in google and follow them back to NASA&#39;s site where it states explicitly the pictures are composites) And the moon landing hoax was in part to prove that the Earth was a sphere by taking a picture of the Earth from the moon.</p>

<p>So you have two instances that debunk the idea that the blue marble theory is incontrovertable. Because there is zero visual documentation of it being a sphere.  Absolutely zero. </p>

<p>Then you can go from there.</p>

<p>2nd. If you have no occult knowledge or knowledge of symbology you will be totally confused  by this. Our sphere Earth history is based on Copernicus&#39;s heliocentric theory of the galaxy. Copernicus was a pagan and rejected any notion of geocentrism. He created the heliocentric giant Sun at the center of the galaxy based on religious, not scientific findings. And modern science and physics is built on this man&#39;s religious theology, which is totally backwards. A plane earth would tear down 600 years of science and obliterate modern science in its entirety. It&#39;s simply a lie that cannot afford to be uncovered.</p>

<p>In RE to Antarctica. Nobody has ever circumnavigated Antarctica. Nobody has been to the south pole, it&#39;s just a mathematical placement theorized by scientists. A pole was created based on what is believed to be the south pole.</p>

<p>I thought it was a CIA psi op as well. The poisoning the well idea. But the president and others keep on mocking it publicly. Which tells me there is something to it.</p>

<p>Ancient cosmology from the Arabian peninsula and Africa show that we&#39;re in an ice encasement. Too far south it&#39;s too cold, and too far north it&#39;s too cold for humans. Both are places far from the Sun. Go too high it&#39;s also too cold for humans. And the firmament is ice.</p>

<p>In RE to NASA. The reason they don&#39;t get much funding is because all they do is create CGI videos and pictures lol. They don&#39;t need it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not totally sold but I do know there is no visual proof of a sphere Earth, and the moon landing never happened. Which opens a pandora&#39;s box of possibilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FE model accounts for both the position of the sun and for timezones.  The change in position of the constellations is explained in the mainstream by parallax which happens over the span of tens of thousands of years and cannot be perceived at all with the naked eye - the constellation graphs and charts from thousands of years ago are actually still accurate today.  As far as not being able to see Australia, a flat earth proponent would tell you that you obviously can&#39;t see thousands of miles with your own eyes through the atmosphere and through the many elements it&#39;s made up of.  Not sure what you mean by change in horizontal perception with altitude, I was just in a plane two days ago and the earth looked flat from up there, just as it does down here.  What do you mean by earth&#39;s shadow in this context?</p>

<p>Let me point out again that I do not think the earth is flat and I appreciate that you at least provided some substance for your argument.  All I am doing or was trying to do in this thread is point out that a lot of people who are vehemently against any discussion of the shape of the earth and the nature of the cosmos can&#39;t even substantiate why they hate the discussions so much and can&#39;t or won&#39;t provide any context or evidence for their claims.  It&#39;s just &quot;the earth is obviously round and you&#39;re obviously retarded if you think otherwise - go study orbital mechanics&quot;.  That&#39;s a shit argument and most who use it do so because they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about and are just repeating what they&#39;ve been told growing up.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a moderator should do- moderate. Not doing so is what turned this sub from a discussion on lots of topics to an awful lot of spam and reliance on innuendo.</p>

<p>That&#39;s nice, now why don&#39;t you go start your own sub and make the moderator rules to that effect? </p>

<p>The mods here are pretty good, they&#39;re mostly hands off and they stick up for people being bullied. They aren&#39;t there to enforce &#39;A&#39; side of a discussion, that would be tantamount to a judge in a courtroom. </p>

<li><p>It is a fact of calculus and non-Euclidian geometry that small sections of large, curved surfaces will always look flat to little creatures (like humans) that crawl upon them</p></li>
<li><p>Satellites would not be able to orbit the earth if it were flat because the satellites need to stay at a relatively constant distance from the center of the Earth via Newton&#39;s Law of Gravitation: F=GMm/r</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have, and doing so has allowed me to form my own opinion using my own words.</p>

<p>You dismiss everyone in this thread with an empty &quot;go study physics 101&quot; or &quot;go learn orbital mechanics&quot; and then when asked to back your own argument up with anything you simply bow out and say nothing.  I doubt you know much about physics or orbital mechanics and your responses thus far only confirm that.  You may not realize that you&#39;re just parroting what you&#39;ve been told all your life by perceived authority figures and/or the standard, mainstream understanding.</p>

<p>TL;DR: If you can&#39;t articulate your knowledge in your own words then it isn&#39;t knowledge, it&#39;s dogma and talking points.  Many things go a lot deeper than that, the nature of the cosmos and earth&#39;s place in it is one of them.  I&#39;m not even saying I think the earth is flat, because I don&#39;t, but to just dismiss people out of hand isn&#39;t helping anything.  There are plenty of other subreddits for you to visit if all you&#39;re interested in is what mainstream science says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, how do you explain the &quot;horizon effect&quot;, with the way objects at the horizon disappear by going further and further down?</p>

<p>The effect has been reported for several millenia, and I&#39;ve translated ancient greek reports of it, too.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m interested, how do you explain an effect that has been attributed to a spherical earth for millenia?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a few more such examples, which already the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians used to calculate the earths circumference accurately, because it had effects in their lives.</p>

<p>And I have some questions regarding plate tectonics, your standard model of physics, and the modified theory of general relativity you propose.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve built systems myself where the effects of the curvature were directly observable on large scale, so I&#39;ll try to ask you to explain at least the few of them that you can observe, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive me, I&#39;m having a really hard time trying to form a mental picture of what you&#39;re talking about here. If the earth has a torus shape as opposed to a disk or globe, what would prevent those in the &quot;inside&quot; gap of the torus from looking up and seeing another part of the earth instead of the night sky? Does the equator form a line around the outside loop of the torus and the poles to points on the inside of the torus? How would it be able to sustain this shape? What route does the sun take, does it circumvent the torus entirely or does it doe a figure 8 through the center? </p>

<p>e: I&#39;m really not trying to mock here, I&#39;m just trying to get where you&#39;re coming from. Even though I buy into the spherical earth postulate, I understand where those who believe earth is flat or a disk are coming from, as personal observation would seem to support this idea. I&#39;m having a hard time seeing how any kind of observation or knowledge of physics can support what you&#39;re arguing for if this is legit.</p>

<p>I am talking about those who believe that the Earth is flat. I&#39;ve already disproven this thought.</p>

<p>For instance, I could be anti Flat Earth and believe also in a batshit theory that the Earth is hollow (an equally absurd thought) or that the Earth is a prism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a redundant suggestion since I do not believe, and have never argued the Earth is flat. What I am saying is that because the horizon is, by definition, a flat, <strong>horizontal</strong> line, it&#39;s not a winning argument to use against flat earthers.</p>

<p>And for that matter, the gravitational theory of planet creation is also a poor strategy if you are trying to win the argument, because obviously most flat earthers won&#39;t understand the point you are making. The only way to convince a flat earther is to use a compelling, logical and simple argument that they can understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh, but the horizon is NOT a flat horizontal line. It appears that way due to the tolerance of the instrument you are using (your eyes). Given a precise enough instrument, the curvature of the earth can be measured even at seal level. A spirit level, puddle, pond, lake only appears level due to the perceptive scale allowed by eyesight. It&#39;s also good enough to level the base of a pyramid. The ship disappearing over the horizon uses a large enough scale to allow our rudimentary eyesight to pick up the curve that is always there.</p>

<p>No, it allows us merely to deduce the curve is there, because the ship is disappearing beneath the horizon. You can&#39;t see the curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, I&#39;m pretty sure that fails too.</p>

<p>Keep it simple. The Flat Earth&#39;s explanation of the (smaller, closer) sun is the achilles heel of the hypothesis. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ULkqCIg.gif">https://i.imgur.com/ULkqCIg.gif</a></p>

<p>The fact that the sun is visible in the Antarctic for the entire day of 21 December each year (and more than 12 hours per day throughout the Southern Hemisphere summer), kills the FE theory stone dead.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in the ISS. If you haven&#39;t looked into it I recommend it, it is very easy to tell it is hoax after you pay a little attention. </p>

<p>And Space-X really?! I&#39;ll look it up, but there are a lot of dubious vids of space-x. </p>

<p>All of that orbital tech can work with towers, no need for some thoysand of miles away device that somehow shoots right at you while it is dragging through atmosphere that some doesn&#39;t degrade it&#39;s orbit ever. </p>

<p>As for your last statement, it isn&#39;t even logical but that seems typical of your ilk.</p>

<p>How about astronomy? With a cheap telescope you can see the other spheres near to us. One can watch Venus and mercury transit the sun. How can that be with a small sun 5000 miles away?</p>

<p>How does a lunar eclipse work in your version?</p>

Also why aren&#39;t the building leaning to one side? as that&#39;s how things would be on a spinning globe at 60+ miles away... learn your &quot;earth curvature calculator.&quot;</p>

<p>also that ISS picture is obviously fake learn about photoshop artifacts. </p>

<p>The spacex landing was obviously played in reverse. </p>

<p>Gps satellites can easily be replaced with underwater sea cables and cell phone towers.. Why did we lose that Malaysian airliner if we have GPS everywhere? Note: we actually don&#39;t have GPS everywhere we lose GPS over international waters. Because no satellites only land based antenna towers. </p>
