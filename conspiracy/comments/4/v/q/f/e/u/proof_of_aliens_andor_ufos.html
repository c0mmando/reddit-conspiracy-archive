       I'm a conspiracy nut and I've tried moving on to aliens being real but, I can never seem to find any credible resources of actual documentation without also finding some drunken redneck to disprove everything that I had found to be credible. Is there anything out there that's credible, hard evidence of a real video that cannot be disproven or documentation that, at least, cannot be argued rationally?

       There is compelling footage. The mass sightings are the best evidence, like the one in houston 2014 or phoenix in 1997. There have been some in mexico as well, documented in the news. So, in my mind, there is no question that ufos exist, but i have never seen evidence that aliens are inside.

      </ul>
      <p>
       And why is this not common knowledge? Because no government on Earth will want to admit there are craft capable of violating their airspace at will, possessing superior technology to their own military's, undermining any notion of public safety and national security, not to mention the cultural and societal ramifications of such an admission. It's much easier to collect the available evidence, keep the most compelling research classified and pretend it never happened in the first place.

       Your self-description as a conspiracy nut leads me to certain assumptions about what may be floating around in your head. You are likely very familiar with a range of topics that all share certain themes, actors, and locations. You are also almost certainly aware that mis/disinformation is the name of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that I am correct in those assumptions, ask yourself why you don't believe in UFOs. Ask yourself why so many of the 'most credible' witnesses all seem to be ex-military or intelligence. Ask yourself why the Rosenbergs were executed for releasing nuclear secrets to the Soviets, but nobody has been prosecuted for their whistleblowing about the greatest philosophical
       <em>
        and strategic
       </em>
       secret in the history of humanity. Ask yourself how these 'whistleblowers' are able to spend decades writing books and going on lecture tours but not one of them is rotting in prison or mouldering in a ditch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubts that there are other sentient species out there, I just doubt that they're
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       . Too much of the UFO phenomenon is connected to military and intelligence activity, and an awful lot of the narrative stinks of syncretism. I suggest that you cannot find credible evidence for UFOs because you already know how the game is played and that you should keep that in mind when you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       get presented with compelling evidence.

       This isn't conclusive proof but it's pretty impressive stuff nonetheless, a 2001 press conference with pilots, military, and air traffic controllers at the National Press Club in DC:

       I don't think you'll find anything. Ufos and odd sky-phenomena are most likely military tech of some kind. The best we have is eyewitness reports from highly credible educated people (bonus points if they don't have a book or biography to sell). Also helps if they aren't senile rambling lunatics.

       There is a lot of information out there, at least some of its credible. Several countries have portals to some historical records, including; Canada, Great Britain, France, and probably a few others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The French produced the Cometa Report- this is a good read.
There are also a few academic articles written on the subject.
Disclosure project is also a good place to start- dr. steven greer.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you will find is that there is definitely a phenomena, and there has been a lot of interest in the subject by many governments, moreover, sightings and strange things continue to appear in the sky, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Dig deeper, and you will find that the entire ufo issue and extraterrestrial questions will just draw you a bit closer to crazy, there are so many perspectives to which to learn from the subject, but you will never develop a full truth on it, unfortunately.

       Egyptian hieroglyphs from Seti I's tomb ceiling. Check it out. I believe the picture found on his ceiling depicts an event which can be corroborated with the first few chapters in the book of Enoch. In the book it is describes multiple beings, or angles, coming down from the heavens and "lusting" after the daughters of Man. This was because they saw them "beautiful." -book of Enoch.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my own research. Not sure if any one else has found the similarities yet. 
The tomb ceiling shows giant heavenly beings, as well as multiple Egyptian gods and goddeses, approaching a woman who seems to be "falling" or succumbing to them. Continuing through the picture there is a normal sized man receiving, or being given, power. (Alligators represent power) The man who was given the power is also shown to have incredible strength, enough to lift an ox. To the right of the smaller man you can see the Egyptian god, Horus, rising. ( Facing upward, or laying on his back.) The rest of the picture has to do with the goddess of fertility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to the local library and rented a book on how to translate hieroglyphs. Please, is there anyone else willing to research these? I would enjoy hearing what anyone else finds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note* these are two different accounts of a similar event separated by thousands of years. The book of Enoch was found among the dead sea scrolls in the early 1900s, and  the hieroglyphs found in Seti I's tomb date much earlier than when the dead sea scrolls were discovered. Please, research these two noted artifacts. I need others to corroborate these two discoveries.

       Check out William Tompkins and Corey Goode's testimony. They corroborate each other and detail some of humanities involvements with ETs as well as ITs (inter terrestrials, or beings that live within massive and deep cave systems). They were both involved with the military, Tompkins was designing space craft for the military, Goode was in the SSP (secret space program) as a soldier and intuitive empath and worked on vessels Tompkins helped design.

       You should check out Billy Meier. He claims to have been in contact with Pleiadians/Plejarens since the 40s. A documentary crew analysed his a evidence/claims and couldn't debunk him:

       I think some of his stuff did get debunked later on but a lot of people believe that his evidence was contaminated.
