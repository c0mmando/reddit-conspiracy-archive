       Lets look at the Muslim ban, given that's one OP pointed out to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all those 11 points, it's changed from: Stop Muslim immigration, to - Stop immigration from particular territories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the points are just clarifications and to make the list look longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what's the difference between stopping Muslim immigration and stopping immigration from particular territories? - It's an improvement! It means that Muslims from Australia and other nice countries can come in, but

       Google "trump policies" and you'll get a super-duper handy dropdown list on the big topics (Only google has this custom made list)

       He wants to ban Muslim immigration from countries with links to terrorism (Namely ISIS). And if you consider the social views of the
       <em>
        majority

       of people in some of those countries - I say keep them away from the West.

       But its not the majority, fuck its not even the sunni majority, the only group actively 'boots on the ground' pushing isis back are Muslims, they rule by fear and have torn Arab Muslim towns apart in both countries, the Muslim world calls them daesh - bandits, we in the west are the ones that refer to them as if theyre a legitimate organisation.

       According to several Trump sources (and one Clinton source) who spoke to the Post, the two men spoke over the phone in late May, shortly before Trump announced his run in June. During the call, the Trump sources said, Clinton “encouraged Trump’s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party” and “analyzed Trump’s prospects and his desire to rouse the G.O.P. base.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That conversation, said the anonymous Trump sources, certainly didn’t discourage the billionaire to run: while Clinton never outright told Trump to enter the race, he reportedly told Trump that he was “striking a chord with frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right,” and his tone was supposedly “encouraging.”

       At this point, nothing would surprise me, but a couple of phone calls with Bill Clinton (which have been public knowledge for months) hardly amounts to compelling evidence that Trump is conspiring to get Hillary into the White House.

       This is ridiculous, you're extrapolating the fact that he is running for president to allow Hillary to win because of a phone call?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or what, Hillary paid Trump, the billionaire with his own jets, helicopters, buildings, resorts, golf courses etc to make a fool of himself and be called a racist by the mainstream media controlled by the Clintons for what?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for conspiracies, but this one is theorized by a shill for a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump hasn't changed his tune since the 80s, he is the read deal, and he will destroy Killary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This actually backs up what I'm saying, more so than "a phone call was made"

       He did anything in his power to grow his brand.
His name is his brand, just like RedBull sponsors extreme sports, he also did whatever he could to get his name out there.
It's called marketing.
When you get to the point where you put your name on buildings you better make as big of a splash as possible. 
He did just that.
Read The Art of the Deal and you'll see, he talks about those things.

       u/Orangutan just listed 2 sources. What do you want, a paper trail? Good luck finding one outside of another Panama Papers leak (actually listing all of the American corruption). It's a pretty freaking decent hypothesis if you ask me: Hillary Clinton and Wll St buying all of her opposition at every turn. And it's only been 2 people so far, in all reality(Sanders, Trump). The rest (Comey, Lynch) might have been threatened into compliance.

       she outspends him 100,000,000:1 ... and she can barely pull a tie.

      <p>
       and that's not to forget that she has pulled on a coup against democracy -- completely stealing the DNC nomination from Sanders (who CRRRRRRUSHES them both on the polls).

       Her ego knows knows' no bounds -- preferring to start a war with Russia than admit she fucked up and allowed State secrets to leak into enemy hands by keeping a private server in her basement.
