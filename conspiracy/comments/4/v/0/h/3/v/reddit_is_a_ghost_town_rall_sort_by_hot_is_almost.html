<p>It&#39;s the  last day of the Democratic convention. A big chunk of their delegates has walked out there and occupied the media tent. The seats have been filled by paid actors.

    <div class="md"><p>You can tell from my profile, I&#39;ve been here awhile. Digg was the orginall user submitted news site, not sure what it is now. Their orginall problem was a few power users that really controlled the front page. As Digg got popular, corporate sponsors paid these power users since they generated millions of views. The manager was encouraged to ban these users, but instead did nothing. They then allowed media outlets to submit and promote posts, using the same power users. 
Digg also created a friend system to promote votes, but these turned into brigades that can take over the front page. 
Reddit has been removing content, letting brigades (correct the record, Trump brigades) control content and control media outlets post in major subreddits. </p>

<p>I think Reddit Inc did something brilliant last year (from their perspective) in that they pushed away lots of their more vulgar users to all of the reddit replacements waiting in the aisles, thus making those sites a less attractive alternative to those of us who are getting fed up with the way reddit has been changing over the last five years or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually look at &quot;new&quot; and upvote the content I think is decent or entertaining.  As I mentioned in another comment, i browse reddit on my long commute in the morning, and my phone will default to &quot;hot&quot; for some reason, which is how i noticed it.</p>

<p>The newly announced &quot;promoted user&quot; content is kind of what I was thinking might be associated with posts lingering for a long time.  There were 5 posts that were more than a day old hanging out on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> this morning.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret that social media has been manipulating content and certain narratives, and it isn&#39;t far fetched to think that reddit would tweak the algorithm to allow for their new paid posts to linger longer.  I mean, if McDonalds and Coke paid good money for their ad, they wouldn&#39;t want to see their promotional material slide off the front page too fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or at all. Most advertisements are not one shot deals. They are continuous and the companies have a formula to determine how many times a potential consumer needs to see something to seal the deal. Usually three times, provided they showed initial interest. I don&#39;t know how that would apply on the propaganda aspect, but I would imagine they have developed their own formulas as well.</p>

<p>Reddit does not (always) properly consider time zones. When I make a new post or comment, it instantly shows as &quot;posted 9 hours ago&quot; on my mobile device for example.</p>

<p>It is quite likely the reason for your observation, in which case you based your statement on incorrect information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I browse reddit every morning on my 2 hour bus commute to work.  I typically read <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.  In my personal experience, it is almost never that clogged with older posts.  So, no, that isn&#39;t literally how it is every morning.</p>

<p>When I checked &quot;new&quot; there was the usual amount of new content under 4 hours; 100+ newer topics for each of those popular subs.  Admins have admitted to fiddling with this in the past, so it isn&#39;t that far fetched.</p>

<p>It might be nothing and is just a &quot;slow news day&quot;, but I felt it warranted a discussion.  Especially based in light of the new &quot;promoted user posts&quot; announced just a couple days ago.</p>
