        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">180</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-07-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This blood scandal &#39;getting out&#39; is widely believed to be why Vince Foster &#39;committed suicide&#39;.  It&#39;s been remembered as a &quot;bayer blood scandal&quot; since bayer got sued many times over from this, although their source was the arkansas prison system which sold the blood to canada.  It is important to understand that this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products">was a very widespread problem from the late 70s to 80s (7 yr period) among at least 3 major pharma blood brokers, bayer, baxter, and cutter and the origin was in fact a prison in arkansas.</a></p>

<p>Every company involved is at fault since they were supposed to &#39;trust but verify&#39;,  have some semblance of quality control.  That means you check the blood routinely, AND MOST SPECIFICALLY YOU DON&#39;T SOURCE IF FROM A PRISON, since injection drug use and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men">MSM (men-who-have-sex-with-men)</a> sex and male-rape are commonplace; thus failing the first criteria of donorship, you don&#39;t take blood from someone knowingly HIV+ or having HEP-C.  Furthermore, it would seem there was a financial incentive both on the donor side and the seller side to lie about the potential contamination factors.</p>

<p>The film was a comprehensive treatise on the subject, according to blogs.  I wouldn&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve not seen it.  Nor will I ever.  And nor will you, unless you dig up a copy, for example in Russia or Japan or something.</p>

<p>The film disappeared because the filmmaker was threatened with murder.  He was stonewalled by our government, by the prison system, by the police, by the FBI, by the DOJ.  These &#39;authorities&#39; broke into his home and stole his research materials, and committed other acts of intimidation including burgularizing him and slashing his tires.  He&#39;s had to sue for information when it should be free under the FOIA.  His private, personal information has appeared on the internet to intimidate and shame him, suggesting intelligenc-mafia tactics.</p>

<li><a href="http://hcvets.com/data/bloodmanagement/RedCross/documentary.htm"><strong>Factor-8 : The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal [Film] Suppression</strong></a> : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Duda">Kelly Duda</a> produced the documentary film<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_8:_The_Arkansas_Prison_Blood_Scandal">[1]</a></sup> about the Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal<sup><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1547991/posts?q=1&amp;;page=74">[2]</a><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/04/arkansas-bloodsuckers-the-clintons-prisoners-and-the-blood-trade/">[3]</a>,</sup> in which Clinton cronies knowingly sold HIV and HEP-C tainted blood collected from prisoners to Canadian pharma companies including Bayer, which was ultimately culpable for lawsuits when hemophiliac children were infected and died as a direct result.<sup><a href="http://www.hemophilia.ca/en/commemoration-of-the-tainted-blood-tragedy/">[4]</a>.</sup>  Although it was an award-winning film, Duda was sued, robbed, intimidated<sup><a href="http://hcvets.com/data/bloodmanagement/RedCross/documentary.htm">[5]</a><a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=47128">[6]</a></sup> and ultimately this film has been scrubbed from the internet.<sup><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4uuxxd/factor_8_is_a_documentary_that_has_been_scrubbed/">[6]</a></sup> 

<ul>
<li>According to Joseph Farah of WND, &quot;Duda, who has worked with CNN, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Associated Press Television in their coverage of the blood-scandal story, says he was followed, sued, burglarized and had his tires slashed while working on the documentary&quot; quoting Duda as saying,<br/></li>
<li>“While making this documentary, I lost several things. I lost my president, my home state, my family, many friends, and my innocence.”<br/></li>
<li>Despite having &quot;worked as a consultant in two major class-action lawsuits in Europe and Japan where plasma from Arkansas’ prison system showed up.&quot;  and having &quot;assisted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in its investigation of the Arkansas prison plasma sales.&quot;,<br/></li>
<li>&quot;he has also been in talks with the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI about a possible investigation in the United States.&quot;<sup><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2005/10/33137/">[7]</a>.</sup> </li>
<li>Duda added, “It may sound sensational, but I assure you it’s true. In the process of making ‘Factor 8,’<em>I received strange phone calls, I was followed, my house was broken into, my tires slashed</em>, and <strong><em>sensitive information – including my personal notes – mysteriously appeared on the Internet,”</em></strong> recounts Duda. “I also had a gun pointed at the back of my head, there was a murder, and a key inmate informant was whisked out of state and put into isolation.”</li>
<li> ... Farah&#39;s article continues, &#39;He says when he went looking for Clinton’s governor’s papers to find state documents relevant to his investigation, he was told that 4,000 boxes had been hidden away in private storage and could not be found.&#39; </li>
<li>“When I went to the Arkansas State Health Department to request records regarding disease rates at the prison and anything about the plasma program, I was stonewalled,” he said. </li>
<li>“I actually had to sue the state agency just to get access to its files that by law are supposed to be a matter of public record. When I went to the Arkansas State Police Headquarters key documents had disappeared. When complete strangers showed up out of the blue asking me what I was doing and with whom did I work for, I had to ask myself, ‘What’s going on here?&quot;</li>
</ul></li>

<p>For the &quot;doubting thomases&quot; who are so incredibly lazy that they just want to shit on this article with doubt, not bothering themselves to follow my links that took me a very long time to put together.  HERE: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The president of HMA at that time was Leonard Dunn, a close friend of Bill Clinton and Vincent Foster.[1] He chaired Clinton&#39;s re-election campaign and was appointed by Clinton to the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission.</p>

Don&#39;t use this username, create a new one, and post it through 7 proxies.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it and talk about it.  Our awareness is key and very timely. I really just dug up something that wasn&#39;t well buried.  The real credit goes to the filmmaker.  I know he probably doesn&#39;t want anything more to do with this as he knows <em>exactly</em> what kind of mafia with whom he would be dealing.  Which sucks.  I kind of wish we had our own private <em>Country</em> so we could not have to deal with these vicious, reptilian assclowns</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it was.  Well for money for one; I am not sure they knew it would go to hemophiliac children initially, but certainly they found out after they got phone calls about it after the first couple of cases.  The problem is, 1) they did this for over a decade. 2) they got it from prisoner blood which is ALWAYS a problem.  Diseases spread through prison like wildfire, esp hiv/hepc from fighting, drug use, prison tattooing with pens and male rape. They didn&#39;t screen, they clearly didn&#39;t inform the recipients of the source (canadian pharma affiliates).  It&#39;s very possible they even fenagled certifications and lied about the blood being &#39;clean&#39;.</p>

<p>They knew what they were doing.  They were extremely callous and inhuman in knowingly continuing the program.  One could argue this was a genocide against victims of a particular disease, kind of a eugenicidal program.  I think if the UN / World judiciary bodies had any integrity whatseover they&#39;d have given this a much better investigation.  </p>

<p>But that they didn&#39;t suggests that the clinton network extends out in ways we cannot even imagine (ie: freemasons, smom, jesuits and even well up the chain to the pope or something---I&#39;m serious about this also--this is suggestive of empire-class mafia dealings)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never heard this part of the story and I am not surprised at all but sickened.</p>

<p>Makes me think of that movie the Constant Gardener. And of all the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that HIV was created yo kill gays and blacks and junkies and purposely released again and again into the populations of certain cities and countries and is being done even today in 3rd world countries. The AIDs epidemic in Africa is created and sustained on purpose and as in the movie they hand out free drugs but are actually using these people as non consenting lab rats.</p>

<p>Today I lost respect doe an author I love when U found her on Twitter and saw just endless HRC love posts and Trump hate tweets.  Now I want to show this to her and ask her if the wise healer and spiritual guide Nevyn would have voted for HRC.  I couldn&#39;t vote for either but as HRC gets more and more heinous the more I learn I wish I had voted Trump.  He probably is Goldman Sachs and TPTB puppet but at least he hadn&#39;t yet used his political office to profit off killing people whatever his crimes happen to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This matter of HIV is personal to me.  I have hiv.  I told my uncle--who lives in SF, is a progressive liberal with lots of gay friends and such, and who strongly supported Hillary--about this arkansas prison blood scandal.  He didn&#39;t reply to me.  He thought it was political.  He ignored it.  I wrote a follow up with the documentary.  I said &quot;this documentary was made well before she ran for office&quot;.  I said, &quot;hillary and bill knowingly gave 60,000 sick children hiv and hep c coinfections, killed 800 right away and foreshortened their lives by decades&quot;.  He hasn&#39;t written back and won&#39;t talk with me.  Which is fine, because I&#39;ve already decided he&#39;s dead to me.  If he didn&#39;t watch that documentary, then I have no reason to consult with him for the rest of my life.  The world is full of really good people--I&#39;m going to choose to spend my time surrounding myself with them.</p>

<p>Clinton has had this really good effect of helping you find out who is immoral around you and cut you off from them in a permanent way.  She&#39;s made it very clear that there&#39;s a battle between light and dark and you telegraph your affiliation by which side your on.  </p>

<p>This says nothing about Trump.  He&#39;s not even a player in this conversation.  This is about 1) you&#39;re for hillary, 2) you&#39;re against hillary.</p>

<p>And finally: when you know this story about the arkansas prison blood scandal, you realize that all the &quot;trump is a nazi&quot; accusations fall completely flat: because the clintons participated in a huge, suppressed, nazi agenda, genocide of sick children (eugenics / genocide) and have never faced the music for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow =(  not even a look over for his nephew/niece?  I&#39;m so sorry. And not at all surprised based on my family experiences and so called friends.  They are there until you ask for support that is unpopular or uncomfortable to them and their carefully constructed version of reality.  It&#39;s a harsh lesson realizing people I had given so much of my love and time and energy and money to would turn their backs if I inconvenienced them at all.</p>

<p>And to have HIV and see this story and have people ignore it. =(  I am so sorry.  I have some serious health issues and they disabled and disfigured me and I know I am preferred kept at a distance.  I need help finding a surgeon and convincing my insurance but not a single  one is willinh to even let me stay with them if I need to be in Dallas for a drs appt.</p>

<p>Well, shame on them!  You are absolutely right.  We only have so many hours in our day why not choose to spend it with positive and caring people and not phonies and hypocrites.</p>

This is at least the 4th time I&#39;ve heard some version of this in relation to a Clinton scandal. At what point do we collectively acknowledge that no one is that lucky and these documents are being lost on purpose? Or at least acknowledge that we shouldn&#39;t keep putting them in charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it and talk about it.  Our awareness is key and very timely. I really just dug up something that wasn&#39;t well buried.  The real credit goes to the filmmaker.  I know he probably doesn&#39;t want anything more to do with this as he knows <em>exactly</em> what kind of mafia with whom he would be dealing.  Which sucks.  I kind of wish we had our own private <em>Country</em> so we could not have to deal with these vicious, reptilian assclowns</p>
