        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know what the plan for the next year is if you will hear me out.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that Trump came in out of nowhere and no one, including the elite took him seriously. He was truly a rogue wave that no one could have foreseen being as destructive as he truly was/is. </p>

<p>Before the Trump meme train hit high gear the plan of the elite was to pit {insert controlled Republican here} against Clinton or some other controlled Democratic candidate in case of a Hillary wipeout. Hillary was obviously their best choice as she has the most dirty laundry for the puppet masters to use as blackmail in case she goes rogue (which, of course for that reason, she would never do). </p>

<p>For rhetorical purposes going forward I will say that Bush was to be the appointed Republican, although it doesn&#39;t matter if you substitute Bush with Cruz, Kasich, Rubio etc.</p>

<p>I believe that the economy is hanging on by an extremely thin thread and it was scheduled to BLOW UP sometime in July-August. The fallout being the most extreme candidate from either controlled side would have taken the gold. Bush would have promised Nazi like control over the collapse and Clinton would have promised Stalinist like control over the economy. Either way the elite win.</p>

<p>This obviously cannot happen now, as Trump has used all the blackmail the elite had on hillary against the elite by releasing it before the election cycle. Now the elite are in damage control. They do not have enough time to replace Hillary and they don&#39;t have the ability to replace Trump. They are just going to do the best they can holding the economy above water and censoring the mainstream media in support of Hillary. They hope that she can win, but the elite are backed into a corner. It has been reported that many of them have already gone into hiding. This is a very dangerous situation. If they feel like they are going to lose their puppet Hillary they may just pull the &quot;fuck everything&quot; lever.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>Economy crashes before the election = Trump victory</p>

<p>Elites goal is to get hillary in so they must prop the economy up for a few more months.</p>

<p>This is an almost impossible task as many major banks/countries are already on the very precipice of complete destruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting input.
I&#39;m not sure how I feel about Trump, I feel like both sides (that he is Hillary&#39;s puppet or he is just a rogue that gained traction) could be viable, along with other theories.<br/>
What I don&#39;t think will happen is the economy collapsing before the end of the summer harvest season for the farmers (big bucks for investors).  These depressions are controlled by the banks/top share holders and investors so they can have put and calls on the stocks.
The only way that the economy will crash in an uncontrolled scenario (in my opinion) is that there would be a triggered sporadic foreign run on American resources and assets when they decide that the US dollar has lost too much of its worth.  This would create a giant wave of cash within America and we will finally witness the hyper-inflation that the Federal Reserve has been hiding over seas. 
Anyways, it&#39;s hard to tell.  My guess is October if our final thread snaps (man, is it hanging on there....).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard of the economy supposedly collapsing for decades.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t happened, not saying it won&#39;t now, but there&#39;s nothing suggesting it&#39;s more likely now than it was then.</p>

<p>Also, painting Trump as a good guy, when his entire life he has been a good little puppet to TPTB, is unlikely.</p>

<p>Could he have gone rogue? Sure, but he would&#39;ve had an &quot;accident&quot; if he did.</p>

<p>Trump and the Clintons are good friends, and that alone, even disregarding his entire background, shows that he&#39;s just a plant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe we are taking the wrong approach. The problem is, the conspiracy is vast because it&#39;s a system, but it also has key people and institutions around it.  How about a visual</p>

</ul>

<p>It also helps to demonstrate that there were several events that enabled 911 and the post911 global corporatist security state (nwo) and that you can point to key figures that enabled it (starting with george h w bush, cheney, rumsfeld to begin with, although there are many many more neocons that enabled that, primarily in the MIC and intelligence).  If you study the history of intelligence then you will get to the illuminati, since spycraft and the occult go hand in hand all the way back to John DEE and beyond</p>

<p>I would consider these fascist neocons to be a very big part of the post bavarian illuminati, and I&#39;d point to freemasonry as the primary secret network that provides auxiliary services, crimes to happen, a  mechanism of communication and also it anonymizes connections to higher &#39;masters&#39; such as the monarchs and religious leaders of the world, making for plausible deniability of these &#39;mafia&#39;s&#39; covert actions</p>

<hr/>

<p>there is a  &#39;self proclaimed ex illuminati witch&#39; named doc marquis who claims the freemason network was a good one prior to 1776, but it was infiltrated within a decade or so and since then has been controlled by the illuminati, and is a coven of witches as well as a mafia that engages in creating spies / doubles by ritual abuse starting with babies---they dip them in boiling water to cause them to dissociate and &#39;create alters&#39;.  He seems legit as I&#39;ve fact checked him on eveything I could and haven&#39;t caught him saying anything counterfactual...Of course i know nothing verifable about the illuminati parts of his discussion and canot fact chec that...except to say that the technique he describes for creating alters is certainly verifiable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump wouldn&#39;t be where he is now without a power base which protects and supports him. Some here believe he is just fake which is surely possible but the damage he does to the narrative makes this unlikely in my eyes.</p>

<p>IMHO Trump&#39;s existence shows the national/international oligarchy isn&#39;t just one block sharing the same interests and ideology.</p>

<p>Just think about it.</p>

<p>Why should traditional US elites with their financial base connected to the health of the US economy be interested in getting their business concept getting ruined by globalists or fear to be taken over when the USD crashes?
That group will need protectionism to protect their own assets sooner than later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how should &quot;eastern&quot; elites protect and support Trump in the USA?:-)</p>

<p>There are different classes of western elites. There are national elites which make their profits through traditional businesses and there are the globalists which can just move their capital wherever they see fit.</p>

<p>Both just don&#39;t have the same interest. When the USD crashes its devaluation will make every US business a takeover candidate which will easily ruin the national oligarchy which hasn&#39;t reached the international plutocrat level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>stay away from that shit. it loses all it&#39;s value when this shit goes down. Bit coin is great for money laundering and SHIT as an investment.I should clarify Bitcoin is GREAT if you want to move wealth without a government knowing. I think bitcoin is one of the greatest inventions of the past 10 years. but it will go up, and it will come way down in value. it is good for money transfer. you get in, transfer and convert.</p>
