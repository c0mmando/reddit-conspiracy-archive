       Non-American here however I have been following the facade taking place in the south. Whenever a major news broke implicating Hillary, Trump just ignored and talked rubbish. I am sure Republicans are not that dumb that they are unable to prepare material for trump to literally tear apart Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: Today he said that US should accept Russian in Crimea, the other day when FBI released statement of her being willfully negligent - he simply ignored it...likewise the whole DNC leaks talk is very poorly presented by republicans...

       This has been considered by many from the beginning and sadly right now it's basically taboo to even entertain it with the general public. Trump supporters get livid at the suggestion that they might be getting fooled by a con artist, and Hilary ones will take it as a personal attack on their worship of their savior, as well as proof one is a misogynist.
      </p>

       He's performed his controlled opposition role perfectly. He attacks her with facts and figures already suggested by MSM but ultimately ignored by it, and then spouts some more outlandish verbiage and it all becomes noise:
       <em>
        'oh, he called her a Wall Street puppet, then tweeted a rare Pepe, what a crazy racist lunatic!'
       </em>

       Remember Trump behind the birther movement regarding Obama?   Trump has been feeding on some of those far out Republican groups for a long time,  some more,  some less.    His retention of facts is not all that good,   and his own views are not fleshed out too well except in the simplest of terms,  but his version of reality has been radicalized.    The new left is the enemy of America.    Just as Merkel is the enemy of the German people,  and that is not a hard case to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take a parallel recent situation,  the Bernie phenomenon where Bernie captured and then demobilized a huge segment of the left that could have derailed Hillary.     Bernie had enough support to do something productive,  and it was squandered,  intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       This worked out well for Hillary,  and at least by the time of the Democratic convention,  it was
       <strong>
        the
       </strong>
       strategy,  shared by Hillary and Bernie.    Was it the strategy all along?    Most likely.
       <em>
        The progressive left was played.
       </em>
       When did Bernie realize it?    From the start?    No,  I doubt that.   But Hillary knew it from the start.   Bernie has always been compromising with the machine.    His followers did not realize how easily Bernie would sell out in the end.    On what day did Bernie sell out?    The day he got that facial injury?    The day he "lost" California?   Did he really think the votes could ever work in his favor,  did he ever not know the votes were being rigged?    Did he misjudge his own support?   Probably he is just used to fighting within the confined system of apparatchiks that he has become familar with,  and it was this system that he was hoping to use,  this system that he believes in,  and this system whipped his ass,  on terms that he accepts,  as corrupt as it may be.    So now,  he compromises,  because there are things more important than his platform.    There is an intact ideology that still guides him,  and it has to do with not letting the Republicans take office,  no matter how much your own group stinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its hard to imagine that the same is true for Trump,   because Trump appears to have been radicalized into a position at some point,   probably since 9/11.        Bernie was not radicalized into a position,   his ideological position that he has now has always guided him.    His compromise with Hillary fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump can't win women,  he can't win blacks,  he can't win Muslims,  he can't win Hispanics,   so a bunch of angry white men is all he has,  and we saw how that went for Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand,  Trump would probably really enjoy being president.    And Hillary does have real vulnerabilities.    So Trump might see it as a worthwhile gamble.    Trump is in it for himself,   not in it for the conservative side of America.   That's a big difference with Bernie.   Bernie's position has more ideological urge against the conservatives.    Trump is not anti liberal in the same way.    The post Bush liberals like Obama and Clinton are more neocon than liberal.    Trump is not friends with the neocons,  not the Republican ones,  or the even weirder Democrat ones.   The Democrat neocons like Hillary and Obama are even worse maybe than the Republican ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that right now,  considering the dud that Trump picked for VP,  considering how much Republican support is already shifted to Hillary,   considering the media that Trump gets (incredibly toxic),  I call rigged,  in the sense that Hillary supporters have more money and more power,   and the Clintons also have a lot of power,  on their own,  to rig the system.   Trump is toast.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me sick.   They are both turds.   This country needs to not have either.    It needs someone who is sane enough to get us out of the military adventures and false flags we have been doing to others and ourselves.    It needs a voice of sanity to guide us through the next and looming financial crisis.   It needs someone to stand up to the corporate and religious fundamentalists.    A vote for Hillary or Trump is a wasted vote.    So,  I might as well vote for Jill Stein.

       You better fucking believe it. I'm going to put this in the easiest terms for you guys to understand....
      </p>
      <p>
       The chances are great. I wouldn't say the clintons themselves set it up, but whoever the "architect" of our presidential elections is, whoever writes the "script" (and they select the candidates and do this years in advance by the way), saw some potential in a "self made" charismatic straight-shooter businessman like trump, and knew that he would appeal to the conservative/republican demographic, and saw an opportunity to use the media to orchestrate a Hillary victory against him, and Both candidates are in on this and they realize this and go along with it, as well as the media. They're pretty much just playing a pre-written character that suits the political climate of the time. If there was a copy of the "2016 presidential election script", it would be something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       *ACT I, SCENE 1: Trump enters race
Isolates himself from latino, african american, and female voting demographic with racist and ridiculous anti-women statements, setting himself up for a huge loss. He is simply playing the character he was asked to.
      </p>
      <p>
       ACT 2, SCENE 1: Media and television play a role in portraying Trump as a "court jester" or a "comedian", not a serious legitimate presidential candidate. This increases incrementally over time, and also creates hostility between the two parties, which gets people really involved in the election and taking it seriously, kinda like an NFL game.
      </p>
      <p>
       ACT 3, FINAL SCENE: Then, Hillary wins by a landslide, because they know it will trigger the classic voting mentality, "Trump is so dangerous, we CAN'T let him win, so we must vote for Clinton instead, the lesser of two evils".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most rational voters will fall into this trap and elect Clinton, and have no idea this was all done by design. When trump and clinton attack each other, it's all for show, they don't really hate each other, infact they're good friends in real life.  In a nutshell,
      </p>
      <p>
       **"Lets make one of our puppets act like a crazy asshole, so the OTHER one can win easily against him, despite having a criminal reputation herself". They knew Hillary was so unpopular, they had to come up with a scheme to FORCE people to vote her in....She has been pampered and prepared for this role for the last 20 years guys.

       This is an area where proof never happens.  And when it does come out so much time has passed that nobody cares. Which really pisses me off is when I hear about some scandal from 50 years ago and nobody cares. Nobody seems to draw the connection that if someone did something a long time ago someone else might be doing the same today.  Especially in politics.  They don't even have to break laws. Just have a verbal agreement.  How do you think hillary got the secretary of state position?  Obama and her agreed that if she stepped aside he'd give her a cabinet position.  There will never be proof unless one of them talks. But it's pretty obvious.  Also what do you think Bernie Sanders will be doing a year from now? Probably in her cabinet.  Not sure though.  He held on through the convention so maybe no favors. He did endorse her so there will be some payment for that.

       Fair enough I see where you're going with this. But, if you were in Trump's position right now would you give up the opportunity for the most powerful political position in the world? Especially since Trump is a narcissist.

       Exactly my thought. People of wealth and power only are in it for more wealth and power. There's no way he's going to go this far just to say here you go Hillary. I actually think the opposite shes the plant for him. He will gain the populist movement and the people will pretty much let him do whatever he wants until its to late. But who knows anything can happen.

       It's certainly a farce. Whether Trump is for real or a decoy is uncertain; the possibility, no matter how remote, cannot be ruled out. If he's not an intentional decoy, he's certainly trying to look like one.

       Also, I think just as Clinton rigged the Democratic primaries, she also ensured Trump's victory on the Republican side perhaps later in the game seeing momentum. Trump has been beating Hillary in the polls recently and decided he would lose some points by putting himself into another controversy

       Didn't his former campaign person said he just wanted publicity for his stuff? I think it was more unintended than anything. He did this patch up campaign and enough people fucking bought it. He pretty much get his speeches by putting together various comment sections, add some name recognition and boom! You automatically have about 50% chance of winning it all (thanks electoral college). I can't wait to hear what his take on this after the election. I bet you a lot of his supporters will be pissed

       With the utmost respect, try to look at this post with a different pov. This subreddit is supposed to be for those who think and look outside of the box. Ive often thought that Trump was placed where he is for the purpose of making HRC look good. Think back at all of the horrific things this guy has said. Why not theorize that he is simply TRYING to throw the election for her sake? Why is that such an outlandish thought? Look at his complete lack of sanity, his outrageous claims and words about immigrants, foreign relations, etc. Im not saying to take this post as truth, instead, as with every post in this subreddit, take it with a grain of salt, food for thought, things of the like. As with any rumor, there is an element of truth. This subreddit/community should not be divided but accept all theories no matter how "insane" you think they may be. Now, as with any rational post, downvote your hearts out. :)

       The problem is you're talking to a Trump supporter.  He's taken all of Trump's insane comments as "telling it like it is" and has agreed with all of them.

       See i always thought that too but he does bash her relentlessly. When Trump goes in on HRC, Trump GOES IN. Least from everything ive seen. i dont think he is being easy on her at all. he has called her out on pretty much everything. I think the problem is not individual people the problem is the entire system has been subverted by corporate profit. Doesnt matter who is president at this point.

       Who would do that? Well, who would go to such lengths to rig a DNC knowing that if that fact was made public that their position would be in jeopardy, unless there was a safety net job waiting on HRC's staff, of course. So THAT happened. And no body seems to be questioning those emails. Why do you think THAT is? I think that these people are willing to put their public face in question if the rewards are far greater. So, understanding that IF this theory (huge if, i get that) is correct, and considering Trump's immense wealth as it is, the rewards must be pure insanity to us common folk. And yes, I often think what he says in such a public forum. I commend him for that despite what others think. I dont want this to turn into a political argument, there is one to be had, but id rather discuss the (remote) possibility that Trump is actually throwing the candidacy and purposefully dividing the country so that the masses flock to the "only other candidate" in the race, HRC. Whether you like him or not is irrelevant when entertaining the thought of conspiracies such as this.

       Some people believe that we are crazy because we believe that the email leaks had nothing to do with the Russians. The mainstream thinkers ask us for our proof since they supposedly have proof that the Russians are all over it. Should we automatically believe them because of their "facts"?

       I’ll copy and paste this again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has done more in half a year to publicly smear the media than anyone else has managed in decades. The media centers–the news aggregators like Fox and MSNBC–are the primary means of controlling the population. If Trump was controlled opposition, he wouldn’t be taking a massive steaming dump on the Jew’s best and primary means of getting what they want in America. The news networks know nobody watches them anymore and the Democrats and Republicans know that nobody wants to vote for either of them anymore. But they need the people to believe otherwise, because that’s how the Emperor’s New Clothes charade is maintained. People who question or attack the parties and the media machine that promotes them are by definition eroding the Zionist control over America. Trump isn’t controlled opposition. Old videos of him show him holding the same general opinions and political leanings that he does now, and he is directly attacking the things that allow Jewish elites to maintain a stranglehold on Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recall Tolkien’s works. “I think a servant of the Enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump was controlled opposition, he would superficially appear to be a bad goy, but his policies would all serve Jewish and Israeli interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact opposite of this is true. He superficially appears to be a good goy, but all of his policies are bad for Jews and Israel–or at least, bad for the Jews and Israeli interests who wish to directly control and influence us. He’s not controlled opposition. He’s a Jew-wise bull in a china shop. The worst possible enemy of the establishment. He threatens to break the monopoly of both sides of the aisle. That’s why both parties are attacking him, just like both sides attack the Tea Party because it threatened to wake up the 60% of the US population that doesn’t vote, the vast majority of which are conservatives. Even worse, his mere presence and standing up to the monolithic machine has caused some of the Neocons to start uncucking themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Huckabee has spent the last three decades hiding his power level because he knew it was the only way to get anything done, and now he’s coming out swinging on Trump’s side. We saw something absolutely unprecedented during the GOP debate. We saw the entire Republican lineup shitting on the moderators and their bullshit agenda. Trump has now even called out, on television, the fact that news stations play loops of footage of events and call it “live”. Not only did they immediately stop doing this once he said it, he even got the anchors to agree with him. That has literally never happened before. And who started the fire? Trump did. Does that sound like a good goy to you? If the GOP wants to snub Trump, they’re going to have an internal struggle to manage it–between the people who had given up hope and become part of the machine and those who were willing accomplices.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they do snub him for someone like Bush or Rubio, they’re going to risk not only a political schism that would split the conservative base between the progressives and the traditionalists, but  also further risk an Independent winning the Presidency, which is the one thing that would spell certain doom for both parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because once the people realize an Independent can actually win again, the Emperor’s New Clothes charade is over, the false dichotomy is broken, and the genie can’t ever be put back into the bottle.

       Same with JFK, Sandy Hook, the truth behind the Afghanistan War, the Iraq War and the recent Turkish coup.  Not to mention countless mysterious deaths of journalists and others connected to the political-media-financial-defense sectors.

       Your demands against discussion without proof are absurd.

       We do not.  We have the previous history of coziness between Trump and the Clintons.  We have the phonecall meeting between Trump and Bill shortly before Trump announced his run.  We have Trump running a campaign that looks to be constructed to pull the Republican party to the far right and to then sink his own campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has proved exceptional on this last point, but for any other politician the things he's said would be campaign killers.  To any rational observer these are the actions of a campaign attempting to self destruct.  I expect him to continue this throughout the campaign.  If he is elected we've already heard he intends to give his governing powers to someone else more qualified, like he offered Kasich, at which point TPTB will be in control as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short of a confession from the man himself we will probably never know the truth.  But there is evidence, which i just reiterated.  You can say you don't like it, but you can't claim it's not evidence.

       You are entitled to your opinions, NO ONE here can argue against that if theyre being rational and adult about it. But take a step back and look at what is happening here: A devoted proponent of a political figure, arguing about whether or not a CONSPIRACY is plausible or not? Dont confuse what this platform is about. He certainly calls it like it is, often times i believe its rooted in fact if not maybe just presumed facts via observation and a bit of intuition. But THAT is not the issue here.
