    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t people understand by now that EVERYONE is part of the establishment?!...are people still so naive as to believe that you or me or random Joe blow off he street can run for president and win based on how many people we get to back us enough to vote for us?...NO...Trump is not squeaky clean by any means and has ties to people we all question...but Hillary has been PROVEN to be a criminal.  It is unfortunate that we as a people are subjected to choose between the Rock and a hard place.  Hell...who would want to be president at this point?...it&#39;s like selling your soul.  If you&#39;re asking will Trump be better than Hillary...Absolutely.  Do I think he will be an awesome president?...I am skeptical. With all the corruption that we have always known about but it being obviously EXPOSED to the people without tunnel vision, especially at the DNC where they removed first amendment rights from their OWN party...I just don&#39;t understand how people are still trying to logically justify that Hillary Clinton should even be a possibility?!</p>

<p>I second that.  </p>

<p>Personally, i think Trump is marginally better only because none of the evil people we all know want him.  That makes me want to see what he can do.  Sadly, that scares the poop outta me too.  I have a really cool loud mouth, life of the party, tell-it-how-it-is, alcoholic, uncle that i LOVE hanging with but id never want him as pres.  </p>

<p>Cheney and Rumsfeld both claim they want him. Lots of other neocons as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Trump has been quite honest about supporting the police state, torture of &quot;terrorists&quot; (like Assange and Snowden) and their family members, and the Patriot Act. He&#39;s also a zionist, like Hillary. Would he be better than her? I don&#39;t think so, but I&#39;m probably not going to find out, since I think neither of them will be President. IMO, Obama is the last President of America. The old world order is coming to an end, and the globalists are about to introduce the new one. </p>

<p>But first: WW3, the biggest financial crisis ever, Yellowstone eruption and total collapse of civilization. That&#39;s how they&#39;ll end the old world order. </p>

<p>But, if someone stuck a gun to my head and forced me to choose between them, I would choose Trump. I say this as a person who switched my registration from Green to Dem only to vote for Bernie and then promptly switched back to Green the day he endorsed HRC.</p>

<p>I despise Donald Trump and most of what he stands for, but he is an unknown commodity as an elected official, unlike the murderous and corrupt Hillary. His every move will be watched by both Dems and Republicans. Whereas I get the sense that the vast majority of elected Democrats are fully behind HRC. She will get away with far more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but trump was in epsteins book too, and accused of raping minors.  You&#39;re being very disingenuous saying that all trump has done is said mean things at the podium.  His team is full of neocons and he is a billionaire who wants to cut taxes on the wealthy just like bush did.  He has defrauded our economy by declaring bankruptcy multiple times as a business move whenever it benefits him.  He doesn&#39;t care about anyone but himself and has a track record that shows he does not care about doing the right thing.  Nobody gets to that level of wealth without being part of the establishment.  He is a smooth talker which is what business people are trained to do, but his actions reveal his true motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying he is in cahoots either.</p>

<p>I am saying that there is an arena we are allowed to play in.</p>

<p>Whether Trump is in cahoots. Whether Trump is a republican and the party is rejecting him. Whether the republican party is just acting. Whether or not he and Hillary are just friends pretending.... none of that matters.</p>

<p>What I am saying is we are all being played. All of this nonsense is a fucking show and the result is going to be a shit show no matter which one wins.</p>

<p>(When I say &#39;you&#39; here I mean the proverbial &#39;you&#39;)</p>

<p>If you vote for Trump in the honest belief that he is going to make this country better, or even be a better candidate than Hillary you have a <strong>fundamental</strong> misunderstanding of what the establishment really is.</p>

<p>If you want to know what it is - the arena analogy is the best thing I can think of off the top of my head. We are allowed to play in a little box. As long as we play inside that box we can go cuh-razy. We can say whatever we want about Trump or Hillary. We can throw shit till the sun goes down... hell, we can EVEN entertain the idea of a third party candidate appearing at the debates. </p>

<p>But actually bringing in a candidate that wants to restore the constitution of the United States? HAH!</p>

<p>And if you think Trump is interested in that you haven&#39;t been paying attention to a single fucking word he&#39;s said.</p>

<p>He is part of the establishment. The difference with Hillary Clinton is that she is <strong>bought</strong> and supported by the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Trump is part of the establishment, considering the Republican establishment and Fox News spent almost a year and millions of dollars trying to derail him. Regardless, I expect him to get co-opted like Reagan was. Anyone who puts up a serious fight gets Kennedy-ed.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a president with good intentions again, even if they are inevitably co-opted - we haven&#39;t had that since Reagan and Carter.</p>
