      <p>
       I'm thinking about what could cause the world to change. Here are some ideas: any more?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Violent revolution from below?
         </strong>
         It seems to me that elites tend to weather these quite well. Or at best we just get new elites.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          War?
         </strong>
         This removes some elites but just strengthens others.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Environmental collapse?
         </strong>
         Hard to rule the world when there is no world to rule.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Corporations even hurt the elite?
         </strong>
         This interests me a lot. We have created systems designed to divide and conquer. We assume that somebody is in charge. But can we reach a point where even "the illuminati" are slaves? Or 4a,
         <strong>
          Realisation dawns?
         </strong>
         Maybe we are already at stage 4, and one day a billionaire will wake up and realise it?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Too much chaos?
         </strong>
         Change becomes so rapid and unpredictable that elites constantly change. So being in the elite no longer has value.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Selling your soul?
         </strong>
         The cost of being elite becomes so high that they long for the simple life?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Technological utopia?
         </strong>
         Could technology make us all equal, despite the efforts of the elites?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Passive resistance?
         </strong>
         Could a non-violent revolution be organised? or is this impossible when big business makes the phones?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Elites get inspired?
         </strong>
         Could key elites ever see the bigger picture, and see the long term benefit in doing good?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Anything else?

       An awakening.  The elite rely on 90%+ of the people not knowing they exist, and not knowing they are controlling institutions, politicians, media, etc. . towards a thought out endgame.  If everyone were as awake as the peole on this sub, they wouldn't cease to hold power and wealth, but their ability to manipulate would be gone, which would essentially end any further progress on their agenda, and would likely lead to rollback of it.

       I had such a disappointing exchange with a couple otherwise smart people over the weekend....the denialism is so strong, still. Social media is a double edged sword (as we all know).....some people love it for its ability to reinforced all the lies they want to believe.

       What's the best way to make that happen? And how do we stop the same underlying forces taking over again (i.e. self interest and deception allows a new elite to survive or emerge)? I'm not saying the other options are any easier of course.

       All banks abolished. Abolishing all banks takes away the roots from the tree. All of your options above either give way for revolutionary chaos that are often more insidious than the old elite (And thus furthering the NWO) Or will never happen at all (The elite are supreme so they won't bicker; They are doing this for 10000+ years).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our only hope would be as above, a mass awakening and the abolishment of the central banks which are the root of everything. Without it, no money is printed for the elite and the life supply for them will be cut off. And i mean all central banks and banking families, every of them. If you do so, you would had been did the first step to remove the world mafia. Then everything else will collapse like a stack of dominoes.

       Thanks. Good addition to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you stop central banks evolving again? E.g. let's say we have the old system of "building societies" to finance housing (everyone who wants a house pays in, and each month a  new house is built). What happens when these societies club together to build something even bigger, like a major highway? Doesn't that create a de facto central bank?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is a central bank different because it creates money from nothing (rather than simply keeping lists of all the investments)?

       I agree. But maybe this could be used as a bargaining chip? Here is my logic:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Massive inequality leads to destruction, so everybody loses.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         But limited inequality is healthy: some people don't care about wealth or power, they just don't want to be bled dry.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In a less unequal society we make better use of brains. So everybody is better off in absolute terms.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         So elites have a choice: nothing at all, or be on top of a wealthier society. You won't have a hundred times the wealth of others, but you will still have more, and it will be more than now.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There is one weakness in my suggestion: in a fairer society some of today's elites could not compete. And they know it.

       Even if you have all the money in the world you need to know how to use that effectively to get done what somebody else planned for you.

       So if you cut away their managers, operators and intelligence they are like an empty shell company which did everything through outsourcing.

       I agree. And that is why technology plus inequality bothers me so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are creating systems that need fewer and fewer humans involved. Couple that with an unequal society, and elites have fewer and fewer humans to bribe in order to maintain their position.

       You'd get a lot further with a countrywide general strike and mass civil disobediance until incumbent interests are deposed. The only people who'd win in a violent revolution are the military elite, they're already the dominant class anyway. A violent revolution would only ensure that anybody who opposes them are permanently eliminated and nobody would oppose them ever again.

       "a countrywide general strike and mass civil disobedience" would bring them to their knees if we could organize on such a scale.

       It all comes down to whether or not people think critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the elite would have much less power if the average person knew that

       This interests me. I think the taxes example illustrates my point 4: these systems are evolving on their own. Most of us don't know what's going on. My suspicion is that NOBODY knows more than 1 percent of what is going on, even the elites. The tax guy understands tax, and the elites understand elitism. But they don't see how it fits together, they don't see its effects. I think we have created a system that is a monster. And it evolves to survive.

       tl;dr I don't think humans are the dominant species any more.

       Hmm yes, even the elites are probably heavily compartmentalised.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I don't think everything is a big conspiracy, sometimes people make mistakes and those mistakes persist due to incompetence.
