Everyone who works for any agency under the executive–from the directors to the janitors–can be fired by the president at any time for any reason.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay...so what are you saying?  Are you being serious or am I supposed to be reading some sarcasm in this statement that&#39;s whooshing over me?</p>

<p>I KNOW you&#39;re not referring to Shillary.  I know you&#39;re not referring to Shamders.</p>

<p>...and you <em>can&#39;t</em> be referring to Frump.</p>

<p>None of those corporate-owned cats are gonna change anything for the better if at all.</p>

<p>And regardless of whether you say &quot;Frump&#39;s not corporate-owned!&quot;  I&#39;ll say &quot;Yeah.  You&#39;re right.  He&#39;s not corporate-owned.  He&#39;s <em>CORPORATE</em> - which I&#39;m not sure isn&#39;t ultimately worse, actually.&quot;</p>

<p>So...what is it you&#39;re saying in terms of me/us being &quot;in for a real treat in the near future&quot;/January - implying that the next US president <em>won&#39;t</em> be the same kind of corporate-controlled shill puppet that they&#39;ve all been for quite a while now?</p>

<p>Well then I need to be enlightened <em>BIG TIME</em> - because as far as I can tell, they seem to be not too far from the center in terms of who controls the world.</p>

<p>I mean I know it’s not “corporations” per se that are <em>the</em> very center, but the people that own and control some of these global corporations most definitely have more power than governments themselves.  It’s the whole “give me control of a nations money supply and I care not who makes its laws” kind of thing…and the corporate structure is a lot closer to that paradigm than the governments are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until you understand that, you can’t understand the ramifications of the stated positions of those running for the presidency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then Jesus.  Stop acting like you’re some wannabe cryptic guru or whatever and lay it tf out.  I mean if you supposedly know what’s all going on…then LAY IT OUT.  I mean spell it out if you know.</p>

<p>I’m <em>telling</em> you outright that I don’t know.  You keep saying in your responses that you <em>do</em> - or at least you’re <em>definitely</em> implying this in the tone of your responses.</p>

<p>Yet you’re not actually <em>saying</em> anything.  You’re not actually spelling anything out.  You’re just essentially saying “Yeah.  I know what the ‘secret’ is”, yet you’re not actually <em>explaining</em> anything other than saying that you supposedly know.</p>

<p>So what is it?  Again, PLEASE enlighten us/me - and, <em>again</em>, I’m not being sarcastic.</p>

<p>I’m continuing to be wide open w/no sarcasm to whatever it is you may be saying or meaning or may be referring to.</p>

<p>So lay it out.  Spell it out.</p>

<p>[long bit that makes me think you’re at least relatively genuine]</p>

<p>Answer the following questions.</p>

<p>Are the Jews in control of Israel?
Do the Jews feel completely assimilated in America (like Germans, Italians, Irish, etc.), or do they maintain a distinct national identity within that nation?
Is this national identity neutered of its sense of self-preservation, or is its sense of self-preservation alive and well?
Does this mean they have an agenda to act upon this self-preservation?</p>

<p>Are the Jews drastically overrepresented in the highest levels of politics and business?
Did all of these Jews just happen to reach these positions by their individual competencies, or is there a self-perpetuating Jewish culture at the upper echelons of America?
Could the Jews hypothetically use these positions to sway public opinion?
Do the Jews have anything to gain by using their positions of power over media, politics, and money to sway public opinion?
Does it look like public opinion has been swayed?
Has it swayed in favor of the Jews?</p>

<p>With this in mind, go watch some Jewish-produced blockbusters and listen to Jewish-American politicians. Does it sound like they are pushing propaganda?
Do you detect a pattern in what you hear?
Is that pattern in or out of alignment with the direction in which society has changed?
Have otherwise respectable people spoken out against this in the past?
Have people who you believe (or have been told) are not respectable spoken out against this in the past?
Where did you get the impression that they are not respectable?
If you do your own research, do you still find said people to be unreasonable?
Who are you allowed to criticize?
Who are you forbidden from criticizing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Khazars have caused and continue causing much harm on the planet.  However, it is very important for us to not throw too many if any stones, lest our own glass houses come crashing down.</p>

<p>Call out evil.  Call out racism.  Rage against it.  Yes.  I agree.  But if you’re going to do it, do it against racism and injustice and prejudice of EVERY kind - not just of a selective aspect of it that benefits you and your specific group <em>only</em>.  Otherwise, you are then being no better than the worst aspects of those you criticize.</p>

<p>Racism of <em>any</em> kind is bad and should be railed against, and I see a white American or European or black American or African as being no better than the worst, most racist Khazarian Jew when they engage in racist, separatist mindsets themselves.</p>

<p>We become no better than those we hate if and when we do what <em>they</em> do.</p>

<p>We are all one people.  We are all one species.</p>

<p>We are humans - Homo sapiens sapiens.</p>

<p>and the more that we keep ourselves divided and apart from one another - the more we keep from seeing ourselves as the one human species which we most definitely are - the more damage we do to ourselves; the weaker we become as a species; the more harm we do to our ability to move forward and evolve together, and the easier it becomes for others - jackals or whatnot - to come in and rule over us, take advantage of us, use our ignorance and weakness against us.</p>

<p>It is bad for <em>all</em> of us.</p>

<p>We must learn to come together.  We must not be afraid to criticize each other and fight against ignorance - yes…this is how we learn and teach each other - but we must also do all of this in the spirit of ultimately coming together as one species…not separating and being apart from one another.</p>
