      <p>
       From the article "
       <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/pope-refuses-to-equate-islam-with-violence/article/471444">
        Pope says Islam is Not Terrorism
       </a>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't think it is right to equate Islam with violence"
      </p>
      <p>
       "In almost every religion there is always a small group of fundamentalists. We have them too."
      </p>
      <p>
       "If I have to talk about Islamic violence I have to talk about Christian violence. Every day in the newspapers I see violence in Italy, someone kills his girlfriend, another kills his mother-in-law, and these are baptised Catholics."
      </p>
      <p>
       What the HELL?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pope, if you would look at the
       <em>
        definition
       </em>
       of "
       <em>
        fundamentalist
       </em>
       ," and then compare it to what the Bible
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       tells Christians to do, you'd see that it is the OPPOSITE of violent!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        fundamentalist
       </p>
       <p>
        an adherent of fundamentalism, a religious movement characterized by
        <em>
         a strict belief in the literal interpretation of religious texts
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then what the Bible literally says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Matthew 5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:
        <strong>
         but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        2 Timothy 2:24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but
        <strong>
         be gentle unto all men
        </strong>
        ...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Equating fundamentalist Christians with terrorists! There you have it!

       The Catholic church is everything jesus despised, no better than the corrupt temples in rome he railed against. Organized religion in its current form is a perversion of Christ's teachings. I am not a Christian, but i have read the bible and am sickened by the hypocrisy of those that claim to be.

       He's a jesuit.  Jesuits have an oath that says they can and should kill anyone who doesn't believe in catholicism.

       So I don't know what kind of shit he's peddling but he is kind of like the pot calling the kettle black.

       I'm not sure if he's evil or just clueless.  He seems kind of like a useful idiot to me, being puppetteered by Adolfo Nicolas; and kind of stupidly putting out puff pieces on social issues.
      </p>

       He's basically trying to slowly mutate catholicism into gnostiticsm hoping that catholics will go along with it if he dabs them with enough lubricant and goes slowly.

       And they will.  They already believe hell isn't eternal any more because pope said so.  And they think freemasonry is good.  People in my family are catholic and they don't know freemasonry is no good.  My mom even recommended I join them to 'find out'.  If only she knew I'd be killing people and urinating on the bible at some point....

       You talk to anyone these days about religion and it's like they're all brainwashed into the same weirdass universalist ideas .. Even if they claim to be Christian.. They all repeat the same things... "I don't believe anyone will go to hell" "I think everyone will be saved" -_- Or if they're atheist "the God described in the Bible is evil"

       That's not something I would do just to find out about their innerworkings. I wouldn't do it for anything. We have a masonic lodge in my city. It gives me the creeps.

       Of course he is. Every pope since Vatican II is a jewish puppet. Catholicism stopped being Christianity centuries ago, but modern catholicism doesn’t even have Christian undertones to it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need an antipope and we need him FAST. Additionally, we need to start working toward the reunification of Christendom, starting with the expungement of the heresies of catholicism (and the far fewer heresies of orthodoxy).

       Yes, telling more people the truth and herding them away from false doctrines needs to happen. We all have to labor together to do this. And I mean, this has already been happening slowly. But I sincerely believe that, as tensions increase, it will start happening more rapidly. It will be like a ripple effect. But it will all happen in God's time..

       The black pope of the jesuits was traditionally the antipope; however francis was one position from black pope (superior general), a regional guy for latin america, and then he became white pope.  This makes the Jesuit takeover of the vatican complete.  So Jesuits run the papacy now.  There still is a black pope adolfo nicolas and he runs Frank

       Given their track record of being political / religious mercenaries, assassins without any adherence to national sovereignty, I'd say this is a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a master spy becoming the world's highest religious leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and this is KEY, that Francis is a freemason also; and has thus reversed the rule that catholics can't be masons and vice versa.  This rule was centuries old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freemasons worship Baal, and Jehovah, and Astarte (isis) NOT christ.  They think either Jesus is made up or that he existed and didn't die and instead have the mummified head of his wife which has superpowers since she's basically "queen of heaven', the highmost witch of all ages, isis; and that the rothschilds and the windsors are blood relatives of these two "roses"--this part is unclear ... do not  know if even 99% of masons have untangled all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both freemasons and jesuits have been kicked out of countries for their political chicanery.  Connect the dots and none of this looks good for anyone

       The real struggle that no one knows they are in is not between jews/christians vs muslims, it's freemasons versus everyone.  There is a third party that is never acknowledged and that's why they win.  They've been in the dark, playing both sides against the other for centuries.  It's the globalist, fascist corporate aristocrats (freemasons or gnostics for short) and they're going to win.  Because their religion is based on spycraft, occultism, steganography, hiding, lurking and plotting; the hegelian dialectc (ie:"alchemy", "unifying opposites").  There is nothing wrong with the gnosticism philosophically--in fact it's quite interesting.  however those who practice it are vicious aristocrats who have a kind of 'divine entitlement' that makes them think that the world is theirs, it's just that "lesser brown people" are simply holding onto their resources for them.

       People have absolutely no comprehension of what's going on.  It's as if there is an invisible someone behind them that has grabbed their arm and is slapping their faces with their own hands.  But since they cannot conceive of invisible people, then they aren't there.  So they are left slapping themselves for no reason.  Then they blame the jews.  Or the ferners.  Or the blacks.  Or evangelicals.  Evertyone BUT who is responsible

       There are a lot of false Christians. Anyone who goes against the teachings of the Bible in the name of Christ is not truly Christian.

       Matthew 7:21
       <em>
