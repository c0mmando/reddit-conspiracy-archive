        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>in fact, the mental games are even MORE SERIOUS now with technology.</p>

<p>why arent serious 1984 alarm bells ringing in everyone&#39;s head? </p>

<p>why arent more people moving away from traditional politicians?</p>

<p>we need to be UP IN ARMS about this now, the MSM is hiding information that makes us look bad and lying about foreign entanglements.</p>

<p>we are being led like sheep to the slaughter. and everyones bitching about how liberal they are.</p>

<p>wtf is wrong with you world? can&#39;t we like, stop bitching about trannies and race, and work together for the common betterment of mankind and STOP THIS GLOBAL SYSTEM OF TYRANNY WHILE WE HAVE HOPE?</p>

<p>the NWO is real boys, and the time to act is now.
we can&#39;t let this media keep having such a tight grip on our minds. we can&#39;t let them take reality from us.</p>

<p>our decisions need to be based on history and reality, not popular opinion. our eyes need to be open to deception.</p>

<p>we must be willing to make compromise with the promise that in the future,  more options will be available. things will be BETTER.</p>

<p>but only if we unite against this now.</p>

<p>we&#39;ve been manipulated by foreign agents for a long time now. we are far into the plan at this point.</p>

<p>there wont be time to say no to globalism later. those fema camps are about to go full throttle active. and it will be the UN policing us, not your family. the military will not protect us.</p>

<p>they rigged this election FOR AN OBVIOUS REASON.</p>

<p>they are planning to flood immigrants in and give them legalization so they can out vote us.</p>

<p>the are PLANNING TO TAKE THE GUNS. there is PROOF they are going to lie about &#39;common sense gun legislation&#39; and go for a full grab.</p>

<p>they are manipulating the MSM to the extent where they try to control the narrative of everything.</p>

<p>all our foreign affairs are fucked up. we fucked over nations instead of helping them BECAUSE of the clintons. we went into wars for hte highest bidders.</p>

<p>this country is DONE if we keep going down this path.</p>

<p>we need to get out the old guard political class quickly. we need to slow down their plans, identify elements who have betrayed us, and prepare.</p>

<p>the final plans for globalization are very bad guys.</p>

<p>they REALLY WANT a universal &#39;communist&#39; government. not one based on mans needs but their own. there is a depopulation agenda.</p>

<p>guys im very scared. you really SHOULD BE too. this shit is getting very real, and im afraid not enough people are awake to vote against the establishments lies.</p>

<p>so many are going to vote hillary for all the wrong reasons. </p>

<p>because shes a woman, because of the lies they heard about her being a good person, because of &#39;experience&#39;</p>

<p>her foreign policy is the primary and direct cause of our wars and suffering now.</p>

<p>her new policies will fuck us even worse.</p>

<p>and after she pulls our the big black dildo from our behind, we&#39;re getting strapped into fema torture racks.</p>

<p>maybe im a bit extreme here, </p>

<p>but we really should be IRATE about these two things. the media collusion is distorting the reality and views of thousands of people in favor of a dangerous authoritarian regime of foreign interests and invaders.</p>

<p>the vote rigging is bad enough on its own. but there are CLEARLY VERY SINISTER INTENTIONS HERE.</p>

<p>if anyone in this country had half a brain, they would clearly see it. its not an election where &#39;good luck to whoever&#39;
]
everyone is saying like a robot how IMPORTANT IT IS THAT HILLARY ACHIEVE THE PRIME DIRECTIVE.</p>

<p>we can&#39;t let the prime directive happen guys. its not in our favor, im telling you.</p>

<p>the threat is real here.</p>

<p>its a code red,</p>

<p>america is about to go totalitarian.</p>

If they call you a conspiracy theorist just quickly insult them with a &quot;you&#39;re just saying that because you&#39;re ignorant.&quot; It can cause the program to lag for a second. Act quickly by questioning them with facts and you may break through their subconscious firewall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that we&#39;ve been steadily moving closer to a weird and fucked up future for a long time now right? </p>

<p>That the planet is getting warmer, and our animals are dying, and our oceans are filled with radioactive waste and plastic? </p>

<p>And that this future is a byproduct of the greed and gluttony and misdirection and distraction and outright bullshit that we&#39;ve been fed by the business owners and leaders of this world?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna go so far as to say &quot;totalitarian&quot; because I think it&#39;ll be a lot more desperate than that when the aquifers dry up, and the food trucks run out of gas.</p>

<p>and I&#39;m also not saying that it&#39;s gonna happen tomorrow, but we are certainly not all that far away... 50 years tops... if things keep trending the way they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re actually Wrong. By the way it&#39;s in the Philadelphia news channels CBS and major news station. Don&#39;t quotes snoops they&#39;re not reliable because any joblo can edit them. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-earned-zero-votes-in-some">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-earned-zero-votes-in-some</a></p>

<p>You can type in did Romney get  0 votes in Philadelphia? And you&#39;ll pull up everything look at everything else the point say yes, yet snoops is the only one that says false. The snoops post tries to rationalize why he got all the votes. There&#39;s no logical sense that 1.5 million people there&#39;s always one guy. To say all those States always support the Democrats, wrong, Democrats are spread out all over the country not just in one small little section. Snoop has been caught recently manipulating information. Every single major news Outlet agrees that the event DID  happened, but they are trying to rationalize that those states are democratic. That&#39;s a illogical. Every state has various types of groups. And Romney never did anything crazy like murder anybody, clean cut, family man,  even had a black adopted son.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look that up yourself. Its well know mostly because there articles contradict other outlets. Also snoops is not 100% legit source, that is like saying wiki is 100% legit when anyone can be edit. My point was, that snoops, CBS, philly news, etc agree with what I stated about ZERO votes for Romney but they try to rationalise it and say that the state is democratic. That is a lie man. Think about this. 1.5 million people no one voted for the guy with clean record, family man, big family and had an adopted black son so he appealed to everyone. I know people who voted for him who are from there so there is no way possible they dont count. EVery state has mixed voters even if a handful. It&#39;s statistically impossible that 1.5 million not one voted for the guy. Back than it was a big deal BUT news outlets tried to rationalise it was democratic majority. When called out, they later stated that they couldn&#39;t find his vote box (where they add votes inside). Look at the 50 states now, everyone has mixed voters. Including philly, keep in mind Romney was not like Trump all vocal and loud. He was calm which means someone would vote for him.  Look at the leaked recent emails. they show the media messing with the election process making others better than others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching a movie so I wasn&#39;t able to comment/link you. Not gonna bother anymore since you seems to discard the obvious . Here they say (you link): Claim: In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility).It’s not mathematically impossible. The 59 districts are in areas of the city that are mainly African American, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. And Obama received 93 percent of the black vote nationwide. lol  1. 5 million voters no one voted for him. Get real man, especially when I said people I knew voted for the guy, Instead, you&#39;re in denial.Your own link started to &#39;defend&#39; his vote saying it wasn&#39;t impossible. Your own article started to validate that it wasn&#39;t impossible. I know blacks who dont agree with BLM, I know Mexicans that want a wall to keep illegals out, That in itself shows that people vary.  </p>

<p>trustvote.org does a good job explaining the regular outcomes of crying &quot;election fraud&quot;</p>

<p>So this is why I eagerly await wikileaks, because that in it&#39;s creation it is solely a whistleblower for corruption.  And it reaches a much wider global audience imo.  If the offenders are brought to light, the publicity and embarrassment is almost as damning as an indictment.</p>

<p>As far as me, I am capable of anything. But that doesn&#39;t mean I just do things without a plan. And planning to rob other people is a good way to die quickly. If you really want to get it on, you should let them do the work and come to you.</p>

<p>End quote..&quot;mine vs ours.&quot; implying a situation where it&#39;s me vs you. If I have supplies already why would I come looking for yours or anyone for that matter? Other than to get my self ID&#39;d and possibly followed back to my hold out?</p>

<p>A little less reading between the lines and actual reading may help.</p>

<p>You say that till your child needs penicillin. Or one of the many other unidentifiable reasons why you would have to &quot;find&quot; your own supplies.</p>

<p>You and I both know if the SHTF all playbooks would be out the window overnight. It&#39;s will be about contingency on top of contingency and the will to do what you have to for you and yours.</p>

If an EMP weapon destroys our power grid, if a dollar crash leaves all the grocery stores empty overnight, if violent gangs patrol the countryside raiding preppers&#39; houses because the police departments went out of business - how hard do you think it will be to herd people into camps if the camps have food and water? How many people do you think will complain if there&#39;s a safe zone declared around each camp that&#39;s swarming with militarized police? Might as well just release the bird flu into the wild and hand out vaccinations on site while we&#39;re at it. You think people are too distracted to wake up in present day?

    <div class="md"><p>I think history shows that military will willingly enslave, imprison and execute its  population if required to do so. Sure, there will be a number who will balk at such measures, but they won&#39;t even constitute a minority, just a fringe.</p>

<p>Add to that the layers of unique &quot;problems&quot; the U.S. and, specifically, its military has and it becomes even more probable that  the military will oppose the people.</p>

<p>The US military is full of disclaimer-americans. African-, Mexican-, Chinese-, Italian-, etc etc, you get the idea Americans. Those people are Africans/Mexicans before they are Americans.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think it absurd that a kid gets told to remove his American flag on his bike. But that happened.</p>

<p>&quot;A California school has done a U-turn after it forced a student to remove an American flag attached to his bike, saying the Stars and Stripes could spur racial tensions on campus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[...] citing complaints from other students.&quot;</p>

<p>If we do have a full breakdown/fall out this country is going to spread into racial/cultural divisions. Whites, Blacks, Mexicans, Asians.</p>

<p>Nobody is putting American ahead of themselves or their identities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, its real all right.</p>

<p>Our country is literally hanging by a thread and if and when it breaks all hell will come forth.</p>

<p>Should have had your parents put you in Cub and Boy Scouts. It&#39;s a prepping 101 college course. With a motto like &quot;Always be prepared&quot; I&#39;m not sure a prepper couldn&#39;t find a better home at a young age. Hell it takes the average scout 13 years to compete the whole thing. More if you become Eagle and make a carrier out of it.</p>

<p>So in short find your nearest retired scout. If that&#39;s not an option your second best bet is to buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Scouts-Handbook-America/dp/1619491796">Boy Scouts Handbook</a> so you have a hard copy. For now you can always source the PDF version <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/HealthandSafety/GSS/toc.aspx">here</a>. They do allow you to print straight off the site.</p>

<p>People will recommended all kinds of first steps into the prepping world but if you don&#39;t know the basics of survival your just someones Christmas present waiting to be opened.</p>

<p>Ex-Mil are good teachers also depending on their MOS but the majority of Ex-Mil are not survivalist in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Example; General purpose troops are taught the basics of compass and map use. A scout can do the same just by looking at the position of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and natural formations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I link the wrong one? It&#39;s literally over 300 pages of outdoor survival knowledge. From making knots to making clothes out of bark.</p>

<p>&quot;The &quot;Boy Scout Handbook&quot; is a manual providing information about camping, signs and signaling, Scouting games, and more. The original edition of the guide owes much to Baden-Powell&#39;s &quot;Scouting for Boys.&quot; The official handbook of the Boy Scouts of America, this volume contains everything the young Scout must learn to become a &quot;well-developed, well-informed boy.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/boy-scouts-handbook-boy-scouts-of-america/1018194084?ean=9781619491793&amp;amp;st=PLA&amp;amp;sid=BNB_DRS_Core+Shopping+Books_00000000&amp;amp;2sid=Google_&amp;amp;sourceId=PLGoP648&amp;amp;k_clickid=3x648">Here&#39;s it at Nobles</a></p>

<p>Unless they have had a drastic change in content in the last decade it&#39;s the best single book for survival. Literally a guide so simplistic a child could understand it...</p>

<p>I put stars(*) next to some of the basics everyone should know. Always check the Table of Contents if you want a ruff guide on the content of a book.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not listed in the contents but it even covers gunshot wounds and much, much more. Again I highly recommend it for anyone even avid outdoors men. Were talking ruffly 106 years worth of scouting knowledge packed into a hand sized book.</p>

<p>And believe it or not but your conduct and behavior will decide whether you survive or not in a life and death situation. I consider that to be very important.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s no &quot;human rights&quot; in the wild. Knowing how to play well with others (knowing your place) is just as important to your survival.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long answer?</p>

<p>Because 1984 and Brave New World are real. People are drowning in irrelevance, entertainment, and info-tainment. Pop-culture has shifted to a state that promotes nothing above consumerism, and pays no mind to ambition. It is narcissism incarnate. A never ending, raging river of bread and circuses.</p>

<p>Short answer?</p>

<p>Pokemon Go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you disseminate real, factual information to people who have no idea what&#39;s going on without being called a lunatic and immediately dismissed? Because posting it on your Facebook or Twitter isn&#39;t gonna work; they&#39;re part of the problem. </p>

<p>Do you have living room interventions with friends and family? It&#39;s one thing to show them bills like the TPP and the NDAA and explain how we&#39;re fucked because of them; those are on .gov websites. But how do you rightly and calmly explain even half of what you just said? Which, we must admit, is mostly speculation, but not out of the realm of possibility either. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to, for example, tell people to look up at the sky and take notice of the obvious geoengineering going on. Do they care? Nah. They dismiss it and don&#39;t think twice to even research it on their own. And when you show them a list of weather modification patents you get a &quot;Huh, that&#39;s interesting. Hey, what&#39;s the score of the game?&quot; Try explaining GMOs to these same people. Or vaccines. Or water fluoridation. Or the historical concept and precedent of a false flag event. And this is just surface-level, introductory shit that&#39;s easily researchable, yet even the people close to you (or close to me anyway) don&#39;t take you seriously.</p>

<p>Has the systematic brainwashing and indoctrination really been that effective? Or are we our own victims of confirmation bias? Are we overreaching, overreacting? Do we WANT this to happen for whatever reason and are therefore collectively manifesting it into reality? Or is something sinister, some massive conspiracy of men, really afoot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my theory is that rome either created christianity or lied about the real story behind jesus to have a theocratic control instead of the republic, then intentionally destroyed all human knowledge  in the great libraries and killed the professors and educated class,</p>

<p>they created the dark ages, and all the secret socieites and groups broke off from them. the hoarded wealth and influenced nations.</p>

<p>they are the illuminati. they plan to use man for his technological achievements then exterminate us and combine themselves with machines and computers to become godlike and live forever.</p>

<p>they dont realize we are part of god and they wont be able to exist anymore once we all become one again,</p>

<p>they believed the lie, that knowledge of all things gained from both good and evil could make them gods</p>

<p>we&#39;re at the end of evil, and we have the technology , or at least will once human rights go bye bye</p>

<p>they want a perfect future society for themselves who they view as having superior genes, and perhaps they follow the same eugenics goals of hitler and the occult, to revive the &#39;supermen&#39; through eugenics experiments. for this they require control of humanity in order to not be resisted, and control of all resources to keep us slaves</p>

<p>I imagine something like this. But I don&#39;t know if there is much you can do except for &quot;common sense&quot;  stuff.. </p>

<p>I just watched a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/suki_kim_this_is_what_it_s_like_to_go_undercover_in_north_korea">video</a> teacher who went to N. Korea, and describes their personality cult. It seems extreme, and the dissonance seems wearing to them, but overall it seems like a more primitive and overt version of some of the systems of control we use in the US. </p>

<p>What I think was destroyed was accurate knowledge of our past and the, essences perhaps, of certain sciences and forms of knowledge. Volney describes something like this in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1397/1397-h/1397-h.htm">Ruins</a>  Civilizations, and includes that each passing of these knowledge essentially degraded them in some ways. </p>

<p>What else was hidden was information about the human spirit. I think the Western world only appreciates it in veiled form while on the eastern hemisphere, in certain parts at least, it is acknowledged more openly. This is regarding the Serpent, Caduceus, or Kundalini.. </p>

<p>So maybe the age changing had to do with the focus of worship? Needing a hierarchical control system vs being self sufficient and basically in tune with the environment. Pisces to Aquarius?</p>

<p>If so I think the battle will be more so spiritual, and require any skills one possesses or subtle abilities that may prove useful.. </p>

<p>Exactly. It needs to end.</p>

<p>Please source. Off the top of my head, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam and the continuation of the Israel-Palestine conflict would indicate otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are biased in favor of a past that never existed.</p>

<p>Are you saying what we&#39;ve been taught is a lie?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the fact is that humans have never enjoyed as much peace as we have today.</p>

<p>Um, nothing...</p>

<p>No, I was trying to determine the depth and breadth of how AutoMod determines which links are &#39;good&#39; and which require an automated response. I&#39;ve determined that it gets lazy when you break a link down in interesting ways, and there are a few ways to place a <a href="http://www.%5C">www.\</a> \ <a href="https://ww%57.reddit.com/r/conspiracy"> [] </a>. reddit link, so that AutoMod doesn&#39;t care.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure AutoMod is open source, but it&#39;s kind of fun (to me) to try to derive that information through testing out a &quot;black box.&quot;</p>

<p>I apologize for shitting up the thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it didn&#39;t remove them, but check out <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4v4ml0/why_arent_people_more_up_in_arms_about_not_only/d5vzj2e">this</a></p>

<p>Notice the 2 hyperlinks after Click... those <em>should</em> have triggered a response from AutoMod... but they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.2600.com">Click</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4v4ml0/why_arent_people_more_up_in_arms_about_not_only/d5vzj2e"> </a>

<p>And again. It seems to get confused when I specify a valid ftp site, with actual printable characters, followed by at least 2 hyperlinks, where the last hyperlink overwrites the first, or vice versa.</p>

<p>It also &#39;hates&#39; (ignores) when you specify a non NP link for every single letter of an NP link. I determined that yesterday when it began triggering not on the links I was putting in, but the text I specify for the links. That tells me it doesn&#39;t actually attempt to go to the site you link (Which is a good practice, for this bot.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am new to this sub Reddit and just started going down some of these rabbit holes but I have had many similar thoughts. Here is my &quot;Why no one is doing anything&quot; thoughts.</p>

<p>What better way to keep the populous looking the wrong way than having the &quot;Us vs Them&quot; mentality that is american politics. Couple that with the never ending grind to just exist in this society and most people have to outsource their action/political thought just to provide a roof and food for their family.</p>

<p>This is why the two party system is so powerful for the ruling parties. You are taught from a young age that its Republicans and Democrats. And once you choose your party you start to believe that party x has my best interest at heart and since I don&#39;t have the time to thoroughly and completely investigate the issues on my own I have to rely on the people whose beliefs, supposedly, most match my own. If they say the other person is evil, then they must be.</p>

<p>Now, you take Facebook and all these stupid Memes that just enforce flawed logic but looks correct on the surface and everyone is just spouting ignorance left and right and start to really hold onto those stupid little sayings.</p>

<p>I honestly think, one on one, most people are very close to the center. But everyone on the right thinks everyone the left are extremists and vice versa. And they use those extreme examples to argue with each other while politicians are laughing at us living the good life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America IS totalitarian, and it has been ushered in by the people, particularly liberals. But everyone is guilty. There is a lack of objective concern for the country and many people believe it exists to be robbed and pillaged and that it owes them. That&#39;s why liberals are burning the flags at the DNC, with pink hair and ridiculous ideas. Kill babies, be gay, women are in charge and black people are gods. Give me welfare because we hate big government. </p>

<p>And so the country is collapsing.</p>

<p>The reason people aren&#39;t up in arms is that there are factions that actually urge and support this behavior and it can&#39;t/won&#39;t be solved politically. The country will collapse or be thinned out.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not extreme. When this country was founded we would have already been long past the point of political discussion.</p>

<p>This is worth a read:
<a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Wells_New_World_Order.pdf">New World Order by H.G. Wells</a></p>

<p>&quot;The task of the peace-maker who really desires peace in a new world, involves not merely a political but a profound social revolution, profounder even than the revolution attempted by the Communists in Russia. The Russian Revolution failed not by its extremism but through the impatience, violence and intolerance of its onset, through lack of foresight and intellectual insufficiency. The cosmopolitan revolution to a world collectivism, which is the only alternative to chaos and degeneration before mankind, has to go much further than the Russian; it has to be more thorough and better conceived and its achievement demands a much more heroic and more steadfast thrust.&quot;</p>

He&#39;s tried to do a lot to help small business owners too. America is not about to go totalitarian. Gun control is for liberals what anti-abortion and anti gay marriage is for republicans; distractions.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not voting for Hillary, I think she&#39;s a war hawk and fake as American Cheese... that&#39;s not the point. There is no plan for a mass communist style world government. There is zero incentive to do this. This country has spent the better part of the last century killing to prevent any communism let alone colluding to create a communist NWO. There&#39;s easier cost effective ways of handling overpopulation that don&#39;t involve genocide or mass government intervention, although cooperation for sure. Examples like women being able to gain an education drastically reduce birth rates in nations, having access to medical facilities, not destroying the environment, not existing day to day in poverty, etc. The Gates Foundation spends billions literally trying to achieve this goal amongst many others, that is, population control. </p>

<p>Eugenics was popular 80 years ago and it&#39;s rightfully scorned today for obvious reasons. You can say what you want about all these mega wealthy people you believe are behind what you claim but the truth is, when they get old, they&#39;re quite aware that money is useless. What do people like that want most when they&#39;re getting older? They want to live on; they want a legacy, they want to be remembered. Philanthropy is what most if not all of these families focus on; you can call it a guilty conscious or you can see that it&#39;s people that know wealth is worthless unless you use it and the best way to do that is through philanthropy. I agree with you on Hillary but respectfully disagree with you on your other points. The inevitability is that we&#39;re probably going to become more unified kind of like a star trek like verse. You cannot fight globalism, not in todays world. There&#39;s no reason to force it, it will gradually happen in the next couple hundred with who knows what kind of unfathomable scientific breakthroughs mankind stumbles upon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.unique-design.net/library/image/emergency/diversity.jpg">The television networks have been owned and operated by the same corporate plutocracy since WWII.</a> Even before then with the Federal Reserve, and the same corporations that helped <a href="https://youtu.be/3sCpsq55uic">facilitate the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany into existence</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/henry-ford-receiving-grand-cross-german-eagle-nazi-officials-1938/">(Also: Note this)</a></p>

<p>This is the crust of the upper echelon of all society you are seeing now, for what it truly is. The &#39;cabal of control&#39;. There&#39;s lots of name for it - illuminati, NWO, Reptilians, etc. - but it doesn&#39;t matter which between them. It is what it is: &quot;The ruling class&quot;. If you&#39;re an American like I am, welcome to the epicenter of the whole world&#39;s most corrupt collusions!</p>

<p>They have always acted this way. They have always used the media as a grafting weapon for control. They have always lied to our faces and propped up useful idiots in our government while rich nepotists have pulled the strings behind the curtain. The U.S.A. is no different in this procedure of political corruption; it&#39;s basically a right of passage for all nations in the world.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really happening is your awakening to it. The internet has created a free and open space of resonance for common people to track and investigate the actions of the upper echelon. We can see what they&#39;re doing now to an extent that was never available to the middle class before. The whole world is waking up to the corruption that exists inside of the state right now because the tools to freely educate people without restriction have been unleashed. We see everything with the internet now. They thought that they could control us because of that. They thought the scrutiny would only go one way and they could enslave us with it. Instead of that, now, we have the opposite effect. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s only a matter of time before we topple the NWO paradigm here in America and the corporatist machine backing. Everyone during this election is beginning to collectively &#39;wake up&#39; and see all the grafting that&#39;s happening like never before. I&#39;m actually very optimistic about the degree and measure of all the corruption that has been exposed this summer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, its real all right.</p>

<p>Our country is literally hanging by a thread and if and when it breaks all hell will come forth.</p>

<p>Should have had your parents put you in Cub and Boy Scouts. It&#39;s a prepping 101 college course. With a motto like &quot;Always be prepared&quot; I&#39;m not sure a prepper couldn&#39;t find a better home at a young age. Hell it takes the average scout 13 years to compete the whole thing. More if you become Eagle and make a carrier out of it.</p>

<p>So in short find your nearest retired scout. If that&#39;s not an option your second best bet is to buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Scouts-Handbook-America/dp/1619491796">Boy Scouts Handbook</a> so you have a hard copy. For now you can always source the PDF version <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/HealthandSafety/GSS/toc.aspx">here</a>. They do allow you to print straight off the site.</p>

<p>People will recommended all kinds of first steps into the prepping world but if you don&#39;t know the basics of survival your just someones Christmas present waiting to be opened.</p>

<p>Ex-Mil are good teachers also depending on their MOS but the majority of Ex-Mil are not survivalist in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Example; General purpose troops are taught the basics of compass and map use. A scout can do the same just by looking at the position of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and natural formations. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-earned-zero-votes-in-some">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-earned-zero-votes-in-some</a></p>

<p>You can type in did Romney get  0 votes in Philadelphia? And you&#39;ll pull up everything look at everything else the point say yes, yet snoops is the only one that says false. The snoops post tries to rationalize why he got all the votes. There&#39;s no logical sense that 1.5 million people there&#39;s always one guy. To say all those States always support the Democrats, wrong, Democrats are spread out all over the country not just in one small little section. Snoop has been caught recently manipulating information. Every single major news Outlet agrees that the event DID  happened, but they are trying to rationalize that those states are democratic. That&#39;s a illogical. Every state has various types of groups. And Romney never did anything crazy like murder anybody, clean cut, family man,  even had a black adopted son.</p>
