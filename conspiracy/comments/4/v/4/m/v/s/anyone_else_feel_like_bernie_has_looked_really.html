    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I normally take things like &quot;I now have proof Facebook/Google/iPhones/My Nav in my car is spying directly on us because of something I talked about&quot; with a grain of salt, simply because as a programmer, I understand how something can appear that way at times, but really be the result of something understandable... For example, say you are watching a movie you normally wouldn&#39;t take the time to watch, but it happened to be on HBO and you just left the channel on as you aere flipping through. Then you decide you want to know he name of a song playing in the movie and you pull up google, and you get two letters deep before it pulls up th exact move and song reference... Creepy right? It seems like it was listening... But you don&#39;t realize you are watching that movie with millions of others and some significant percentage of those people also want to know about that song an and also go to Google for it. It wasn&#39;t listening, it was just throwing out an option that has spiked in searches in the last 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have dug into a few things about CTR and HBGARY in the last few days and really starting to grasp how &quot;in on it&quot; Reddit and all of social media is, and how you really can&#39;t trust 90% of &quot;comments&quot; from &quot;users&quot; anymore, because the bot armies are absolutely real, and not even a secret anymore, even though the bot armies will cry &quot;kooky conspiracy theorist&quot; immediately because it&#39;s known &quot;branding term&quot; like &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;rapist&quot; or &quot;homo/islamo/transphobe&quot;.</p>

<p>I went to this link for the picture of bernie and tried to save it to my phone in case it gets wiped out. I use alienblue still, and save photos all the time. This one failed repeatedly. Not of space, not a bad connection or some bull crap, not a lack of permissions... But it wouldn&#39;t give me the photo. I opened it in safari and it saved right away.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to save another different photo in a minute to test it, but it&#39;s creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also worked in marketing, and I can tell you, as of about 6 months ago, they track all sorts of crap but they aren&#39;t listening to you for ad purposes. They barely know what to do with what they have already. the analytics involved to deem something useful, then to write the software to automate it.</p>

<p>Even if they did record you all the time, what would they hear? Muffled, unnormalized bits of useless conversation that they are somehow going to spend however much it costs on however many computing cycles to try to transcribe what you are talking about in hopes you clearly stated something &quot;they&quot; could market to you? Has apple made some huge middle man ad company contracts lately or something? If they wanted to record your camera all the time, the&#39;d just see the inside of your pocket most of the time and then your blank face as you take a dump.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, just hit record on a memo and stuff your phone in your pocket and walk around.</p>

<p>Your phone has to be listening all the time to use siri or ok google or whatever, and that&#39;s still only listening for a trigger phrase. I had an app that was supposed to be always recording so i could have a 3 minute &quot;instant replay&quot; type of thing, and it sucked terribly.</p>

<p>Unless you are a pretty high level target on some alphabet soup agency&#39;s most wanted list, no one is bothering with listening to you.</p>

<p>The danger lies in the fact that all smart phones have a set of firmware for your ios or android operating system, and then a second set of firmware that controls everything about your phone that used to be handled by your nokia.</p>

<p>This is dangerous for a few reasons: you CAN remotely &quot;call and answer&quot; with out notifying the os for eves dropping, and I believe there&#39;s a way to snap photos. You can redirect phone calls and messages and all that. This happens through remote commands from the cell station and is implicitly trusted... It works on the assumption that ANY command sent from a cell tower will be legit.</p>

<p>Over the years, these proprietary firmware implementations, which are carrier specific, have been bought and sold and poorly maintained and documented, so really the only people that MIGHT be experts are hackers and government agencies.</p>

<p>On top of that, the ability to obtain a small cell tower has increase for individuals, and the &quot;stingray&quot; device is essentially based on this.</p>

<p>So, to have someone nefariously listen into your conversation using your phone, they would have to spoof the network (meaning your device wouldn&#39;t be able to truly connect) in the hopes that you might say something worth a damn.</p>

<p>So lighten up on the &quot;all the time&quot; thing because you probably don&#39;t say anything useful for ads, and you aren&#39;t important enough for the government to want to bother. You tell ad companies more by using the same google id on your phone, table and pc at the same time (they bump the prices up if you are on mobile because stats show you&#39;ll spend more).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the shills, crt bots and all of that on principal, but I must say it is a bit satisfying... Months ago I could just tell some things were off and I called out in a few posts and comments that I thought that there were sock puppets en masse manipulating the message for clinton, and that it was either trump or clinton &quot;agents&quot; in Chicago when the violence went down at the trump rally...i mean what protestors whats cause trouble and then mindlessly chant &quot;bernie&quot;? Sounded more like they wanted people to &quot;know&quot; who started the trouble. I got so much hate. I don&#39;t get too fringe about most things anymore because I have found a lot of stuff to just sort of have some kind of more reasonable explanation that even negates the &quot;coincidence&quot; perception, and too much woo woo crap takes away credibility from the true conspiracies going on. But this shit is real. I googled CRT the other day and found an article from April about the actual CRT PAC spending $1mil towards &quot;pushing back&quot; on reddit. The HBGary place had put a bit towards making an astroturfing narrative controller for the freaking US government, but the contract when to a different company... So HRC is using them. And it&#39;s bullshit because people online can totally spot it, but it&#39;s not for that...it&#39;s so the logs are full of the narrative and the MSM and report about thousands of comments.</p>

<p>But when the theater&#39;s empty and shit doesn&#39;t add up...well, I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s being handled because I don&#39;t have cable or anything like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a person like Bernie, but without children, grandchildren, spouse, parents... an untouchable. Also with some sort of &quot;killswitch&quot;: where, in the event of an emergency (e.g. being assassinated) this person can press a button and have a tweet or something immediately go out saying that they&#39;re being assassinated. Death would be well worth the price if it means exposing the corruption. An audio feed would be even better.</p>

<p>Then again these types of people aren&#39;t afraid to assassinate someone right out in the open with a coverup story. Sigh. There has to be a way, we just need the good guys to have some tricks up their sleeves too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve called out a number of Hillary supporters with fact/links in debates on various subs, and they never reply to the links, instead they disappear. Its true, there is zero critical thought there.</p>

<p>I just watched a video yesterday of women being asked who they will vote for and they were saying Hillary, and when asked why and what their favorite policy of hers is, they couldn&#39;t even answer the question and instead redirected into her being a woman and first woman president.</p>

<p>Really? That&#39;s woman&#39;s logic for voting for her is that she is a woman and that&#39;s their number 1 reason? That is such a massive reality disconnect, misogynist, and complete 100% lack of logic...its scary that we allow these sorts of people to vote.</p>

<p>Which brings up my next point, why are morons allowed to vote is beyond me. It is like asking a 4 year old about calculus </p>

<p>It was a little odd. </p>

<p>I could see the gash on his cheek still....and I&#39;m not saying I believe that an incident went down, but like many here I wouldn&#39;t write it off as impossible.....in the same way that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they had kicked off some sort of false flag in Vermont to completely fuck up his game. </p>

He claimed that it was the DNCs way to control the college voter block but they didn&#39;t realize how big and how much momentum that block would be. Which would explain why he didn&#39;t put up much of a fight even after finding out that they screwed him out of the nomination. Those emails showed his team negotiating use of the DNC private jet for her endorsement as well. Not to mention all that money he raised now goes to Hillary. Just some food for thought. </p>

Why would he have gotten beat up for doing exactly what he said he was gonna do? I do not like the outcome one bit but she won, not fairly or squarely by any means but she won and if Bernie did anything different than what he said he was going to do, then I would be very disappointed in his word. I believe he did his best with what he can and he will still fight for everyone of us. Bernie was never in this to gain anything for himself. Bernie has always been about the people in every choice he makes, good or bad. He never cowered. He is, in every aspect, a true American hero in my book. And I don&#39;t like anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I normally take things like &quot;I now have proof Facebook/Google/iPhones/My Nav in my car is spying directly on us because of something I talked about&quot; with a grain of salt, simply because as a programmer, I understand how something can appear that way at times, but really be the result of something understandable... For example, say you are watching a movie you normally wouldn&#39;t take the time to watch, but it happened to be on HBO and you just left the channel on as you aere flipping through. Then you decide you want to know he name of a song playing in the movie and you pull up google, and you get two letters deep before it pulls up th exact move and song reference... Creepy right? It seems like it was listening... But you don&#39;t realize you are watching that movie with millions of others and some significant percentage of those people also want to know about that song an and also go to Google for it. It wasn&#39;t listening, it was just throwing out an option that has spiked in searches in the last 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have dug into a few things about CTR and HBGARY in the last few days and really starting to grasp how &quot;in on it&quot; Reddit and all of social media is, and how you really can&#39;t trust 90% of &quot;comments&quot; from &quot;users&quot; anymore, because the bot armies are absolutely real, and not even a secret anymore, even though the bot armies will cry &quot;kooky conspiracy theorist&quot; immediately because it&#39;s known &quot;branding term&quot; like &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;rapist&quot; or &quot;homo/islamo/transphobe&quot;.</p>

<p>I went to this link for the picture of bernie and tried to save it to my phone in case it gets wiped out. I use alienblue still, and save photos all the time. This one failed repeatedly. Not of space, not a bad connection or some bull crap, not a lack of permissions... But it wouldn&#39;t give me the photo. I opened it in safari and it saved right away.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to save another different photo in a minute to test it, but it&#39;s creepy.</p>
