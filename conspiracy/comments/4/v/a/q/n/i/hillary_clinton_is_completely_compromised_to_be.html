        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It doesn&#39;t even matter if it was the Russians, or the Chinese, or the North Koreans. Our enemies have the &quot;smoking guns&quot; to blackmail Hillary while she is President. The media is spinning the story to make it appear that the Russians want Trump to win. On the contrary, The Russians and our enemies want HRC to be President. Then they can blackmail her, because they have the 30,000 e-mails she illegally deleted which will include her involvement while SOS with the Criminal enterprise known as The Clinton Foundation, and 
her giving up of top secret information to our enemies by using her unsecured, private, basement server. The country is completely screwed if HRC becomes President. The F.B.I. knew this during the investigation, but James Comey was told to stand down and not press charges even though the evidence they had was overwhelming to indict her on multiple charges. Bill Clinton&#39;s &quot;Unplanned&quot; (/s) meeting with Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, was a not so subtle signal to investigative journalists and any potential enemies. &quot;Mess with Hillary or I, and we have the power to ruin or take your life.&quot; Bill Clinton is more powerful than any Mafia Boss.</p>

The NSA has more blackmail material on our politicians than Russia or China. Maybe you should look less outward and more inward, in regards to &quot;enemies&quot;. </p>
