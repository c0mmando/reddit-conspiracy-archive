        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was watching the Prime Minister of the UK lambasting Jeremy Corban for paying too much tax and looking sheepish WHILE making such an odd accusation, and while watching Hillary blatently refuse to answer about the transcripts and her incredibly idiotic responses to the question of the emails, making herself out to be a fuddy duddy... with access to information for the public at all time high it seems the new method of control now is with the public face of the shadow government being that of seemingly inept, fuddy duddy idiots. The public will froth at the mouth, pulling their hair out trying to figure why and how such important roles are given to such silly idiots, and while the pundits scoff and the public pat themselves on the back, how wonderfully smart they are and dumb politicians are... the status quo continues.</p>

<p>Now it is no longer corruption. It is always accidents and idiocy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Incompetence theory&quot;.  &quot;Mistakes&quot; and &quot;misadventures&quot; in the Middle East. It&#39;s all bullshit. How many terror groups have been fortified through our alleged bumbling? The mujahideen armed by &quot;accident&quot;. Then the Taliban. Then Al Qaeda. Then ISIS. How many countries in the Middle East have been routed so far in the wake of 9/11 that had nothing to do with it?</p>

<p>They would have us believe that the most powerful individuals on the planet, surrounded and advised by the most intelligent, experienced and highly educated of us are stringing together catastrophic failures because the truth is too unpalatable.</p>
