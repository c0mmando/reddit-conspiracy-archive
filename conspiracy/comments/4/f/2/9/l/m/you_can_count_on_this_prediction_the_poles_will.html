        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The more you search for the truth the more that fears like these will be pushed on you. Fear no more. While most conspiracies discussed here are &quot;cold-cases&quot;, requiring interpretation of historical evidence within context, many of these conspiracies are concerning the nature of physical reality, and can be confirmed or debunked with independently reproducible observation. <a href="https://imgur.com/CMHjKsq">Heliocentrism</a> is indeed a scary religion full of demons, but the independently verifiable truth is that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PyaY8gn.jpg">the Earth is flat</a>.</p>

<p>The problem with believing in spinning balls in outer space is that all the evidence comes solely from government military space agencies, members of the same governments which have lied about virtually everything while committing mass murder and atrocity. As a truth seeking community, we learned not to trust NIST from their fraudulent WTC 7 report; we learned not to trust the FDA from their defense of GMOs; we learned not to trust the CDC for their promotion of vaccines. Unfortunately, so many people still blindly trust NASA, a military organization <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/45f6xw/do_you_trust_nasa/czxdbxs">directed by the US Department of Defense</a> which uses national security to classify its information.</p>

<p>This is driving towards a salient point best described by critic and polemicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>: &quot;In the Middle Ages people believed that the earth was flat, <em>for which they had at least the evidence of their senses</em>: we believe it to be round, not because as many as one per cent of us could give the physical reasons for so quaint a belief, but because <em>modern science has convinced us that nothing that is obvious is true</em>, and that everything that is magical, improbable, extraordinary, gigantic, microscopic, heartless, or outrageous is scientific.&quot;</p>

<p>The easiest way out of the entire deception is discovering that there is no independently verifiable proof of either curvature or rotation of the Earth. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIvu9k08n2s">Here</a> is what two teams of students found when their hot air balloon camera reached over 100,000 feet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDs2T2PgxNM">Here</a> is another high altitude amateur balloon flight which reached 75,000 feet and also found no evidence for curve or spin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMc_KwXppzY">Here</a> is the Superdome seen from 26.55 miles away, even though the view should be hidden by 387 feet of curvature. If you&#39;re ready for more, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3m7j90/what_is_the_actual_shape_of_the_earth/">here</a> is a basic primer full of information on many more of the endless proofs. And finally here are <a href="https://youtu.be/zuBVCmC0ACM">12 simple questions heliocentrists can&#39;t answer</a>, with a bonus of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfBcZXD7aQttlFtmVkrsMwM2ZEPWXZxYf">more than 70 videos</a> explaining the Flat Earth truth.</p>

<p>Although there would be no reason to bring it up, Flat Earth is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4dmwo4/if_flat_earth_is_a_psyop_why_dont_i_see_hipsters/">regularly disparaged</a> by mainstream propagandists ranging from politicians to celebrity scientists to journalists. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4cwq6a/here_is_another_example_from_rall_of_the/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/47p61d/whats_happened_to_rconspiracy_100_points_for_an/">/r/conspiracy itself</a> have joined in on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4egukn/the_more_people_find_the_truth_the_worse_the/">the circlejerk</a> as well. Even Cartoon Network, a children&#39;s television channel which often features <a href="https://imgur.com/illrXJ1">occult/Masonic symbolism</a>, has seemingly out of nowhere <a href="https://imgur.com/iZXEZzJ">attacked the Flat Earth truth</a>.</p>

<p>The truth is that it is easy to create <a href="http://imgur.com/a/s3HzE">fake space photos</a>, and there are <a href="https://imgur.com/hVomdGT">many</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/yMpDmXj">simple</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/An220UT">proofs</a> that NASA is lying to you. The moon landings were a combination of 
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mh2an.gif">front-screen projection</a> and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/D65Ke">1960s film props</a>. The Lunar Lander, a supposed $6 billion hallmark of American engineering, was in truth <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xdooJ">made out of cardboard paper, a few old curtain rods, a roll of roofing paper, some floodlight holders, gold foil, and lots of scotch tape</a>. It&#39;s much easier to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cezBVZzdN50">what&#39;s actually happening</a> in the moon landing footage when you play it back at the correct speed, just as it&#39;s much easier to see what you&#39;re looking at in the Mars photos when you <a href="https://imgur.com/5LAYehx">adjust the white-balance</a>. As high priest Carl Sagan once said, &quot;Once you give a <a href="https://imgur.com/ghSgbn5">charlatan</a> power over you, you almost never get it back.&quot;</p>

<p>And just in case you were wondering how any of this connects to the real world, with all of the constant warfare and exploitation, do you remember when they created a one-world government, put the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection_SW.jpg">Flat Earth map</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_Nations#/media/File:Flag_of_the_United_Nations.svg">its flag</a>, and divided it into 33 sub-sections? These are the people who believe they own you. These are the people who want you to live your life in fear of aliens, asteroids, satellites, and pole shifts. Maybe you should ask yourself why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take that bet...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poles will never shift.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. The poles are constantly shifting which is why maps have to be updated regularly to show the difference between true north and magnetic north.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The North Magnetic Pole moves over time due to magnetic changes in the Earth&#39;s core.[1] In 2001, it was determined by the Geological Survey of Canada to lie near Ellesmere Island in northern Canada at 81.3°N 110.8°W. It was situated at 83.1°N 117.8°W in 2005. In 2009, while still situated within the Canadian Arctic territorial claim at 84.9°N 131.0°W,[2] it was moving toward Russia at between 55 and 60 kilometres (34 and 37 mi) per year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole</a></p>

<p>You lose that round.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there will never be a cataclysmic asteroid impact</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been many asteroid impacts, including &quot;cataclysmic&quot;
impacts. We have both physical evidence on the earth&#39;s surface, and evidence of such impacts on the moon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The high-speed impact of a wayward space rock on the surface of the moon last year triggered the brightest lunar explosion ever seen, scientists say.</p>

<p>Video footage of the record-breaking meteorite strike on the moon, which occurred on Sept. 11, 2013 and was unveiled today (Feb. 24), shows a long flash that was almost as bright as the North Star Polaris. That means the boulder-sized meteorite&#39;s lunar crash could have been visible to anyone on Earth who happened to be staring up at the moon at 8:07 p.m. GMT, weather permitting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You lose round two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there will never be an alien invasion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ll have to call that one a draw, as &quot;never&quot; is a very long time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there will never be weaponized satellites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Soviet Union&#39;s Fractional Orbital Bombardment System completes a partial orbit in space, before re-entering the earth&#39;s atmosphere to strike its target. That means it is a &quot;weaponised satellite&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Fractional Orbital Bombardment System[1] (FOBS) was a Soviet ICBM program in the 1960s that after launch would go into a low Earth orbit and would then de-orbit for an attack. It had no range limit and the orbital flight path would not reveal the target location. This would allow a path to North America over the South Pole, hitting targets from the south, which is the opposite direction from which NORAD early warning systems are oriented.</p>

<p>The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 banned nuclear weapons in Earth orbit. It did not ban the launch systems, so the Soviet Union proceeded to test their FOBS albeit without placing nuclear warheads in orbit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You lose round three. Three wins and a draw for me.</p>

<p>What&#39;s my prize? If I get to choose, I will take &quot;You stop posting this crap&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you have moved the main point of your posts away from claiming flat earth and are instead focusing more on showing problems with the official cosmology and claims of NASA.</p>

<p>&quot;Flat earth&quot; at this point is a weaponized term.  Whether the earth is flat or not, I think you have to agree that over the past year there has been a surge in visible proponents of flat earth.  Many of those proponents have acted like clowns and, in my view, appear to have intentionally tried to discredit the idea.  </p>

<p>Obviously the credibility of a proponent of an idea has no direct bearing on the validity of an idea.  It is the merits of the idea itself that are important.  But many people cannot think that far.  &quot;Flat Earth&quot; is tainted.  So I think you will have more success making people realize there is something solid to your arguments by making posts that point out errors in the official narrative.</p>

<p>For yourself though, are you sure that flat is correct?  Any visual observations we make must be made in the context of how light behaves in the atmosphere.  When we look across water to the horizon we are interpreting the image assuming straight light.  But there are experiments that can demonstrate that light does not travel in straight lines within the atmosphere.  It bends upwards, so what you see as straight in front of you is above you.  </p>

<p>Infrared light does not bend the same way visible light does.  From Martin Gardner&#39;s &quot;In the Name of Science&quot; (1952)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s April of the year 1942. Germany sacrificed all its forces for war. Nothing, it seems, can distract the
technicians, the scholars and the generals from their immediate task. And yet a mysterious expedition
leaves the mainland with the approval of Goering, Himmler and Hitler. The members of this research
group are some of the best German radar specialists.</p>

<p>Under the leadership of Dr. Heinz Fischer, who won fame with his work on infrared rays, they land on the
island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea. They are equipped with the most accomplished radars. What is more,
there are only a few of these devices at this time and they are needed especially at the critical points of the
German defense. The observations, however, that need to be adressed on the island of Rügen, are considered
indispensable by the General Staff of the Navy for the offensive, which Hitler prepared on all fronts.</p>

<p>No sooner have they landed, than Dr. Fischer has the devices set pointing at the sky at an angle of 45 degrees.
In the chosen direction, however, obviously nothing is to discover. The other members of the expedition believe
that this was just a test. The purpose of the investigation is to be communicated to them later on.
They note with surprise, that the radars remain in the same position for several days.
But then comes the explanation:</p>

<p>The Führer has good reason to suppose that the earth is not convex but concave.</p>

<p>We do not dwell on the earth, but inside and are thus comparable to flies, moving over the inner surface of a
glass ball. The expedition had received the order to provide scientific proof of this truth. By the reflection of radar
waves, which propagate in a straight line, you would get pictures of the most distant points inside the sphere.
The second purpose of the expedition was to procure images of the English fleet anchored at Scapa Flow by reflection.</p>

<p>In any case your blunt swing of an attack here is a whiff.  The point is not how the author or any reviewer decided to categorize this idea, but the description of the testing that was done.  That people in positions of authority decided to put non-trivial resources towards this pursuit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof of curvature... okay, here&#39;s a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>Great circle routes, which every navigator who every pilots any craft from the lowliest cargo ship to the most advanced planes <em>must</em> follow in order to conserve fuel by following the shortest route. If the Earth were flat, then everyone would just navigate in a straight line and save <strong><em>billions of dollars</em></strong> in fuel costs!</li>
<li>Eratosthenes&#39;s experiment - This is a trivial little experiment that you can do on your own, it just takes a couple days of travel and $10 worth of equipment from the local hardware store. Set up and measure the sun&#39;s shadow at noon using a perfectly vertical stick at two different locations, one about 500-700 miles north of the other, such as from Wichita, KS to Austin, TX. That difference in shadow length is the curvature of the Earth, but just in case you think it&#39;s because the sun is just 32 miles away (yes, this is a real flat earth claim!) try doing the same experiment between two locations that are several hundred miles due east and west of each other and you will find no variance.</li>
<li>Navigate via sextant</li>
<li>Cross both the north and south poles (this is expensive, of course, but eminently doable).</li>
<li>Travel to the southern hemisphere and <a href="http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/time/moon/hemispheres.html">observe the moon</a>.</li>
<li>Measure a triangle&#39;s angles on the Earth. If you have a plane, this one is easy. If you have a boat, it&#39;s harder, but doable. This ties back in to the idea of great circles.</li>
<li>Get involved in ham radio. Actually, do this anyway, it&#39;s a great hobby! But with ham radio you quickly learn how far away you can receive a signal from before you are only receiving signals when atmospheric conditions allow for them to be reflected off of the ionosphere because otherwise, the Earth is in the way.</li>
<li>Watch satellite weather imagery and track it against local observations over a period of weeks. You&#39;ll find that the satellite view is actually exactly what you&#39;re seeing, and that view is from a geosynchronous satellite, something that really only works around a uniform mass (such as a spherical Earth).</li>
<li>Get yourself a kit for directly receiving GPS telemetry on a computer. This is an amazing experiment to perform for high school or older kids who have had some trig and a bit of calculus and know some programming. You get the raw data from the device, and you can look up the correct formulas to use to determine your location. These formulas have to take the Earth&#39;s shape <em>and</em> the relativistic delta in motion between the Earth&#39;s surface and the satellite into account and you can prove this out to yourself mathematically.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry, those are the only examples I can think of off the top of my head.</p>

<p>Almost a decade of experience doing astrophotography has demonstrated to me numerous times that the concept of the Earth being flat requires a lack of critical thought, cognitive dissonance as well as an inability to process and interpret basic scientific information.  I&#39;ve been to several museums to view Foucault&#39;s Pendulums and I&#39;ve helped people make a rudimentary one.  The flat Earth theory lacks evidence and reason.</p>

<p>&quot;Flimsy&quot;?  Thousands of photographs of the Earth from space showing it to be spherical.  Lunar eclipses.  Visibility of other spherical planets.  Foucault&#39;s Pendulums ... this is all flimsy evidence to you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NASA isn&#39;t the only agency taking photos of Earth from space.  I would suggest doing some research so that you don&#39;t limit yourself to relying on a single source.  What experiments have you conducted yourself that demonstrate the Earth to be flat?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s easy to call others dumb, but why don&#39;t you make a video or something with your supreme logic and intelligence and see if flat earthers can debunk them.</p>

<p>There is no need, basic facts and observations like lunar eclipses, the moon being oriented differently in the north/south hemispheres, different constellations being visible in the two hemispheres, the difference in the direction of the movement of the sun in the two hemispheres are obvious points that anybody capable of basic logical thought would recognize as proof of a round Earth.  If you need a video for these, then that is your own inability to process information in a non-passive format that is the issue, not the facts at hand.</p>

<p>You seem to have trouble with reading comprehension.  I said astrophotography, not astrophysics.  You should take your time when reading long words, it seems as though you get frustrated half-way through and make up your own endings.  I also suggested that you look at the numerous other agencies that have taken photos of the Earth, not just NASA.  You seem to have concluded the opposite due to poor reading comprehension.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It demonstrates the Earth&#39;s shape by the variation in its demonstrated effects on different parts of the globe.  Again, it would seem as though you are only half-informed, yet confident regarding an issue you are discussing, yet another symptom of a flailing education system.</p>

<p>Ok, so again no evidence.  You can simply say <em>&quot;I don&#39;t have any evidence, but I don&#39;t need any because I&#39;m already so firmly stuck in my uneducated beliefs&quot;</em>.

<p>I&#39;ve been enjoying your comments, that guy is a complete moron. But FYI the sun still rises in the east and sets in the west regardless of what hemisphere you&#39;re in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but in the Northern Hemisphere the sun appears to move from north to south (rising moving &#39;right&#39; and setting moving &#39;right&#39;), whereas in the Southern Hemisphere it will rise and set moving left.</p>

<p>Coming from a guy who can&#39;t spell millennia and intellectually I&#39;ll take that as a compliment and move on to doing more productive things with my day as I know neither of us will get anywhere. </p>

<p>Wow, moving on to petty attacks on spelling mistakes and still haven&#39;t provided any evidence or &quot;debunkings&quot;.  I fear for our future if people like you are allowed to educate their own children, robbing them of a decent future and simply creating more cogs in a machine that serves the elite.</p>
