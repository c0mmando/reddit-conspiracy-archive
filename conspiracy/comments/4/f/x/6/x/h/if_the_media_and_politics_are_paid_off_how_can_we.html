       I love science and I think it is very fascinating and I have watched a lot of documentaries. But with so much propaganda being thrown around, how can we be sure that the new breakthroughs in science are true? Couldn't scientists just as easily be paid off as politicians? I sure as heck don't have a telescope like Hubble so there is no way I can confirm what they are sending back is accurate. Or about climate change, or about anything scientific really. I watched alot about hubble and that one seems legitimate, as I'm sure most science discoveries are. But what about new ones? What's stopping them from being paid off and lying to us?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see alot of Bill Nye being tossed around, especially with that new $20,000 bet he did on video. (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4bDk-pPgbs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4bDk-pPgbs
       </a>
       ) The video seems fishy to me, I mean who has an entire production set and prints out a giant $10,000 dollar check just to put someone on blast and make a bet? Why so much effort? It doesn't seem
       <em>
        normal
       </em>
       to me. Why be so "TV" and "viral" about an issue like that, why not just tweet it? The weather man he was betting had a normal, human, response. It was simply on twitter and he pretty much just said "Hey, I'm putting my kid through college and don't make 20k bets like actors can"   source:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722533523312119808">
        https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722533523312119808
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in the video it seems like Bill Nye used the weather guys own correct graph, trying to use it against him. Very weird:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722736596533977089">
        https://twitter.com/BigJoeBastardi/status/722736596533977089
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The way Bill Nye went about this particular "bet" seemed so orchestrated, pre meditated, and was such an unnatural way to call someone out, that it irked me. He is so ingrained in young peoples mind due to acting on a TV show, that young people my age eat up everything he says. The man has a BS in engineering, and now he is telling me about climate change? Are there no other scientists who can tell me this? Why does it have to be always be Bill Nye? Could he be bought off just like politicians and the media? I don't have the answers but lately Bill Nye, an actor who was ingrained into my generations childhood, is telling me everything I need to know about science. I'd like some other reputable sources to tell me science information. What do you guy's think?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Bill Nye's video was also pretty condescending to the weather man as he belittles him for working out. Why would he even mention that he works out? It is so irrelevant and I believe used to make the weather man look bad.

       Some scientists are paid off, but more than those are intimidated and pressured to toe the party line. And sweet, sweet biostatisticians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Nye isn't really a scientist, though, I wouldn't worry too much about that guy - didn't he write a book where he changed a full chapter because Monsanto paid him to take a trip to visit them?

       I dated a biostatistician.  She said to me that she got paid to bullshit with numbers to approve stuff for the FDA.  In her case, luckily, it was with a consumer grade defibrilator for offices which is certainly a wholesome task.  But it left a bad taste in my mouth and eventually I thought her job was bullshit and by proxy she was bullshit.  So I left.  Also, I didn't really love her so it was bad of me to stay anyway.  I hope she's found someone.

       Of course those manipulating truth would go to someone like Bill Nye to steer the direction of science. Especially since he is so loved by the millennial generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Nye is part of a lot of psy-ops he recently said that scientists that do not agree with shady climate change science should go to jail. That's insane.

       Um... As a scientist I can say the likes of Bill Nye have precisely zero effect on "steering the direction of science" whatever that means. Even if they were once scientists, they're TV personalities now, nothing more. Can they influence public opinion? Probably. But that shit about affecting actual scientific work is complete crap, I'm sorry.

       These TV personalities like Neil Tyson and Bill Nye have a huge effect on science. They steer public perception. Millions of students (including me) idolized those figures as role models when young. You don't think their pursuit of science will be along the same lines as their role models?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example we have a shit ton of problems on earth. Yet countless amounts of resources and funding and research goes into NASA and the space program. If public perception of space is negative then billions of public money wouldn't fund it.

       All 97% of them? You really suggests that statistically 100% of scientists have either been paid off to fabricate results or been influenced by the media enough to fabricate results showing climate change to be real/man made?

       Not only that you have a very naive understanding about what science really is.
Science isn't fact, it's the agreed upon opinion of how things work at our given time.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point in history theories regarding gravity, space, time, and being were also considered science until one day when they weren't. Science isn't a concrete thing and we have a lot of bad science going around right now. Most science these days is funded by the wrong people, for the wrong reasons, with unrepeatable lab procedures, and incorrect conclusions. Just look at the work vaccine scientists are doing and GMO scientists and weather modification scientists, it's a lot of bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       To just blindly follow the science of the day is actually very unscientific.

       At no point did I come close to defining science as fact in that post, you're right by the way. The only thing I said was that people like bill Nye in no way influence the scientific community. They are science communicators and serve as the bridge between scientists and the public. Thinking that they can somehow "steer" science is naive. I also never said anything about blindly following the current scientific thinking, which would in fact be very unscientific.

       Scientists are absolutely paid off. Before trusting any "research paper", you absolutely must find out who financed it. Chances are it's a corporation benefiting from the paper's "conclusions".

       or the funding comes from a government with a social engineering agenda.  I really see no distinction between governments and corporations.  Both are powerful entities that seek to increase their power.  Both are run by they same type of person that has no qualms about causing harm to others for their personal gain.

       would you be interested to learn that some very suspect conservative religious think tanks are funding human genome research. they seem to be very interested in the DNA differences between the races. likely for eugenics purposes.

       You must! Science is compliated, and you are only a layman! How are you to form an educated opinion, if even the experts are in disagreement? You must trust the scientists, because everything else leads you to religion and superstition. You don't want to be an evolution-denying, flat-earther creationist like all dumb people, do you? So trust the scientific consensus. Scientists are getting paid a lot of money to do their job, which is a very hard one, because you have to be very intelligent and study many, many years to become an expert and pass all the tests, and they would not tell you with so much conviction that buildings simply self-disintegrate if it weren't true.

       The last link, The Lancet is one of the oldest and most prestigious scientific journals in the world. When the editor-in-chief states that up to 50% of research papers are fraudulent, which would include research published in The Lancet, then you know this is a serious problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can safely assume any research that is tied to big money, either to protect current profits or generate new profits, the rate of fraud is significantly higher. I suspect the Fraud rate is much greater than 50%. But even at 50% that means you simply can no longer trust the statements;

       Not everything is a conspiracy, but of course there is corruption in every sector of human Industry. Here's the difference:
Many if not most scientists get into it because they're genuinely fascinated with some anomalous part of the natural world, or want to solve some problem for humanity. Now of course there are some liars and bad apples, but on the whole, most of us in science are fairly moral. Yes we have to sell out for funding, but in comparison to other fields, ethical standards are vastly higher, and conflicts of interest are quite limited. That's not to say it's ubiquitous, but just look around at what we have today, and I think you'd agree, the overwhelming majority of scientific innovation actually helps humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the case with politics, and especially with career politicians. Their whole life is dedicated to basically being a sociopath: doing whatever it takes to fund and win elections, and having no real "job" besides that. Look at most of the negative externalities of science and I bet you'll find that they're in some way driven by politically-natured events (I.e the defense industry highjacks science for murder when, under presidents like JFK, we were using most of that part of the budget to explore space).
      </p>

       Scientists on TV are not real scientists, people like Nye and tyson are just like politicians, mouthpieces.

       You should always be very skeptical about everything.  You have to remember that there is no way you are correct about all of your beliefs and ideas and you have no way of knowing which beliefs you hold are wrong because if you did, you wouldnt hold them.  Always remember your position could be wrong because it could be based on bad information.  Never firmly believe anything.

       If you question the results, run the experiment yourself and independently verify or disprove the data.  That's what science is.  At least claims can be challenged and disproved within the framework of science, unlike religion or politics where someone can just spout "God told me to do this" or "no comment, this is a matter of national security" and end the conversation.

       And this is why we need open data. The data and trials are all-too-often hidden - so what you're asking for can't physically be done. A good example is the discovery that
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/10/tamiflu-saga-drug-trials-big-pharma">
        Tamiflu was pretty worthless
       </a>
       - it lessens symptoms by a day and a half and can cause children to hallucinate and self-harm - harms outweigh the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no one knew this because negative trials were hidden. The only reason we know this is because they were sued, and as part of the lawsuit were FORCED to release the data sets, and a more accurate meta-analysis performed.

       Even more prevalent than directly paying off scientists, which likely does exist to a degree, is the way that peer review and academia works.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to continue to hold a research professorship, you must publish, preferably in the prestigious journals in your field. To get published in these journals, your paper must be accepted by those journals' editors. If they don't like your research or its implications, they can simply reject the paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole 97% climate consensus is based on published papers. Who's to say how many papers that disagreed with that consensus were rejected from the journals? It's a lot easier to buy off a few journals than all the scientists in a field. And once you realize you're not going to get published or get funding for such research, you're naturally going to go into something that will pay the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some sense, the old system of gentlemen scientists, aristocrats who didn't have to work for a living could pursue science for science's sake was a much better system than what we have today.

       There are 5 major media organizations running almost all of the media you see.

      <p>
       There are two parties running US politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are hundreds of thousands of science foundations, universities, research labs, exploration organizations worldwide- most of whom don't have an iota of a tie to the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       This separation of all of these scientific groups makes a global scientific 'hoax' or manipulation pretty unlikely.
