         The Great War (1914-1918) once-again-taught Rich Men that war is very profitable. War also affected society more than anything else, and these men wanted to control society even more than they already did. They decided to promote war whenever, wherever, and however possible.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Persons in the NAZI party (NAZI = national socialist German worker's party) in Germany were not the master-minds, nor the financiers of their movement, nor the war. The ideas and money came from American tycoons, "Robber Barons," and attorney family Harriman brothers, who recruited the NAZIs to be a buffer against Bolshevism (Russian revolution). The strategy worked because Germany was slumped in a super-inflationary recession caused by the outrageous reparations demanded by the Treaty of Versailles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The American leadership of the NAZIs was mostly  hidden, but Prescott Bush was one of the most prominent; his support of Hitler was later squelched by FDR (aiding the enemy act).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The German war industry was set up with major assistance from Henry Ford.

        <p>
         Hitler's eugenics program originated in California:

       <li>
        <p>
         The German people were duped into becoming a patsy, like L H Oswald, and O bin Laden after them. For the first time, an
         <em>
          entire country
         </em>
         was recruited to become both "hitman" and "fall guy" by very rich men.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The holocaust is proof the Jewish common-people are not behind the NWO. They are dupes and victims, as are many other people who were, are, and will be, victims of the eugenic/ genocide agendas of the NWO, who are  not Jewish.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the NWO personnel can be said to have an official religion, it must be Satanic. Their secrets are hidden in Freemasonry, Skull and Bones, and Sicilian Mafia secret societies. JFK made a famous speech about them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After the war, much of the German NAZI hierarchy was recruited to come to the USA, and adopted to master-mind NASA, CIA, and other alphabet agencies, putting their 1930s experience to use in their adopted country. Operation Paperclip...  Welcome home, mo-f'krs!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The USA worships the ideals of Fascism. Look at the statue of A Lincoln in his DC monument. His throne is book-ended with fasces. And look at the reverse of the old Mercury dime... fasces.

      </ul>

       <strong>
        Evidence of these claims is abundantly provided in a 3.5 hour documentary "Everything is a Rich Man's Trick" which has been posted several times in r/conspiracy.

       You missed a big one.
      </p>
      <p>
       John D. Rockefeller's United States based Standard Oil company was supplying the Nazi air force with gasoline through a cartel arrangement with German based IG Farben.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without that gas the Luftwaffe could not have made such advancements, and they were still a few years away from being capable of producing the oil themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heard of Zyklon B? IG Farben are the ones who purchased the patent and manufactured it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you research more and more about Nazi history you start to realize there were some very rich players pulling the strings, and the Germans (as well as Hitler) may have been patsies in a much larger scheme. I'm not saying Hitler was any good, but Hitler-the-badguy is the perfect ending to an NWO horror story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's extremely important that we recognize and correct this misconstruction in our history books. Letting kids think Hitler was the top supervillain without knowing anything about the conspiring wealthy assholes who funded Hitler is a nice recipe for history repeating itself.

       Right (u/ragecry). And the whole ugly business is in full swing again, in the Middle East. The Israeli Mossad inspired 9-11 attacks were a setup to frame the Arabs, and send the entire M.E. up in flames and strife. As if that never happened before (wink).

       Another item the documentary we are discussing missed, was FDR's instigation of war with Japan... exposed in
       <em>

       Oh, it gets even more complex than that. It was not only the Americans (and even the British) who supplied the oil that the German military machine used at the beginning of the war. A lot of the initial oil also was supplied by the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, after the war ended there was literally ZERO investigation into that pesky fact: that American companies supplied oil to the enemy and continued to supply it for a while after the war was declared. There was also no investigation into the price gouging practices oil companies carried out through the war, in which they charged outrageous prices for oil to the US government (and the allies as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       WWI, interestingly enough, has also a principal oil angle. Which is completely absent from the narrative used to explain the conflict in history classes everywhere.

       Thanks, I'll have to research the WWI era oil.

       The Standard Oil / IG Farben cartel was not only being used to supply the Nazis with gasoline, it was also being used to funnel U.S. war secrets and technology to Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       While they were accused of treason fairly early on, not much happened with that and the U.S. Supreme Court later broke up Standard Oil into Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, and corporate merged with BP.

       So many corporations were involved to help the wars and atrocities move foward over the years... I'll never forget learning about how IBM provided the typewriters to the NAZI's so they could properly log and organize prisoners of war... Just one of the many mongrel companies making big money of murder and destruction.

       These companies which mostly still exist today made money on the spoils of war. I'm not saying they are still evil. I'm saying their fortunes and success were built during WWII era when Nazis allowed the use concentration camps for labor (aka slavery) and wealthy tycoons were funding Germany. It gives them a lot of leverage in the market now, to the point where any new competitor can be bought out. They don't really deserve to be where they are now, but it's kinda hard to hit the reset button on that.

       The UK's big enemy was Russia. It was the only other Empire of comparable size and strength. The UK got Japan to attack it in 1905. Japan won. This and WW1 led to the revolution and Russia's withdrawl from the war. Germany was defeated and was used to attack Russia again in WW2. Germany lost and Russia won. This led the UK to use the USA to attack the Russians in the Cold War until the Russians were defeated in 1991.

       It might be that the financial center of the world is in London city, but it seems unlikely the UK played the Russians against the Germans as both the USSR and the Nazis were funded by Wall Street.

       Good comment, but the British and Russian empires were not very comparable in size or strength. The British Empire (sun never sets on it) is by far the largest, most populous, and most economically powerful regime the world has ever known. It is still intact, still threatens ordinary people the world over. It includes the USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, and India. After the American Civil War, some British masterminds put together a plan, in league with the red shield family, to control the world in secret. The plan worked, and is still in process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree the Russians were defeated. I would say the Soviet Socialists were defeated, the Russian people won. As for the USA, we seem to be trading places with the Bolshevik Reds. Look at the Russian TV network RT (truth). Compare to the US MSM (lies). Here is why:

       I would say that the Russian Tsars lost to the British Crown. The Russians were smaller than the British Empire and worse at sailing. But they do have a large resource base and a large enough population. They would have been able to do more if they had not lost so many people in WW2.

       The red shielders seem to have been the true winners.

       The US is seen as an upstart competator by the UK. They are a big part of the reason that we go downhill. They want to use us as a military force at their bidding. Hence we need to be stupid and controlled.

       There is much more to the story of the relationship of USA and the British Crown. My research tells me the USA is a corporation formed in 1871 as a result of bankruptcy after the devastating war. Clever Brit lawyers set it up to regain control of their American colonies, with frauds and money controls. According to this evidence, the USA is still British property, and everything in the USA is included, the citizens, and their property, and their children, slaves. The trick's success depends on secrecy, and keeping the citizens ignorant. Thus the clandestine programs of "deliberate dumbing down" (look it up) and propaganda supporting socialist world government. We are headed that way, even more than the Russians, who now have a leader who knows the scam, and is keeping his country out of it. Thus the western media tries to paint the Russian leader with black.

       Yes, you are very correct about this. We are all slaves. This is some of the stuff that the natural citizen people talk about alot. They definitely do their best to dumb us down. There is no doubt about that. But there is also an effort to replicate the Brit social system inside of the US, where one group of Americans tries to keep down another. There are any number of people inside the US that would sell out the country for their own personal benefit. (Think Clinton, for example) So, not all of problems come from outside...

       Russia seems to remain under attack. I find this hard to explain other than the 1% seem to have an endless desire to profit from every situation. The attack on the Ukraine was met by push back from Putin (who is no saint) which was a good thing. Putin seems like the only person who is willing and able to push back now. I sorta wish that the Chinese were a bit smarter about the situation, but they do not seem up to it.

       Things will hit an inflection point in the next 50 years or so. Maybe the City will dump the dollar for the Yuan? Maybe a wide-scale break-down? Maybe WW3??? I don't know what will happen but I get a bad feeling in my gut.

       I agree, I'm going to reinforce what you wrote: To confirm Putin is excluding the NWO, look at the membership roster of the Bilderberg Group (it's online). No Russians. That is not to say Putin is above using  some of the same evil tactics. He plagiarized his doctoral thesis about using energy for geopolitical objectives. He is probably behind several assassinations. He is also probably behind a false flag attack purported to be done by Chechen rebels. No saint indeed. But I applaud his spunk in standing up to the USA and NWO. The revolution lives on, fighting fascism, another brand of socialism. (See my discussion:

      </p>
      <p>
       As for "Brit social system" here, you mean the class system, with titles in the nobility, and the lower classes of miners and weavers, etc. The Founders outlawed it with the original 13th amendment, which was eliminated in the re-issue of the bogus Constitution. The legal system here is now all Brit, UCC, and Temple BAR, and attorneys have the title of Esquire. Hussssh, it's a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for selling out the country, you know nearly everyone in Congress must know about the citizenship/ British ownership scam. So they all sold out. For more clues, look at the 9/11 fiasco. Best books for naming names are Another 19, and Solving 9-11. Never mind books, anyone with Internet and a smidgen of curiosity can watch videos that expose the whole thing. Congress is just fine keeping all that ignored. They all just want to collect their moola and retire in comfort. Not even Ron Paul would spill the beans.

       The inflection point you mentioned, giving it 50 years, way too conservative. I think major sheet will heat the fan before 2020. I'm trying to prepare, but not much hope if the nukes fall. Did you see the comment about the Yellowstone volcano?...

       Yes, Putin pushing back seems good in theory, until you read about nukeing Yellowstone. Then, the war seems real enough! But, you cannot blame them for fighting back...

       The Brit social system, by that, I meant something like the ever-widening gap between the have nots and the haves. I guess I was wrong, but growing up in the suburbs, I got the impression that everyone had about the same economic status, some poorer, some richer, but everyone treated everyone else fairly well. Now you can see insane CEO pay while the retail workers earn minimum and full time pay is not enough to raise a family or even feed yourself and rent an apt. for that matter. It is a totally fucked situation, IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 is some sort of a con. I do not know who is responsible, but you can feel that it is a con quite clearly. Even if you accept everything the government says, the entire 9/11 commision report, it still does not add up to an attack on Iraq, which was the major outcome. It was a manufactered 2nd Pearl Harbor, just as false as the first. The goal was to get us into war, perhaps for oil, perhaps for Israel, perhaps so Junior could show Dad he is a hard ass too. Whatever the reason, it was a con.

       There are so many problems and they are so large, that I feel overwhelmed at times. It is good to read your comments, although I am sure we would have many points of disagreement, there are many things that we can agree on also. The dumbing down problem is a serious one. It is a shame that 300 million people cannot come up with a good educational system. But, it seems like it is controlled by certain groups that wish to keep the slaves down.

       It's not like Germany won the war. That is patently bogus. But rather that a specific form of "fascism" (the anglosaxon capital markets one) won over the other competing forms of "fascism" : initially the German-Italian-Japanese form of state-fascism, and then after a few decades, the Soviet style of "proletarian" fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "fascism" really becomes meaningless. Basically you're having one form of assholiness triumphing over two competing forms of assholiness.

       All I am sure about, is that in 1930 there were crowds of alive Jewish people in Europe, and in 1945 there were several million fewer (I did not count them, but believe the photos). The Russian peasants got an even worse deal from their revered leader Stalin. The entire war was a disaster and human tragedy of staggering proportions. And, it could happen again.

       No, this is not true. Various scientists that had worked for the German government, some of them who were members of the NSDAP, were recruited by both the USA and the USSR after the war.

       Research alchemy Freemasonry and gnosticism
      </p>
      <p>
       Epicenter of pre-Nazi occult in turn of 20th century was Heidelberg, which centuries earlier was epicenter of rosicrucianism, a failed protestant movement to transform Europe to alchemical gnosticism, and and area involved in a failed jesuit gunpowder plot (v for vendetta) was part of that history
      </p>
      <p>
       Rosicrucianism became Freemasons.  Highest level freemasons are aristocratic crypto fascist nazis that are part of the hijacking of the world by the international ruling class that includes the pope and monarchs of the world, called by some the empire of the city or the hidden empire
      </p>
      <p>
       Low level Freemasons are dupes and utterly clueless

       Obviously a comment by a well educated and morally sophisticated person, who knows their sheet. The Satanic theme was made in the documentary more than twice.

       PS. Notice this user name ends in 322. I have seen this number recently. Could it be with Skull and Bones? The pirates? That is rich. Pirates. The author of the documentary is brilliant. I hope he is not murdered for releasing it.

       Good comment, but the British and Russian empires were not very comparable in size or strength. The British Empire (sun never sets on it) is by far the largest, most populous, and most economically powerful regime the world has ever known. It is still intact, still threatens ordinary people the world over. It includes the USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, and India. After the American Civil War, some British masterminds put together a plan, in league with the red shield family, to control the world in secret. The plan worked, and is still in process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree the Russians were defeated. I would say the Soviet Socialists were defeated, the Russian people won. As for the USA, we seem to be trading places with the Bolshevik Reds. Look at the Russian TV network RT (truth). Compare to the US MSM (lies). Here is why:

       Yes, Putin pushing back seems good in theory, until you read about nukeing Yellowstone. Then, the war seems real enough! But, you cannot blame them for fighting back...

       The Brit social system, by that, I meant something like the ever-widening gap between the have nots and the haves. I guess I was wrong, but growing up in the suburbs, I got the impression that everyone had about the same economic status, some poorer, some richer, but everyone treated everyone else fairly well. Now you can see insane CEO pay while the retail workers earn minimum and full time pay is not enough to raise a family or even feed yourself and rent an apt. for that matter. It is a totally fucked situation, IMO.

       9/11 is some sort of a con. I do not know who is responsible, but you can feel that it is a con quite clearly. Even if you accept everything the government says, the entire 9/11 commision report, it still does not add up to an attack on Iraq, which was the major outcome. It was a manufactered 2nd Pearl Harbor, just as false as the first. The goal was to get us into war, perhaps for oil, perhaps for Israel, perhaps so Junior could show Dad he is a hard ass too. Whatever the reason, it was a con.

       There are so many problems and they are so large, that I feel overwhelmed at times. It is good to read your comments, although I am sure we would have many points of disagreement, there are many things that we can agree on also. The dumbing down problem is a serious one. It is a shame that 300 million people cannot come up with a good educational system. But, it seems like it is controlled by certain groups that wish to keep the slaves down.
