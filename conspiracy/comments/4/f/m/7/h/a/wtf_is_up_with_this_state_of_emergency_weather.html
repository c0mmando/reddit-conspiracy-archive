       Don't talk about it out loud, you don't want to risk sounding crazy. I've noticed it too, things are different in general. Here in South Texas, we have summer nights already. That usually doesn't start happening till around late May to mid-June. And seismic activity on the rise from its already rather drastic incline. The Inuit of arctic Canada claim their sky has changed. The geomagnetic shift is real.

       Here in south Brazil its the same. Its autumn and the temperatures are the same as in mid summer. Usually by this time of the year I would be starting to wear jackets, but as of now im still going to sleep naked with a fan on max speed towards myself. Not to mention going to work wearing trousers is a pain.

       I don't understand how California can be so dry when we have companies that advertise cloud seeding to make rain...unless the water from the Pacific ocean is full of radiation.

       I'm sorry, let me elaborate. I forget that I have knowledge of certain things that are unheard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       California has been experiencing a chronic drought. Ironically, San Francisco is a "top tech city", yet they have not used tech to solve their problems. There is a technique called "cloud seeding" that is advertised by companies in Texas. It makes use of technology that is over 50 years old. You basically stimulate clouds to rain by introducing certain molecules into the skies. Since Cali is a "progressive" state, unlike West Vergernia, we could assume that they are aware of such technology. However, there is the issue of a radiation leak in the pacific that was caused by a meltdown in Japan about 5 years ago. There have been various claims that it is being downplayed (Fukushima).

       So you think "they" might not be cloud seeding because the clouds might be radioactive?

       I can name a company that specializes in that service if you're questioning the validity of my claims. I do not know why they don't just cloudseed, if they really want rain. Does radiation accumulate in clouds and fall as rain the same way acid rain does? I have no idea. It is possible.

       Except in Hendersonville where it was 77 because of the cloud cover.  How nice of those clouds and strangely no wind in a gusty week to protect all the local apple orchards, a big revenue maker for the state.

       The actual North Pole of what is called the earths Axis of rotation, is not shifting. What is shifting is the "Magnetic" poles. Just like the polarity of a magnet. One is north, the other South.
      </p>
      <p>
       The North magnetic pole was drifting towards North America for decades, but suddenly started to drift eastward toward the UK...for some unexplained reason.

       earlier this month (April 2016) we had snow in the mid-atlantic region of the U.S., which is unheard of considering that we're essentially in springtime.

       We've had a few hot summer days in Vancouver so far. Our weather has been pretty weird the past few years. Not as much rain. Nowhere close to as many late speing and early summer storms. It's just different. Global warming.

       I'm not sure if he's referring to the Valley as "South Texas" but I can generalize for you what it's like in Texas. Summer nights are hot and humid just like every other day in Texas lol. SA will be hot, maybe not as humid but I'm not too sure since I'm southeast Texas.

       If the Earth's axis has shifted by any significant amount, it'd have a massive impact on anything that relies on satellite communication. It'd also be plainly visible in the night sky because suddenly the position of the constellations would start deviating from computer models, planetariums, etc. It'd be impossible to cover up.

       Didn't you read all of what I said? Here in South Texas we already have summer nights. It won't get dark until like 8. Other people have also commented saying daylight hours are unusual as well as weather and climate conditions.

       I'm in Alabama and it's pretty weird. I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed in May for some weird reason. Usually we have a lot of tornadoes starting in March and through like October and we haven't had very many so far. Hell we haven't had many tornadoes since April 2011 I believe. It weird especially for Alabama when there's usually a lot of tornadoes.

       One thing we have to also take into account is how much we've modified the weather just living here. Hell the majority of our green house gasses come from livestock to feed us and that's not including factories/generators/transportation or contamination/destruction of nutrient cycles in the soils. More mass migrations will continue as farming becomes impossible to do in once thriving areas.

       EDIT: Fracking as well, as this causes seismic and environmental impacts.

       Any one remember the Crystal City tap "water" Texas fiasco and that California fracking spill that caused a lot of people to move out of their neighborhoods? Fracking causes so much damage and is often overlooked yet a huge contributor to many of the worlds problems.

       The video he posted recently is very scary given the fact that his model was further proven valid by the April 16th twin earthquakes. Right now, massive coronal holes are facing earth and as I type this the solar winds are drastically increasing... I'm worried something is going to happen today

       my gut is no better than yours, and no worse. It wasnt so much of a gut feeling before, rather it was a deep thought that has been held in the back of my mind since I awoke to the truth. That thought of knowing the truth has always lurked in my head, but is now manifesting itself into more than a thought, a feeling. Its coming to the surface.

       The science behind his research is validated statistically to a very high confidence level (thanks to Stanford's Statisticians). Yet, he is an amateur (a very smart one) who needs global support to improve his data (aka less than 10 day windows of solar wind data related to coronal holes when facing Earth) since major quakes are happening so closely to these shifts, I'm talking days, VERY unsettling... Not to add to any conspiracy but Nepal's quake doesn't match the model and that's where I personally believe human involvement to cause quakes has been present (just like these past two on 4/16 - if they don't confirm the model which they may).

       This is some of the most gripping and detailed tornado footage I've ever seen. Maybe it's just me?
      </p>
      <p>
       Something about the effect that the wall to the right of the camera creating a clear path to be able to see a fair distance down the street as the tornado hits DIRECTLY in the clear line of sight created by the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never seen a tornado video from that perspective quite like that before. Maybe I don't get out enough.

       Yep.  Seasons were distinct,  they tooks days and weeks to change. When a weather event from the prior or coming season happened out of cycle it made the news.  Now it's just business as usual.  But scary how it can snow,  be hi 70's the next, then back again. It's like  the planet is fighting itself.

       Our solar system is moving through a higher energy spot in the Milky Way. More heat, more electromagnetic functioning, more energy, more attitude, more craziness, and more people feeling restless even when relaxing. We're also part of the big puzzle so our pieces will be affected too.

       I'm on my lunch break (which is when I workout, as well) so I'm not going to look for a link...yet.....if I can even find one.

       Anything I say about it will put me and my opinion in the "crazy, shit-for-brains" category by a lot of people, whether they read it here or I tell them in person. But if they were to see me in person, then
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       they will question their own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this, in fact I know I'm not the only one. I do remember reading/watching a few things online about 2-3 years ago, but since then, I can't remember ALL of the details and points they were making. I've lived most of my
       <em>
        aware
       </em>
       life having some good intuition capabilities, I guess you could say.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been a "
       <strong>
        knowing, without knowing
       </strong>
       ," and I've been "
       <strong>
        told, without being told
       </strong>
       ." I don't know any other way to describe it that doesn't make my words sound like hippy, new-age space bullshit...which is where most people would throw that opinion towards.

       Yeah I remember that now, too. As we move in our counter-clockwise path, as a solar system in our galaxy, we're also on a wave-type pattern going up and down, in the plane of the milky way. I think, if I remember, we are crossing the equator as we venture "up," this time, in our pattern.

       Exactly. The conspiracy is the energy companies lying and withholding info about climate change. Also, governments letting these energy companies run wild in their back yard. The actual weather changes are just the natural process. It isn't global warming and only global warming, it is climate CHANGE. Weather and the seasons are going to be more erratic. Also, as the spotlight gets bigger and more people wise up, more articles and news will be attributed to climate change because people are more willing to accept it now.

       The Chicago area usually gets a few huge snow days per winter. This year there was NO accumulation at all, just cold. Temps didn't go over 50 until days ago.

       Interesting that spray activity in the skies had increased DRAMATICALLY in Mar/Apr. Got charts from FAA and there are 3-4 commercial flights directly above me per day on weekdays...but some days I'll count ten-twelve planes AT ONCE directly above me  spraying.

       I live in Milwaukee where it seems like we're just having another bizarre spring. Granted, it's been a LITTLE strange...we had sleet one day, 70 degrees the next, and an inch of snow the day after that. Can't quite remember a stretch like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this hit home over the weekend though. Through some cosmic coincidence, I wound up in a Rocket League party with someone living in Ecuador on Saturday; never have I even played with a foreigner prior to this. Right before 7 pm CST, I heard the earthquake start over the headset...the shaking got louder, people started screaming in the background. I heard a few dishes / glasses falling and shattering, then
       <em>
        VWOOP
       </em>
       - nothing, and he disconnected. The other guy in the party and I sat in awe for a moment before asking each other if that was an earthquake we just heard. I said it had to be - I literally watched videos from inside homes during the 2011 Japan quake that same morning, and that was exactly what it sounded like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, my Ecuadorian counterpart and his family were ok, despite being quite shaken up by the damage to their belongings.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: I somehow happened to hear the Ecuador earthquake as it happened live through a headset...

       I'm going to have to go with "incredibly slim", lol. Shortly after he disconnected, I checked online for recent seismograph readings from that area, but did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       expect to see a 7.8. Given that number, and knowing about the other Pacific rim quakes in Japan in days prior, I did get a little worried.

       This kind of weird stuff happens to me from time to time. When I was younger, I had dated two different girls named Katie, one younger, one older than me. Both had birthdays exactly 784 days from mine. How did I even come to figure that out? I think too much.

       There are news reports about how squirrels and other rodents infected with the plague are bitten by fleas which then bite humans giving them the "black death." Anywhere around the Rockies. The reports are probably buried by now but it was a thing a few months ago. You could probably still find it if you dig a bit.

       Kansas weather has been different. Granted, it's always been weird, but mostly predictable as far as seasons go. We had a pretty mild winter. Fewer snows than I can remember. One decent ice storm. Then it warmed up quute a bit. We had a few days of it actually being almost 90, then this in March:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jZv2FE3.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We have gotten snow in march before, rarely, but it happens. I took that at 730am-ish and by 4pm, it was all gone and could wear shorts and t shirts outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually, by this time in April we have severe storms or tornadoes, but all we have gotten is pretty heavy rain. The temps are going from mid 80s to mid-low 60s all the time. I don't know. This past year has been weirder than normal.

       I don't think it's that deep but at the same time it is...
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be construed as deep if you begin to tie it into the earth tilt and magnetic pole craziness etc going on and how tornados are hitting in Uruguay. Or the 1000's of other unprecedented anomalies, and basically perversions of nature and natural law as we thought we knew it. And it's all so out of control at this point that only a coincidence theorist could buy he MSM narrative that the earth isn't already FUCKED. It shouldn't take more than a 60 second YouTube video of the north a South Pole over the past 50 years to realize shit is not right.

       You cannot relate things like earthquakes to weather events like tornadoes, they are completely separate things. As for extreme temperature events across the US, blame ENSO along with a peak in the AMO for the east coast. There's a reason why the past few months have been the hottest on record; it's a combination of global warming along with a peak of two ocean sea surface temp oscillations, so it's not really a surprise that we are getting particularly more weather events/climate extremes. \

       Still part of tge ecosystem.  You believe that the earth, literally moving, cannot have a direct impact on weather?  It can certainly cause tsunamis.  Which can fuck up winds.  Which can cause other weather changes.  You're looking at this at the microcosm level.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't yet know for sure what causes earthquakes.  Just theories which will inevitably change once we learn more.  The aforementioned weathers could very well be an important piece of the puzzle.

       ...the rubbing of tectonic plates together causes earthquakes... You literally learn that in 3rd grade. And no, Tsunamis don't cause weather, you're talking about waves on such a small scale that wouldn't even be reaching into the effective part of the boundary layer in the atmosphere.
      </p>

       For an earthquake to cause a weather event like even a storm, you would have to have the ground lifting up from an earthquake a significant amount (i.e. more than 20m), and also on a large scale around a square of ~20km or so, and even then you just might get clouds and not even storms. I don't think you realize how much goes into the formation of storms. If you try to associate an earthquake with a tornado, let alone even a storm, you have literally no idea what you are talking about.

       Plates are huge slates of land and the crust of the earth, floating on top of molten magma (the core of the earth). These plates float around like anything does on the ocean. More than likely, they float in the directions they do due to the rotation of the earth, but huge masses like that floating are going to move due to more prevalent things such as density differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of Pangea? Notice, the earth doesn't look at all like it did back then... this is because of plate tectonics.
      </p>
      <p>
       These plates can either push together (converging plates), which cause things like mountains, or can diverge causing an opening where molten earth comes up, cools, and forms new crust. They an also be side by side, causing many small earthquakes due to them rubbing against each other side to side, i.e. one goes north and ones moving south. (This is what happens by California).

       I'm in Alabama and it's pretty weird. I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed in May for some weird reason. Usually we have a lot of tornadoes starting in March and through like October and we haven't had very many so far. Hell we haven't had many tornadoes since April 2011 I believe. It weird especially for Alabama when there's usually a lot of tornadoes.
