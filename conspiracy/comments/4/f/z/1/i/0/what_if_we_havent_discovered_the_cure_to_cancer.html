       Alright so the government makes so much money off of cancer donations because it's a billion dollar industry and there's still no cure, a little odd don't you think we've spent countless generations trying to discover a cure but to this day there's not a single one that's 100% guaranteed.

       You pretty much answered your own question. Big Pharma practically owns the FDA and have made it pretty much illegal to find an alternative cure for cancer other than Chemo.

       This. A cure would provide a lose of income. Keep the research to a minimum to show some progress despite the trillions of dollars in this market to ultimately never find the answer. News flash. Diet. Raw veganism cures all types of cancers but is still relatively suppress by today's society. It's all about controlling the masses and making a net profit. Why inform the public when the public can support big business.

       Multiple cancer cures have been discovered over the past 100 years.  They have all been suppressed in favor of the mainstream (and very profitable) treatments of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.

       There are hundreds of types of cancer. There isn't a single cure. That's like saying one key opens all the locks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But many cancers have been "cured" over the last two decades. Survival rates have skyrocketed. Science is getting closer and closer...

       It's an extremely complex disease with multiple cures. It's not some weekend exercise.
      </p>

       Sure, some non=profits use it (same as the Wounded Warrior Project. Greedy assholes are greedy assholes) but there has been a lot of advancements in the last 30 years. Would you like me to post links? It is illuminating.

       Cancer isn't a disease it's a classification of a family of diseases. Some cancers at some stages are curable others are not at this point.  The virus and phage treatments are promising but no magic bullet.  It's like saying why haven't we cured allergies or auto immune disease. It's a much more complex thing than just 1 disease like syphilis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the FDA suppressing cures? I doubt we've advanced to the point of a viable cure.  Research money tends to go to only certain types of cancer and not to others as well. Breast cancer over anal cancer, skin over lung, colon over stomach.

       Why haven't they suppressed cures for other diseases to make money then? Why is smallpox gone?

       Satanists don't really think that way. I think people are confused as to who is actually in control. It's not your happy go lucky guy you can trust. It's someone who does not give a fuck if hundreds of thousands of people die and all that money gets sucked up right into their pockets. That's the mindset you need to have when looking at the scenario.

       These people aren't faceless. We have just given a ridiculous amount of power to medical ethics doctors and cancer doctors as if they aren't profiting from the disease. The AMA was started by JD Rockefeller for a reason. Why would an oil salesman be interested in medicine you ask? Oh maybe so you can control the masses through prescription drugs and disease. It's a lot easier to rule a nation when your population is severely sick (and they are). Ever wonder why we are catapulting ourselves into the 21st century but everyone is getting sicker (well everyone besides the billionaire class). It's because when your sick you don't revolt, when your sick the system makes money, when your sick you die and that definitely helps their depopulation agenda.
