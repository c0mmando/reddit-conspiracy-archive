       Dig if you will the picture of you having the exclusive power to print/create money and then lend it with interest to all the governments in the world, and they are only allowed to borrow the money that you print/create.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picture this power in the hands of psychopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the set up in existence right now, the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank Of International Settlements and all the central banks of the world are privately owned by a small group of people who happen to be Jews loyal to Israel, who have the exclusive power to print/create and lend all the money to create the worldwide money supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you live with yourself if you allow psychopaths to have an exclusive monopoly on the Highest Power On Earth, which is the power to print/create the money and lend it, to create the worldwide money supply?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how they control all the governments and politicians, and keep everyone, including yourself and entire countries poor and dependent, and transfer all the wealth to themselves because they use the paper to buy everything of real wealth like land and gold, and also taking all the resources of countries that default on their debt to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Highest Power On Earth, which is the power to print/create the money and lend it MUST be brought back to Congress, so that the money doesn’t have to be borrowed by the government, and the government can lend the money to banks and use the interest to build infrastructure and social security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you don’t believe it yet but these psychopaths intend to destroy nature and the food available to you, and countries, so that people are dwindled down to be extremely unhealthy and weak, and always close to death, but the psychopaths will have transferred all the wealth to themselves so they will be the only ones who will be healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you can do some research and check the status on Geo Engineering, vaccines, and GMO, and realize they are all intended by these psychopaths to depopulate YOU!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you can do some research and check the status on Open Borders, illegals, and ISIS terrorist migrants and realize they are all intended these psychopaths to make YOU poor, afraid, and dependent!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you want these psychopaths having total control over the Human Race?
      </p>
      <p>
       You better WAKE UP!!!

       I woke up the other day.
Grey aliens were standing above me, and my first thought was to ask them, "Are you going to probe me  and invade my planet?"
      </p>
      <p>
       They looked at me and said (weirdly enough in a brittish accent) "Oh, no no. We're here to SAVE your planet from an invading species of shapeshifting reptilian aliens that want to, through a very complicated process, enslave your people in order to accomplish some slave-ish tasks they could very easily just do with their spaceships!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Really?!" I exclaimed
"Yeah, something like that!" They replied
"Oh sweet!" I said.
Then I Lost consciousness.
And now my butt hurts.

       All money  is illusion. They are human slave masters on this earthly plantation. The only currency is current, see? The human spiritual energy, prana, chi, which we are tricked into exchanging for labor, to which fiat debt based prommisorynotes are given in exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the highest power on earth, not their worthless paper. Collectively we need to remember this fact, and then their control disintegrates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Borders, ownership of property, even language is used to divide us and keep us separate, in addition to the obvious isms the foment- racism, classism, nationalism, etc etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The world has our needs provided for in abundance, we need not slave and be in misery. They need that from us, we do not. It is called loosh, and it is their food.
      </p>
      <p>
       The khazarian bloodline families that run the illusion use deception and camouflage to be wolves among the sheep. No other species in nature uses camouflage and deception agai st its own, thus, one must wonder, are they the same? It sounds more like a predator prey relationship....
      </p>
      <p>
       Their magic, mind control, and programming is only effective in the shadows, when it is unknown or quickly dismissed as fantastical crazy talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps they are performing a different role as well, teachers? It is unlikely that anything or anyone is 100% polarized as evil... or good. There is balance in everything, whether or not we perceive it. IMHO.

       well I guess since you mentioned 'loosh' which I had to lookup 'orgone' / 'vril' / 'emotional energy', then you're leaning towards a gnostic globalist description of 'archonic influence', or 'emotional / spiritual parasitism'.  This is kind of in the realm of scientology ('thetans') or science fiction for most symbolically or occultically illiterate folks; but one thing you can say realistically, or at least using their own neutral language of science is that they are psychopaths. That the world is run by actual psychopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say they use 'deception and camouflage'...'against their own', you're talking about people who are 1) misanthropic, 2) dys-empathetic, 3) abusers, 4) manipulators.  These are hallmarks of a psychopath.  Some say 'sociopath' but honestly no one can tell me the differecne between these terms so I just call them all pscyhopaths or 'spycopaths' because they are all in this business of secrecy, rule from the shadows, using codes and sigils and cryptograms; in fact the tether between spycraft and the occult goes back all the way to the ancient mystery schools of hellenistic egypt and the asia minor, not just to the well known spy-sorceror for Queen Elizabeth.  All this occult stuff is actaully the language of spies.

       You're looking at it backwards.

       You've already climbed up and out of the rabbit hole. You were in it before you were awake, you have come out into the light, and it's bright and painful. You don't want to fall back in.

       The ones who are awake know that awakening is a process. We are all at different stages in our journey to self-realization. For some it is a mere measure of footsteps, and for some it's a matter of months. We still have to hold strong and participate in a way where we can be empowered informers who create the world that we were born to create to fit in. A world motivated by awareness to contribute to its wakefulness. I feel the lightest way to walk is by being involved through pure expression without being strangled by opinion.

       Wow, this deserves its own post. Thanks for sharing. I guess it fits in as one of the previous attempts at circumventing the fed, of course the money went back to the fed in the end and we were left with more of the same. It really is all about the fed, it is the source of so much anguish.

       When we all realize that we dont need permission to print currency instead of printing debt, and that it is just a ponzi scheme of the highest order...the fed will end and instead of poverty we could thrive as nations.
