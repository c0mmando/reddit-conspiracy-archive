Prince: a male singer known for his feminine sexuality died April 21st.</p>

<p>I wanna know if anyone else sees any connection here as April 20th often rings a bell as being a satanic holiday. Do you think they were sacrificed? Anyone else see any patterns?</p>

<p>You make a deal with the devil. You get fame and fortune and everything you&#39;ve ever wanted. You are legend. </p>

<p>But part of the deal is that you never know when you&#39;re time will be up. When you will be called upon to sacrifice yourself for the greater satanic &quot;good&quot; -- in Prince&#39;s case, a distraction from the growing clamor over the Saudi-9/11 Connection, stolen presidential elections and the latest pedophile revelations.  </p>

<p>Prince&#39;s untimely death pushes all the attention his way, one of the 1000 points of life being snuffed out, but another will take its place. The disciples of Lucifer are always eager for another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mention of their androgyny is interesting. Killing the sexless is very much the ultimate virgin sacrifice. There&#39;s a certain truth to it, and you&#39;re probably right.</p>

<p>If you look at the history of the American deep state it does stand out that they target people who are &quot;too good for this world.&quot; Look at one of the more famous people that the government killed, Jean Seberg. A beautiful and talented actress, she stood with the Black Panthers, I believe, and civil rights activists in general. What power did she actually have? None, she was just an actress. So why target her? Because she was beautiful, and she didn&#39;t hate niggers like the government agents did. They had to kill her because she was too good for them.</p>

<p>The motivations of people can always be reduced to elementary instinct, and once you realize that, no matter how convoluted things appear, the truth of human frailty is hidden in there. Now we live in an era that is so masked in artifice and fantasy that the obviously true answers appear like conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Of course, is anyone too good for this world? No, that&#39;s the fresh paint coat we put over the lives of those destroyed by fucking animals.</p>

It looked...off to me, the fans didn&#39;t quite sync up with the background (which was of cars passing by)as if they had been superimposed onto the footage afterwards. The only thing I can compare it to is very bad green screen work.</p>

<p>Not really a Satanic holiday, but definitely an occult one. Beltane starts at this time of year. There seems to be some differences in terms of when it begins. I checked online and found dates ranging from April 19th to the first week of May.</p>

<p>This does coincide nicely with what occult expert Marc Passio calls &quot;The Season of Sacrifice&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post was brilliant. A few weeks ago, I wrote something about all the dead (and &quot;dead&quot;) celebrities that keep popping up. I started noticing a pattern when Bowie passed away (or SEEMINGLY passed away). I&#39;ll dig up my post later, and show it to you. </p>

<p>Strange things are happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some of the celebrities are definitely being sacrificed by the Illuminati. Jared Leto will die sometime in the near future. (July 22nd at the latest. He&#39;ll die on a &quot;master number&quot; date, like Heath Ledger.) </p>

<p>Some of the others, like Bowie, are probably being evacuated to an underground city or some base on &quot;the other side&quot;, courtesy of the breakaway civilization. A global disaster is imminent, and some celebrities have paid lots of money to get a ticket to another place when shit hits the fan -- or before. </p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote something a few weeks ago. It&#39;s not the point you brought up, but it&#39;s related to the slew of recent celebrity deaths. I&#39;d like to share it with you, since you seem to be awake. I&#39;ll just quote myself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought I was the only one noticing all the celebrity deaths lately. I started noticing it when Bowie died. Then people kept dying. I noticed that a lot of the people dying, had been heavy psychedelic users. And a lot of them were UFO disclosure advocates or at least people with a serious interest in visitors from ET civilizations -- and knowledge about said civs.
(As an example: Two founding members of Jefferson Airplane died -- independently of one another -- on the same day. They were said to have knowledge about ET civilizations.)
I think something very big is about to happen. There probably isn&#39;t anything nefarious about most of the celebrity deaths, but the souls playing UFO disclosure avatars are either needed on The Other Side, or needed to incarnate in new avatars to help Earth through a transitional period of dramatic transformation, awakening and trauma.
Interdimensional ET beings told me, on January 10th, that a &quot;Global Disaster&quot; is coming.
Sure, it might be a figment of my imagination, it might be my subconscious self talking to me, but I&#39;m seeing signs everywhere that we&#39;re accelerating towards some incredibly dramatic events, some of which are literally transcendental in nature, and have to do with the foundations of our perception of space, time and our place in the cosmos.</p>

<p>I think the global disaster you&#39;re describing may be the future inexplicable disappearance of millions of people worldwide all at the same time. I think if millions of men, women, and children disappeared all at once, the world most certainly would be thrown into chaos. </p>

<p>There are two texts you should read on that site:</p>

<p>First &quot;NWO schedule of implementation&quot;. Then &quot;End Times programming&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about dead celebrities, and I don&#39;t agree with the writer on every issue he goes into, but he might be the best &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; I&#39;ve ever seen. He has some interesting, original perspectives on certain issues.</p>

<p>I think some of the celebrities are definitely being sacrificed by the Illuminati. Jared Leto will die sometime in the near future. (July 22nd at the latest. He&#39;ll die on a &quot;master number&quot; date, like Heath Ledger.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He won&#39;t be sacrificed, more likely his death will be faked. </p>

<p>and what you wrote would be more accurate if you replaced &quot;Illuminati&quot; with &quot;Intelligence&quot;</p>
