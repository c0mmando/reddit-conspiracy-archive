       I have heard of Correct the Record before and heard a number of individuals complaining about how bad it is. Its a superpac, I took their word for it without really delving into the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I looked Closer and found two concerning things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Correct the Record openly coordinates with the Hillary Campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is something that is normally illegal. A campaign and a superpac closely working together should result in much legal trouble. However, they seem to have found a loophole. Some exemptions not quite intended for this kind of collaboration are being used to justify their work as legal. Whether or not a court would agree with their lawyers, I do not know. At the end of the day, however, this is at least greatly unethical. It lets the Hillary campaign exert influence on how donations to other groups are being spent.
        </p>
        <p>
         And its not just me saying this. The Washington Post previously reported on this in May 2015:
         <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/12/how-a-super-pac-plans-to-coordinate-directly-with-hillary-clintons-campaign/">
          https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/12/how-a-super-pac-plans-to-coordinate-directly-with-hillary-clintons-campaign/
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Correct the record is spending money on astroturfing reddit.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of Correct the Records main projects right now is something called "Barrier Breakers 2016". Its goal is to produce "Positive Content" for supporters of Hillary on the internet. Doesn't sound too bad. One part of this is a cute campaign encouraging people to thank delegates for Hillary. The other part, which is concerning to me, is that they are spending over $1 Million dollars to target online communities on Facebook, Twitter, and our own Reddit. This is coming straight from them. Here is a direct quote from their press release: " Correct The Record will invest more than $1 million into Barrier Breakers 2016 activities, including the more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram.". If you want to read the whole thing, here it is:
         <a href="http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/">
          http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         Much of this is presented by them under the guise of combating online bullying. Don't get me wrong, any attempts to help combat harassment are welcome in my book, but offering a Hillary-Positive counter narrative and responding to criticism of Secretary Clinton aren't going to help victims. This looks a lot like astroturfing instead to me, and working along side the campaign in doing so.

       r/enoughsandersspam is very strange as well. It's a bunch of people leveling nothing but ad hominem attacks at Sanders and his supporters e.g. "He's annoying! They're annoying!" but way more toxic than that. Tons of derisive, reductive, condescending, just like, really mean stuff, most of it apolitical. Clinton gets her share of shade thrown at her, sure, but it's essentially all a response to her policies and actions, not her behavior (this is not always true, there's bad apples everywhere, whatchagonnado).
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, a lot of people who would feel disenfranchised or alienated otherwise take a lot of comfort in the security blanket provided them by the propaganda machine of the establishment, colloquially called a "rational, moderate, centrist opinion." It makes them feel normal, secure, part of a ideological community that will always be in the right by virtue of majority if not by virtue itself. Let's call it an unexamined reaction to existential dread. Challenging this upsets them, cognitive dissonance, yadda yadda yadda...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, all it takes is a couple interns setting up the space and tone for their echo chamber and if they can find an angle that resonates with
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       then it'll just get louder, attract more, and sustain itself. The angle they've seemed to settle on is "populist indignance toward the smug superiority of Sanders supporters" Personally, I do think Sanders supporters are smug, as they should be, 'cuz no matter what you think he is the only candidate you could call ethical. Sure you might have something like 50,000 people on reddit doing their best to ignore their candidate and shout down the other one, but it only takes like 50 people on a bunch of alts working 9-5, M-F to keep that "conversation" rolling.

       those from the /enough camps are blue-haired landwhales that cry muh-soggy-knee and ray-cis-sm on /srs and such.

       They are not bots or shills, just people of below-average IQ with years of "progressive" training. The same that attacked Ron Paul last two campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hate anything good and right if it comes from a white man. And since they live in a majority white country, that's a lot of things for them to hate

       I supported Ron Paul back when he was running because he stood against the establishment and made sense. I might not have agreed with a lot of his policies but he certainly couldn't be paid off and a lot of his libertarian values resonated with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support Bernie Sanders for many of the same reasons I supported Paul. Can't be bought off, working to better the lives of everyday Americans based on his views a lot of which I can get behind, i.e. universal healthcare, breaking up too big to fail, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you can drink the kool-aid and devolve into us vs them but don't bother trying to paint every liberal under the same brush.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can just as easily paint Trump/Cruz supporters as ignorant redneck hillbilly bible thumping racists but that's clearly just derisive stereotypes designed to drive people against each other when the true enemy is looking down at us from their ivory towers laughing.

       No such thing as "Bernie Bros" - ask anyone who bleats about it for proof of abuse from "Bernie Bros" and they just block you. It's straight facile playbook from the 2008 election and made me lose respect for so many journalists this year - what are they paid or how are they convinced to fall into line with such obvious vapid bullshit as this?

       And completely disenfranchising the female Sanders fans. I have never encountered a "Bernie Bro." As a woman, I've been called a "Bernie Bro" by angry Clinton supporters - and I'm actually probably going to be a "Johnson Sis."

       Simply for responding with counter arguments in the comments that run counter to the narrative they push, my posts are deleted by auto moderator citing the rule "no negative campaigning". Anything that isn't blatantly pro Hillary is removed under this rule. Don't take my word for it, browse there for a bit and you'll see plenty of comment graveyards.

       That's exactly what I mean.  Most Bernie supporters on Reddit love to defend his positions and take any opportunity to do it.  Last I was over "there", there was only vacant cheerleading and a conspicuous lack of actual activism.

        Here is the link from the group that is doing the astroturfing

       . I was wondering why all of a sudden
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was flooded with people defending Hillary. This hadn't been the case since I started commenting there. Now anything that isn't pro Hillary is being downvoted constantly. I've been arguing with these paid fools for a few weeks now. I finally decided to investigate today. I found the link to the group responsible for this, they aren't trying to hide it.

       are Trump trolls from 4chan and paid Hillary shills. They idly waste the time while they wait for the random normie to stop by. Then both sides pounce into action, trying to get the normie to join them or run them off depending on what the normie said.

       Considering the troll content I was responding to was worse, indeed there seems to be a pattern of shutting out people who have facts, and present them when necessary to correct the record.

       I used to be subscribed to politics and some of the other shitty, default subs and just finally realized it wasn't worth even browsing, much less posting. Call them what you want (neckbeards, SWJs, feminazis) there's a number of subreddits here that are run by mods who are on power trips and control content by heavily banning people. I mean, Reddit is forum site where people discuss things, right? If I can't partake in the discussion because they don't agree with me or don't like my opinions, then, like you said, why waste my time?
      </p>

       Funny thing is, I began enjoying Reddit a lot more by not being subscribed to those subs.

       I haven't been called too many names but I am being downvoted constantly which means that most people are ignoring the subs rules. I'm pretty strict with not voting based on opinion because I enjoy the discussion on that sub. Things are getting out of hand now though, I actually considered unsubscribing this morning.

       "Hillary is corrupt and here are some articles about it" is nowhere near the new tone over there, which is "Bernie supporters are human waste." Actual personal attacks on one side. HUGE difference.

       The tone did change. It was much more hillary friendly and slightly more anti bernie in the comments. But before it was pretty much only pro bernie, and any pro hillary comments were attacked (to good reason she's currupt). It was much more anti hillary. You would see the bernie bro comments and attacks against them but they had a lot of support from the cummunity because the majority is pro bernie. Now there is a pro hillary resistance trying to break through the real people

       Just FYI, I defend Hillary on r/politics all the time, and I've yet to receive any money from Correct the Record. I'm gonna need to find a way to apply, I'd love to get paid to do it.

       Frankly, I'm just sick of that sub being a one sided echo chamber for a candidate that is easily as flawed if not significantly more so than any of the other candidates. The amount of absurdly stupid shit spewed forth from that sub is obscene. I consider it a duty and a hobby to dispel bullshit. But please, tell me more about how I'm a fake account paid to spread propaganda.

       Because the implication was obviously that every single person who both goes on Reddit and supports Hilary is just a paid shill. The fact of the matter is that this is a thing that is happening and it's relevant to this conversation, not a personal attack on every Hilary supporter on Reddit.

       One of the first things a shill is supposed to do when this kind of blowing of the cover is out, is to create a comment trail attempting to feign victim-hood, therefore just 'can't be a shill!'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't suspect you of being a shill, but I do question your choice of candidate. In spite of everything that is out there about how this primary has played, you still blindly support the status quo.

       I haven't had any trouble with posts critical to Hillary, well other than being immediately downvoted, so I think most of the mods seem to be okay however there are a few posts made by a mod or two that shows a clear and enthusiastic bias against Sanders.

       Worst place on the Internet. It's clever tho, CTR realized they had no support in r politics, and that no new voters came in to r hillaryclinton, so they created political discussion as a way to circumvent that issue and appear to actually be having high minded "discussion" when all they do is fart out talking points.

       I've been saying this all over. I thought people knew it, but I guess most people just assumed it was a joke. I used to work in corporate social media. Never for a campaign like this one, because I like to be able to look at myself in the mirror, but there are trends to corporate astroturf campaigns that you can watch for. If you find yourself engaged with an account you believe to be a Correct the Record shill, disengage immediately, block, and report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things to watch for: very similar messaging from multiple users; talking points that change simultaneously with the campaign's; groups of pro-Hillary comments appearing in each thread at or about the same time--but never really in response to one another; aggressive gaslighting; aggressive demands for proof/evidence/links to tangential topics that deflect from your comment's point; dismissive, condescending pet names (dear, kid, bro, kiddo, honey, etc); "evidence" links from known pro-HRC publications (including and especially Blue Nation Review and Politifact, which is owned by Tampa Bay Times and has endorsed Clinton); and perhaps worst, which I started getting last week, private messages from said users that are aggressively hostile, demeaning, dismissive and accusatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are already perhaps a hundred such accounts on reddit, primarily in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       <a href="/r/politicaldiscussion">

       One was fairly alarming and I reported the user to the mods. That was three days ago. Today I got several snarky messages in response to a comment I made about getting shitty messages, but for the most part they've just been asshole comments. "Give it up, you lost" type things of varying hostility that are annoying but not necessarily harmful. It's a demoralization campaign, basically. I just block and move along. Except the one that I reported.

       I hate reporting, but I will report when it's obvious it's a user who's harassing others and trying to suppress free speech. Bet that's what all of them were up to. Problem with reporting all of them is that reports delete the message from your inbox - they need to fix that. Reporting abuse doesn't mean you yourself don't also want to document it.

       Threats sent via PMs do not "manipulate the tone" of a conversation - they intimidate users and keep them from speaking up. I've known people who've deleted their accounts here after some particularly nasty and targeted threats sent via PM. That's absolutely suppression of speech.

       I made fake accounts to join some of their subreddits (acting as if I was a Hillary supporter), and any time I questioned the fact that they were using misinformation or stretching the truth, INSTANTLY banned AND muted from contacting the moderators.

       Hiring a bunch of novices to astroturf would be clumsy and minimally productive, so I'm guessing that they probably hired a subcontracting company that has team(s) already working Reddit.

       I find it troubling that they are only concerned about online bullying.  I wish they would  devote some if the money to combat voter suppression bullying by the Clinton campaign and establishment DNC.

       They're not doing a very good job. The antiHillary shills and sockpuppets are much more effective.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For months now, [conservative group] America Rising has sent out a steady stream of posts on social media attacking Mrs. Clinton, some of them specifically designed to be spotted, and shared, by liberals. The posts highlight critiques of her connections to Wall Street and the Clinton Foundation and feature images of Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, interspersed with cartoon characters and pictures of Kevin Spacey, who plays the villain in “House of Cards.” And as they are read and shared, an anti-Clinton narrative is reinforced.
       </p>
       <p>
        American Crossroads, the group started by Karl Rove, has been sending out its own digital content.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conservative strategists and operatives say they are simply filling a vacuum on the far left, as well as applying the lesson they learned in 2012, when they watched in frustration as Mitt Romney was forced to expend time and resources in a protracted primary fight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Few Republicans are more familiar with that nightmare than Matt Rhoades, who was Mr. Romney’s campaign manager. He founded America Rising...its focus under Mr. Rhoades has been to subject Mrs. Clinton to an ordeal similar to Mr. Romney’s.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The idea is to make her life difficult in the primary and challenge her from the left,” said Colin Reed, America Rising’s executive director.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It can diminish enthusiasm for Hillary among the base over time,” he said. “And if you diminish enthusiasm, lukewarm support can translate into lackluster fund-raising and perhaps diminished turnout down the road.”

       Good for him. Meanwhile, I've been a supporter of Sen Sanders since he went (I). Right wing propaganda is easy to spot, if you have been exposed to it for 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, in an of itself, is no evidence Sander's supporters are being duped by the right. Sanders is the only candidate with a clear record.

       You can't buy a record, you make it.

       Be flattered Redditors. This website, and other technologies like it, are powerful enough to be perceived as a threat to the political establishment. So much of a threat that they are spending millions of dollars in an attempt to change the narrative on places like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Wikipedia, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A futile attempt, because the truth will always come out in the end.

       That is a good find OP. Nice research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of just assume crap like this happens, now OP has provided pretty concrete evidence of it. Does this fall under the banner of shilling? Probably, but hardly unexpected shilling. The main "dishonest" part is for the individuals participating to not disclose that they are paid to make their posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ads on TV, have disclosure requirements. Shouldn't ads in the form of Internet submissions or comments have the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I just ask as an aside, is there any other modern politician on the planet that plays dirtier than Bill and Hillary? They will stop at nothing up to and including murder and cocaine running if the rumors are true. Unquestionably the
       <em>
        bribes from foreign governments of questionable character
       </em>
       window is open for business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hardly the ideals needed to lead us back to a position of moral authority where the rest of the world trusts us to behave ethically. Shoot that
       <em>
        we trust us
       </em>
       to behave ethically. We have been lost in the wilderness at least since WWII.
