    <div class="md"><p>They were pushing &#39;progressive&#39; agendas like gay rights and trans rights, minorities, etc. </p>

<p>They were anti-border.  And pro immigration.</p>

<p>And as liberal myself, one thing that had always annoyed me was the narrative on both Stewart and Colbert that went like this, &quot;we need immigrants because white people won&#39;t pick fruit for 7 dollars an hour&quot;.  That&#39;s insulting because america isn&#39;t white people, it&#39;s everyone.  By that I mean white, black, chinese americans aren&#39;t going to find 7 dollars an hour acceptable because the job is hard, too low paying, you can&#39;t support a family on it, and frankly our educational system and culture is such that only the stupidest, dysambitous people don&#39;t have skills better than picking fruit.  Even labor jobs pay more because you need to know how to hang drywall or perform rudimentary plumbing. </p>

<p>Why is it acceptable for mexicans then to come and pick fruit?  Oh because they say our economy would collapse otherwise. Well first of all, that assumes that we can&#39;t dare ask corporations to pay their labor more while putting in a freeze of their current market prices.  Nope, that&#39;s regulation.  Conservatives have won that one.</p>

<p>But secondly, the subtext of that narrative is that it&#39;s ok for immigrants because they break rules anyway and live in multifamily situations in contravention of local single-family-occupancy ordinances, which allows them to bring down the cost of living so that 7/hr works for them.  And the laws aren&#39;t tough enough on illegals, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So my point overall is this: that Stewart and Colbert&#39;s immigration narrative created a subtext that justified the system: that secretly justified corporations&#39; ability to shirk their public responsibility to americans (not illegals), and to justify the governments inability to raise the minimum wage to a level that would be acceptable enough for a single person working 40 hrs to support himself in our society (rent apt, buy food, etc).</p>

<p>In other words, because of this mind control narrative, they were illuminati confirmed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same! Growing up I used to literally just repeat what they said when asked how I felt about whatever current events people were talking about. I didn&#39;t realize this; I thought I simply agreed with them, but in reality I was looking to them to make the decision for me because I was not willing or unable to do my own research and form my own opinions based on knowledge and fact. This is sadly the case for so many of my contemporaries, friends, everyone just fucking repeats shit they heard on the news -- they simply cannot be bothered to go outside their information bubble and find something that might break their echo chamber. It&#39;s a very awful cycle, and I know because I was there. Jon Stewart is a propagandist, do not fool yourself for one second -- there&#39;s a very simply reason why he used to visit the Whitehouse during his show years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you took the time to really express your ideas, rather than just simply expressing your incredulity at my seemingly unbelievable idea that these people who earn lots of money reaching millions of people and lauded by the entire mainstream media as some soothsayer wise-truth teller, might actually just be another arm of the propaganda machine? What a scary thought! Tell me -- when you listen to John Stewart, does he really invoke that sense of fearless tell-it-all comedy that say, George Carlin invokes when he speaks? I contend that if you truly listen to both acts, you will indeed notice a stark difference in tone and content. That is because George Carlin, unlike Stewart, is actually a fucking hero and doesn&#39;t cower behind some a deep-seated ideology, but actually is just someone who calls it like he sees it, and happens to be fucking hilarious while doing so. Stewart is funny, but he uses that humour to propagate his agenda, which happens to be the neo-liberal agenda that is fine with government and war as long as it adheres to neo-liberal marxist ideology. Open borders, atheistic, come-one, come all immigration policy, welfare are all things that are lauded as common sense, when in reality these are things that should be up for debate, and are not simply common sense. </p>

You can roast just beiber for pissing in a restaurant pucket..haha but the fucking president of united states engaging in a criminal war causing the death of millions...haha, is that entertainment or a Roast material of comedy? What fucking sick people would do that? Would you watch a  fabulous dinner roast comedy with Saddam laughing that his criminal war actions were based on lies and then air it on a national TV where the rest of America laughs with him? If you thought that was comedy or acceptable roast then this sickness is America itself. It continues with Obama laughing about killing children with drones at his dinner. These people are mocking us on purpose, stop laughing at their war crimes with them. Why would a comedian who supports the troops be at a fabulous White house dinner Laughing with Bush? The jokes is on those who don&#39;t get the truth. I got sick to my stomach when I watch here on the sub. I cant imagine how veterans of iraq would feel

<p>This isn&#39;t Soviet Russia. We&#39;re allowed to lambast our president. After all, we have &#39;the free press (TM)&#39;. That&#39;s how the media gains it&#39;s legitimacy and make people feel all nice and fuzzy about how we have freedom of speech.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how Colbert gets to go on air and take a dump on the President. It would be way too obvious for them to censor such an event and would do even more damage than to just chuckle at it and not make a scene.</p>

<p>Where shit gets insidious is when &#39;serious&#39; information gets disseminated - or in our case, not disseminated.</p>

<p>Our mainstream media is propaganda and always tows the party line but usually by omission. You can&#39;t complain about something if you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s happening. That&#39;s why you&#39;re not going to see an Iraqi kid burnt to a crisp or a soldier missing both legs from an IED attack. You&#39;re not going to see the grieving widows of both innocent Americans or Iraqis. Instead, all you&#39;re going to see is how we&#39;re always &#39;winning&#39; and how &#39;<em>they</em> hate us for <em>our</em> freedom&#39;. </p>

<p>The oldschool news and investigative journalists at least on major networks are of a bygone era. Our propaganda media works because it&#39;s effective in having the aire of legitimacy, showing basically infotainment while not really informing viewers of anything at all.</p>

<p>Even those living in Soviet Russia had a rough idea of how much their state run propaganda lies but talk to a majority of Americans about how the media is propaganda and they&#39;ll tell you to take off your tinfoil hat. Because they actually <em>believe</em> that shit. And that&#39;s how propaganda is effective.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now if you want a dose of actual journalism which has been more or less sidelined, here goes. They&#39;re all long but they&#39;ll give you far more truth and knowledge than months of watching &#39;the news&#39;.

<p>In part, but people listen to the sources that make them feel happy.  Conservatives tune into FOX, liberals go to MSNBC.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve pointed out several times (to family and friends) how information is presented as the truth, but in fact, it&#39;s either lies or so convoluted and twisted it may as well be lies.  In the end, my mom put it best, &#39;I listen to what I want to listen to, not to the truth.&#39;  </p>

<p>Just like rooting for a sports team, politics is about winning and losing, not fair rules, fair refs, and players follow the rules.  It&#39;s about my team winning.</p>

It certainly was approved to mock and make us feel helpless by diluting  the war crimes of iraq by serving it as comedy by everyone&#39;s  favorite comedian Stephen Colbert. I am surprised people on this sub are here to debate conspiracy but still some convince themselves  the hand picked clown Colbert while delivering his pre-scripted lines somehow &quot;Critiqued&quot; Bush for war crimes. They fucking laughed at us together while they ate expense dinner paid by your taxes.

<p>Oh because they say our economy would collapse otherwise. Well first of all, that assumes that we can&#39;t dare ask corporations to pay their labor more while putting in a freeze of their current market prices. Nope, that&#39;s regulation. Conservatives have won that one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you forget that corporations don&#39;t give a shit about where they source their goods?</p>

<p>If US farmers suddenly start paying high wages (even $7/hr is high for fruit/produce picking by current standards), that&#39;ll just mean companies will start importing more produce from places like Mexico.</p>

<p>Wages don&#39;t exist in a vacuum and haven&#39;t for many decades. Pretending that it&#39;s somehow immigrants&#39; fault that picking vegetables can&#39;t pay a decent wage is just asinine when you&#39;re competing with produce pickers in third world countries who would be elated with a dollar an hour.</p>

<p>In any case, laughing at a problem only assists in making people laugh themselves into passivity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find Chris Hedges description of Stewart and Colbert to capture their true nature excellently: <a href="https://youtu.be/zwrXpIwwvRk?t=431">Video, begins at about 7:12</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Satire becomes destroyed in essence in the hands of figures like Colbert, John Stewart and others,&quot; Hedges asserts. &quot;<strong>They will attack the excesses or the foibles of the system, but they are never going to expose the system itself because they are all millionaires</strong>, they are commercially supported. You have very few people (George Carlin was one) who will stand up and do it. If you do that, it is tough to make a living. Carlin maybe being the exception. But if you really use Satire the way Swift used Satire, to expose the English barbarity in Ireland because culture, like everything else in the society has been completely corporatized.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is not a question of theology,” the ruling reads in part. “The FSM Gospel is plainly a work of satire, meant to entertain while making a pointed political statement. To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a ‘religious exercise’ on any other work of fiction.</p>

<p>Really? You&#39;ve never read Wilheim Reich? The New York Intellectuals? Ramparts magazine? PLAYBOY?</p>

<p>Yeah, I know - &quot;reading is hard&quot; - but really.</p>

But even if he was, I don&#39;t understand the leap from &quot;there was a group of influential Marxist professors who taught social sciences around the 1950s-80s&quot; to &quot;there is a global movement in effect to destroy all cultural concepts, like what the People&#39;s Republic of China did but way more slow and effective&quot;</p>

<p>Um, yes?</p>

<p>The articles were excellent, and they published a huge number of CIA authors.</p>

<p>Remember, folks, &quot;grungebot&quot; tried to discount the idea that Cultural Marxism was a &quot;thing&quot; - then, when confronted with the list of names of authors that promoted Cultural Marxism, &quot;grungebot&quot; tries to spin it and blow it off.</p>

<p>If &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; wasn&#39;t &quot;a thing&quot; - why would &quot;grungebot&quot; bother?</p>

<p>I think &quot;grungebot&quot; protests too much ...</p>

<p>The Nazis didn&#39;t call themselves &quot;Nazis&quot; either - your point?</p>

<p>Check it out - grungebot admit that these professors are &quot;Marxist&quot; - and &quot;cultural&quot; - but complains when they are labeled &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot; - because that&#39;s not a &quot;thing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t say they got rid of Stewart or Colbert. Stewart was dead tired of doing the Daily Show, you could see it in his eyes and voice during the last season. He also said it himself that he wants to do something different. Now he is working with animals.</p>

<p>Colbert&#39;s ratings were falling before John left. Wilmore replaces that slot, but has been abysmal in the ratings. I tried watching one episode of Wilmore and couldn&#39;t get through the entire thing.</p>

<p>I like Noah replacing John. He is doing rather well and funny and relevant. He also pokes fun at people that deserve it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t go into John Oliver&#39;s HBO show? Why? He is doing very well and is making an impact at times to right the bullshit.</p>

<p>The only thing you are right about is The Onion. Which is sad, but we all saw that one coming. </p>
