       They were pushing 'progressive' agendas like gay rights and trans rights, minorities, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were anti-border.  And pro immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as liberal myself, one thing that had always annoyed me was the narrative on both Stewart and Colbert that went like this, "we need immigrants because white people won't pick fruit for 7 dollars an hour".  That's insulting because america isn't white people, it's everyone.  By that I mean white, black, chinese americans aren't going to find 7 dollars an hour acceptable because the job is hard, too low paying, you can't support a family on it, and frankly our educational system and culture is such that only the stupidest, dysambitous people don't have skills better than picking fruit.  Even labor jobs pay more because you need to know how to hang drywall or perform rudimentary plumbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it acceptable for mexicans then to come and pick fruit?  Oh because they say our economy would collapse otherwise. Well first of all, that assumes that we can't dare ask corporations to pay their labor more while putting in a freeze of their current market prices.  Nope, that's regulation.  Conservatives have won that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But secondly, the subtext of that narrative is that it's ok for immigrants because they break rules anyway and live in multifamily situations in contravention of local single-family-occupancy ordinances, which allows them to bring down the cost of living so that 7/hr works for them.  And the laws aren't tough enough on illegals, otherwise it wouldn't happen.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So my point overall is this: that Stewart and Colbert's immigration narrative created a subtext that justified the system: that secretly justified corporations' ability to shirk their public responsibility to americans (not illegals), and to justify the governments inability to raise the minimum wage to a level that would be acceptable enough for a single person working 40 hrs to support himself in our society (rent apt, buy food, etc).
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, because of this mind control narrative, they were illuminati confirmed
       </p>

       Same! Growing up I used to literally just repeat what they said when asked how I felt about whatever current events people were talking about. I didn't realize this; I thought I simply agreed with them, but in reality I was looking to them to make the decision for me because I was not willing or unable to do my own research and form my own opinions based on knowledge and fact. This is sadly the case for so many of my contemporaries, friends, everyone just fucking repeats shit they heard on the news -- they simply cannot be bothered to go outside their information bubble and find something that might break their echo chamber. It's a very awful cycle, and I know because I was there. Jon Stewart is a propagandist, do not fool yourself for one second -- there's a very simply reason why he used to visit the Whitehouse during his show years.

       My red flag went up when Colbert hosted that presidential dinner at the White House back when Bush 2.0 was still in office. I thought to myself..."wow, they're all really having a good time." It looked a lot like a peek behind a curtain.

       I'm glad you took the time to really express your ideas, rather than just simply expressing your incredulity at my seemingly unbelievable idea that these people who earn lots of money reaching millions of people and lauded by the entire mainstream media as some soothsayer wise-truth teller, might actually just be another arm of the propaganda machine? What a scary thought! Tell me -- when you listen to John Stewart, does he really invoke that sense of fearless tell-it-all comedy that say, George Carlin invokes when he speaks? I contend that if you truly listen to both acts, you will indeed notice a stark difference in tone and content. That is because George Carlin, unlike Stewart, is actually a fucking hero and doesn't cower behind some a deep-seated ideology, but actually is just someone who calls it like he sees it, and happens to be fucking hilarious while doing so. Stewart is funny, but he uses that humour to propagate his agenda, which happens to be the neo-liberal agenda that is fine with government and war as long as it adheres to neo-liberal marxist ideology. Open borders, atheistic, come-one, come all immigration policy, welfare are all things that are lauded as common sense, when in reality these are things that should be up for debate, and are not simply common sense.

       Bro my first comment was legit. I disagree on many levels. My follow up was both meant to piss you off and to inform you that I was busy. I still haven't read your msg and I'm sorry for that. I looked at it and saw this block of text and said to myself, "I don't have time for this right now so I will be a jerk". And I did. Hey, you deserve better and I'm sorry. I don't give a shit about reddit karma so points or no points I change my views for no-one. I will however review your msg  comment and give you a response that is more in depth than my previous two... I'm not always a jerk. Hope all is well, expect something more from me. Enjoy your evening.

       You weren't just being brainwashed you were being mocked as well! Kinda like when Stephen Colbert did that  White House dinner and George W. Bush joked about not finding  WMDs and they laughed together about the millions of Iraqis and thousands of American soldiers who lost their lives and their mind in that Corporate War in Iraq. I was never a liberal but that fucking Stephen Colbert joined in that mockery of deaths of millions. Fuck him! I can never watch these fucking soul-less puppets and the next week he was fucking pretending to be for the Veterans. They feed off mocking us.

       You missed the point indeed, on national media a guest of elites got together to roast / laugh with the President on Criminal actions he committed? You can roast just beiber for pissing in a restaurant pucket..haha but the fucking president of united states engaging in a criminal war causing the death of millions...haha, is that entertainment or a Roast material of comedy? What fucking sick people would do that? Would you watch a  fabulous dinner roast comedy with Saddam laughing that his criminal war actions were based on lies and then air it on a national TV where the rest of America laughs with him? If you thought that was comedy or acceptable roast then this sickness is America itself. It continues with Obama laughing about killing children with drones at his dinner. These people are mocking us on purpose, stop laughing at their war crimes with them. Why would a comedian who supports the troops be at a fabulous White house dinner Laughing with Bush? The jokes is on those who don't get the truth. I got sick to my stomach when I watch here on the sub. I cant imagine how veterans of iraq would feel

       If he were mocking the president of the United States it wouldn't have been aired.  What we watch on American TV is completely scripted so we follow the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took Obama 2 terms to get out of Iraq but his 2008 promise was to get out immediately.  The POTUS has been bought for a long time and the corporations are in control.

       This isn't Soviet Russia. We're allowed to lambast our president. After all, we have 'the free press (TM)'. That's how the media gains it's legitimacy and make people feel all nice and fuzzy about how we have freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how Colbert gets to go on air and take a dump on the President. It would be way too obvious for them to censor such an event and would do even more damage than to just chuckle at it and not make a scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where shit gets insidious is when 'serious' information gets disseminated - or in our case, not disseminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our mainstream media is propaganda and always tows the party line but usually by omission. You can't complain about something if you don't even know it's happening. That's why you're not going to see an Iraqi kid burnt to a crisp or a soldier missing both legs from an IED attack. You're not going to see the grieving widows of both innocent Americans or Iraqis. Instead, all you're going to see is how we're always 'winning' and how '
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       hate us for
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       freedom'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The oldschool news and investigative journalists at least on major networks are of a bygone era. Our propaganda media works because it's effective in having the aire of legitimacy, showing basically infotainment while not really informing viewers of anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even those living in Soviet Russia had a rough idea of how much their state run propaganda lies but talk to a majority of Americans about how the media is propaganda and they'll tell you to take off your tinfoil hat. Because they actually
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that shit. And that's how propaganda is effective.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Now if you want a dose of actual journalism which has been more or less sidelined, here goes. They're all long but they'll give you far more truth and knowledge than months of watching 'the news'. That is if you can actually read something for longer than 5 minutes given how conditioned we've become towards reading.

       I've pointed out several times (to family and friends) how information is presented as the truth, but in fact, it's either lies or so convoluted and twisted it may as well be lies.  In the end, my mom put it best, 'I listen to what I want to listen to, not to the truth.'

       Colbert performed the most blatant critique of a President the correspondents dinner has seen.  It's normally a much gentler roast.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also in no way joined in the mocking of the seriousness of the Iraq war, and both he and Stewart criticized Bush for that skit.

       We are on r/conspiracy thread here, we are awake enough to know the Whitehouse chose/ invited Colbert on purpose, his fucking bullshit was scripted and approved by the Bush PR team. It certainly was approved to mock and make us feel helpless by diluting  the war crimes of iraq by serving it as comedy by everyone's  favorite comedian Stephen Colbert. I am surprised people on this sub are here to debate conspiracy but still some convince themselves  the hand picked clown Colbert while delivering his pre-scripted lines somehow "Critiqued" Bush for war crimes. They fucking laughed at us together while they ate expense dinner paid by your taxes. Like I say, step deeper into the Rabbit hole further,your eyes are wide shut.  you ain't seeing the whole picture yet.

       You can believe in some conspiracy theories while also not believing that everything in the world is scripted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have gone down just about every rabbit hole available over 15 years of reading this stuff.  I haven't found a lot of them very convincing.  I certainly haven't seen any evidence of Colbert and Stewart having lines written for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can certainly believe that everyone in the government and the media is just laughing at all the peasants and everyone is controlled, but to me it's a lot more likely that it's a lot more complicated and there's good and bad people everywhere.  I don't think it's as hopeless as you.

       Amen to everything you say.  Their leftist cognitive dissonance is that we need immigrants because the economy depends on slave wage labor, but also that all righteous workers all deserve $15/hr or more.

       Mexicans don't want to pick fruit in the hot sun any more than anyone else.  Our failed school system cranks out enough unskilled, uneducated labor that we don't need to import more.

       You can't freeze market prices because it's a global market that the US doesn't control.  That's literally one of the stupidest, most ignorant, ideas I've ever heard.  It's damn near jingoist in how much power it assumes the US has over world markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, if you froze prices in the US and market prices rise, don't you think farmers would be angry?  What are you going to charge for those crops on the world market?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is against that because it's regulation.  They're against it because it's stupid and will never, ever work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not a farmer, shut up about agriculture.  I guarantee you have no idea what you're talking about.

        Oh because they say our economy would collapse otherwise. Well first of all, that assumes that we can't dare ask corporations to pay their labor more while putting in a freeze of their current market prices. Nope, that's regulation. Conservatives have won that one.

       Did you forget that corporations don't give a shit about where they source their goods?
      </p>
      <p>
       If US farmers suddenly start paying high wages (even $7/hr is high for fruit/produce picking by current standards), that'll just mean companies will start importing more produce from places like Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wages don't exist in a vacuum and haven't for many decades. Pretending that it's somehow immigrants' fault that picking vegetables can't pay a decent wage is just asinine when you're competing with produce pickers in third world countries who would be elated with a dollar an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - ITT: People who don't understand basic economics who recoil at the thought that they may be wrong so they resort to burying such uncomfortable words instead.

       Nope you're wrong.  The market has spoken. People are willing to pay 5 dollars for free range organic eggs.  They are also willing to pay more for 1) non gmo / organic, 2) made in america, 3) fair trade, 4) from employee-owned companies (ex: alvarado st bakery), 5) healthy food in general made by companies that are responsible that pay their employees well.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are not robots who pay for the lowest cost commodity as you and some of the shittyeconomists seem to think.  People are actually tired of shitty mass market food that tries to kill them or make them fat or give them crohns.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are willing to pay more because food has become politicized.  You're thinking on this subject is not unlike a grade school version of 80s high school economics class--it ignores modern trends and the enhanced political knowledge of todays internet-enabled consumer

       I'd argue the end game is to control behavior, but do so in a way that people don't realize their behavior is being controlled. Generalizing, but older people are easier to manipulate by fear, and younger people are easier to manipulate by entertainment.

       There have been studies on this and they've shown that comedy is more influential in people's opinions than fear mongering.  They say that to cement an idea that you should make a joke in your talks every 5 minutes.  When you listen to an engaging, entertaining speaker that is transmitting knowledge, listen for those 'cementing' jokes, usually they punctuate the strongest statements so they 'stick' in the audience's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example in the domain of conspiracy is Michael Parenti-- listen to one of his talks and you'll be able to spot this easily, as he is very good at doing this in his talks.

       It's the same effect: control. And you only mention the method - what if fear and humor were both in the same cause? And they only did it different because they had a plethora of data on what psychological manipulations worked on what generation and age range?

       I find Chris Hedges description of Stewart and Colbert to capture their true nature excellently:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/zwrXpIwwvRk?t=431">
        Video, begins at about 7:12
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Satire becomes destroyed in essence in the hands of figures like Colbert, John Stewart and others," Hedges asserts. "
        <strong>
         They will attack the excesses or the foibles of the system, but they are never going to expose the system itself because they are all millionaires
        </strong>
        , they are commercially supported. You have very few people (George Carlin was one) who will stand up and do it. If you do that, it is tough to make a living. Carlin maybe being the exception. But if you really use Satire the way Swift used Satire, to expose the English barbarity in Ireland because culture, like everything else in the society has been completely corporatized."

       I agree, but lots of people eat his shit up, my social group included, even though the jokes are so formulaic. His "Donald Drumpf" meme has reached tens of millions of people I think. So he definitely has influence.

       His drumpf piece was a means to omit the fact that trumps family was originally from bohemia / heidelberg, the epicenter of both a failed protestant alchemical movement to transform europe by frederich V 'winter king' (which was connected to the failed Jesuit Gunpowder plot to kidnap fred's future wife to install her as a catholic puppet queen), as well as headquarters of the the occult nazi ss.  It's actually pretty damned specific area of what's now germany.  E: Anyone from there would be from the epicenter of the rosicrucian movement

       IMO, they were/are controlled as well. i've always thought that some views are allowed to give people a means to vent. you are given the
       <em>
        impression
       </em>
       that there is another opinion. a slick way of maintaining control.

       The conspiracy theory is that the retirement and promotion were cover to get two big political influences our of the public discourse.  The Daily Show is much less influential without Jon at the helm and Colbert has had to be much less political at CBS.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were both champions of pointing out the bullshit of the media and political classes.  I do think that there is something lost without their commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly not unreasonable to think there was corporate pressure considering they work for one of the big 6 media conglomerates like everyone on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's much crazier conspiracies that gain traction here.  I'm not sure why this one is out of the question.

       One could argue Colbert got neutered in exchange for a much bigger paycheck. I don't think that's entirely true, as though he was successful as a comedian in using satire, I don't think he was politically effective as a satirist, certainly not in the way Hicks or Carlin were. He was never anyone TPTB needed to be afraid of, as he was just employing satire to get some laughs, never to rock the boat.

       Corporations own US media. Comedy Central is owned by Viacom which is the 3rd or 4th largest media conglomerate in the country and they're not liberals, they're capitalists pandering to the youth liberal demographic who didn't realize that those shows are a form of subversion.

       The upper class divides the lower classes through media and academia using divisive labels like left or right, black or white, male or female, religious or non religious, etc...

       All the major media outlets are corporate owned and work together as an oligopoly that works together to control dissent and keep the public divided rather than united.

       I noticed that also.  This is when you absolutely must know that everything coming through the tv is statist propaganda, and you should apply the same level of critical viewing when you watch streaming on amazon and netflix.  You can still enjoy your life, but keep your eyes peeled for the propaganda.

       No Agenda podcast. Great news dissection and analysis. They watch CSPAN so you don't have to. Also, FOX MSNBC CNN ABC NPR... etc. They don't take advertisement money. They cannot be censored. Plenty of yucks.

       I usually only get my news from RT. It's not corporate owned, it's government owned. I usually consider most news sources to be biased, but you cannot remain completely in the dark if you want to know what is actually going on the in the world. otherwise, you wouldn't be part of the enlightnment. However, there are certain news sources that I would not trust whatsoever, (ie: any western sources which would clearly have an American or pro-EU bias to them, as they are prone to globalist shilling.)

       OH. so you DO read the news? Your posts gave the impression that you didn't trust any source. When people ask questions like "where do you get your news from"? And you respond: "no one"; usually that would be taken as an (unfounded) opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you could lay the groundwork for your opinion better. Might seem less biased if people think you've actually followed news from this planet, researched it, and come up with your own opinion.

       I actually watched Larry Wilmore's godawful show once just for a laugh, it's actually painful to watch him plod along those 17 minutes one failed joke at a time. Something about it being the same writers except coming out of his mouth somehow illustrates just how full of shit these comedy central shows really are, it's all statist propaganda, but at least Stewart and Colbert were funny enough to keep me under the spell for a long time, Wilmore is just fucking awful!

       Colbert is gone because he got a better offer. Stewart is gone because he wanted to go after many years. I know nothing about the Onion. No one is pushing any agenda when it comes to Colbert. I'm sure that the Comedy Channel would take him back in a heart beat. These guys are performers; entertainers. They are talented but I don't see any conspiracy here at all.

       Cultural Marxism is all about being "liberal" on "social issues."

       I haven't read any Reicht, but I've read snippets about him in old Village Voices.  He wasn't a cultural analyst though, was he?  But even if he was, I don't understand the leap from "there was a group of influential Marxist professors who taught social sciences around the 1950s-80s" to "there is a global movement in effect to destroy all cultural concepts, like what the People's Republic of China did but way more slow and effective"

       Are you sure he was a cultural analyst?  I can only find credentials of his as a psychoanalyst who happened to have really strong opinions on cultural conditioning.

       Remember, folks, "grungebot" tried to discount the idea that Cultural Marxism was a "thing" - then, when confronted with the list of names of authors that promoted Cultural Marxism, "grungebot" tries to spin it and blow it off.

       I guess I was "quibbing about the label" to begin with, because as far as I can tell, it refers to some kind of academia-rooted conspiracy.  You haven't provided any evidence that it's "a thing" beyond some completely arbitrary label that has been posthumously applied to a given subset of Marxist professors and applied randomly to modern-day politicians

       Check it out - grungebot admit that these professors are "Marxist" - and "cultural" - but complains when they are labeled "Cultural Marxists" - because that's not a "thing."

       You can't say they got rid of Stewart or Colbert. Stewart was dead tired of doing the Daily Show, you could see it in his eyes and voice during the last season. He also said it himself that he wants to do something different. Now he is working with animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colbert's ratings were falling before John left. Wilmore replaces that slot, but has been abysmal in the ratings. I tried watching one episode of Wilmore and couldn't get through the entire thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like Noah replacing John. He is doing rather well and funny and relevant. He also pokes fun at people that deserve it.

       You don't go into John Oliver's HBO show? Why? He is doing very well and is making an impact at times to right the bullshit.

       It actually makes me mad that I can't trust anything any more. I read the News and instantly I think "Is this trustworthy?" and "Who is behind this paper and what agendas will they most likely be pushing?"

        What exactly was Marxist about Colbert or Stewart? I don't remember them being very liberal on much but social issues.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Cultural Marxism is all about being "liberal" on "social issues."
      </p>
      <p>
       Stewart and Colbert are Democrat party hacks.

        You haven't provided any evidence that it's "a thing" beyond some completely arbitrary label that has been posthumously applied to a given subset of Marxist professors

      <p>
       Check it out - grungebot admit that these professors are "Marxist" - and "cultural" - but complains when they are labeled "Cultural Marxists" - because that's not a "thing."
