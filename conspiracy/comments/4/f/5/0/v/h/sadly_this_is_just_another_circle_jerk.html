<p>This subreddit is a thinking ground. Above all else, we respect everyone&#39;s opinions and ALL religions. We hope to challenge issues which have captured the publicâ€™s imagination, from JFK to 9/11. This is a forum for free thinking, not hate speech. Respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind.
Our intentions are aimed towards a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.</p>

<p>I asked a couple of questions and all I got was jokes and hate rhetoric about the group I had questions for.  Some of you have similar behavior to those you are against. </p>

How is opening a discussion and possibly having the opportunity to share your opinion wrong.  I can&#39;t claim everyone in this group is skewed in their thinking but everyone who has answered my posts has been.  Assuming that everyone is a lost cause because of their current beliefs is a dangerous opinion.  I doubt you always believed everything you do and I assume a large amount of your old beliefs are no longer valid or rational opinions to you.

    <div class="md"><p>Because by opening the discussion on flat-earth and giving them the opportunity to share their opinions will not only distracts from actual real world problems that we are currently facing, but has the potential of insinuating itself in the minds of the naive and gullible and further propagating this bullshit beyond whichever organisation that originally started this meme.

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t the divide and conquer tactic be working then because you are alienating people who basically believe what you do, except the shape of the earth.  It seems you have similar sentiments on other things. If you have read my questions I don&#39;t believe flat earth, I am just not vilifying them for having different beliefs than me.  In many ways the logic of &quot;we can&#39;t let them discuss this because we don&#39;t believe it and we find it damaging&quot; seems to be similar from what a large deal of people opposed to TPB are trying to prevent.  If you fail to see any similarities between the two I think your judgement is a little suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHA what.  I stated I didn&#39;t believe them long before this post or interacting with you.  You are a waste of my time and your position and logic are frightening and sad.  I am spending time trying to understand what they believe because I am interested in it.  Similar to how people research things they are unfamiliar with to get a better understanding.  Asking questions doesn&#39;t imply belief and I find it worrisome that people in a thread about conspiracies have such a hard time seeing how damaging their thought process is.

<p>If you condone, (as others replying to you contend,) that calling flat earthers mentally deficient then you condone that same language be used against you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I believe it is being abused (LOL!) by the <em>safe space</em> throng.</p>

<p>When clinicians teach an addict to avoid places where triggers occur, often times they fail to reinforce the responsibility of the addict to use self control, tools, buddy systems etc.</p>

<p>Alcohol is a socially accepted drug, its everywhere...so a heroin addict has to seek out the fix actively. In a group, a needle user went off about whining alcoholics triggering her! That they were weak and had no idea what real addiction was. </p>

<p>I was stunned! She had missed something very important in her treatment, she was <em>staffed</em> to repeat a few modules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once people begin to understand why they flip out over religion, they&#39;ll start to understand why they freak out over conspiracy theories. Hearing that the government is responsible for 9/11, or whatever, is the same as hearing that the story of Noah&#39;s Ark is taken almost verbatim from Sumerian texts. The patriot is just as offended as the fundamentalist when presented evidence contrary to his worldview and seeks to dismiss, suppress or ridicule it.</p>
