       George Soros is a major funder of the Drug Policy Alliance, and has spent like $80 million to legalize Cannabis in Uruguay and the US.
This seems like a good thing. But what are his motives? Why?

       Hmmm.. perhaps. It would definitely be wise to invest into the cannabis business.

       I've also read some shit of him having a connection with Monsanto, and that GMO Cannabis is on the agenda?

       Hmm... I don't think so.
       <br/>
       It's seems as if we have polarization right now; the pro-legalization side and the anti-legalization side. After it would be legalized, it would become more and more socially accepted like alcohol.

       What the fuck does freedom and control over your own body have to do with egalitarianism? It's hypocrite to ban cannabis, but allow more dangerous drugs such as alcohol. Legalization is in fact fixing problems. No more mass incarceration for doing something that causes no harm to others. It's crazy that the biggest danger of a drug is getting caught with it...

       I know what egalitarianism is, this has nothing to do with it. This is about personal freedom, not equality. Cannabis is far less dangerous than alcohol, go do your fucking research. You know nothing about Cannabis. Comparing it to public masturbation? Ahahah what a joke... Oh? So you think it's fair when someone gets locked up for 13 years over 2 joints? Surely that has less implications on a person than if he would continue his cannabis use... You fucking troll...

       What a joke, even coffee is more addictive than Cannabis. And the gateway drug theory has been widely debunked by many. Let's not get started about the many positive effects of Cannabis, it's anti-carcinogenic properties and it's many many medical uses... And you don't even need to smoke it. You can use vaporizers and edibles, so no harm to your lungs whatsoever then.

        Cannabis has many medical applications:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Google for "Patent 6630507" which proves that it has medical applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's one notable example:

      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ask me for a citation on these, I already gave you 2 pieces of evidence that it has medical uses, do some research yourself.

        Gateway theory debunked
       </strong>
       :

       <a href="http://www.alternet.org/drugs/debunking-5-biggest-myths-about-pot">
        http://www.alternet.org/drugs/debunking-5-biggest-myths-about-pot
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.hightimes.com/read/scientists-debunk-theory-pot-gateway-drug">
        http://www.hightimes.com/read/scientists-debunk-theory-pot-gateway-drug
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many proponents of the gateway drug theory use statistics in a misleading manner, for example citing that a high percentage of heroin users previously used marijuana in an effort to imply that a high percentage of marijuana users go on to use heroin, when the two are not the same at all. Even if it was established that 100% of heroin users had previously used marijuana, it would not follow that their marijuana usage was a causative factor in their progression to heroin, nor does it prove that 100% of marijuana users (or even a statistically significant percentage of marijuana users) later used heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an argument that the prohibition of marijuana can lead users to buy from people who may also sell heroin, but this would suggest a problem with the law rather than the drug itself. Look at alcohol; in reality only a very small percentage of the people who use alcohol, move onto "harder" substances. The same goes for Cannabis, but if Cannabis would be legalized, this percentage would be even lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, tell me again why we're better off with criminalization of Cannabis rather than legalization?

       Hmm... I don't think so.
       <br/>
       It's seems as if we have polarization right now; the pro-legalization side and the anti-legalization side. After it would be legalized, it would become more and more socially accepted like alcohol.
