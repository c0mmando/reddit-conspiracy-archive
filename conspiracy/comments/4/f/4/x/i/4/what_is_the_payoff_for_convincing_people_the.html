However, one of the many glaring issues I have with the Flat Earth is I don&#39;t really see a pay off for tricking people to believe in the globe earth.  However, I do see how tricking people into believing the flat earth divides the &quot;conspiracy&quot; community and helps promote the &quot;popular&quot; opinion that conspiracy theorists are mentally unstable. (I mean no personal attack on the mental stability of a believer of the flat earth,  I assume most of you can admit the general public would perceive your beliefs as mental instability or simply ignorance) Personally I think most rational people would admit conspiracies exist and take place. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that exposing easily proved, easily accepted lies to gain trust in your beliefs.  Remove whoever you perceive the powers that be are and then expose the flat earth.</p>

<p>Are you more concerned with exposing the flat earth and losing the support of large number of the people or are you more concerned stopping what you view as the manipulative forces?</p>

<p>I am asking these questions genuinely and mean no disrespect.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I am more concerned with stopping the manipulative forces.  I believe the Flat Earth Disinformation Operation (FEDO) is an effort to start a civil war in which the dumb conspiracy theorists kill the intelligent conspiracy theorists.  The people behind FEDO literally have employed hypnosis techniques to brainwash their victims.  You can watch Eric Dubay&#39;s &quot;200 proofs&quot; and note the spinning hypnotic horizon during &quot;proof&quot; 1.  BTW, proof 1 is disproven for you on <a href="/r/trueearth">/r/trueearth</a>.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth Delusion is basically pretty dumb.  When it is so easy to disprove every claim made by the FED side, one has to assume the followers of FED are pretty dumb open-minded people.  I call them the Flat Earth Zombies, or the FEZ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the off chance that you are really a curious onlooker, here is an outline:</p>

<ol>
<li>The &quot;Flat Earth&quot; posts started around Nov 2014.  The evidence for this would be Google Search Terms history, and the lack of YouTube videos on the subject prior to Oct 2014.</li>
<li>This was be around the time that Eric Dubay published his &quot;200 proofs&quot; video on YouTube stating that the earth is flat.</li>
<li>That video literally contains hypnosis:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5i_iDyUTCg&amp;amp;t=8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5i_iDyUTCg&amp;amp;t=8</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Why is the horizon rotating at 5 rpm?  That&#39;s a neural entrainment technique.  The audio overdub states that the horizon is &quot;flat&quot; for 360 degrees.</p>

<p>The horizon is like a hula-hoop.  It&#39;s a circle on the globe and it curves around you.  But you are nearly in the middle of it, looking out.  So it appears level, just as you can look on a hula-hoop edge on.</p>

<p>Put a lego man on a really big yoga ball.  Put a hula-hoop on the ball.  That is the horizon.  To lego man, it looks flat.  To put it more accurately, it appears level, and it is declined below the 90-degree angle that a flat earth would make.  Depending on how tall you are, H, it is arccos ( ( R + H ) / R ) degrees and not 90, the flat earth angle.</p>

<p>So, we look at the beginning of this Internet movement, and we find:</p>

<p>A) False claims, that the author surely must already know are false.
B) Hypnosis techniques
C) 200 examples of this</p>

<p>Getting back to the timeline, we have:
4) Now there is an Internet movement of Flat Earth followers who are the fallen ones.  They believed all the lies, watched the hypnosis, and their language brains are entrained on the messages being sent through Dubay.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a war thing, but it&#39;s psychological operations.  Perhaps World War III will be a combined arms, cyber and psy, war.  Perhaps it started already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. I put myself neutral to this notion whether the earth is flat or not, but for discussions sake I will share the first reason that come to mind if this was all to be true.</p>

<p>If the earth was flat and everything was revolving around us that would be a strong argument for an existing God and us being at the center of creation and not just a coincidence of natural laws. I imagine it would unify and empower all people.
On the other hand. If people believe we are just one, of an unimaginable amount, of balls spinning in a wast universe, it might distance one from God and make people feel much less empowered and insignificant.</p>

<p>I agree that without scorn and ridicule of the Flat Earth Delusion victims, this sub will go further downhill.  Unfortunately, the mods here love to ban for scorn and ridicule (&quot;Rule 10&quot;) and at least one of them (ambiguously_ironic) seems rather too sympathetic to the delusion.  Finally, thread deletion would be the best choice, but the mods here are under the misconception that the best thing is to leave the ridiculous threads.</p>
