        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see a disproportionate number of nestle brands represented and I am part of growing group of people saying no to Nestle.  For example, Nestle owns every pizza brand at walmart but 3: sasquatch, totinos (general mills) and screamin&#39; sicilian.  Screamin sicilian is extremely good btw.</p>

<p>Since my stand by Totinos offers no palatable vegetarian choices, I went looking for alternatives.  I found that Nestle&#39;s damn pizza takes up the half of one frozen isle at walmart.  I was only able to find 3 pizza brands that weren&#39;t from my loathesome arch-enemy Nestle, the Sweeney Todd of food industrialists, the demon powder of milk street.  </p>

<p>In case you&#39;re wondering where I&#39;m getting this, I assayed <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4a7fau/toxic_amounts_of_iron_found_in_nestle_nido_whole/?ref=search_posts">NIDO brand milk powder and found toxic arsenic and poisonous amounts of iron</a>.  If I had continued drinking it, I&#39;d have died.  They did not issue a recall per my request and after sending them certified report from the chemical analysis group.  They don&#39;t care about you.  <a href="http://www.corp-research.org/nestle">Nestle has a long history</a> of quality control issues that impact people and their pets.  They have a long list of <a href="http://www.zmescience.com/science/nestle-company-pollution-children/">human abuses including slavery</a> and screwing up womens lactation by foisting a formula on a community with disinfo about its merits and safety.</p>

<p>Here are Nestles brands</p>

<ul>
<li>Digiorno&#39;s</li>
<li>California pizza kitchen</li>
<li>Tombstone</li>
<li>Jacks</li>
<li>Delissio</li>
<li>Buitoni</li>
<li>Stouffers</li>
<li>Hot pockets </li>
<li>papa giuseppe</li>
</ul>

<p>Nestle is then like our grocery store momento mori--when you see a nestle product you should say to yourself: &quot;remember I too will die&quot;.  Then buy it, because there&#39;s no other choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just be sure to read who owns the brand and where the brand is from.  USA made stuff is at least not constantly implicated in alimentary-terrorism like Nestle. </p>

<p>I found out today that &quot;Land O Lakes&quot; is a cooperative from Minnesota.  And their stuff is consistently pretty good for mass market food.  I&#39;m a fan.  Anything certified organic by oregon tilth or QAI is generally of very good quality and safe regardless of where it is made.</p>

<p>Nestle stuff or any other swiss brand for that matter (Mars, Lindt) is dangerous to consume.  All three companies I just said have had toxins found in their chocolates.  Despite this, Nestle tried to corner the chocolate market around 2010 and failed to merge with Hershey (thank god).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And Totino&#39;s just CAN&#39;T be good for you. It&#39;s tastes too good for the cardboard it is. ;)</p>

<p>This is the thing that kills me - we <em>can</em> vote with our food choices and it DOES make a difference. And then these bastards buy up the alternatives we were buying...</p>

<p>Thank you for posting this, though. I avoid Unilever and Nestle, anything with non-organic wheat, soybean/canola/corn/cottonseed oil and MAN does that make food purchasing a lot easier. Except there&#39;s very little left.</p>

<p>Also, if you wanna go cheap and healthy, and you still want the pizza, you can make your own and freeze it. Wanna make your own dough, though, because have you SEEN the fucking ingredients in the grocery store bread and dough? Good dough is: flour, yeast, water, honey, salt. Use organic because you&#39;ll get less herbicide. Simple sauce recipe that kicks ass: tomatoes, a little wine, butter or olive oil, garlic, an onion, salt, pepper, and all the thyme/oregano/basil (and red pepper!) you want. Stir with a wooden spoon because metal spoons make it too tinny for some reason. </p>

<p>What&#39;s actually decent when you&#39;re lazy is is buying one of those grocery store brand organic pizzas and then tossing other shit on top when you cook it - onions, jalapenos, ham or whatever you got in the fridge. And pounds of red pepper on top.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s probably because the levels of arsenic and iron are normal, and your belief that they are not is based on a &gt; misunderstanding of basic concepts in medicine.
When referring to toxicity, mg/kg refers to the amount of the substance vs the weight of the person.
When looking at an assay, mg/kg refers to the amount of the substance vs the weight of the sample.
For the iron, 100 mg/kg means that for every kilogram of powder, there&#39;s 100mg of iron. Now, Nestle claims that in a  &gt; serving, there&#39;s 30% of the &quot;daily value&quot; of iron for 4-and-under. The &quot;daily value&quot; they&#39;re talking about is 10mg.
A serving is 4 scoops, or 34g, again according to the Nestle website.
So that means they claim that there is 3mg / 34g. If you convert that to mg/kg, it&#39;s 89 mg/kg.
So the assay shows the iron content is about 12% higher than they claim, well within reasonable levels (your assay &gt; shows about 3.5mg per glass). There&#39;s more iron in, for example, a steak, than a glass of this Nido stuff, according to &gt; your figures.
Assuming you weigh 68 kg, (150 lbs), and the lower cutoff for iron toxicity (10 mg/kg), you&#39;d have to drink 194 &gt; glasses, all at once.
I&#39;d do the math for the arsenic, but somehow I doubt you&#39;ll actually listen about any of this stuff, so I&#39;ll stop here.</p>

<p>You should probably read replies in your old posts before making new ones. But like the quote says, you probably don&#39;t actually care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the point.  The american lifestyle is such that you are required to work harder and longer hours every year...and so to have more free time you buy food that gives you shortcuts.  If it&#39;s available at the store, the implicit assumption is that it is safe to eat. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Because we pay taxes so that we have agencies like the USDA, FDA, EPA, and NSA to protect us from harm.  However, glass, cadmium, arsenic, lead, melamine, perchlorates, pthalates, bpa, etc ends up in our food.  But this is not a quality control issue, this is a &#39;we don&#39;t punish the hand that feeds us&#39; issue.  </p>

<p>Those agencies are lobbied by those companies so that they can avoid or reduce punishment such that its viewed simply as &quot;the cost of doing business&quot;</p>

<p>Now imagine that if in one instance where there were a rule that said &quot;if you harm more than 1000 people, the US government takes over your business and it becomes &#39;public&#39; (owned by the people of the US).  </p>

<p>Do you think these companies would ever fuck up again?</p>

<p>I think they would not.</p>

<p>Similarly, If you made the punishment for rape and murder 1 day in jail, I&#39;m guessing there&#39;d be a lot more rapes and murders.  That is just common sense.</p>
