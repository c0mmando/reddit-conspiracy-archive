       It's just a sign of the times changing. The world is moving towards progressive drugs policy. 
LSD is nontoxic, it won't kill you, it's one of the safest compounds in existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no reason it should be illegal, and the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracy is its prohibition.

       Yeah no LSD is non addictive (Physically, mentally is another story) and if you're implying that there is some mass conspiracy to get people to try LSD and ruin their lives/harm them, then you seem to on some other shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is GOOD news, drug prohibition and the way we handle drugs as a society is one of America's biggest blights which has contributed to increases in violence and prison poulation.

       Not trying to start an argument, but here's another way of looking at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is illegal and what is not? Another interesting question is how is this decision made... and
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       gets to decide?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of things should be illegal because it just seems self-evident to anyone. If you have some familiarity with natural law, you'll know what I'm getting at. But there are plenty of things that are illegal where nobody is harming themselves or anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of examples where something is illegal in one place, but legal somewhere else. The are also plenty of examples where the legality of something changes over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition of alcohol is one example. Weed currently seems to be another. So what's up with this anyways? You'd think that, if the law was perfect, it wouldn't change over time or vary so much from place to place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, in many cases, the law has nothing to to with what's inherently wrong or right... or good or bad. The law gets decided by a small number of people at the top of the society in which we live. They usually decide what should and shouldn't be legal based on the needs of society itself. In many instances, this decision is strongly influenced by the needs of the powerful few instead of the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with LSD? I'm going to speculate now. For a long time, LSD has been viewed with suspicion by the elite. They don't like the way it gives a person the ability to see the world in a completely different way. If you seek to maintain control of society and along comes a bunch of people who can see the world in a completely different way, that would probably make you very uncomfortable. You'd probably prefer it if everyone had a similar perspective to your own. Someone who sees things differently might even have an advantage over you.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD is also associated with the social unrest of the 1960's. Again, not a great thing if you're one of the law making establishment elite. So, as you rightly asked, why the change now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that someone has realized that LSD
       <strong>
        in low doses
       </strong>
       can be useful to society. If it can improve someone's mood, that's a good thing. If it can enhance creativity and imagination, that's also a good thing. Especially if these improvements can be harnessed at the workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember what I said earlier about how the legality of a thing is closely tied to the benefit/s to society by that thing? Same principle applies here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If LSD, in certain circumstances, can be positively shown to improve worker productivity, it
       <strong>
        WILL
       </strong>
       become legal. They aren't making it legal for our benefit. They're doing it for theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an incredibly cynical way of seeing things, but I believe that it is correct.

       LSD tolerance is so severe that if you take it two days in a row, the effects will be incredibly diminished. Take it a third day and it won't effect you at all! It's pretty much non-abusable!

       Well I guess you could take like 500 tabs and melt your brain but that's about as easy as drinking yourself to death with water (Like that lady trying to win the wii). It's pretty difficult. Unless you had a pre existing mental condition, then the affects could be escalated.

       The biggest danger of LSD is the unregulated market (because it's fuckin illegal) where other research chemicals pop up to replace LSD since its fairly hard to make. The RCs is the shit that's destroying people.

       LSD is more of a tool to break addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, due to the rapid tolerance, it is one of the few things that your body kinda prevents you from developing an addictive pattern to, on a neurological level.  That is not to say it cannot be done: the human mind is a strange place and I'm sure some folks can manage to develop an addiction, but this would be an extreme rarity if possible at all.

       I'm not sure it was quite that simple.  He personally experienced LSD to result in a cessation of his craving for alcohol.  This led to considerable personal conflict within himself and between him and the organization he founded.  Use a drug to treat a drug?  Yeah that didn't go over very well.  But he does say that LSD might well be an appropriate treatment for those who do not find help in the 12-step program.

        Very small doses, perhaps 25 micrograms, could be useful as a euphoriant or antidepressant.

       LSD has no LD50. That instantly makes it safer than a huge amount of pharmaceuticals that are supposedly safe and prescribed daily.

       The biggest danger about LSD in my eyes is that it's illegal. This pushes production underground and potentially creates poor quality product.

       Similar stories have been coming out about psilocybin (shrooms). This is a good thing. Speaking from experience, in small, irregular doses and in a healthy environment, they're both infinitely better for the psyche than anti-depressants, alcohol, weed, or whatever other chemical escapism. LSD's main downsides are that you shouldn't take it alone somewhere where you might get lost and you can't really function socially while feeling the effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a good thing, I think. If there's a potential real conspiracy here, it's that they're talking up LSD to eventually sell something that will be
       <em>
        branded
       </em>
       as LSD, but actually be something genuinely harmful/addictive/useful for brainwashing.

       It's hilarious though - you are so brainwashed by the drugs you think that ANYONE who has ever tried them just MUST have a positive opinion.

       I'm quite aware that not everyone has a positive opinion of it, especially after a bad trip. When used responsibly it's a very small percentage of users that have any lasting negative side effects.

       Wait, which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       We must do research on it, but you already "know" that there are no serious, long term side effects, because, um, you took acid a bunch and you are
       <strong>
        totally
       </strong>
       normal, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than the fact you have become an LSD evangelist yourself, despite you having ZERO scientific understanding of it and can point to ZERO major studies?
      </p>
      <p>
       So much for "knowing thyself."
      </p>
      <p>
       NO DRUGS are free of side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the LSD cultists sound like just that - CULTISTS - who assume that
       <strong>
        their
       </strong>
       drug leads to some magical "enlightenment."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absurd.

       I wasn't saying that hallucinogens aren't chemical escapism. They are. They just typically aren't as harmful, and are potentially more beneficial, than most other forms of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong; If you get a regular supply of a hallucinogen and abuse it, or take it for the wrong reasons in the wrong way, it will do damage. It can ruin your life. If you eat a couple of handfuls of shrooms alone, deep in the woods, you've got a decent chance of dying. If you're on LSD more often than not, you're basically gonna turn into Ozzy Osbourne - incoherently rambling, drifting between reality and the imaginary world in your mind. Like with literally all things, moderation is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've felt happier, fuller, more satisfied in my skin since my first dose of LSD. It wasn't a pleasant experience - in fact, it was
       <strong>
        really fucking scary
       </strong>
       . But, by the end of it, I'd come to terms with the fear I was feeling, and by the time I was sober, I felt a much deeper understanding of myself, the things that scare me, the thoughts that comfort me, the places my mind wanders to when I feel like I'm in a dark place. It's been genuinely useful to me, not just with respect to how I see myself, but how I approach social situations and new experiences. I used to be introverted and judgemental. It took a temporary break from my close-minded reality to see the roots in social anxiety and fear of my own inadequacy that were hiding behind that. No amount of therapy could've convinced me of it; A tiny does of LSD did it in a few hours, for a hell of a lot cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        REMEMBER FOLKS!!!
       </strong>
       If you're taking hallucinogens,
       <em>
        have a chaperone
       </em>
       . That is all.

       What, like, literal, court-admissible proof? No. I do have personal experience with alcoholism, greening out and badly prescribed anti-depressants. Hallucinogens helped me overcome those issues/their after-effects, actually. It's not like dropping some acid cured me or anything, but it certainly didn't hurt.

       Now it's obvious that you've never tried these substances. Faith healing is a placebo. LSD

       I don't feel the same need to impose on others as you seem to. I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone. Most people don't really "need" it, and would probably be better off
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       doing it, kinda like how
       <em>
        everyone

       would be better off avoiding hard liquor. It's all about what you make of the experience.

       Not a fan of Scientology at all, but... Who are you to judge where people find their fulfilment? Hell, you seem to be missing something, if you're crusading against something you know nothing about over the Internet the way you are. Besides, Mr. Hubbard did better for himself than either of us has, I'm willing to bet. Kinda shoots down your argument, doesn't it.

       Also, Jesus Christ supposedly claimed that submitting yourself completely to slavery and showing honour and pride for your owner/master were important sources of spiritual growth and comfort. Your argument is invalid.

       Hah, you came in here spewing utter garbage, I didn't think you were after an actual serious conversation. 1. Ive never done LSD so it precludes me being in the cult. 2. You've mentioned the murdering screeds multiple times. Are you implying that this person is crazy because of some words they wrote down, and its somehow tied to LSD? Trolling nonsense, don't expect a reply beyond this. Keep fighting the good fight there buddy

       It stands for Multi-discipline Approach to Psychedelic Studies.

       There has been a lot of underground research going on by people in medical and academic fields studying the effects and uses of such drugs.

       What are you, a 63 year old Texan Police Officer or something? Afraid of a chemical that heightens your awareness in a very beautiful, real way? Afraid to challenge your own ego? I think you would have a bad trip, and it's not because of the drug. Look up the LD50 of Lysergic Acid, it will not kill you, or hurt you physically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, don't do it. But I would say that you should move into the woods do nobody has to see you ever again.

       I'm not interested in your misguided ignorant opinion, because I clearly wasn't going to cater my opinion to those that wait for scientific consensus to make life choices when it's all but confirmed that it is not dangerous to the body, but yes, continue waiting for the scientific community to give it the go ahead for you to try. Live your life in fear, yes, continue.

       I've noticed this also.  It's worth keeping an eye on.  I don't really have an opinion on LSD as I've never tried it, but I have heard it can produce both positive and/or negative effects depending on the user themselves and environmental stimuli.

       It's not extremely dangerous at all.  You're being dramatic and mimicking decades of drug war propaganda.  It can cause some big problems for people that have a mental illness though.

       I never said it was unsafe.  I said it can cause issues for those with a mental illness.  It would be naive to assume that it's impossible to have a negative reaction to it or possibly suffer longer term effects.  It can make an underlying mental illness pop up.  But it won't kill you.   Which is what dangerous implies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper studies need to be done on it.  Studies which have largely been illegal because of panicky types steering drug laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       And compared to other legal drugs is really very safe.

       Don't be a child and feel free to discuss this like a grown up any time.  Anything can be dangerous.  Tylenol kills people with liver failure.   Alcohol kills people directly and indirectly every year by the thousands.  Cigarettes cause cancer and lung disease.

       Nothing is without risk.  Nothing is perfectly safe when abused.  The problem with lsd is panicky idiots have bought into the drug war propaganda and make it difficult to study.  It's shown promise as a therapeutic tool.  But individuals like yourself would hold that back purely from ignorance.

       I've been noticing something about the LSD enthusiasts I've met. They do seem to glorify the drug a bit - put it on a pedestal - attribute "godlike" powers to it. In their view, it seems like LSD is goodness, light and right wrapped up in a tiny molecule. LSD can do no wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a scene in Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain" that touches on this. IIRC, the part when the pilgrims reach the "base" of the Holy Mountain, and they see one guy promising God and the universe in the pills he's hawking.

       As someone who has lived with addiction for 35 years, you're starting to piss me off.

       Why post about propaganda and then spew it? Your self-righteous judgment of all addicts based on one bad trip is laughable to many here.

       Yes, LSD is a spiritual tool. Yes, it has medicinal uses, especially promising for schizophrenics. Yes, dumb kids do dumb shit on acid. But, no, don't paint every medical benefit of a chemical with the same whitewash of disinformation and personal taste. Until you're staring down a chemo regimen, you have no fucking clue of what weed can do...

       Have serious depression and anxiety. I've tripped 8 times since August and It's seriously helped me figure myself out, and what I believe the world to be. I'm not sure what lives were ruined by LSD alone, or if that's even a thing, but if there was any serious negative reaction to the drug, it's either interference with an SSRI, mixing drugs, or it wasn't LSD-25.

       You're a sucker. You're an inherently negative person, or have some deep unresolved issues which is why you had a bad experience with LSD...but everyone isn't you. Don't think just because you didn't get anything out of something that other people can't either.

       Well the problem here is not that he didn't doesn't like LSD.  I know people who have tried it and decided they don't want to feel like they are dying.  In my opinion maybe they tried too much or it wasn't LSD, but if people don't want to experience this, that's fine.

       There's a little backlash. Understandable, since this whole idea that it is somehow wrong to explore your own consciousness is pretty unethical.  So when people such as yourself start coming across against LSD, frankly you sound like just another misinformed, ignorant, agenda-driven D.A.R.E. officer.

       Uh, if you read the articles, the authors have pretty clearly all experienced hallucinogenic drugs.  I'll start considering the implications of a conspiracy when the government starts rumbling about legalizing hallucinogenic drugs.

       I would disagree with it being extremely dangerous, however if the person has an underlying mental problem such as schizophrenia then it can bring it out quicker. As with all things if you take to much it can be dangerous but if used responsibly I believe lsd can be very beneficial.  A lot of brilliant minds microdose with it on a regular basis.

       There's lots of undiagnosed cases of mental illnesses among people. Either parents thinking it was possession or some crazy shit or people just hiding it. Taking something that messes with your mind can stir things up, even if they've been under control for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I know nothing about LSD. I've heard an anecdotal story about a guy who tripped for years after cleaning up, and how LSD had supposedly made his PTSD flashbacks more intense. But here's the thing. None of us know much about LSD. It hasn't been studied effectively because laws prohibit that kind of thing, because if a drug on the banned list were found to be relatively safe, the government would look like a fool.

       It happens with weed too....people with family history of schizophrenia can speed up the on-set by smoking a buncha pot....meaning, maybe they wouldn't have a psychotic break until they're 30, but if they smoke a buncha pot they can have one when they're 18. Does that mean pot is bad? No. Does pot give people mental disorders? No.

       Same thing with LSD man. Everyone's different. I think you'll find plenty of people here who have done LSD with no issue, and you'll probably find even more people that said LSD helped them in some profound way.

       There's a pattern, but in reading the articles I think they are generally written by people who have actually taken the substance.  I feel that these articles are a byproduct of the recent resurgence of LSD usage.  Once a few journalists have experienced it, they might be willing to acknowledge these stories that they would otherwise have missed.

       No this is just my alt account where I talk about drugs, porn, and some of the less-socially-acceptable aspects of conspiracy theory.  My regular account could potentially be linked to me personally.  In real life, I have a fair amount 'on the line' and when you speak about things like this, there are all sorts of people that want to dig around and "dox" you, not just government but people such as yourself digging through my comment history.

       Yeah I don't know, none of my comments seemed to be voted very high.  But I think you are about as far away around the world as it is possible to be, as I'm in the US northeast, so no coffee at least not this year.  :)  It's probably worth being skeptical, there's a lot to be skeptical about.

       But, it was used in mind control experiments. Doesnt that mean the gubmint is trying to control the population?

       Im pretty sure that part of the reason it's no longer used for mind control experiments is due to it being ineffective for that purpose.

       If I had to guess at some sort of conspiratorial reason for this, it would be that Silicon Valley is seeing many of its employees productivity exploding when they begin micro dosing daily with LSD. Maybe the groundwork for legalizing a micro-dosing of LSD in order to enhance productivity is being laid.

       well lsd and other powerful psychedelics were a large part in mind control techniques. psychedelics helped in the 60's to accelerate the breakdown and trust of traditional institutions, not that that's all bad, but it's definitely not all good, and more so not the purview of
       <em>
        government
       </em>
       and is competely unethical as it was a clandestine operation/"study".  furthermore, just like the original "ecstacy" MDMA morphed into "e" and "molly" which are completely different and far more dangerous chemicals like bathsalts and meth, you have no idea what the sob's are actually mass distributing and setting you up for.
      </p>
      <p>
       as an aside, SWIM had tried lsd and mushrooms in the past and had some entertaining experiences to say the least, and some intense and illuminating experiences.  just be educated and aware of what you put into your body in any case, drugs, nutrition and otherwise.

       LSD is not a very good tool to make people hazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       To people who haven't tried it, yeah it sure seems that way.  But in reality, you're more likely to make someone learn what their real purpose in life is, and light a giant fire under their ass to accomplish it.  LSD is probably more likely to lead to social revolution than anything else.

       LSD mimics a natural hormone that induces a sense of spirituality and links unrelated random ideas together as new ideas.  Artificially overloading your brain with it feels amazing but is not really creative or inspiring, just a false sense of actual creativity or inspiration...  Delude yourself at your own peril.

       Well ... Silicon Valley begs to differ.  Steve Jobs apparently believed taking LSD was one of the most important things he ever did.  This admission from his friend Mr. Kottke was a real eye-opener for a lot of people.  If you head on over to
       <a href="/r/microdosing">
        /r/microdosing

       , there are a surprising number of people using low-dose LSD on a regular basis to funnel that "random creativity" you mock into useful work.

       I think there is a lot of pro-drug propaganda being pushed intentionally just as the populace(s) become more sedantary. LSD is fine, I think criminalizing it is inefficient to protect from its dangerous side effects. Popularizing it surely can't help either. Oh well, it's the responsibility of each of us to avoid abuse.

       Well, the CIA was pushing LSD for 30 years, from about 1950 to 1980, in order to experiment with "mind control" and later to simply disrupt the anti-war movement and political dissidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they were so successful the same burnouts that were targeted have completely bought into it. LSD freaks are more religiously fanatical than Scientologists (another CIA-sponsored cult group.)

       Hate to break it to you but LSD was invented and tested by a  respected researcher with a Phd while working for a major pharmaceutical corporation.
       <br/>
       Same with MDMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you are under the impression that legally prescribed drugs are all safe, you may want to look up the histories of Vioxx and  Thalidomide, for starters.

       I take it you didn't hear about Dr Hoffmans last gift to humanity that he cooked up in his old lab. 10,000,000 doses 
 Also, a lot of what's out there these days is produced in legitimate labs  and compounding pharmacies in countries where it is legal. And seeing how its cheaper and easier to follow Dr. H's recipe, its a pretty good bet there not cooking up some witches brew in their bathtub.

       I thought weed was going to help with my depression and it honestly made it worse. I became extremely lazy, apathetic, couldn't put together sentences when u was high, weak willed if I were smoking say a week straight with(food, nicotine,caffeine, porn etc), literal body aches when high and just didn't give a fuck about the world while on it. It's better for you than alcohol at least but shit I couldn't function while smoking.

       Well, the CIA was pushing LSD for 30 years, from about 1950 to 1980, in order to experiment with "mind control" and later to simply disrupt the anti-war movement and political dissidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they were so successful the same burnouts that were targeted have completely bought into it. LSD freaks are more religiously fanatical than Scientologists (another CIA-sponsored cult group.)

       Just a "by-the-by" ... Ted Kaczynski went through some very interesting experiments where LSD
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have been used.  If you read up on what happened to him, it is pretty clear that the real problem here is the vicious and unethical psychological experimentation that was conducted on him.  However, there is a possibility that if you combine that kind of brutality with LSD, you might perhaps sometimes get a unabomber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the US government and it's intelligence and military arms function on this institutionalized brutality, LSD probably is a dangerous drug
       <em>
        to them
       </em>
       .  It wakes people up to the reality of the nightmare, and their life's purpose becomes a quest to end the horror.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's maybe that.  I can't find confirmation that he was given LSD, but there are some very interesting articles if you google "ted kaczynski lsd."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I would like to emphasize very strongly here that LSD is not the problem.  Only when combined with direct Western military or psychoanalytic brainwashing, and only because those methodologies are horrific nightmares that should never exist.
       </strong>

       The Church Committee hearings revealed I found that the mkultra guys realized fairly early on that L was pretty useless as a manchurian candidate drug.  As one researcher put it, the test subjects were more likely to developers an attitude of a 'pox on both houses'.

       I mean, can you even think about this rationally? The Washington Post - the CIA's house newspaper, has spent the last two years pushing LSD again.

       I was implying that you're full of shit by using an old meme (google "navy seal copypasta"). See, I'm obviously not a Navy SEAL (I'd hope they have more discipline than that). You haven't spent 20 years studying LSD, either. I don't have 300 confirmed kills. You've probably never even seen LSD or magic mushrooms.

       I have no intention of killing you. You, however, could probably find a good reason to kill yourself if you bothered to introspect for even just a fleeting moment (like the guy who wrote the original rant I copy-pasted).

       Okay, seriously, last time I'm answering you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already acknowledged that it can be abused to great detriment, and I wouldn't put it past the CIA to provide something, anything, that will distract and/or incapacitate a group they are targeting. In fact, providing it in excess to a group of mostly students has huge potential to turn a lot of them into the Ozzy-like zombies I described. Of course, you could also just give them painkillers, or SSRIs, or quaaludes, or weed, or night-time cough syrup. There's a reason the CIA switched to heroin and cocaine - they're far more effective at disabling the "target market" than LSD ever could've been.
      </p>
      <p>
       LSD is not inherently awesome. It's just a chemical. It has downsides. There is grave danger in using it irresponsibly. That doesn't mean it doesn't have it's uses, or that it brainwashes everyone who uses it into being a walking advertisement for it. It just means you should be careful with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like a child because the entirety of your comments here have been trolling, not because of your opinions regarding hallucinogens. Your opinions are clearly founded in a mix of fiction and delusion, but that's to be expected across all ranges of ages. Your lack of maturity in discussing this, however, is reminiscent of a bratty preteen who actually listened for a moment (just a moment) in health class.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel pretty good about where I stand. I can laugh at you, not because we have some disagreement, or because I'm making assumptions about you that give me some illusion of being somehow better than you for the different choices I've made, but because I spoke my mind clearly and honestly using what I know, whereas you just blathered and snorted and called everyone who doesn't totally agree with you a stoner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, as a friend (we've gone back and forth enough that I feel like I can call you that with only a bit of sarcasm), you should try it in a safe, controlled situation, accompanied by a sober person you trust. I don't usually recommend it, but something tells me you could use it. You're a bit quick to judge others for things you don't understand. Maybe you should confront the parts of yourself that you don't understand. Maybe you don't even need hallucinogens to achieve that, which would be even better, but you definitely need
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       .

       LOL - "RazingAll" is desperately trying to spin his ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       He thinks because he took a bunch of LSD he knows something about something. Does he even understand that LOTS of people have taken LSD - along with many other drugs - and that the fact he took LSD really doesn't mean much?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, lots of people have taken drugs. But most people don't hold themselves out as somehow "enlightened" because they scored some drugs in some jam band's parking lot.

       You're a idiot. I have done a LOT of acid years ago, then had a few realisations quite like what you have been saying and i would definitely have liked to have heard more of what you have to say on the subject but you have presented yourself like a fool and I can't even stand reading your shitty posts.

       I thought weed was going to help with my depression and it honestly made it worse. I became extremely lazy, apathetic, couldn't put together sentences when u was high, weak willed if I were smoking say a week straight with(food, nicotine,caffeine, porn etc), literal body aches when high and just didn't give a fuck about the world while on it. It's better for you than alcohol at least but shit I couldn't function while smoking.

       No this is just my alt account where I talk about drugs, porn, and some of the less-socially-acceptable aspects of conspiracy theory.  My regular account could potentially be linked to me personally.  In real life, I have a fair amount 'on the line' and when you speak about things like this, there are all sorts of people that want to dig around and "dox" you, not just government but people such as yourself digging through my comment history.

       I'm not a bot, though.  If you want, we can maybe meet for coffee depending on where you are.
