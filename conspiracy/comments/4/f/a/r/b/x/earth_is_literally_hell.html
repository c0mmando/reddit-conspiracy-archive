       the key distinction is that it's not eternal, you can literally walk out by being meritorious, which means you've chosen to be in hell as a side effect of who you've been but not who you are.  Also, not all buddhists even believe in this idea (dhammists) as much of it is vestigal hinduism 'snuck' back into buddhism and is no part of the pali canon (noncanonical).  A lot of the 'gods of buddhism' and 'dimensions' stuff is actually more dogmatic bullshit borrowed from india and chinese traditions lain on top of original buddhism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know real buddhism, find an insight meditation class or one called vipassana, as this is 'real buddhism' and everything else is similar dogmatically as catholicism and it's contrivances are to Jesus' original teachings, which were similarly simple

       I'd say it's more of a spiritual middle school for souls in this part of the galaxy that are not greatly developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To those young middle school souls, I imagine this planet very much does look like a hell (as most middle schools do to most middle schoolers).

       I'm just worried because I was just the same before I understood what was going on. I try so hard to eat and now everything tastes of poison to me. A bit of a hypochondriac I have become but it's still the truth. Thank you. I just want to take the time to reply and hope that you make it out ok on the other side as well.

       You don't need to avoid every poison, the body has strong abilities to naturally detoxify. Trust it. If you avoid the worst and stupid, prefer natural food if you have a choice, you'll likely do better than most people. Also, calorie restriction improves health and life span. But don't overdo it :)

       Lol, wow. Funny you should ask...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I have SAD and anytime the leaves are growing or falling on the trees, I have insomnia, decreased appetite with the added bonus of abundant restlessness. I could easily drink 5 gallons of water a day, but have to force myself to eat small snacks. I can handle one entree, but only if I eat it over an hour period.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, basically, for about 2 weeks, every spring and fall, I look and feel like shit, but there's a mental sharpness that I am going to attempt to direct towards my creative goals.

       Semi annual depression?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have depression based on the weather too, but never used to be like that. Lately when it rains I feel it on my bones and it hurts. I am back to eating once a day, before it was less. I'm drinking only distilled water and can't drink pop anymore because it tastes like poison to me now. I'm trying to force myself to be more happy but to be honest I'm just waiting for the end times to come.

       If you're deadset on only distilled water, you need to take a multivitamin. As shitty as tap water is, its still has vital minerals. And repeat this mantra
       <em>
        food is medicine
       </em>
       , eat what you need based on each day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rain/snow makes me ache, too. I'm extremely sensitive to the barometric pressure, so much that I have to plan my daily activities around it. But I don't wanna leave the mountains, I love them. If my arthritis keeps getting worse, I'm gonna look at the Rockies or Zuni mountains, more arid than the Berkshires.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the depression, it's a mutherphucker but part of the process of growth. Find one small thing that actually makes you happy, not just gives you pleasure. I crochet and it totally pleases me to gift something I made and see someone use it. But it's the actual process of creating pieces that makes me happy. Sometimes it learning new techniques and sometimes its just the meditative state I achieve in total mindless muscle memory. Get a hobby or interact with one person you truly enjoy on a daily basis, even if it's just one text. Eye contact is better. We need it, on a biological level. We all have a basic need to at least acknowledge each other, even if the nicest person to you today was the simple headnod from someone you passed in the grocery aisle. Talk to strangers. Some of the best advice I've ever gotten in my life have been from people I only ever spent a few hours with or overheard in a public setting.
      </p>

       Do not despair. Despite all of this shit, humanity is still good. Even a poisoned existence. And you've already helped me today, simply by replying here.

       At this moment, yes, but still on a heavenly trend. That's why hellish creatures such as David Rockefeller and Henry KISSinger are pushing their agenda so hard; soon they will not be able to incarnate anymore, and will have to wait a very long time to do so again; they don't want to spend all that time with a disappointed master.

       I don't know anything about your belief structure, but you seem to be open to the idea hell existing and have experienced contemplating what that might be. I strongly believe that this is not hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have felt that this is hell in the past, and can empathize with the despair. I was in high school in 2001 and realized pretty quickly that I had been lied to just about everything my entire life. Gave up on school, walked away from religion and essentially spent a decade waiting to die in whatever false flag attack, nuclear war, a eugenic agenda, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       About a year ago I was led to begin researching religion again. Having an immensely skeptical, if not conspiratorial perspective (and rightfully so) I was able to better get a fresh look at the history of religion. By far Christianity has been most tampered with, and was even co-opted at times for political control. It has been blended with all sorts of various traditions by emperors and kings as if it were under attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the common belief around here is that religion is just a collection of myth used by elite to influence masses, but I was astounded at the amount of evil done "in the name of Christianity" that was designed and executed by secret societies for the purpose of character assassination of actual Christians. People with great power do seem to actually believe in the spiritual and super natural and also seem to be vehemently opposed to Christianity. This sparked my interest in focusing on the life of Jesus specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       After spending hundreds of hours figuring out what these old words mean, reading historical texts, non-canonical religious texts, the bible, and listening to expositional commentaries and getting used to the actual meaning of words (as opposed to the denotative doublespeak our language has become), I believe that Jesus is who he said he is. I believe that he is in control, that there are reasons evil is allowed to exist at this moment, that he is returning, and that the earth is not our permanent habitat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it as much as I know that explosives were used to bring down building 7.

       I agree with much, but I don't think Jesus is "the Messiah", I think he was definitely an Enlightened being. I don't think the Enlightened Ones
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be martyred or ascend, I think thier job is to just show others The Way. All religions hold truths to that path, even the new "religion of science". Carl Sagan was definitely Enlightened.  (Please watch this and tell me this is not only scientifically sound, but a spiritual allegory as well!
       <a href="https://youtu.be/-wv0vxVRGMY">
        https://youtu.be/-wv0vxVRGMY
       </a>
       ) ,
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like Jesus not only baffled the Sanhedrin with his perfect logic on Jewish Law, he also knew how to speak to "the sheep"  and instanly break programming. He said things that instantly made people radically change thier lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest manipulation of all world religions are that these Enlightened folks are somehow
       <em>
        magic
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        divine
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        supernatural
       </em>
       . No, they are human. They don't heal anyone, they can't teleport, there's no God the Father/ Jupiter, etc. They are us, too. But they are 5th dimension beings and we are only 4 (3D + time). They know something beyond time and space that we don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite do not want the Enlightened Ones around. They threaten everything. There's some kind of contract or agreement I haven't really figured out yet. What we call selling thier soul to the Devil. Some Enlightened Ones are famous, but of thier own merit; they aren't celebrities, those are tools of the elite. But some Enlightened folks were definitely murdered/silenced. Kurt Cobain, Tupac, lyrical geniuses with serious messages, hidden in genres you aren't going to hear in a church or temple... Some never "sell out" and get to make amazing art, music, politics, discoveries, literature, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows, in 3 months, I'll be somewhere else in these rabbit holes. The one thing I understand for certain is "on the other side", they keep giving me the message that love is greater than fear, but that they totally understand our fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I want to start studying etymology, desperately. Know any good places to start?

       Seen other similar flat world clips before, and yes I agree the idea makes sense both scientifically and spiritually. String, super-string, and other similar "macro-foam multiverse-esk" theories all call for several more dimensions than timespace. It seems to be logical progression that some aspects of spirituality are things happens in literal higher dimensions. I chuckled a bit at the part where he talks about the apple looke at the "attractive, congenial looking square." This is a biblical concept that can be found in Genesis 6:1-2.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Genesis 6:1-2 (KJV)
 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In this passage the words "sons of God" in Hebrew are
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/text/genesis/6-2.htm">
        ḇə-nê-hā-’ĕ-lō-hîm
       </a>
       which suggests the beings are direct creations of God, as opposed to offspring of a direct creation. The term could describe Adam but not Cain or Abel. That is a roundabout way of saying we know that Adam is the only human ḇə-nê-hā-’ĕ-lō-hîm, so that means these beings are angels from a spiritual realm who came here. This is somewhat of a fringe perspective, but seems to be how the text has been understood throughout antiquity when comparing with ancient historians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize I have used some scripture here and you man not hold stock in it, and I don't want this to seem like circular logic so I will explain why I see it the bible as authentic word of God. In short, it is because of specific prophecy that has already been fulfilled qualitatively and quantitatively. One of the most solid examples I know of has to do with the Medo-Persian king Cyrus the Great.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bit of back story is needed. In the years leading up to 586 b.c. Jeremiah was told that the king of Babylon would sack Jerusalem and capture many Israelites, bringing them to an exile in Babylon for 70 years. After that time, they would be allowed to return home. It just so happens that in 586, Nebuchadnezzar, Babylonian general and son of the king is out on conquest and sacks Jerusalem. When he returned home with army and captives, it was found his father the king Nabopolassar was dead and the right of succession was passed. Seventy years later Cyrus the Great captures Babylon with a brilliant tactical maneuver leading to an almost bloodless empire change. Soon after Cyrus was shown Isaiah (a contemporary of Jeremiah) chapter 45 by an exiled Israelite, presumed to be the biblical Daniel. This is what the text says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Isaiah 45King James Version (KJV)
1 Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut. . . . 4 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Take note of the gates not being shut, that's pretty important. Also to the phrase "loose the loins" . That is a euphemism for losing control of the loins, or bladder area. . . possibly that entire region if you get my drift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Babylon proper was surrounded by a moat and wall, but an interesting feature is the
       <a href="http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbgiqMI8j1ql5d2uo1_1280.png">
        river Euphrates ran right through the fortified area
       </a>
       very close to the palace. Cyrus had his men divert the river into an unused reservoir which lowered the water level substantially. His men walked in openly under the gates and right up to the palace.

       We also have a historical account of whats going on inside the palace that night in the book of
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%205&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        Daniel chapter 5
       </a>
       . The current king
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar">
        Belshazzar
       </a>
       was hosting a massive party in the palace for the high society of the time, things happen (understatement) and a floating hand writes on the wall words indicating his reign was over and his kingdom would be conquered that night. This is his reaction:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Daniel 5:6 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Shortly thereafter, the Persians stormed the palace and Belshazzar was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Cyrus read the account of the night he captured Babylon in a Hebrew scroll more than 70 years old, that called him by name, he released the exiles and prompted the people to donate towards the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. This is chronicled
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great#Religion_and_philosophy">
        in the work of Josephus
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All this goes to say that I believe there is enough evidence to support the text and even knowing it was penned by many authors, I see a force of congruity and stunning precision that suggests the work of God's spirit. When I got to that point it only made sense to take Jesus at his word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm realizing this got really long so I'll end it here. Hope this is helpful in some way. If you are interested I could go into passages where people teleport (that are also somewhat fringe, most people gloss right over this stuff) and other interesting happenings.
