    <div class="md"><p>Lol…for the very reason BurninEpix stated…the cosmic time scale. The &quot;truth&quot; has been &quot;violently opposed&quot; for decades…in some cases, centuries.</p>

<p>What makes you think the end is near?</p>

<p>In point of fact this is not the end…it&#39;s not even the beginning of the end. It is simply the end of the beginning.</p>

<p>For the record…it&#39;s not only the ruling elite that violently opposes the truth…it is our friends and neighbours. It is they that will have to be profoundly affected to have their povs change. To be affected to the point of not only acknowledging the &quot;truth&quot;…but to the point of action.</p>

<p>Btw…I didn&#39;t mention &quot;revolt&quot;…I said becoming aware and involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are talking about 9/11 tho. I know we are on /conspiracy but can you tone it down with the crazy talk? Thanks. We are talking about 9/11. What &quot;truth&quot; are you talking about that hasnt been exposed on a &quot;cosmic time scale&quot;??? Also &quot;the end of the beginning&quot;?  Dude wtf are you talking about.

You can stow the attitude. If you dont understand there&#39;s no shame in just admitting it.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Stow the attitude&quot;. Look, I understand. You just turned 15, you realized god isnt real, your parents lied to you about that and santa claus, you also realized the world and governments suck, so now youre an angsty teen that thinks he knows everything. But you dont. I was there once, One day youll grow up and realize how stupid you sound. Now if youll get your head out of your ass, and read the comments here in this thread, youll see the person I originally replied to quoted someone who mentions 3 steps to a plan. We are already on step 2 of the plan he quoted, which btw was in reference to 9/1. So when you come in here spouting about &quot;truth&quot; or whatever other buzzwords you want to use, youre being fucking retarded. We are talking about 9/11, we are not talking about illuminati or any other bullshit your silly mind is thinking of.  The comment that Im replying to right now is utter trash, you should be ashamed of yourself. Read my other comments, read Burning_Epix comments, you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  Which is exactly why we get made fun of. There too many vocal children like you that use angst and sarcasm as if that works, as if rolling your eyes is a convincing argument. Grow up. &quot;Omg the cosmic truth bro theyll never let us find it out unless we revolt!!&quot;  Gtfo, idiot. Leave the discussion to people who arent retarded</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh Its hard to find comments on mobile, i applogize. Didnt know it was you. That being said, my comment stands. How can you be this lost in a comment thread you started? Youve wasted 2 comments now saying nothing of substance whatsoever. If you insult me, at least spend an extra couple seconds and back up your extremely retarded statements. And there you go using words like projection, trying to be some kind of psychoanalyst Sherlock Holmes.  No one here is convinced youre older than 15. </p>
