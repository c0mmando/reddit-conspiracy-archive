       <strong>
        Intro
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Soft” forms of social control are everywhere. We are given cultural forms which purposefully inhibit the full expression of our natural drives in order to prevent people from self-actualizing. For example, as a man, you are supposed to develop into a
       <strong>
        Warrior
       </strong>
       . By warrior, I don’t mean someone who is violence prone or fake-macho. A Warrior is simply someone who rises above the dependence of childhood and the carnal trappings of adolescence in order to become
       <strong>
        truly independent and informed.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in our society, the strength, courage, and strategic planning that are needed to progress along this path towards manhood are redirected into professional sports. Indeed, the NFL, NBA, and other leagues are mere simulations of true masculine polarity. They are circus-like representations of the competition, glory, and hierarchical organization found in real, archetypal masculine pursuits like war and politics. Men have been tricked into thinking it’s manly to passively watch other people compete, often reciting statistics from games as if that somehow makes them well adjusted. In reality, any masculine activity you see on television also exists in the real world, where it’s ten times more epic and interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       ESPN says: “the Patriots are continuing to dominate the AFC East this year with their overwhelming firepower on offense.”
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that’s not nearly as cool as hearing: “The U.S. continues to dominate Afghanistan this year, due to its overwhelming firepower in the air and on land."
      </p>
      <p>
       As you clue in on this, and shift your gaze from television to the “real world,” you will start to notice propaganda is
       <strong>
        everywhere
       </strong>
       . For instance, there are large banners all over my city that depict baseball stars. Having enjoyed baseball as a youth, I used to take these signs for granted, but now they scream: “Stay infantile! Watch other people do things! Don’t fully develop yourself!” Some of them actually encourage people to sign up for
       <em>
        fantasy
       </em>
       leagues on various online platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might be thinking: “Uh huh, so sports are a government plot to dumb down the masses? That sounds like a conspiracy theory.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the government does pay the NFL millions of dollars to showcase veterans and soldiers at halftime amongst other propaganda, I am not alleging a top-down plan here. The masses to some extent want mindless distractions, and wealthy businessmen are all too happy to provide them for a quick buck. Sports, like much of our media, thus function as
       <em>
        de facto
       </em>
       propaganda that effectively stunts the growth of people who attempt to break away from the herd and self-actualize. Whether or not conspirators meet in smoke-filled rooms to plan it out this way really doesn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to advertising. If you were to say in a crowded room: “70% of our economy is based on consumption. Therefore, psychological techniques must be used to hypnotize the public into buying things they don’t need,” you’d get a lot of weird looks and probably get labeled crazy. And yet, that is a factually accurate description of the advertisements that play on endless loop in between our favorite programs. Hell, kids from the ages of 2 to 11 see 25,600 advertisements per year. If that isn’t a form of brainwashing, then I don’t know what is. (1)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Drives
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another strong drive is sex. Since Freud, sex has been a favorite topic amongst behavioral psychologists and social engineers. This drive goes very deep, and thus is quite useful for manipulating people.
      </p>
      <p>
       German philosopher/sociologist Theodor Adorno writes, “The mass production of the sexual automatically achieves its repression.” (2) Further critiquing the American “culture industry,” he continues:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The culture industry does not sublimate; it represses. By repeatedly exposing the objects of desire, breasts in a clinging sweater or the naked torso of the athletic hero, it only stimulates the unsublimated forepleasure which habitual deprivation has long since reduced to a masochistic semblance. (3)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the West we mistakenly see dressing in skimpy clothing as a sign of “liberation.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Repeated exposure to near-pornographic images in the media generates constant sexual tension that is rarely “resolved” for most people. The net effect from all this “liberation” is really sexual frustration, and a turn to other means (i.e. porn and masturbation) to relieve the subconscious stress it induces. Indeed, Adorno continues, “There is no erotic situation which, while insinuating and exciting, does not fail to indicate unmistakably that things can never go that far.” (4)
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not arguing that casual sex is immoral or “bad,” but we do have to be honest about how it acts as a
       <strong>
        control mechanism
       </strong>
       in communities in which sex is viewed as “just a fun thing to do.” Obviously this viewpoint transfers prestige and attention to the physically attractive women, who as the “gatekeepers” of sex now wield the power to decide which guys receive social validation for getting laid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current sexual mores we see on college campuses are only about two generations old, and actually are the result of significant social engineering. They mark a profound switch from the way sex was viewed in America (and Western civilization) for nearly two hundred years prior. Sure, there have always been womanizers throughout history (Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein come to mind) – I’m not saying there’s even anything wrong with that. However, it used to be done discretely and certainly wouldn’t have been a staple of institutions of higher learning like we now see at American colleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we’re currently seeing in the West is a degradation of sex. Sex and sexual imagery is used to sell products, control men, and generate low-grade tension on a mass scale. This is all carnal and animalistic behavior. By all means enjoy sex with beautiful women, but get it out of the classroom and stop showing it to three year olds on television.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Authentic Community
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States was founded on small towns in which most people knew each other, and gathered at Church each week to (basically) socialize. In fact, for the first ten or so years of our existence, states were more or less countries unto themselves that had the power to coin money and enforce tariffs on interstate commerce. Now, I wouldn’t suggest a return to that level of decentralization, but it’s plain that over the years we’ve morphed into a centrally controlled Empire system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong local communities will always come into conflict with commands sent from “the top down” (i.e. from a governing class which is potentially thousands of miles away and has its own interests in mind.) Therefore, local communities must be subjected to the age-old “divide and conquer” technique in order to dampen their natural instinct towards self-determination. This topic deserves a post in its own right, but the point here is that man’s drive to bond with real people (i.e. not talking heads on fluorescent screens) and to protect and help grow the environment that he is immediately and most intimately connected to (i.e. his local city/state/town) is under attack on all fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Netflix shows, for instance, provide a false sense of community – of being a “part” of something bigger than oneself. Shows like
       <em>
        Friends
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        The Big Bang Theory
       </em>
       tell us what it’s like to be “a young professional living in the big city,” and then use laugh tracks to engender a feeling of bonding and shared interest amongst viewers who will never see each other in real life and who may be physically thousands of miles away from one other. We then talk about these shows at the water cooler, make Facebook posts about them, and sometimes even unconsciously mold our lives after them, apparently not realizing they are total illusions specifically designed to appeal to our baser tendencies and beamed through a medium that has been proven to produce subservient brainwaves (Google Fred Emery's study on television. Emergy is widely regarded as a legend in his field.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern school system also represents a faux community, in that it is a pipeline to ever-more centralized control. As one ages, one spends ever more time at school, eventually having to participate in sports, extracurricular activities, etc. in order to pad one’s resume to get into college. In college, of course, you actually live at school, in a totally artificial bubble, subjected to leftist propaganda and various psychological management techniques, and are physically removed from all local roots. You then usually move to wherever you get a job and watch TV Shows that reflect this lifestyle as "normal, fun, and sexy." Your family is the State, now. Learn to love it!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What Can We Do to Overcome the Manipulation?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When society is seen for what it is: an interconnected matrix of interest groups and opposing narratives competing for primacy (with the centralized group known as the ruling class usually winning), then it becomes clear to the Warrior-in-training that he must develop a rock-solid “mental frame.” A mental frame is the boundary between one’s “inner-self” and the outside environment. It acts as a “firewall,” blocking other people’s baggage and manipulations from being passively downloaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       A warrior is a man who places values that are eternal (truth, honor, family) above his own lower/selfish desires. He therefore comes from a place of “Wisdom” and clear conscience and is able to see the magician’s tricks for what they are: mere games used to fool the gullible.

       Why don't we just make a Netflix original series with this as the main plot instead? Would be a lot easier and just as entertaining.

I don't have time to go into the details right now on how to do this, but ask around at r/BTC there have been several people who've lived entirely off of bitcoin.

       Really? This whole thing reads as one of those shitty posts you talk about.  And Im not disagreeing with him. Most of what he wrote is true, but the writing was so terrible and misinformed in some places all I could think while reading it is "this is what makes us look bad."
      </p>
      <p>
       So in 1 part we have the literally crazy people who are drawn to conspiracy theories, then we have the people who are just easily gillible and believe every conspiracy theory, then we have those who do their best to read into these things and they try to critically analyze the information, but they come out thinking like OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, Ill apologize for a second because like I said I agree with a lot of what you said, and Im only critiquing what you wrote. Not you yourself. But how old are you?  This reads a lot like what I thought when I was a teen and first found out "god wasnt real" and all these conspiracies. While your overall message is true, I just wish it was written better in a lot of places.

       This is just such a quality post, even if I don't have much to say in response I feel compelled to say good job and thanks for contributing real content to this sub that isn't about Hillary Clinton. However, I do agree with the entire sentiment you have conveyed about our manufactured culture. Posts from other users like Magnora7 and 911bodysnatchers are similar to yours -- you might enjoy reading some of their post history.

       Thanks for posting this. I do believe we should get away from large nation states as soon as possible however. They are the cause of much of the problems in the world. They encourage a freedomless, controlled society not based on the local beliefs and culture but on converting them into manageable labour pools. A lot of the immigration problems would be solved if these immigrants had no where to go. A lot of these cultural problems would be solved if there wasn't an overlord type system directing it. Agendas would be more manageable at a more local level and people would return to looking out for one another instead of just giving up in the face of this unstoppable, massive machine that is the globalist nation and the extended globalist continental union. Things like the EU are against human interests and they hurt the planet in every regard.

       Sounds like you tried summarizing Adorno's work into a reddit post and created the same fallacies in arguments that he left rampant throughout his essays.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, there is no mention of the woman's role, yet you essentialized the man's role to a stringent degree. A bit myopic in scope from the start, but ok, maybe you didn't have time to fit in half the world's population into your piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the argument linking sexual repression and the false conception of "liberation" does not seem to add up and creates holes in your argument. You're trying to convince the readers that propaganda and other social tools are "bad," but you insist that there are strict guidelines in defining the role of sex in modern society. To observe from wherever you're sitting and make this agenda claiming that sexuality can be boxed into something as simple between the male and female "gatekeeper" sex, is shortsighted of you, especially when making attempts at critiquing a
       <em>
        modern
       </em>
       society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will agree with you that there is definitely a rampant amount of propaganda thrown at us to fetishize certain social aspects or become a consumerist drone, but when you attempt to explain that on an open forum by associating positive connotations of words like, "truth," "honor," and "family" with "wisdom," it seems as if you're selling your own rendition propaganda in different packaging.

       Just playing devils advocate here, but this could read as propaganda itself. This type of thinking typically comes from someone who is overly critical of themselves and society, and usually has trouble assimilating themselves. It could be argued that these beliefs are just representative failures to adapt to societies evolution of mores .

       "rise above the dependence of childhood and the carnal trappings of adolescence in order to become truly independent and informed."
Make sure any partner you choose to share your intimate experiences with shares this ideal in its truest form, and is concsiously working to foster this attitude within himself and others. You become a Warrior as well.

       You lost me at the red pill and Afghanistan being "cool" nonsense... Don't you think that the ubiquitous propaganda you mention is to blame for your thinking that unjust wars are cool, that natural human sexuality is bad and shouldn't be expressed, that "manhood" is a thing, that it matters, and that it is essentially being a "warrior" (i.e., a tool for the state)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like a confused mix of redpill, art of manliness, return of kings, Francis Fukuyama, uber-conservatives, and uber-leftists like Adorno. Sort out your thoughts, OP!

       I sort of agree with this, actually. I'm a man, but if I put myself in a woman's shoes and read through the, it's very unappealing to me. That may not matter to a lot of people on this sub (which is extremely tilted toward the male demographic), but I can't share this with any of my female friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that all of the ideas are bad, but these are the kinds of posts that turn away certain groups of people from being interested in conspiracies at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't even imagine coming to this sub if I were a Jewish person - I would immediately be scared away by the extreme rhetoric and probably never learn the truth, even though had it been presented in a different manner I would probably be very sympathetic to the ideas.

       Some people may say that this is part of the "liberal pussification of culture" by not allowing people to speak their minds about women/gays/whoever, but people need to show some self-restraint at the risk of sending people who are trying to wake up from the matrix running for the hills instead because they are afraid of the people that populate

       My friend listens to WFAN religiously every day.  4-5 hours of sports talk until Mike Francesa is done with his show.  Then he'll listen to a Yankee game or go home and watch Sportscenter.  Basically everything must involve baseball, football, basketball or bowling.  Yelling at the TV and getting super excited over plays.

       "The United States was founded on small towns in which most people knew each other, and gathered at Church each week to (basically) socialize. In fact, for the first ten or so years of our existence, states were more or less countries unto themselves that had the power to coin money and enforce tariffs on interstate commerce. Now, I wouldn’t suggest a return to that level of decentralization, but it’s plain that over the years we’ve morphed into a centrally controlled Empire system."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of many things that would be better for this country than decentralization of the States. It would allow different states to try different policies. Taxes or no taxes, drug laws, voting laws, printing money, etc...  Everything you can think of. It would allow us to see what works and what doesn't and why.  Most importantly it would create competition (which is always good) among other states to have the best standards of living or the best laws for the people. It would encourage more people to get involved in the political system and allow them to become more invested in the outcomes.

       Centralization is a killer. It concentrates more power into fewer hands.

       Excuse me this is reddit. The enlightened beings that us Reddit users are, we know that there has literally never been a conspiracy ever, and entertaining such blasphemy is a clear indication you're a crazy, tin foil hatter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what we know as a fact. The government would never lie. It would never do anything to maintain a global empire that was illegal or immoral. Multinational corporations, especially pharmaceutical companies would never hurt their customers because they're a holy bastion of purity, righteousness and selflessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, power doesn't corrupt. In fact, the more powerful a person or entity is, and the more power and ability they have to cover up their crimes the less likely they are to commit the crimes. Billionaires love bottom feeder plebs, they wanna make the world better for bottom feeders. They just wanna give me free money so I can play VR all day and never have to work (eeeeee!! I can't wait LOL YAY).
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically if you disagree with any of this you're just an idiot who is a conspiracy theorist nutter tin foiler luddite with mentally health issues.

        Do something about it means organizing, getting funding, hackers to take back the stashed trillions in offshore shell corps of 1%ers, muscle and firepower via a large portion of the military commanders on your side, and insiders in congress/Whitehouse waiting for the signal.

       Or stop using their money system. Use Bitcoin. Get your income in Bitcoin (there are places were you can convert your salary at your current job and get paid in Bitcoin) and make all your purchases in Bitcoin. I don't have time to go into the details right now on how to do this, but ask around at r/BTC there have been several people who've lived entirely off of bitcoin.
