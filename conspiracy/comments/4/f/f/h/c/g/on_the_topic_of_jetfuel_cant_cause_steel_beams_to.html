        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is is my opinion that rather than comparison tests that serve as scale examples, we need to do a full scale tub of ignited jet fuel, and an I-BEAM under hydraulic cylindrical traction that a WTC primary support would have been under. Then just watch to see if the beam fails at the burning jetfuel heated temperature under the expected load.</p>

<p>This could be accomplished by buying 
20,112 imperial gallons of jetfuel. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/655918/">http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/655918/</a></p>

<p>Building a (1 Gallon=0.160544 Cu Ft *20,112)  3,228 cu ft tub with an open top. </p>

<p>And spanning a beam across it comparable to the sheer strength to a box column in the core of the WTC.</p>

<p>Rotate this beam under the strain the box columns at WTC were designed to be under. This could be accomplished with a large hydraulically rotated chuck or perhaps a rack and pinion driven chuck.</p>

<p>Sounds like a kickstarter idea to me.</p>

<p>It can totally melt steel in ideal conditions. Wouldn&#39;t have to melt though, it will gain sufficient elasticity to fail at a much lower temperature. Then you have shearing and shit that would easily raise it above melting point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so explain why ALL of the columns melted. that is always the part deniers seem to get stuck on.</p>

<p>IF the beams melted and lead to the failure, then why did all of the columns similtaneously fail. if this wasnt the case then the building would have tilted to one side as it fell, but it came down almost exactly in its own footprint, meaning nearly every column that failed had to do so at the exact same time on each and every floor.</p>

<p>AND had to do this across multiple floors. </p>

<p>had any of them failed even just a second or two before or after the building would have leaned to one side or the other. </p>

<p>that hole (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/images/2002/04/08/national/attack.5.jpg">http://www.nytimes.com/images/2002/04/08/national/attack.5.jpg</a>) is not symmetrical in anyway, so why would the columns fail symmetrically and bring the building down in to its own foot print?</p>

<p>also just to point it out but Adiabatic is the constant pressure, meaning if fuel is fed in to the flame at a constant pressure(or rate) so if some one sat with a firehose adding fuel to a 100% efficiency, full contained flame (aka the completely unrealistic, never even possible lab conditions)</p>

<p>or as wiki clearly states</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note these are theoretical, not actual, flame temperatures produced by a flame that loses no heat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a tank of fuel that has been opened to the air and set aflame is so far removed from adiabatic flame temp that it is almost non-sensical to consider it.</p>

<p>Some interesting quotes from NIST in regards to whether or not the steel was exposed to temperatures that even warranted strength loss:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Examination of photographs showed that 16 of the exterior panels recovered from WTC 1 were exposed to fire prior to the building collapse.  None of the nine recovered panels from within the fire floors of WTC 2 were directly exposed to fire.  NIST used two methods to estimate the maximum temperatures that the steel members had reached: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Observations of paint cracking due to thermal expansion.  <strong>Of the more than 170 areas examined on 16 perimeter column panels, only three columns had evidence that the steel reached temperatures above 250 °C:</strong> east face, floor 98, inner web; east face, floor 92, inner web; and north face, floor 98, floor truss connector.  Only two core column specimens had sufficient paint remaining to make such an analysis, and their temperatures did not reach 250 °C.  NIST did not generalize these results, since the examined columns represented only 3 percent of the perimeter columns and 1 percent of the core columns from the fire floors. </p></li>
<li><p>Observations of the microstructure of the steel.  High temperature excursions, such as due to a fire, can alter the basic structure of the steel and its mechanical properties.  Using metallographic analysis, <strong>NIST determined that there was no evidence that any of the samples had reached temperatures above 600 ºC</strong>. <em>:: NCSTAR 1, p.90</em></p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The two aircraft hit the towers at high speed and did considerable damage to principal structural components (core columns, perimeter columns, and floors) that were directly impacted by the aircraft or associated debris.  However, <strong>the towers withstood the impacts and would have remained standing</strong> were it not for the dislodged insulation and the subsequent multi-floor fires. <em>:: NCSTAR 1, p. 174</em></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The initial jet fuel fires themselves lasted at most a few minutes.</strong> <em>:: NCSTAR 1, p.182</em></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jet fuel sprayed onto the surfaces of typical office workstations burned away within a few minutes.  The jet fuel accelerated the burning of the workstation, but did not significantly affect the overall heat released.</strong> </p></li>
<li><p>In the simulations, none of the columns with intact insulation reached temperatures over 300 °C.  Only a few isolated truss members with intact insulation were heated to temperatures over 400 °C in the WTC 1 simulations and to temperatures over 500 °C in the WTC 2 simulations.  In WTC 1, if the fires had been allowed to continue past the time of building collapse, complete burnout would likely have occurred within a short time since the fires had already traversed around the entire floor, and most of the combustibles would already have been consumed.  In WTC 2, if the fire simulation were extended for 2 hours past the time of building collapse with all windows broken, the temperatures in the truss steel on the west side of the building (where the insulation was undamaged) would likely have increased for about 40 min before falling off rapidly as the combustibles were consumed.  Temperatures of 700 °C to 760 °C were reached over approximately 15 percent of the west floor area for less than 10 min.  Approximately 60 percent of the floor steel had temperatures between 600 °C and 700 °C for about 15 min.  Approximately 70 percent of the floor steel had temperatures that exceeded 500 °C for about 45 min.  At these temperatures, the floors would be expected to sag and then recover a portion of the sag as the steel began to cool.  The temperatures of the insulated exterior and core columns would not have increased to the point where they would have experienced significant loss of strength or stiffness. <em>:: NCSTAR 1, p. 184</em></p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>[...t]he simulations were insensitive to both the amount and distribution of the jet fuel. Sensitivity studies showed that the amount of fuel spilled in the simulation only influenced the results of the first few minutes; the long-term behavior of the simulated fires was unaffected.</strong> <em>:: NCSTAR 1-5F, p.56</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. For the Twin Towers, NIST states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WTC towers likely would not have collapsed under the combined effects of aircraft impact damage and the extensive, multi-floor fires that were encountered on September11, 2001, if the thermal insulation had not been widely dislodged or had been only minimally dislodged by aircraft impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So...they must have completed some pretty thorough, scientific testing to ensure that the fireproofing <em>was</em> in fact, &quot;widely dislodged,&quot; right?</p>

<p>Wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;However, the debris impact test condition simulated an instantaneous impact by a burst of debris whereas the actual scenario involved a three dimensional field of debris, with a depth, width, and height, continuously impacting the target(s) for a finite duration over a large area. <strong>In addition, since the samples used in the tests were not restrained in the same way as actual structural elements would be, the response of the steel component and SFRM to debris impact in terms of dislodgement of SFRM may differ somewhat from that of an actual structural member.&quot;</strong>  NIST NCSTAR 1-6A Appendix C pg. 264 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About flame temperature: only 75% of that temperature would be needed to turn high carbon steel into a pool. After about 600-1000°C mild steel would fail, especially after it got hit by a jet.</p>

<p>All it takes is 1 floor to collapse and the weight of the upper floors will collapse the lower. This is true of controlled demolition as well, they don&#39;t wire every support on every floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay but what you are not considering is those flame temps are absolute 100% efficiency with zero heat lost. essentially 100% combustion in perfect molar ratios in a vacuum in a thermodynamic impossible hypothetical situation.</p>

<p>now likely those temps in an open air explosion with a metal that does conduct heat away, plus the air that does so as well you might be talking about 30-50% of those temps at best, and i am likely highballing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a mostly closed concrete room (a fantastic insulator) and the temperature you need is not that to melt steel but only to bring it to a failure point. Also the steel I mentioned is high carbon stock, not the mild steel they use for concrete work.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to do that.  It&#39;s already been done.  The steel didnt&#39; change at all.</p>

<p>In fact, every time you make eggs on a stainless steel or carbon steel or cast iron skillet you are performing this test.  So then you will have to ask yourself how natural gas--which burns much hotter in open flame than kerosene (jet fuel)---doesn&#39;t melt holes in your pan.  The answer--unsurprisingly--is SCIENCE.   Steel is a conductor of heat so it disperses it. that&#39;s the 2nd law of thermodynamics; secondly, MP of steel is 3300-3500F, much higher than kerosene, around 500-900F in open flame.</p>

<p>The trusses of the WTC were connected to larger beams.  If you dumped heat on them, the heat would dissppate along the trusses and beams, making the entire skeletal structure of the WTC a kind of &#39;heat sink&#39; not unlike your CPU heatsink.  in other words, because of the first and 2nd laws of thermodynamics which I assure you were NOT suspended on 9/11, then it would have been the case that heat from the fires would easily be disappated by the steel and they would be completely unscathed.  Combine that with all the enhanced fireproofing on the trusses and beams...</p>

<p>So in other words, because of science we have a crime here.  It&#39;s the case of the missing Joules.  IN this case, joules are the missing heat energy that would need to be there to account for the melting beams (we have videographic evidence of molten steel AND firefighter testimony AND recovery worker testimony AND the fact that the fires were in temps in excess of 3000F (according to mayor guiliani) burning for 3 months, well into DEC.  Which is again, a &quot;where&#39;s the joules&quot; problem.  </p>

<p>Burn a bonfire of ikea furniture and a shitton of kerosene and I guarantee you it will be dead cold in a week, not 3 months later.</p>

<p>Additional heat from a thermal agent such as thermite, nuclear weapon or directed energy weapon.  The first being most likely but the others not ruled out entirely</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Melting point of 1060 steel is 1500°C, much higher than mild steel used in building construction. Heat conductivity is 50W/mK. You would need a gigantic piece to dump the energy from gallons of burning fuel in a confined space.</p>

<p>Your pan analogy isn&#39;t really accurate. A pan won&#39;t melt because it&#39;s a massive hear sink compared to a small flame that is only applied to one side. </p>

<p>You can nearly melt steel with oak and a bellows, certainly get it hot enough to deform and fail under load. When it fails it reaches a point where metal will shear, this creates a tremendous amount of heat. Well more than enough to melt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for theories, but I&#39;m also into math and worked for a long time in manufacturing. Steel ain&#39;t all that tough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the key there is the bellows, the extra air being forced in to the mix is what jacks the heat up. at the same time all of that is also heavily insulated to reflect all the heat back in to the metal being worked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds of gallons of liquid fuel in a semi closed area would more than increase the pressure/temp enough to bring steel under load to its failure point.

    <div class="md"><p>when you put a cap on a fire and starve it for oxygen what happens?</p>

<p>it does not get hotter, it goes out. it also produces black smoke (the kind seen pouring out of the building iirc) that is unburnt fuel.</p>

<p>so no the fires did not burn hotter, than they would in open air, they would have burned even cooler by a large margin based on how starved it was for oxygen (this is the main flaw with the arguement) </p>

<p>all evidence shows the fires were oxygen starved, which means temperatures vastly below the ideal max burn temp of jet fuel</p>

<p>so on to the whole insulating arguement. the damn buildings had glass fucking windows <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/107e_%C3%A9tage_du_World_Trade_Center_(10-12-1979)_(1).JPG">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/107e_%C3%A9tage_du_World_Trade_Center_(10-12-1979)_(1).JPG</a></p>

<p>now if anything exploded in their all that glass is gone, so there is nothing to insulate the heat that would pour out the sides, glass is also a great conductor (and if they were double panes they would burst due to the temperature differences in between) </p>

<p>now the smoke stayed black so if even if the windows didnt pop, from the collison or the super high temp fires. the fire never got &quot;that&quot; hot due to being starved of air.</p>

<p>most buildings have safe guard in place to prevent fresh air from getting to fire areas as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well funny thing bro, i worked in a materials engineering lab.</p>

<p>so here is the thing, if the heat was enough to melt the steel, it would have melted the windows too.  or do you believe in the magic of super hot fuel burning though steel but leaving glass intact?</p>

<p>unburnt fuel means the reaction is well below ideal burning temperatures if the windows did not fail or melt, then there is no way the Steel inside would have. the fires were oxygen starved so never would have burned at max temps. the hotest point would have been the entry hole as it would be the only location drawing in air for the fire or letting the smoke exit.</p>

<p>absolutely none of the footage shows the sort of raging inferno pouring out of those holes that would be needed to melt either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about hottest temps being near the point of entry from air. We have to consider this big structure got hit by a  1M lb vehicle as well. May have defeated some fire doors and whatnot. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really not trying to argue here, I just see this as a poor explication of what happened with no basis in physical reality. I&#39;m fully confident this incident was carried out by the government, or they had a role in its happening.  I don&#39;t see why we need to jump to unrealistic conclusions to prove that idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually the plane strike is a big deal, however the buildings were rated to take a plane strike when they were designed. if that impact were a part of the collapse the buildings would have fallen in the opposite direction that the plane hit (or the same from swinging back after) but it fell straight down, which means the momentum of the plane had no part in the collapse. planes are made of 75%+ aluminum so the vast majority of the aircraft would shatter before it could damage steel columns behind concrete. engines and landing gear would have been the only parts likely strong enough to actually take out columns and concrete imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be 500k tons of feathers and it&#39;s going to do some internal damage at speed. Like I said brother, I have no reason to believe this was anyone but the government. Hard to fathom why they would go outside the box for a fairly simple task. That is very unlike the government I&#39;ve worked with/for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually that is exactly what thermite does, if you have ever seen them set up a demolition that is exactly how they bring them down.</p>

<p>thermite cuts the steel beams on angles so they sheer off and let the building drop so it can fall in its foot print. </p>

<p>im saying there is no possible way that some jet fuel melted those beams to the point of failure, while being oxygen starved and well below their ideal burning temperature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not used very often, there are a few times it has been used the military iirc uses it to destroy bridged and such, but thermite is not really an explosive so much as a cutting agent, because of how it burns it slowly burns through thick steel.  most demolitions charges are timed in rapid succession so it would be a poor choice for that.</p>

<p>frankly ive been waiting for something to explain that molten steel other than thermite, hell if they told me they managed to smuggle a few suitcases or cargo boxes of thermite on to the planes i&#39;d see that as a possible scenario.</p>

<p>but even in that scenario you just have it burning a hole down the center of the building something unlikely to make an entire floor drop at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve played with thermite and had my hand on a carbon arc welder quite a bit. Seems extraordinary for the task of dropping a building. Just as easily rig some charges.</p>

<p>In addition thermite would be bright as shit and obviously visible. That stuff goes off like a flashbulb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay so i agree with you first of all,</p>

<p>but some issues i see popping up.</p>

<p>1) the heat dissipation, the beams are not large in comparison, and are not exposed to the air (the fire sheathing would insulate them in the worst way IF this was a reason) again i still think the idea the burned in what was essentially kerosene is absurd.</p>

<p>2) your bonfire example also doesnt really work,  the temps would need to be stupidly high to begin with, but the reason they were still hot 3 months later was that the debris fell on them, and would have insulated the heat that was already there.</p>

<p>it seems pretty clear thermite was present, just wanted to point those things out before the shills latched on to them to try to discredit you.</p>

<p>nuclear imho is a silly distraction as residue would have been easily measured and survivors/responders would have likely had radiation sickness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when you put a cap on a fire and starve it for oxygen what happens?</p>

<p>it does not get hotter, it goes out. it also produces black smoke (the kind seen pouring out of the building iirc) that is unburnt fuel.</p>

<p>so no the fires did not burn hotter, than they would in open air, they would have burned even cooler by a large margin based on how starved it was for oxygen (this is the main flaw with the arguement) </p>

<p>all evidence shows the fires were oxygen starved, which means temperatures vastly below the ideal max burn temp of jet fuel</p>

<p>so on to the whole insulating arguement. the damn buildings had glass fucking windows <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/107e_%C3%A9tage_du_World_Trade_Center_(10-12-1979)_(1).JPG">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/107e_%C3%A9tage_du_World_Trade_Center_(10-12-1979)_(1).JPG</a></p>

<p>now if anything exploded in their all that glass is gone, so there is nothing to insulate the heat that would pour out the sides, glass is also a great conductor (and if they were double panes they would burst due to the temperature differences in between) </p>

<p>now the smoke stayed black so if even if the windows didnt pop, from the collison or the super high temp fires. the fire never got &quot;that&quot; hot due to being starved of air.</p>

<p>most buildings have safe guard in place to prevent fresh air from getting to fire areas as well.</p>
