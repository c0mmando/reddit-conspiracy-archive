       It wasn't about him. I believe he was referring to the western world when he said that. He was basically saying hat just because they let their people vote it doesn't mean shit, because the people that count the votes are ultimately deciding who gets elected.

       Oh completely agree with you on that. I'm not saying he is a hero by any means, quite the opposite in fact. But him saying things like this makes people question reality, and for that he did make an impact. This shouldn't be happening in a modern world, but it still does, needless killing, wars, etc.

       I'd like to point out that when European merchants first came to Africa, they had lots of awesome stuff to sell and all Africans had to offer were slaves of other Africans... In some African countries close to 70% of population were slaves. We're talking about 16th century here, slavery was long abolished in Europe by that time. Meanwhile it flourished in Africa and in Muslim world.

       I know. I have nothing against black people BTW, but this is the truth. There are many written accounts about this. Europeans didn't go around catching black people, they went to the market and bought them from other black people for for mirrors, nice fabrics and necklaces...

       Comparitively the same amount of jews died in the Holocaust.  You hear about that 100x more than the death of the Ukrainians.

       There are more Jews worldwide then Ukrainian. If Ukrainians were as numerous as Jews in Hollywood we probably would hear about it as much. But the idea that no one knows about Stalin and the Ukrainian Famine is just wrong.

       Ironically, Stalin is credited with this line but it was actually said about Stalin by a famed pacifist (who's name escapes me now). But it's almost always attributed to Stalin, so often that it's become the accepted truth.

       Then I came across this, which both supports and contradicts me, but is interesting nonetheless.

       It is a somewhat popular saying in commercial banking especially as it relates to large, high profile construction projects. Kind of like lender beware. You can get yourself in a situation where the developer actually has you by the balls rather than the expected outcome of a project heading south, which would be putting the borrower over the barrel.

       Its funny as well because when Stalin went to Potsdam Churchill was still primeminister. The general election happened while he was there which was a landslide for Clement Atlees labour party and Churchill was recalled and apparently Stalin just couldn't understand how a man like Churchill couldn't fix the election.

       Sorry you took it so personally, but it's not as cut and dry as you say it is. It's on brainyquote and stuff but it very well could be a false attribution, the only case of it in writing I could find was a variant in Boris Bazhanov's
       <em>
        Memoirs of Stalin's Former Secretary
       </em>
       written in 1991, not that it matters much.

       if election votes were posted on a spreadsheet, with each voter getting a unique ID # and able to check that their vote was for the right person, the list could be calculated and you could see the winners.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is unrealistic for 3 reasons
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the general public is too stupid and/or lazy to even check something like that, let alone handle keeping track of their other ID #. a good example of how stupid and little people care - look at the amount of people using windows10, even on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) the average person's vote doesn't matter, and it shouldn't for 2 reasons
      </p>
      <p>
       a) the public has let the system get like this over the last century. nobody cared then, nobody really cares now, nobody will care in the future. every 4/8 years there's some hubub about 'election fraud', everyone forgets about it a few weeks later. last time i remember the ron paul votes, nobody cared about that shortly after
      </p>
      <p>
       b) almost all people should have no say in any bigger picture things.  they can't even process the information that's relevant to them, let alone researching and knowing about bigger issues that don't directly involve them. Just because you're "here" doesn't mean you should get a say in something you know nothing about, which in reality is 99.99% of voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the final reason why none of this matters, because whoever wins the next election - it won't matter. whether it's trump or sanders or hillary, for example, within the next 10-15 years all illegal immigrants will be made into some form of documented resident.

       Why isn't Bush, both of them. Why wasn't Reagan. Why isn't Rove. Why aren't everyone who works for the voting machine companies. Because we no longer have a democracy. We will have to have a revolution to restore it. Not looking forward to it.

       Soon enough, the elites won't even have to rely on the Soldiers and Policemen to enforce the laws. They will be able to squash any rebellion with the machines. Our only chance to fight will be with the use of hackers that will try to control the machines; however, if they take away the encryption, enforce backdoors on everything, and in the future, prevent any computer (smartphone, desktop, laptop) to be disconnected from the internet (or simply prevent you from using it if there's no connection), we won't even have that.

       If they make backdoors a given, then hackers would have no problem. The only problem with that, is that it would all be traceable, because no encryption on the public's devices. A hacker would have to have their own encryption software to cover their asses. I'm sure all police and military tech will have major encryption and massive firewalls. They just want to keep the public vulnerable.

       The most informational part of this clip occurs towards the end when a licensed attorney addresses specific actions taken by the vote counters and audit officials that reveal how such a fraud is perpetrated.

       Personally, it's difficult for me to watch this, because I have a lot of problems with how this is all structured. What irks me the most is this guy on the far end of the city board who proclaims to be a "professor of auditing". That's wonderful, good for him. I'm not entirely sure what you have to do to become a professor of auditing, but forgive my ignorance if I think properly auditing the results of an election is far from being a complex science. Being a "professor" does not mean that what you say goes in lieu of relevant counterpoints, yet that's the assertion he implies right before the 38-minute mark. He asks the woman speaking what she's a doctor of, as if particular fields of medical practitioners are incapable of grasping the concept of a legitimate audit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using your credentials to establish superiority in a discussion or as a defensive rebuttal is all too often a cheap and cowardly way to avoid an honest back-and-forth that provides both concerning questions and thoughtful corrective actions. To simply discredit a family physician's critical remarks on the basis of being a "professor" makes me want to vomit. Perhaps, explaining why everything that occurred during the audit happened like it did would better alleviate the nerves of those in attendance, rather than insisting your process is fine and people shouldn't worry about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of hearing is so discouraging to so many champions of change. I can build mathematical models that can give you exact odds a particular candidate has of winning based on exit polling of any sample size, and have the info verified as true. Yet, I get the idea that I couldn't have a discussion about this with the "professor" because, well...I don't have a degree? I'm missing a certificate telling people that I'm a sharp guy and know how an audit works?
      </p>
      <p>
       People should never made to be felt they are not worthy of particular suggestions or concerns because of educational shortcomings, especially in matters of government. Educational accomplishments are based solely on the merit of other people's approvals, and there are a lot of highly-intelligent people who didn't bother with that process, and they should be listened to every bit as much as the others. Just my opinion...you can guess which side of that coin I'm on, LOL.

       Great comment. But, I really wish the team of auditors I used to work with could have been there for the guy saying he is a professor of auditing. They would have been like "oh yeah?" and then eaten him alive. They are great people, but they dissect government contractors for breakfast and eat the remains for lunch.

       The
       <em>
        sole
       </em>
       fact that the reported election results could even be found anywhere in the same building the audit was taking place is in and of itself proof of a flawed process. There's really no justification for this. Notice how the officials only decide to address the questions they have a real answer for, all the while talking down to the constituents. For example, the guys on the board were very quick to explain the situation with the back-up voting machines and their role in the audit process, but completely ignored the complaints about the method the auditors were using to count the votes, which
       <em>
        is a complete travesty
       </em>
       and should have been the focus of everybody in that room. Instead, they're told their 5 minutes are up, drop a note in the suggestions box, and get out of here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my honest opinion, a government that holds hearings of this importance in the manner which they do is very worthy of a government that needs to be overthrown.

       Regardless if you are a sanders or a trump supporter. You have to love the fact that millions are waking up to see democracy is dead. Sanders is a true social democrat, trump is a true nationalist, and those are two legitimate political philosophies, and they should be allowed to debate it out. Neoliberalism and neoconservative is on their last breaths, good riddance.

       I had read some time ago that exit polls were how your validated reported results for accuracy. As soon as electronic voting machines came on the scene, exit polls have been "wrong", started with Ohio 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone know anything about this?

        Exit polls have historically and throughout the world been used as a check against, and rough indicator of, the degree of election fraud. Some examples of this include the Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004, and the Ukrainian presidential election, 2004.

       Bush in 2004 lost by a wide margin based on exit polls. But the in states with Diebold Machines he beat the exit polls by a wide margin in his favor in each one. It was so fucked up. That motherfucker was not elected either time he was President.

       I was in Round Rock which is part of Williamson County. The past few times I voted here you always got an option between paper or electronic. Also they segregated the lines based on party this time, and it used to be one line. It was super sketchy.

       Yea, it made no sense. Everyone got asked what party they were voting in and then went in the right line or left line, and the door was labeled Republican / Democrat. There was seemingly no purpose other then to try to sign me up to be a volunteer for the specific party, and give me an ad for their upcoming rally.

       Last Friday, Republican candidate John Kasich
       <em>
        (running in distant third place behind Trump and Cruz)
       </em>
       was interviewed by National Public Radio host Robert Siegel, who asked Kasich how, given his trailing position in the polls, he could possibly hope to become the nominee at the Republican National Convention.
      </p>

       His answers shed some light on the true nature of US politics, and the way that the Elite see the peon voters:

        <strong>
         KASICH
        </strong>

         Well, first of all, there are no rules for this convention - none. Each convention sets their own rules.

      <p>
       Kasich is clearly saying that the Republican Party is fully prepared to toss all of the Primary results into the SHREDDER - ignoring the charade we call the "Primaries", and that it will be the DELEGATES, (not the people) who ultimately decide on the nominee - and Kasich seems to believe that he has the nomination** in the bag.**
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, as of today, the Republican delegate count is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trump: 845
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Cruz: 559
      </p>
      <p>
       Kasich: 148
      </p>
      <p>
       So much for the illusion of self governance. The only question is, where do
       <strong>
        <em>

       I'm no expert on Kasich but this doesn't read to me like the smugness of an elite. If anything I'd guess the true elites view him as just as much of a peon. This reads more like the desperation of a candidate without a ghost of a chance who's trying to convince himself he still has one.

       Political parties in the US are basically private clubs and they can set any rules they wish. They are under no obligation to consider the popular will of the people. They are counterproductive to our political process and should be abandoned in my opinion.

       If nobody cared the popular vote lost the presidency in 2000, nothing else will phase the public. Or hell, go further back. There have been plenty of incidents in he last century that demonstrated a gross abuse of power - prohibition, the drug war, Vietnam, the JFK conspiracy, Watergate, the oil crisis, the propagandized insanity that was the cold war, the isolationism while Nazi's took over Europe, or the rationing once the war started. The hunger and riots while barons rode high in the great depression. Nothing will change until the TV goes out and the hot wings get too expensive on slave wages, and even then the people will be too powerless to fight an enemy at the scale of the US military and its global alliances bent on maintaining power.

       Personally, maybe one of the oligarchs who are not sociopaths (and there are very few of them) takes pity on me and lets me colonize another planet or something, because that is the only reasonable way out, and even then... you are on their spaceship. Even if they are a nice guy, you are still flying on a spaceship crewed by the established power structures, and they will see them maintained.

       When empires go into decline they become vulnerable to being knocked off by any old determined rabble. Look at the decline of the French empire. The loss of Indo-China at Dien-Bien-Phu was only the start. They went on to loose all of their colonial possessions. The British gave up India to the non violent protest of Ghandi and gave up most of their colonial territories with a few quiet dirty wars such as those faught in Kenya, Aden, Oman, Suez and Malaysia.

       Given the piss poor performance of the US forces in Iraq and  Afghanistan i think a moderately well armed insurgency could beat a fiscally crippled federal government. How loyal will the army or marines or navy stay if they're not being paid.

       Were they a disenfrancised voter class?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not - and you can't prove it was based on discrimination - doesn't seem to be any laws violated (not in e VRA at least).

      <p>
       Just corruption.

       That doesn't mean it doesn't suck, of course. If I went to vote for these shenanigans and played by the Rules and was still told to fuck off I'd be pretty angry.

       It is uncomfortable, realizing how vast and corrupt this system is. It is exciting too, though... Gives more purpose to our existence. Something to fight against, a positive idea to represent, no more reason to just be a cog in the machine.

       The author of the "New York" link is incorrect... NY has closed primaries, so you can only vote the party you are registered. Only registered Dems could vote... There were no "independent" votes for either candidate. Any independents who tried to vote would be turned away at the door.

       The worst part is that when we introduce really secure blockchain-based online voting, which is really our only hope, people will point back to these fucking bullshit machines as evidence for why no form of electronic voting  can ever work, ever. We are so screwed.

       Mr. You Know Who already has quantum computing to the 9's. There will never be secure voting in this failed implementation of a flawed, that ultimately spawned "The Great Experiment" known as The United States. It failed folks. Who can say they are proud of this country with a straight face and not be a total dumb ass. The history books will probably not reflect how we systematically manipulated all of humanity and led us to our own extinction accurately, but not much can be done about that. We can't live forever.

       None of us talking right now will see a right and just world. That is because the entire planet and all the things on it are sick and dying. Pretty sure we fucked it up so bad that it won't be till after the ELE that finally wipes the slate clean. Take your pick. Chemtrails, HAARP, the poles and axis already in the process of shifting, nuclear weapons, societal collapse with mass starvation. I could go on for hoes. The elite have plan A - Infinity lined up to depopulate the planet.

       Political parties determine a candidate to put forth on a ballot. It is quite incidental that sometimes, for some states a poll of opinion is performed. Whoever conflates those polls with an actual election should not be chastised too much though. It's an easy mistake to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parties will claim that they have rules and there is a definite process to come up with a candidate. Those rules are changing, arbitrary, cryptic and sometimes non-sensical. But nobody cares. It's just the way things are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the main election is just as good. Electoral college and what not. But it doesn't really matter, in the end we're given a choice between someone from side A and someone from side 1. And either will come from the ruling class. They both oppose strongly on very minor issues.

       I like the sentiment but prefer a nonviolent "dropout" movement, non-participation in the system, alternative educations, lifestyles, economies, self sustaining food production. When enough people step away from the beast, it will starve. Something to show my future child the power of love in the face of hate and fear.

       Slavemasters have a vested interest in keeping slaves slaving, and they won't allow a slave to stop. We may have abolished overt slavery in the west, but all the slavemasters did was rebrand it. And expand it. To the point we are all slaves, if we are not a king.

       I admit this is logical and only disagree on spiritual reasons. Light will always defeat the darkness, when darkness tries to get close to the light, it simply becomes light... If your actions are based in love then you are untouchable

       Love_And_Light33 is right, i try to ignore what i think is happening, even though it maybe like the thinking of Cypher from The Matrix (wanting to replug, forget it all, "Ignorance is Bliss"), because if it is all happening, then the people doing it are far too strong to oppose. No one really knows what is what. You can read and write comments all day every day and still not know for sure. So I tell myself, it is impossible to control a chaotic world. And I try to think positive. I try to think, maybe those who have this much power, might be trying to do some good. I can't explain it, but I was on this kinda thinking last year and everyone and everything was pleasant and positive. Somehow I lost that thinking. Anyway, just do good, be good.

       Tell that to the French, Russian, and American Revolutions,

       how had the aristocracy responded to the peace before those actions. They responded by taking more, because no one stopped them. If someone is robbing your house, the

       Propaganda is predicared on passive participation of the masses. When then masses are taking
       <strong>
        active
       </strong>
       part in the movement, propaganda fails.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems you may not have faith that the majority can be called to action. You have been proven wrong throughout hostory. You and I are part of the masses, they are the same as we are. If you fear the 'sheeps' ' complacencey then it feels very much like you consider yourself more evolved.

       Didn't you hear about the Florida laws making it a crime to disconnect from the grid? No one did until one lady who was fully kitted out with  solar for a year - running computers, big aquarium, etc. cancelled her electric.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police and electric company got a court order. At the end of the day they came in her house, disconnected her solar from the storage system and forced her out of her home on the basis that  it was a 'health hazard' to not be connected to the grid. She ended up camping in her own backyard for weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an ALEC law that had been slipped in.

       And, herein lies the problem.  I work for a test lab that tests voting machines for The United States Elections Assistance Committee (EAC).  The audit process actually works, when done, correctly...
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Turn on machine, get a printed 'Zero votes' printout from the machine (this shows that no votes are added/changed, beforehand)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Open station.  This is when people begin voting.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Close station, printout results.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now, the downside to this process is where it is put into hands of people.  YOU MUST TRUST THE PEOPLE COUNTING, OR ALL OF THIS IS MOOT.  The printouts from 'Zero' and 'End' are signed and dated by the auditor when they are printed.  Now, you have accurate (to the best of it's ability) machine totals, a paper trail, AND the actual ballots from the machines.  So, in theory, you have two totals that MUST match, or else there was some issue with the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, something as simple as having a little too much static electricity built up can Blue-Screen an ES&amp;S machine.

       With modern tech I'd like to know the hardware architecture with all specs public, and have the source code for the programming openly published along with a public copy of the compiled version and its checksum. Not only that, but save periodic points kept on record of the vote tallys with their own files and checksums. Hopefully this would reveal any code injection or other tampering with the data. Votes entered on the machine indexed and identified by number which is available to each voter in the form of a reciept. This data should also be made available for release after the vote to ensure confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       My feeling is that making it open source in some regard makes it more secure in regards to proper auditing. Trusting the software to do the right thing while it does a printout isn't good enough if you have no idea what's going on inside the box.

       I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone here who doesn't take the falsification of elections as a "well, duh" level of given here. I just think you're equally hard pressed to find more people who regularly frequent this subreddit who think that Sanders is not a political pawn himself.

       Bernieprop - that would actually be a good Subreddit, just for the posting of the Berninite propaganda that his supporters believe is appropriate to spread everywhere, as though the spreading of propaganda for any purpose was a positive thing. Maybe it would make Reddit les susceptible to this in the future?
