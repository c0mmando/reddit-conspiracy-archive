       God has no role in modern society.  He was created when simple people looked at the stars at night, and they got scared.  But the one, universal lesson, that most "Bibles" say, is do unto others.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to believe in God, feel free.  But in the mean time, treat your fellow man with dignity and respect.

       Hebrew is an interesting language in which each character has individual meaning. Words can often be translated by combining the meaning of each character, such as the word "Ab" being father. A is aleph, meaning leader or first. B is for bet, the word for house. Together aleph-bet make "leader of the house", or father.

       YHWH or the four characters Yod-He-Waw-He is the Hebrew word used as God's personal name as early as 1300 b.c.e.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the name is often said to mean "I am who I am" a character study turns out interesting results. Here are some possible literal interpretations of what the name could mean:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        closed hand, window, nail, window
       </p>
       <p>
        deed, reveal, secure, reveal
       </p>
       <p>
        to make window, to secure window
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and my favorite
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Behold the work of the closed hand, Behold the nail
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The name God used to describe himself to paleo-Hebrews accurately portrays the crucifixion more than 1000 years before Jesus(Yeshua) walked the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The progression of God's name through time is along the lines of YHWH, YaHWeH, YaHuWaH, Iehova, Jehovah, all of which are referring to the same being.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, God is the loving creator of everything who uses prophecy to show us who He is. Perfect love can not be forced, it can only be accepted or rejected.

       YHWH is not Jehovah
      </p>
      <p>
       Jehovah is Satan Aka Baal aka worship of man aka made up sacrificial God
      </p>
      <p>
       21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
      </p>
      <p>
       22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
      </p>
      <p>
       23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
      </p>
      <p>
       24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
       25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
      </p>
      <p>
       26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

      <p>
       30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.
      </p>
      <p>
       31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
      </p>
      <p>
       32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
      </p>
      <p>
       33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
      </p>
      <p>
       34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
      </p>
      <p>
       35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
      </p>
      <p>
       36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
      </p>
      <p>
       37 Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
      </p>
      <p>
       38 Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
      </p>
      <p>
       39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.

       How did you come to that conclusion from this passage?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the King James text every time "The LORD" is italicized, the source document read "YHWH". It was thought at the time of translation that the name of God was to be unpronounceable as a sign of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ba'al is a Phoenician word that literally means "lord", which is the cause of this confusion. The Canaanites worshiped various patron deities and the title of Ba'al or lord went to their god who represented a mighty hunter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look again at the list of names: YHWH, YaHWeH, YaHuWaH, Iehova, Jehovah. The first three are hebrew, the fourth is latin and the last is old english.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pronouncing them is something like
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ya-weh
yah-way
yah-hew-ah
ye-ho-vah
Jeh-ho-vah
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Same name, different times and languages with slightly different pronunciations. Hope this helps clear it up.

       I'm just gonna post some stuff and pick at what you want to debate about, it's all theory right?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Blacks are the lost 12 tribes of Israel / Jacob
       </li>
       <li>
        Blacks Jews worshiped YHWY
       </li>
       <li>
        Blacks Jews were told not to break the commandments
       </li>
       <li>
        Black Jews broke the commandments which set off a chain of events like going to in captivity in Egypt/Transatlantic Slave Trade
       </li>
       <li>
        Blacks used to rule the world
There are more than 10 commandments
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       One of them being blacks shouldn't mix with whites and their culture because whites would take advantage of them for it and also to watch the number of whites in the world.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Deuteronomy 28:8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.
       </p>

      <p>
       Go google what Leprosy means in the bible and how they would check their skin for it.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       what you have said here makes sense, the first three black hebrews and the fourth is latin
      </p>
      <p>
       Latin was created from the Greek alphabet which was stolen from Persia which was when the blacks ruled. Race mixing had already begun before Latin even became a thing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Latin (Latin: lingua latīna, IPA: [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈtiːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rome was a mixed empire just like Greece. What happened was the same thing that happened here in America, tricked into being humble to strangers and than invaded Trojan horse style.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Remember at this time, blacks were tricked by Baalam
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexander the great was the first trojan horse to the black empire, this is why Cyrus The Great is referenced in the bible as a mighty warrior. God blessed the Yishmaelites and Cyrus The Great protected the Black Hebrews.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        White Jews are Esau aka The master Hunter and Red Meat Eater.
       </li>
       <li>
        White Jews worshiped Baal
       </li>
       <li>
        White Jews inverted the 10 commandments in order to gain power over their brother Jacob
       </li>
       <li>
        Whites Jews tricked Jacob by going to non Israelite Baalam and found out they could gain power by making Israel stop following the commandments
       </li>
       <li>
        This was done by sacrificing animals to the made up god
        <strong>
         Baal
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        Today Esau still makes reference to himself through use of the color Red
       </li>
       <li>
        Things that are red are Rothschild=Red Shield, Red Cross, Red Army, Confederate Flag colors,Republican Colors, knights Templar, the devil being red, etc.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is why you will find that both Blacks and Khazar both tend to have large noses, lips, curly hair and large genitalia in their genes, they were twins. One was red and hairy and a master hunter, while Jacob was a thinker and more relaxed. God originally blessed ESAU but ESAU traded his blessing for soup and god then gave the blessing to Jacob.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now see this is why god mentions
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Romans 9:13King James Version (KJV) 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hitler knew this that is why the Stalin attacked Germany.

      </p>
      <p>
       Normal Whites (non Esau) and Muslims go hand in hand for the most part, whites used to be Muslims. It wasn't until after Christianity when Esau took over did whites begin converting over to the Hebrew bible, this was done for control. Whites used to know the blacks were the real Hebrews and that they were Muslims but lost that knowledge just like blacks lost the knowledge of who they were. This is why you see the Syrian migration, it's testament to the fact that whites used to be Muslims but separated because ESAU currently controls the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you will find that people like Hitler/Malcolm X both said some of the exact same things, one white and one black. The reason the world is in the condition today it is because Esau a predator by nature is in charge of shaping reality.
      </p>

       Ibn Umar said, “No! I swear by Allah that the prophet (pbuh) didn’t say that Jesus was light-skinned, but he said ‘While I was asleep, I was walking around the Kaaba when I saw a black-skinned man with straight hair between two men. I asked who the man was and I was told that he was Isa (Jesus) the son of Meryem.’…”

       This is why you will notice that in 2001, the first people they blamed was the Muslims, you see the 3rd wheel to the whole thing is the Muslims. They hold the comparison between now and then. This is why Zionist want to kill them off so badly, they hold the truth between the 3 main religions. Meanwhile back here in America, Jacob is in a state of psychosis but slowly coming out. This was done with the election of President Obama.

       You made a lot of claims, most of the time without seeming to reference what led you to hold that position. Lets go back to you passage in 1 Kings. You claimed that YHWH is God and Jehovah is Lucifer or Baal, and then provided a passage that says nothing of the sort. After you seem to agree, you start to talk about "YHWH's black jews" and seem to suggest that Jehovah is different and the God of Latin speaking people. I have no idea where that is coming from, and your textual example doesn't make sense.

       <strong>
        At times in Israel’s history Jehovah was referred to as “Baal,”
       </strong>
       in the sense of his being the Owner or Husband of the nation. (Isa 54:5) Also, the Israelites may have improperly associated Jehovah with Baal in their apostasy. The latter appears to be borne out by Hosea’s prophecy that the time would come when Israel, after going into and being restored from exile, would repentantly call Jehovah “My husband,” and no more “My owner” (“My Baal,” AT). The context suggests that the designation “Baal” and its associations with the false god would never again pass the lips of the Israelites. (Ho 2:9-17) The bad connotation that appears to have become attached to the Hebrew word baʹʽal because of its association with the degraded worship of Baal is thought by some to be the reason the writer of Second Samuel used the names “Ish-bosheth” and “Mephibosheth” (boʹsheth means shame) instead of “Eshbaal” and “Merib-baal.”—2Sa 2:8; 9:6; 1Ch 8:33, 34; see ISH-BOSHETH.

        Miriam, Moses's sister was cursed with the same curse and god turned her white as snow.

       You are still playing off of the misunderstanding that the word ba'al means lord, but also means gets a husband (1), high (1), husband (3), married (4), married* (2), marries (2), marry (1), marrying* (1), master (1), ruled (2).
      </p>
      <p>
       You have positioned yourself as to say every time this word root is used, that it always refers to a single specific entity when used and it simply does not. The argument you are making seems very much like this fictitious claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "British people think that God is anyone in a higher position than them self, because they respectfully refer to them as lord. Lord means god so they are calling them god!!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It would be faulty logic and poor understanding of the English language to make such a claim. Some Hebrews turned from God and worship patron deities at times, that is the extent of what you have presented here. I repeated that something didn't make sense when you used unsubstantiated mental leaps that aren't supported by the facts. That sort of logical fallacy literally does not make sense.

       These are the same name in different languages with slightly different pronunciations. Notice how the "J" came from "I" and even earlier from "Y". This is the exact same phenomenon as man's pronunciation of God's name YHWH drifted towards Jehovah. The Hebrew name יוֹחָנָן Yochanan literally means "YHWH is gracious" and the English version John means the same, further proof of etymological shifting from "Y" to "J".
 God's name is not what changed and they are not referring to separate entities.

       About the leprosy article you linked (that did not come from the sources I used, note the bibliography at the end) did not mention a single thing about black people as opposed to white people. It states that biblical leprosy may not always have been the exact same bacterial infection, but upholds the idea of the nature of what the early disease was. Bacterial infections can be in clothes, on walls, on animal hides, etc. The author didn't claim there is nothing in common, they are speaking about it being an infection caused by specifically the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis of Hansen's disease or not. An argument for a different bacterium being the cause of earlier leprosy is not earth-shattering or paradigm shifting.

       You see you are incorrect, a name does not change. If you are born and use that native tongue and that is your language than your name is respected by the language. If your name is English, when you go China, it would be rude and incorrect to pronounce the name in Chinese. People are entities not items, that's why you don't understand. You may use a general term to refer to the lord but when announcing his name, you cannot argue that his name will and will forever be

        YHWY.

       Yes white false Jews did this. The same way they rolled into Russia with the Red Army, burned all the orthodox synagogues (over 1000) and changed the native speaking language to Yiddish and rebuilt their own churches where their own language and religion (Talmud) was put in place.

       In different languages they do. Jesus wasn't called "Jesus" at the time, his name is actually Yeshua. Jesus is an acceptable name because it is the same name for the same person in a different language at a different time. I could detail the etymological changes for that one as well and show the clear progression.

       Are you going to claim that Yeshua is God and Jesus is satan or vice versa?

       This is exactly what I summarized earlier. Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis which are microorganisms. The Dr. said the the quarantine period was too short, ruling out those specific microorganisms for the earlier disease. She then looks towards scabies and ringworm, which are also microorganisms and infectious.

       I never said that once in this entire conversation, I said they are similar. The exact quote was "they still are talking actual leprosy

       Think of a line, at one end it's the darkest color black imaginable and the brightest white at the other. The transition from white to black is slow fade from one to the other. Leaving most of the line a grayish color. That line is god. That line is existence in  itself. Your entire life is laid out on that line. The two opposite poles (black and white) create perapectives (shades of gray). Life is experience. A set of senses is currently creating an experience by perceiving the shade of gray wherever it currently is located on the line. The ego is born from the shade of gray your senses see. There are actions you can take to move you either direction.

       A better question would be what is God?
      </p>
      <p>
       My own personal view is that god is the oneness. It's the infiniteness, the unexplainable, the flourishing life throughout the universe, across space and time. We strive everyday in so many different ways to find peace and harmony within OURSELF. No outside force is going to command the power or spirit of God within you. It is a completely internal and individual journey. The only rationale for the concept of God is our own personal perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       To think of God from any form of earthly perception is already grossly limiting the shear magnitude of the one.

       I would also just like to clarify that I am not religious, I am simply spiritual.

       It's very difficult to answer that question with any certainty in this Archon generated reality in which we find ourselves. No doubt this is all part of a greater plan than even those insectile creatures (which don't really have a "mind" as we know it), are privy to, though I doubt they'd even care given my interactions with "them" (there may only be one... or millions... I can't figure that part out). All they seem to care about is tasting how very yummy we are.

       But on a more human level, I think love is what makes the world go round. It's just that love is hard. I mean that in the sense that loving people you have no (or seemingly) no connection with is hard. Hate, anger, jealous, all the negative emotions are much much easier and is pretty much what our media focuses on, making us humans believe that it's normal to hate, normal to fear, normal to be jealous.

       You made a lot of claims, most of the time without seeming to reference what led you to hold that position. Lets go back to you passage in 1 Kings. You claimed that YHWH is God and Jehovah is Lucifer or Baal, and then provided a passage that says nothing of the sort. After you seem to agree, you start to talk about "YHWH's black jews" and seem to suggest that Jehovah is different and the God of Latin speaking people. I have no idea where that is coming from, and your textual example doesn't make sense.

       The word for leprosy here is described as being an infection. It has absolutely nothing to do with race mixing.

       You may want to check the reference pages in the material you have been reading or watching. What you are saying doesn't make sense and seems to be geared toward generating racial and religious xenophobia.
