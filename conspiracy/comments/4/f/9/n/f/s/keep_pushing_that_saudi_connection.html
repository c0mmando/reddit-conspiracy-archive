       We all know there is a Saudi connection to the 911 conspiracy... but why does nobody talk about the 100,000 dollars wired to Mohammed Atta by the head of the Pakistani intelligence (ISI), General Mahmoud Ahmed?
      </p>
      <p>
       The same Mahmoud Ahmed who was having breakfast with Porter Goss, the then head of the house intelligence committee on the morning of 911 in DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the committee that would know about aliens if they existed, before the president did. The committee that would be rubbing shoulders with the elite. The all knowing, all seeing intelligence oversight committee in DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you seriously telling me that the head of this all knowing organization didn't know that the man he was having breakfast with that morning in that location was in part responsible for bankrolling those attacks? Even when our own intelligence apparatus and signal intel and foreign intel were sounding the alarm? Even when the president himself was receiving briefings about Bin Laden being determined to strike the United States? Even when our own CIA help BUILD the ISI from the ground up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nah let's just focus on the nationality of the Saudi hijackers and not follow the fucking money.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will drip feed this saudi shit for the next decade and when that runs out they will pick another non-topic to focus on. In 30 years time nobody will even give a fuck anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't we drag that fucker Porter Goss and Mahmoud Ahmed into a fucking room and find out what they knew?

       Yes, specifically the evidence all points to

      </p>
      <p>
       PNAC members include: Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wofowitz, Jeb Bush, Richard Perle, John Bolton, Scooter Libby, Elliot Abrams, Richard Armitage, William Bennet, William Kristol, and Zalmy Khalilzad - men with their hands deep in the private defense, oil, and multi-national corporate industries poised to make vast sums of money and secure huge tracts of power and influence if PNAC policy evolved into U.S. Government policy, which it did nine months later.

      <p>
       Well, 9/11 certainly achieved that, what a coincidence.

       , molten metal, thermite found etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       A 9/11 commission was created, with the chairman and co-chair appointed by Bush, with the majority of commissioner's not even believing all the lies, omissions, falsehoods, and contradictions contained within it and to top it all off, a Bush government appointed NIST to write a report on WTC7, a report proven wrong on the most basic level, literally two government sanctioned whitewashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all points to the US at some level and none to any other country, like the MSM and government conspiracy believers are trying to have us believe, although countries do seem to have directly benefited

       The government is trying to shift the blame via propaganda, this is their last resort, all their other tactics have failed.

        This is a list of NORAD war games
       </a>
       created by Miles Kara while doing work for the 9/11 omission report. The style and execution of these games seem to be based off of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">
        1962 Operation Northwoods
       </a>
       which helps to draw a conclusion that dissidents, actors and patsys would be used. This also explains Bush's lack of reaction to several cables received about about AQ trying to pull off an attack with planes. He knew it was a game and was not a threat, as
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnV_pNe_BB0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=76">
        AQ was never a threat

       it was an intelligence invention from the beginning.

       The question is who benefited from taking the games live.

       The 28 pages most likely contain all the fabricated and planted evidence that implicates SA and has no new real evidence about anything. The 28 pages made it into an official report and building 7 did not. In the context of an investigation where commission members said they were "set up to fail", these pages are merely a fail safe.

       A few more points people might be intereested in regarding the 9/11 commission...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton are on record saying the commission was, and I quote, "Set up to fail" They say it was underfunded and rushed as well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In their jointly authored book, Without Precedent they say "Fog of war could explain why some people were confused on the day of 9/11, but it could not explain why all of the after-action reports, accident investigations, and public testimony by FAA and NORAD officials advanced an account of 9/11 that was untrue". Untrue of course being a politically correct way of saying: a LIE.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Lewinsky investigation cost 30 million, the 9/11 investigation cost 15 million
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: "It is a national scandal"; "This investigation is now compromised"; and "One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bush and Cheney testified together, in secret, not under oath
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission, John Farmer - who led the 9/11 staff's inquiry - said "At some level of the government, at some point in time...there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened". He also said "I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described .... The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years.... This is not spin. This is not true."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         442 days to open an inquiry into the attacks on 9/11/2001
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         The committee's head board members had no engineers or scientists, they were  ALL lawyers except for four. The other four professions are an investment banker, historian, doctorate in philosophy and a pharmacist

       Agreed. It's going to get hyped as a super dark secret classified document that points to Saudi involvement...If this were true, wouldn't the so called 9/11 investigators and the commission report have implicate the Saudis by now if it was a legitimate investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       The 28 pages will be an extension of the compete BullShit that was in the 9/11 Omission report.

       There even more evidence for Israeli involvement but you won't here a peep of it over the MSM channels. When they started to speak of it in the beginning, they were shut down immediately.

       There are so many inconsistencies in the events of that day that have to have had evolved from an inside source. Just look at all the benefits gained by this chase of the boogie man. An endless war born out of the manipulation of emotions and the hatred that follows. A complicit pulic willing to forgo any shred of privacy, all for what? How many suspects caught by this system of abuse? Gone are the days of innocent until proven guilty now we live in a society of terrorist until proven otherwise.

       Leaders of legitimate 9/11 Truth groups were saying over a decade ago that the Saudis funded it. It's not a surprise. The Israelis and the Saudis have very similar wants for the Middle East region.
