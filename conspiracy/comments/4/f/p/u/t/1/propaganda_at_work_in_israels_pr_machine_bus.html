       There is
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       no confirmation it even was a terrorist attack and all current preliminary findings show that an empty bus
       <strong>
        caught fire
       </strong>
       and then exploded, causing the bus next to it to
       <strong>
        catch fire
       </strong>
       . Very likely a case of Israels shitty new hybrid buses gas tanks exploding, as happens with these models.
      </p>
      <p>
       No evidence there even was a terrorist attack, by Israels own admission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then suddenly that all changes because...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4fpf3m/hamas_claims_responsibility_for_jerusalem_bus/https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4fpf3m/hamas_claims_responsibility_for_jerusalem_bus/">
        Oh, look at that, an
        <strong>
         anonymous
        </strong>
        source has contradicted Hamas' own leadership and said they've claimed responsibility.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well then, that proves they did. Suddenly every media outlet is reporting "Hamas claims responsibility". All from the same anonymous source.

       Wow. I think I just stumbled onto some Hasbara scrubbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was going to comment about how Irgun or Lehi's newsletter was called HAAMAS and link to the Wikipedia entry, but it's gone. I have commented about this a few times before and have previously been able to find links with ease, starting with the Wikipedia entry and including copies of the newsletter itself. The only reference Google will give me to HAAMAS (all cap's, double A) is a single post I made in r/australia where I tried my hand at comedy writing. None of my other posts
       <em>
        which included links
       </em>
       showed up.
