        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you were given the power to create the money, then you would print/create it and lend it out to governments around the world, meaning you would buy “bonds” from those governments which simply means that government owes you the amount on the bond with interest. So, you are printing all the money for yourself because the governments all have to pay it back to you. This means you have unlimited money. Of course it is only paper money, but you can use it to buy everything of worth, like land, resources, precious metals, patents, your can buy the whole government with bribes, you can buy the entire medical establishment by bribing the leading minds to say what you want, you can buy the entire media and put out any lie you want onto everyone in the world’s tv screen and newspaper.</p>

<p>Can you see what would happen if the power to create money were to fall into the wrong hands?</p>

<p>Yes, it has fallen into the wrong hands, since in 1913 the day the Federal Reserve Bank Act was signed by Woodrow Wilson.</p>

<p>The printing/creation of money is being done by a private group of International Oligarchs who privately own the Federal Reserve Bank, and all the central banks worldwide, including the Bank Of International Settlements,</p>

<p>Guess what, if you are a government that want to print/create the money rather than borrow it from this private group of International Oligarchs, then your country will be brought to war and invaded by the International Oligarchs, who happen to be Jews loyal to Israel and have bribed the entire US government, this happened to Iraq and Libya, who where about to print/create their own money, rather than borrow it from the International Oligarchs.</p>

<p>The scheme of the International Oligarchs is to make all governments borrow money from them and charging compounding interest on it, requires such a country’s economy to have to grow, grow, grow, however the country wont be able to because the International Oligarchs have given them vaccines that reduce fertility so that birth rate is less than replacement rate, so the country cant pay the interest and defaults on the debt and has to start gutting itself and selling off all its land and resources to the International Oligarchs. The International Oligarchs also use Geo Engineering to shut down the ability of such a country’s economy to grow, but this is another completely separate story. </p>

<p>The Human race is missing out on so many opportunities to become excellent because the International Oligarchs are the ones that have the power to print/create the money, however, the Constitution says that Congress must print the money NOT a private bank. The country would then not go into debt at all, and the government would lend the money to banks at interest, and this interest would be used to build roads, bridges, medical care, social security and all other things that a country need completely without debt.</p>

<p>The US and all other countries should never pay back the International Oligarchs because this money was illegally printed/created by them completely unconstitutionally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The textbooks describe money as a means of exchange, but its real function is as a means of control.  This is perhaps the biggest conspiracy nobody talks about.  We all accept money as a societal given, despite overwhelming evidence it is often a coercive and destructive force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We all accept&quot;</p>

<p>These are the key words that people should be paying attention to.  It is not money, but rather the sanctioning of authority by the will of the masses, which in this case happens to be money, that is the highest power of all.  </p>

<p>Consider this theoretical, if you will:  If tomorrow, by some magical turn of events, all of humanity decided that money was without value, money and all the power associated with it would cease to exist in a relatively short period of time.  </p>

<p>Or think of it this way: If you travelled back in time to the days of hunter gatherers and brought a briefcase full of cash to the chief of some village, how much power do you think that money would give you over his decisions? All of the money in that case would be worth less than the smallest piece of food or crudest weapon/tool.  The only value it might possibly have would be as a novelty item and little else.</p>

<p>Name me one commodity or government/corporate/religious entity that lasted for any period of time once the people it relied on to legitimize its authority no longer did so.  Sure, you can try to force people to accept it once they lose faith in it, but this has been shown time and time again throughout history to ONLY result in failure; the only differing aspect from one example to the next is how long each took to fail, but regardless, the final outcome is ALWAYS the same.  </p>

<p>So, who are we really fighting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  And this control is why prostitution is still illegal.  Our government is not supposed to be christian but secular and as such it is not supposed to make any biblical holidays or guidelines about eating pork and stuff like that.  </p>

<p>So if things like abortion and prostitution aren&#39;t a christian prerogative to a secular set of laws, then why is prostittution still illegal?  After all, &quot;liberty&quot; is written into the declaration of independence in &quot;pursuit of life, liberty and happiness&quot;  our three &quot;inalienable rights&quot;.  So I would imagine we are supposed to allow prostitution, but we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I think the reason is that sex is an alternative currency they can&#39;t tax.  I mean how much is 7% of I&#39;ll blow you if you put me in your movie?</p>

<p>This is also another reason drugs are illegal.   I&#39;ll give you drugs if you give me sex.  You could have an entire industry that uses the agorism of sex favor and drug exchanges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me clarify how the scheme works (in easy abstract terms, this qualifies into the complex world as well):
How to be the master of money? How to get gifted by the power to create money out of thin air?</p>

<p>Step 1: Create a monopolistic situation
For example if in a desert acquire the water and try to be the only seller. As a government take the monopoly of power.</p>

<p>Step 2: Monetize on your monopolistic situation by imposing trade in your IOUs only
Meaning sell your water only for your IOUs, don&#39;t accept other monies or goods as a payment. You&#39;re the monopolist, right? As a government &quot;offer&quot; exemption from punishment if payed in government IOUs. (mafia business model)</p>

<p>Now everybody already wants your IOUs to get spared from death by dehydration or legal punishment.</p>

<p>Step 3: Put people into interest bearing debt denominated in your IOUs, be the only authority to issue these IOUs
So rather than waiting until somebody arrives who is offering for some water something of your interest give them a loan. If they want your water ask for your IOUs, if they can&#39;t provide you with your IOUs just print some and borrow them out, at interest of course. You don&#39;t sell them water, you sell them a loan and the water. (That means of course that your IOUs have to be secure against couterfeit so you could for example create the situation where you&#39;re having all the gold and selling it for debt, I believe that&#39;s how gold initially came to it&#39;s value)</p>

<p>Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until you reached a critical mass.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you&#39;re now printing money! Of course <strong>if you&#39;re smart instead of selling water or security you&#39;d sell payment systems like</strong> <em>in a cashless society</em>. </p>
