<p>I don&#39;t change my opinion when I participate in other subs. I only use a more subtle approach, since so many are still lost in the sauce. The trick is getting them to come to the logical conclusions (the conspiracy) on their own. Posting about these things doesn&#39;t often end well, then will be removed, which often results in a ban when you challenge it. </p>

<p>This is just how it goes. On Reddit and in society. You didn&#39;t wake up overnight. I (strongly feel) that each one of us has gone through a process of learning and growth. It wasn&#39;t some &quot;ah hah&quot; moment and it all made sense. These people simply just need to be challenged a bit, like they aren&#39;t now. Your message will never be heard in these times if you&#39;re in their faces with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as everyone keeps supporting the shitshow via purchases (not talking food and house, but smartphone, video games, tv, movies, cars, going out, etc) there is 0 chance of change. If you can&#39;t cancel your netflix and not &#39;play&#39; every weekend, do you honestly thing you are going to revolt? Not bashing the idea, but it has never led to anything but new kings. Why not general boycott, take personal responsibility for each of ourselves and then let the parasitic oligarchs dry up and blow away (after another &#39;last&#39; war)</p>

<p>Because that’s too hard. It doesn’t matter that those of us who are still sane do this; we’re not enough.</p>

<p>Remember that SOPA passed anyway. Until bullets enter brains, there will be no change.</p>

<p>The first response to a tax you don’t like isn’t armed rebellion. You do that when there are no other options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taxation without representation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaningless; they were territories. They were already being taxed without representation. States with representation also had to pay the tax. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Military presence to enforce decree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like every law ever passed?</p>

<p>The point is you’re glossing over thousands of other revolutions that are far more black and white. Stop trying to pretend that revolution doesn’t work.</p>
