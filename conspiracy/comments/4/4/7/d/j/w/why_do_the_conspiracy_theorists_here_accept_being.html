       Because a lot of us here are banned from others subs, for doing that very thing. Between the bans, the shills/trolls, and ignorant people, it's a lost cause for trying to speak on the larger subs. I discuss on here and IRL with people friends/family/etc.

       To be honest, it's like pissing into the ocean. We are better off starting local (IRL) and building up (organically). Help and wake people up in our communities (Friends/families/associates/etc). Your voice/words will get drowned out by the massive brigades of those controlling the internet and the hive mind. Just my two cents.

       I wouldn't say we lost, it's just the beginning. There is a massive awakening happening. Tis' interesting times we live in. Like I said though, I think it's more prudent to start local. Also, more and more people are coming here to get information. That is a good thing.

       Well.. we may not be able to change things.. but that doesn't mean we should stop trying... I think that's the most important point. If we aren't going to try to change things.. at least try to make it known on a wide scale how "conspiracy theorists" are treated and why that is a sign of a bigger issues. Show people HOW conspiracy theorists have been intentionally demonized.

       It all depends on the person and how far along they are. When trying to educate people on these things, you have to tailor it to them, specifically. At least that's how it's been in my experiences.

       Can confirm, same thing happened with me and my brother about WTC 7. Thankfully he didn't kick the shit out of me, because he could've. He thanks me till this day. Younger brother FTW! I take a more subtle approach with those I'm not that close to.

       I find the best way to spread truth is to find creative ways of inserting it into in person interactions. Just keep it simple, possibly funny, and lighthearted. All it takes is the inception of an idea, not full agreement that leads to waking up. A lot of times I'm surprised when they agree with the point and then I respond with something quite astounding to leave them thinking about it.

       This is something that needs to be addressed on a large scale. If people can't talk about this kind of subject matter on a  large scale it shows that we don't have true freedom of speech in the US and other countries.

       I've done it on r/science, history, futurology, news... you get tin hatted immediately and the moderators will ban you or even join in the Lord of The Flies, "Bang, bang on the head! Kill the Pig. Bang bang on the head!" The worst are the pro-nukes, and climate change religionists.

       I don't mind at all - free thinking is very fringe.  I think some of the crazy ideas I float here are too far out for mainstream evaluation.  But my opinion about my own behavior might not apply to everyone, admittedly.

       As a democrat who has been "banned" from Democratic Underground since 2006, for asking the "wrong" questions, I do appreciate having at least one forum that hasn't banned me.

       I don't change my opinion when I participate in other subs. I only use a more subtle approach, since so many are still lost in the sauce. The trick is getting them to come to the logical conclusions (the conspiracy) on their own. Posting about these things doesn't often end well, then will be removed, which often results in a ban when you challenge it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just how it goes. On Reddit and in society. You didn't wake up overnight. I (strongly feel) that each one of us has gone through a process of learning and growth. It wasn't some "ah hah" moment and it all made sense. These people simply just need to be challenged a bit, like they aren't now. Your message will never be heard in these times if you're in their faces with it.

       Not saying we should be in people's faces.. just saying as it is now we are being locked up in the basement. IMO posting things where others can see them isn't being in their faces.. it should be a right we all have. And this is much more important than most the things in the mainstream.

       As long as everyone keeps supporting the shitshow via purchases (not talking food and house, but smartphone, video games, tv, movies, cars, going out, etc) there is 0 chance of change. If you can't cancel your netflix and not 'play' every weekend, do you honestly thing you are going to revolt? Not bashing the idea, but it has never led to anything but new kings. Why not general boycott, take personal responsibility for each of ourselves and then let the parasitic oligarchs dry up and blow away (after another 'last' war)

       Meaningless; they were territories. They were already being taxed without representation. States with representation also had to pay the tax.

       I wouldn't say we lost, it's just the beginning. There is a massive awakening happening. Tis' interesting times we live in. Like I said though, I think it's more prudent to start local. Also, more and more people are coming here to get information. That is a good thing.

       Not saying we should be in people's faces.. just saying as it is now we are being locked up in the basement. IMO posting things where others can see them isn't being in their faces.. it should be a right we all have. And this is much more important than most the things in the mainstream.
