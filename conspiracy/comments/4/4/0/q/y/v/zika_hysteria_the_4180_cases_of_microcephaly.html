       Not quite. You are referencing an examination of a sample of 732 suspected microcephaly cases, 270 of which were confirmed to have microcephaly that appears to be linked to zika. The remainder are either microcephaly by other or unknown causes (i.e. zika couldn't be confirmed but may still be suspected, or they were not microcephaly), or not microcephaly as initially suspected (in what proportions isn't available as far as I can find).
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, it is difficult to confirm zika virus - which isn't even slightly surprising. The fact even 270 cases were confirmed is shockingly high (even if
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       270 cases even happened, it would be a staggering increase in cases). There's no simple test for zika - one was never developed, and the one available is hard to get and cross-reacts with all sorts of things. Also, zika clears the system within a week or two, and so if a mother has it during pregnancy chances are high she won't by the time baby is born - which means no definite link to zika can be confirmed, which is why so few cases (as low as 6 in some reports - though this is just a number the media are repeating now) are 'confirmed to have zika'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if the common cold caused extreme birth defects. Now imagine trying to confirm if someone had a fricking cold six months ago, because yeah good luck with that. The best you can do is look at a huge increase in the spread of the cold virus, and match this to confirmation in some cases, and then work with other evidence such as anecdotal reports on symptoms/contact with the virus. With zika, unless it is confirmed in the mother during a very short window, it's hard to confirm at all, ever. Also, 80% of cases are completely asymptomatic. Another 10% at least are so mild there's no way a normal person would even visit a doctor or most doctors (at least before the crisis) wouldn't bother to test - so this leaves perhaps 10% of cases where someone might even suspect zika in a patient, and the rest will fly under the radar. This all means very few cases can be confirmed or are expected to be - and this absolutely
       <em>
        does not
       </em>
       mean zika isn't involved. The evidence implicating zika is strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My second point is microcephaly isn't an incredibly simple diagnosis in every case. There's a line between microcephaly and normal but small head size. Sometimes, microcephaly may be suspected - even strongly suspected - yet baby may turn out to grow normally over their first year. Sometimes a difficult birth can compress the skull a bit, and this will resolve. Some babies just have little heads - my own daughter was born with very small head size, and the doctor was concerned about microcephaly, but she went on to grow perfectly normally. Her head just 'caught up' but if she'd been born in Brazil in recent months, doctors would have put her down as 'possible microcephaly'. Sometimes the rate of head circumference growth slows/speeds up, and this can take months. It's not stretch for many cases of microcephaly to be ruled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing is, even 50%, 75%, even 90% of the suspected cases turn out to be not microcephaly, we're
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       looking at a staggering upsurge in cases extremely closely correlated to zika infections.

       Well, that's the tough part. Correlation doesn't equal yada yada. So, you've got people in a region with a mosquito carrying a disease(Could be zika, could be dengue) that likes to bite people. This means that when people come in to the hospital with diseases and symptoms, the doctors will also discover that they are carrying this disease. Thus, a correlation seems possible. But this is where we should be wary.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, there are no cases of microcephaly related to zika before this. That's important because it would either mean the disease mutated or that the symptom was not caused by the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, there have been cases of microcephaly in that area of Brazil since 2012 it looks like, unrelated again to zika.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think there is an underlying cause that it not zika because there is no history of zika behaving this way and there is a longer history of microcephaly than the recent media upsurge is talking about.
      </p>

       Not that I have an answer but just thought I'd toss that out. Please feel free to send me articles and data refuting any and all claims I made.

       Uh yeah, I don't think that's the case. The only rumour going around about vaccines is people arguing there's a link between the TDAP vaccine being introduced in pregnant women 10 months ago, and the rise in microcephaly. However, TDAP has been used for many years in pregnant women all over the world without issue (including in USA for several years), the vaccine is the same everywhere and hasn't changed, it cannot be 'contaminated' or 'sabotaged', and the vaccine absolutely isn't the cause here. Brazil was slow off the mark introducing a public health policy that's been adopted in most developed countries (the policy aims to prevent whooping cough). Also, the exact same vaccine has been given n early pregnancy for much longer - a solid decade at least. It's just given late in pregnancy now because it gives extra immunity to newborns (and on that, it's given
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       too late to cause microcephaly, which happens during early development - by the time the vaccine is given baby is basically
       <em>
        about to be born
       </em>
       and is fully developed). The whole idea of vaccines being involved is just anti-vaxxer nonsense. It is completely baseless, both biologically and chemically.

       But what about reported "hot batches" of vaccines that have a higher instance of adverse reaction? I can't remember, but they may be part of VAERS. The vaccine is not just The Vaccine, they have to manufacturer new batches of it that yes could be detective, like anything.

       Pretty sure I read an article stating that only in the past year and a half all pregnant women there were required to recieve a new form of what I believe was the TDAP vaccine. According to the statistics provided it seemed more than plausible that the vaccine was causing the brain deformities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought that was a very interesting take and if I can locate the article again I'll link it! 
Mild disclaimer; I have no idea the exact cause and I'm open to ideas because we all KNOW this ZIKA virus "outbreak" is agenda driven and I'm so sick of this fear mongoring BS!
