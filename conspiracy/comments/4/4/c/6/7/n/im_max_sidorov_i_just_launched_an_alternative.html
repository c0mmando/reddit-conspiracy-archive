<p>We hope to unite the rising community of people around the globe who care not only for our freedom and privacy, but for our planet and our future as a human race. </p>

<p>Miramir is:</p>

<p>-Facebook style social network</p>

<p>-Ebay style store</p>

<p>-Reddit style articles</p>

<p>-Quora style Q and A</p>

<p>-Meetup style groups and events</p>

<p>-Craigslist style classifieds</p>

<p>-Plenty of fish style dating</p>

<p>-Kickstarter style fundraising </p>

<p>A few key features:</p>

<p>-Self destructing messaging</p>

<p>-Cryptocurrency integration</p>

<p>-Private posting and commenting</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Profiles and data can be deleted forever at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiles have the option of a private pseudonym that can publish content privately without revealing the users profile and identity.</p></li>
<li><p>Mods are voted in and out by the user community.</p></li>
<li><p>It is free forever and users will never have to pay anything to reach their circle of friends or followers.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates and improvements are voted on by the user community.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our kickstarter campaign is launched and we already raised over 30% of our goal in just 36 hours.

    <div class="md"><p>Getting taken down is virtually impossible, we are planning on having our domain somewhere in iceland after we get established a little. Selling it impossible because there is no way in heck am i ever going to sell it. Its not about the money, i have another successful business that is funding this project. This is my passion and something i live for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I applaud the effort, however i find it short-sighted, centralized systems get taken down all the time everywhere (less in Iceland, but that&#39;s probably temporary, and so is your will not to sell, you don&#39;t know how many zeros they will offer you, or how many teeth they will have to forcefully extract from your kids)... see what it costs TPB to keep their site up, a shitton of sacrifices and efforts, some are in jail... On the other hand, see how much efforts satoshi puts into the bitcoin network (which takes them head on on their turf, and lives to this day...),  none, can&#39;t be closed, can&#39;t be shutdown.</p>

<p>edit: furthermore, strictly from a user point of view, a centralized system inherently grant its owner powers that a decentralized system does not, reddit is a perfect example of where such powers might lead.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The idea of &#39;Miramir&#39; seems very all encompassing. The more Facebook took over my life the worse I liked it. Any thoughts about trying to be so involved in every aspect of people&#39;s online lives?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>What i want to do is provide people with a tool they can use to connect, unite, and simply do more. I hope i dont have to be involved in the lives of other people:) </p>

<p>Yes, I am from Ukraine myself, and the quality of programmers here is on the level of North American programmers while salaries are much less. That has allowed me to do three times more work for the same amount of money.</p>

<p>Beta will be live about 3 months after our Kickstarter finishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any way for you to post a timestamped picture of you for confirmation (holding a handwritten piece of paper would suffice) so we can confirm it&#39;s you? Maybe on a twitter feed? No disrespect intended but we like to be sure people are who they say they are as we&#39;ve had problems with imposters in the past.<br/>
Also do you have a date for the site going live yet? I signed up a while ago and am looking forward to participating as it sounds very promising. Thanks, IDA. </p>

<p>The only website I&#39;ve tried lately is minds.com--never understood how to use it...I quit facebook after corporate ads started appearing...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you know there are redditors who are sick of the censorship which has been going on in the larger subreddits (r/politics, r/news and r/worldnews, etc.)...</p>

<p>A reddit competitor, Voat.com, seems to be struggling with issues (attacks, etc.)...</p>

<p>Profile/articles/dating/store/groups and events are almost finished and need that last push to get it to a well working beta. </p>
