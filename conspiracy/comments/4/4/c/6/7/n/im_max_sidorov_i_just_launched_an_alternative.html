       My name is Max Sidorov, im the founder of a new social network and portal for change called Miramir which I have been developing for the past 4 years.
      </p>

       Getting taken down is virtually impossible, we are planning on having our domain somewhere in iceland after we get established a little. Selling it impossible because there is no way in heck am i ever going to sell it. Its not about the money, i have another successful business that is funding this project. This is my passion and something i live for.

       Don't get me wrong, I applaud the effort, however i find it short-sighted, centralized systems get taken down all the time everywhere (less in Iceland, but that's probably temporary, and so is your will not to sell, you don't know how many zeros they will offer you, or how many teeth they will have to forcefully extract from your kids)... see what it costs TPB to keep their site up, a shitton of sacrifices and efforts, some are in jail... On the other hand, see how much efforts satoshi puts into the bitcoin network (which takes them head on on their turf, and lives to this day...),  none, can't be closed, can't be shutdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: furthermore, strictly from a user point of view, a centralized system inherently grant its owner powers that a decentralized system does not, reddit is a perfect example of where such powers might lead.

       You are completely on point. I do hope to make it decentralized later, somehow, maybe like diaspora. But at the same time, we wont hold illegal content on our network, like torrents or copyrighted material like TPB so there should be no reason for anyone to shut us down.

         The idea of 'Miramir' seems very all encompassing. The more Facebook took over my life the worse I liked it. Any thoughts about trying to be so involved in every aspect of people's online lives?

       What i want to do is provide people with a tool they can use to connect, unite, and simply do more. I hope i dont have to be involved in the lives of other people:)

       Yes, I am from Ukraine myself, and the quality of programmers here is on the level of North American programmers while salaries are much less. That has allowed me to do three times more work for the same amount of money.

       Beta will be live about 3 months after our Kickstarter finishes.

       Is there any way for you to post a timestamped picture of you for confirmation (holding a handwritten piece of paper would suffice) so we can confirm it's you? Maybe on a twitter feed? No disrespect intended but we like to be sure people are who they say they are as we've had problems with imposters in the past.
       <br/>
       Also do you have a date for the site going live yet? I signed up a while ago and am looking forward to participating as it sounds very promising. Thanks, IDA.

       I'm sure you know there are redditors who are sick of the censorship which has been going on in the larger subreddits (r/politics, r/news and r/worldnews, etc.)...

       We have invested over 50k of our own funds into this project, and it has been in development for over 3 years. Taking into account that developers of that level take 3-4 times as much in the states, you can say we have 150-200k into this project.

       Profile/articles/dating/store/groups and events are almost finished and need that last push to get it to a well working beta.

       Plus we are not just another social network, we are a portal with a lot more to offer, AND we are focused on the alternative communities.

       What a convenient way to gather up societal outliers for further profiling! /s

       Joking aside, how will this benefit an individual who simply bookmarks the needed pages the conventional way?

       Well, i guess it kinda is:D But I realized that if they want to find out about someone, they dont need social networks for that, they have databases full of all your info way before any social networks came onto the scene.

       That is also something that i love doing, neatly sorted bookmarks and saved pages. Miramir will allow you to save and organize any page/note/post which i have not yet seen on any other network.

       Hi there, I was wondering if you have any plans to implement some sort of charter that would keep the website from being sold to a third party who would change and monetise it's userbase ala facebook?

       I never understood founders selling their companies, its like their sole purpose was to make money with their idea. This is not just a company, its everything i believe in and stand for. Its like my child, and as zeus is my witneess no matter what happens ill see him grow and develop into an amazing social network we can all be proud of.

       You are completely on point. I do hope to make it decentralized later, somehow, maybe like diaspora. But at the same time, we wont hold illegal content on our network, like torrents or copyrighted material like TPB so there should be no reason for anyone to shut us down.
