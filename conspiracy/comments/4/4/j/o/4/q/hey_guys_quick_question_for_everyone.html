       So I've stumbled across here from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       in regards to the moon landing stuff, and whilst looking through the topics is interesting, I can't help but notice that there is a conspiracy surrounding every single event in the last 60 years or so.. Like, undoubtedly there are some conspiracies regarding a few of these events, but the fact that there is one regarding every single event seems to take any legitimacy away from anything you present..
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question is, are there any events that you guys all agree isn't a conspiracy? Like, if I list alot of the major events even in the last decade, do you guys agree on any of them being legitimate,  or are they all false?

       This sub is the red pill. Not everything is a conspiracy, but most of the events that have shaped the direction of this nation and its military, legal, and financial policies have, in some form or fashion, been either perpetrated, manipulated, or adulterated by the powers that be (TPTB). Welcome, and I hope you can ignore the rhetoric and focus on the facts.

       I definitely believe that in some of those instances there was some back-door Shenanigans by others such as he government,  but I'm having troubles believing that every single event has some sort of back-door planning..
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, it's hard for me to objectively look at evidence for all these things because odds would simply indicate that there are mentally unwell people out there that would kill people for no reason, or bomb places for no reason..  Some of those events must have occurred 'naturally' because of the sheer unlikelihood that they were all preplanned..

       Like I said, some of the paradigm events were simply manipulated or adulterated for the benefit of the agenda. Obviously things occur organically at times, but control of the media assures the ability to craft the release of information to benefit the agenda. Having said that, I will simply encourage you to dig around and discover the truth for yourself.

       What do you mean by legitimacy?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean legitimate in the sense that it's supported by conventional thinkers and mainstream media, than you'll never find legitimate conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single event you mentioned has a political implication. For myself, as a general rule, I never accept the official story and I do my own research.

       What you've got to try to get your head around is that nobody was actually injured or killed died at Sandy Hook (or Boston, San Bernardino, Paris, and that is not a complete list). Here are some relevant links for you on Sandy Hook.

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       First off, welcome to r/conspiracy. The fact that you are even trying to open a dialogue on this shows that you have an open mind. As others have stated, once you have taken the red pill and woken up to the deception around you, there's no going back. So please take that into consideration before continuing to read and think.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has also recently come around to being a 'conspiracy theorist,' I will tell you a bit about my view and experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, to answer your question: once you realize how deeply and thoroughly we are being deceived and manipulated, it's very hard to know where the lies stop and reality begins. So the risk is that you become credulous and will pretty much believe that any deception is possible. For me that helps explain why people can believe in the flat Earth stuff. I don't believe it personally, but I've also not looked into the arguments. I try to keep an open mind, but it's equally important to keep a skeptical and analytical point of view while considering things carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things I've learned is the key to maintaining the deception is incredulity. Once you believe that "it can't be true" then you never even bother to consider whether it is true. And many of the deceptions are really paper thin, so that once you take a moment to examine it, you realize that it really is a deception. But the "it can't possibly happen therefore it didn't" approach is not very scientific or sober or even genuinely skeptical. Science proceeds by gathering evidence, and from that evidence constructing a theory. So start with the evidence, and then consider what explains it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend that you try to suspend your incredulity for the time being (i.e., the attitude that "all these events couldn't possibly be the result of a conspiracy" so there's nothing to it). Yes it's true that bad people simply do bad things, but that doesn't mean that many or most or all of the events you mention weren't the work of one large (or several smaller) conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, it is a matter of historical record that many of the events that sparked US involvement in various wars and armed conflicts were false flag events or the product of lies and distortions.  These are not even at the level of 'conspiracy theories.' These are facts. Here is a list of 53 admitted false flags:
       <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html">
        http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/x-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So realize that your government has no problem killing innocent citizens and lying to you about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also very very good evidence that Roosevelt pushed the Japanese into attacking the US and deliberately ignored advance warnings at Pearl Harbor:
       <a href="http://jamesperloff.com/2014/11/06/pearl-harbor-roosevelts-911/">
        http://jamesperloff.com/2014/11/06/pearl-harbor-roosevelts-911/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For me the spark was realizing that we were lied to about 9/11. Of course it was something I'd heard but didn't really consider carefully. But then once I realized it was true, and that the leaders of the US government were willing to allow the deaths of thousands of innocent people, plus the slow death of thousands of ground zero clean-up workers, plus the deaths of thousands of US soldiers and hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, etc. etc., while lying to the public about what happened, I asked myself: well if they would do that, what wouldn't they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1970s, there were some revelations about the role of the CIA in assassinating democratically elected world leaders and setting up brutal dictatorial puppet governments around the world, such as Allende being replaced by Pinochet in Chile and Mosaddegh being replaced by the Shah in Iran. Congress set up some committees to investigate the nefarious activities of the CIA and other intelligence agencies. The so-called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">
        Church committee
       </a>
       uncovered the CIA's work in its
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
        MK-ULTRA program
       </a>
       to develop mind-control techniques. Most of the MK-ULTRA documents were destroyed.  The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations">
        'Select Committee on Assassinations'
       </a>
       to investigate the JFK and MLK assassinations concluded that "on the basis of the evidence available to it, that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy" and that "there is a likelihood" that MLK's assassination was the result of the conspiracy. (Of course, don't take these committees as the ultimate arbiters of truth, as they certainly covered up and ignored a lot of evidence, but that is another matter.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway coming back to 9/11, here are some good resources for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a short 6 minute video:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elp3fpqIPVg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elp3fpqIPVg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is by far the best and most comprehensive documentary on 9/11. It's very long. If you don't have time, I recommend just watching the last 30 minutes or so where they focus on Building 7:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some more stuff from Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, much of which is covered in that longer documentary:
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/38-home-posts/78-education.html">
        http://www.ae911truth.org/38-home-posts/78-education.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, once you're convinced that we are not being told the full story of what happened on 9/11, here are some videos on who did it and why:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_fp5kaVYhk">

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3xgjxJwedA
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then once the door was blown open, I began to realize how much of what I thought I knew was either wrong or a flat out lie, and I began to wonder how much of what I believe is a result of manipulation. For example, did you know that Wall Street bankers funded both

        the Bolshevik revolution

       and

        the NAZI party/takeover of Germany?

       Probably didn't learn that in high school. Let's see...what else...

        But the rough outlines
       </a>
       appear to be a secretive group of powerful families who also have some seriously twisted occultist beliefs and practices. Some call them 'the Illuminati,' but I don't really think it matters what they're named. It's really more about who are they and why are they doing it. But even if you don't believe that, it doesn't mean that you're not being manipulated and deceived -- it just means that it's not as centralized as many people believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a final note, going back to the CIA's MKULTRA program and in reference to your point about people going 'randomly' crazy and shooting people (of course it happens, the question is how frequently), I recommend reading McGowan's book
       <a href="http://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/01/12/david-mcgowan-programmed-to-kill/david-mcgowan-programmed-to-kill.pdf">
        <em>
         Programmed to Kill
        </em>
       </a>
       . It's a real eye-opener and also offers a peek into the true depravity of the powers that be.

       Thanks. Not all the links are the best, just what I could easily find. For example there is better stuff on the recent Paris attacks. And also the Illuminati link is pretty weak. Fritz Springmeier's stuff is much better. You can find some lectures of his on youtube.

       WTF? I linked to three credible sources with tons of evidence! What are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you don't think those sources are as credible as, say, Geraldo Rivera and Anderson Cooper? Well that is where you and I disagree. The book I linked to,
       <em>
        Nobody Died at Sandyhook,
       </em>
       counts 6 Ph.D.'s among its contributors, several of whom have or had tenured faculty positions. Now speaking as someone who has a PhD and a tenured faculty position, you shouldn't necessarily take that as a sign of authority. But I can tell you that you don't get to those positions without some degree of above-average intelligence. So yes, I do think the book has credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's really beside the point, because I have a brain and am capable of thinking and assessing the evidence on my own. And it's clear as the nose on my face. All you have to do is look at it.

       I don't think anyone disputes that Columbine, the Paris attacks, 9/11 and Oklahoma City all involved conspiracies. It's more a matter of disagreement over the scope of the conspiracy and who was and was not involved.

       A follow-up point. You wrote:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        undoubtedly there are some conspiracies regarding a few of these events, but the fact that there is one regarding every single event seems to take any legitimacy away from anything you present.

      <p>
       Hitler called this the big lie: "All this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true within itself—that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, my advice to you is, examine the evidence, then decide if it's possible. Don't decide it's impossible (or illegitimate) and therefore ignore the evidence.

       When I was a teenager  years ago,  my high school physics teacher did a class called "Physics or fakery"   even before the Internet was a big thing in the late 90s. He pointed out the material construction of the module, the heating cooling system problems as well as Joule's gas expansion theory, and the extremely fake take off of the Apollo off the moon surf. The moonlanding was fake to me since that moment. Physics disproves NASA. Boston bombing hoax  is another that is too obvious. Jeff at scene not same Jeff at hospital. What a mindfuck! Most absurd fakery to date! No doubt Boston Bombing put hoax events in the mainstream.

       There is no attitude - the according to you part is to highlight your bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've become defensive and in so ignored the answer: you ask why do we think there's a conspiracy surrounding everything, when there obviously isn't a conspiracy about thousands, tens of thousands, unmentioned events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you've cherry picked a few, and claimed they represent all events, ergo, we believe everything is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your conclusion is illogical and based on confirmation bias, i.e., ignoring all the events that people don't take issue with, and cherry picking a few.

       Your question is just so obviously malformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       /conspiracy is a subreddit full of hundreds of thousands of people, there is no consensus on stuff posted here, for that matter any troll can post a conspiracy theory that they just pulled out of their ass to get their jollies off... So expecting the subreddit or the mods to filter bad content out for you or for anyone else, says more about you than it does the subreddit.

       I wasn't saying anything about the mods filtering stuff though, I was simply asking If there was a general consensus between users about which theories hold the most weight and which ones don't, and alot of people have answered which was exactly why I wanted..

       I definitely believe that in some of those instances there was some back-door Shenanigans by others such as he government,  but I'm having troubles believing that every single event has some sort of back-door planning..
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, it's hard for me to objectively look at evidence for all these things because odds would simply indicate that there are mentally unwell people out there that would kill people for no reason, or bomb places for no reason..  Some of those events must have occurred 'naturally' because of the sheer unlikelihood that they were all preplanned..

       Like I said, some of the paradigm events were simply manipulated or adulterated for the benefit of the agenda. Obviously things occur organically at times, but control of the media assures the ability to craft the release of information to benefit the agenda. Having said that, I will simply encourage you to dig around and discover the truth for yourself.
