       In the documentary “We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook”, the mental aspect of the shooter was addressed. According to the official police report of the “Sandy Hook Shooting” there was no clear motive for Adam Lanza, the gunman. Quote “In an effort to fill the void of intention, blame was placed on Lanza’s claimed “mental illness”, despite the fact that no mental health records had been made public”. Unfortunately, “that did not stop the media, politicians, Sandy Hook parents, and the pharmaceutical industry from lobbying for and passing expensive mental health legislation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       To make matters worse, his stated doctor, (Dr. Paul Fox) was removed of his medical license in July of 2012 due to sexual relations of his patients. He claims any record he had of Lanza’s health was destroyed as he fled the country to New Zealand, but still communicated with Connecticut Police.  So what I can conclude from the findings in the documentary is that there was no confirmed or diagnosed mental illness officially from Adam Lanza, so anyone referring to Lanza having a mental illness cannot officially confirm he actually did. So what I can say from my research is that mental illness reform and avocation from the Sandy Hook tragedy is misled.

       Amazing how people think one of the largest false flags in american history is real, all they need to do is watch a 2 hour documentary and they will see how fake it is. You do even a little bit of research and you quickly see how fraudulent it is....

       Medical records of dead people can be made public. However, thank you for confirming that the person who was born Adam Lanza, -
       <strong>
        but who now goes under the name Ryan Lanza
       </strong>
       - is still alive, and yes, he is entitled to keep his medical records private*.

       , it appears you may be a hardcore conspiracy theorist, and you didn't even know it...
      </p>
      <p>
       *Which is fortunate because the whole Sandy Hook hoax would collapse if people clued up and realised that Adam Lanza was an only child who changed his name to Ryan after leaving high school. Adam/Ryan didn't die at Sandy Hook, and neither did anybody else.

      <p>
       "Adam Lanza" did not graduate from High School, and there are no videos of Ryan graduating from High School. There is a video on Youtube of Ryan accepting a bachelor's degree from his UNIVERSITY. I presume you never went to university, otherwise you would know they are not the same thing.

       Your contention is that Ryan attended Newtown High School as "Adam Lanza", but appeared in the yearbook as "Ryan Lanza"? Then returned to the high school to join the tech club in 2007-2008 as "Adam" but nobody recognized him, and he was attending college at Quinnipiac at the same time?

       So, you're saying he never graduated from high school - but somehow managed to enroll at university, take classes and graduate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we need to add the faculty at Quinnpiac to the tens of thousands of people who must have been in on the conspiracy. Why don't we just simplify things and say everyone in the world was in on it, except for the hoaxers? That would be more plausible than what's actually being suggested.

       Adam left high school early and was home-schooled, so he did not "graduate" in the conventional sense. However, he obviously received sufficient credits from his home-schooling to get a place at university - where he enrolled as Ryan Lanza.

      <blockquote>

        "Adam Lanza" did not graduate from High School,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another standard Hoaxer tactic: demand evidence that can't actually exist, then act like the inevitable absence of impossible evidence proves something. See also all the demands for video from the school's  non-existent surveillance system, or from a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/43jolu/the_conundrum_for_the_defenders_of_the_newtown/">
        business which burned down over two years before the shooting

       .

      <p>
       [Edit] And you're not even
       <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1369013/report-on-sandy-hook-shooting.pdf">
        right there
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        AL communicated his goal of graduating early from high school, and staff worked with him to assist with earning the necessary credits. By the beginning of AL’s junior year, he
had accumulated 11.5 credits towards the required 20 for graduation.  By the end of the year, he was credited with 21, which
        <strong>
         allowed him to graduate a year early
        </strong>
        and exit special education services
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Guess the lesson here is: just because there's no video, doesn't mean it didn't happen. Pretty much like the Sandy Hook shootings, really.

       "Adam Lanza was an only child who changed his name to Ryan after leaving high school".
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attempt to muddy the waters with the university graduation ceremony, and whether he graduated, and/or left early from high school is a distraction to draw attention away from the main issue - Adam is Ryan. He changed his name to Ryan after leaving high school.

       Point blank, Adam never existed. Ryan Lanza, however, does. I get the sense Ryan's father, Peter, was part of an elaborate blackmail scheme. Probably was made an example of.

       the whole family was an invention, theres no record of Peter Lanza being a GE exec (or even an employee) period. people in corporations have histories, they make company and trade news at the very minimum, esp in the managerial levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan supposedly is/was an accountant, that means graduations and some data of his career even tho new, none exists. and there was reporting near the time of him working for Spaceweather, that got dropped in favor of him being a wallstreet beancounter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adam is a specter or a ghost, some claim Adam became Ryan, but Ryan is as imaginary as Adam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake divorce papers in two editions, one typed, one hand written, both have Ryan obviously added as an addition so as to make the Adam to Ryan transition seem legit. this is a distraction from the whole bunch being 100% fake.

        The story about the Libor connection, we are told now by some alternative media, has been DEBUNKED.

       <p>
        Oh, really now?
       </p>
       <p>
        As you read this information about Peter Lanza and his work for GE, remember the context and the Obama connection:

       <p>
        U.S. Taxpayers Bailed Out G.E. For $182.5 Billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Back to Adam's Family:
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter Lanza has been up to his neck, drowning, and waterboarded even - BY LIBOR!
       </p>
       <p>
        That's right:
       </p>
       <p>
        PROOF:
       </p>
       <p>
        "Peter Lanza, is the tax director for General Electric, a corporation that paid -$0- in Federal income taxes on $14.2 billion dollars in profits last year. Three of the employees from GE Capitol, the unit overseen by Lanza, were sentenced to time in prison on October 18th 2012 for Libor bid-rigging scheme. The men are the first to be sentenced as part of an ongoing investigation of bid-rigging in auctions. It just so happens that GE Capitol, Peter Lanza’s Unit, was the one involved in the bid-rigging schemes that used LIBOR rates to manipulate the municipal market."

       For me that was really the surprising thing about the Sandy Hook hoax -- it is just so patently obvious. The deception is paper thin. It depends on people's total unwillingness to consider and examine the facts of the case, because if they did, they would quickly see through the deception.

       Although people can disagree on particular details it seems obvious at this point that not everything we are told is the truth.

       The only way anyone could ever believe this actually happened is if they take the mainstream reporting at face value and never look into the details.

      <p>
       A simple cursory glance and it unravels at the seams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fairly obvious why the strategy for dissuading the curious is pure vitriol and character assasination.

       Let the facts speak for themselves and no other conclusion is possible.

       No one shills harder than the Sandy Hook defenders. There are 1000s of them. Same approach. Attack, deflect, confuse.

       Honestly if the sheep won't willingly try and see past the narrative, they deserve to be led to the slaughter. Us clever few will do elsewise.

       Adam left high school early and was home-schooled, so he did not "graduate" in the conventional sense. However, he obviously received sufficient credits from his home-schooling to get a place at university - where he enrolled as Ryan Lanza.
