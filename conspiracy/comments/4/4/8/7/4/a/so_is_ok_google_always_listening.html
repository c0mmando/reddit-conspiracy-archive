       OK, I was in a meeting yesterday and I had my phone on the table right in front of me (was waiting on a call). One of the topics we were discussing in this meeting was centered on trying to integrate wireless headphones into one of our products. We talked about a few different options, but the conversation lingered for a bit on the newer Bluetooth headphones that go in each ear (not connected by a wire behind your neck).
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash forward to this morning...I get into work and start hitting all my typical "day starting" sites. Eventually my eyes glance of to an Ad on one of my regularly visited news sites, and low and behold...WIRELESS BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES...no cable at the back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very use to seeing these Ads update after I search for something on google, but I can't remember the last time I searched for wireless/Bluetooth headphones. So either this is just a coincidence (totally willing to accept this) or Google is listening in on everything that I say.

       Yeah, I mean I guess it's not even that I mind them listening to everything. I definitely have all my setting on "give it all to Google" because I feel like my Android experience is more complete and enjoyable that way. It's more that I've never thought about what it means to have a company potentially listening to everything. I guess if they are listening to everything, I would just expect more subtlety.

       It's sounding like we probably have differing views on the role of smart phones in one's life but since you asked...
      </p>
      <p>
       I use Google Now, an Android launcher by Google, for pretty much everything, rather than one off apps to view specific types of content or information. I'm not a fan of searching through walls of Apps for a single piece of information or type of content. Obviously I have to use some Apps for specific things, but in general I prefer a more minimalist approach. The less Apps the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also enjoy the curated feel of Google Now, I can swipe right from the home screen and it shows me my calendar for the day, where I parked my car (I live in a bigger city so it's mostly street parking), packages that might be arriving that day, traffic conditions to my frequently traveled locations, News/Articles based of my search history, weather where I am and where I might be heading, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you give Google a lot of information access and forego the more cautious privacy settings, everything becomes more seamless and integrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to me the "Android Experience" is one that leverages the consistent user experience found across the Google products I've been using for years (email, calendar, drive, photos, etc.), and organizes helpful information into a one stop shop for all the things that matter to me on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this comes at the cost of privacy though. I do feel conflicted about how much information I am giving away, but I also enjoy the level of organization it affords.

       Google has typically been more open than Apple which is what I prefer. With every company already knowing my habits better than I do at least they admit to some things. I am biased though because I despise Apple.

       Ah. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. You're a fucking retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple sells products. Google sells you. Literally you. Not just your data, which they try to collect as much as they can in very sneaky ways, but you. A digital version of you. Which is locked into a cage and poked with a stick by super computers, because physically locking you in a cage is illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you miss the whole Snowden thing? Which company was the last to join Prism.. and why? Oh wait, it was Apple who was added TWO YEARS after the next closest participant. Why? Because they were literally THE ONLY company which fought the government, until they were literally forced to comply, by a secret court. It was good ol' Microsoft who developed the Prism program for the government then bought skype, immediately backdoored it, just cause uncle sam wanted them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google on the other hand.. they bend over backwards to serve the surveillance state. I don't have any more patience to get into it, but you are a retard. Read Assange's book, if you're literate. Look at the Prism docs. Read the Stratfor leaks. and most of all, pull your head out of you ass. You probably hate Apple because you're a tech illiterate retard.

       In order to voice activate, it has to always be listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voice commands are processed on the server. The only way for the system to know you said the trigger phrase, "OK Google," is for the voice data to go to the server. Ergo, everything it hears goes to the server.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google has, like, infinite storage space. The data's there on the server anyway, why not keep it and do something interesting with it? Like offer it to the NSA and figure out how to better target advertising to you...

       I won't state that they absolutely do not collect everything, but I think your premise is untrue, and therefore your conclusion is not necessarily true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the service is advertised at least, is the the phone does voice processing on a local level to identify the trigger phrase. Once the phone detects the trigger phrase, it sends the command that follows it to Google's servers for further processing. Such a system would not require everything the phone hears to be sent to the server.

       No, you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. The local component of the software listens to everything the microphone records, and is just looking for the phrase "OK, Google." As soon as it hears this phrase, it sends whatever command it hears after that to google's servers, which process the voice command, and returns the processed command in a format the phone can then acts on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying all the processing is done on the phone, just the pattern matching for the trigger phrase. If you don't have a network connection, the phone likely doesn't even do the processing for the trigger phrase, as it can't handle the command that follows on its own, and it can't send it to the server.

       Not working in airplane mode is entirely consistent with how the service works as advertised.

       That said, my friend just received some of those earbuds after he contributed to their Kickstarter 2 years ago. So given that they JUST came out (at least one brand), I wouldn't be shocked if the company bought ads at the same time.

       Hey yeah they listen all the time. On a computer, log into your Google and start poking around the settings. They store all "OK Google" interactions and its there for you to check out and delete. My friend and I stumbled upon them last year and. She works dealing with personal information over the phone. If her phone is in the vicinity, she happened to say "Google" the whole conversation would get recorded until she stopped talking. And the whole thing got saved online for any agency to hear...
Freaky stuff

       Well this is sort of the crux of my question. Saying "OK Google" is one thing. I know when I say it, it starts listening. It's an interaction that is very transparent, "OK Google, I am now giving permission for you to start listening to me"
      </p>
      <p>
       But always listening to my conversations is a whole other issue that I wish Google would be just as transparent about, if indeed they are always listening.

       iPhone here but it makes me wonder. I use google maps over Apple maps. Just about every day, at no set time, once we get in the vehicle to leave the job to go home it'll pop up "xx minutes to home, traffic is (blah)". It does this going to the job in the morning too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's curious. Some weeks I go to the same job often, but abruptly if we go elsewhere it still tells me the travel time. It's almost freaky. If we talk about it it's not about specific addresses or even in texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow, somewhere, someone is doing some silly data digging and reflecting it. But damn some days it's just plain weird when it tells me traffic info
