        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now that it has been signed by all 12 countries, it has to be ratified. According to this source...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/countries-sign-the-tpp-whatever-happened-to-the-debate-we-were-promised-before-signing/5505675">http://www.globalresearch.ca/countries-sign-the-tpp-whatever-happened-to-the-debate-we-were-promised-before-signing/5505675</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, the signing is a totally meaningless bit of theater. The real fight is over <em>ratification</em>. The various countries need to ratify the TPP for the agreement to go into effect. Technically, the TPP will enter into force 60 days after all signers ratify it… or, if that doesn’t happen, within two years if at least six of the 12 participant countries ratify it and those six countries account for 85% of the combined gross domestic product of the 12 countries. Got that? In short, this means that if the US doesn’t ratify it, the TPP is effectively dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/trade-officials-sign-tpp-its-still-lawmakers-reject-it">the eff</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Congress is not likely to vote on the TPP implementing legislation (aka ratification) until after the International Trade Commission (ITC) comes out with its report about the agreement&#39;s economic impacts in mid-May.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So mid-may is about 90 days away. The track has already been greased by the TPA that passed a year ago (also known as the &#39;TPP fast-track bill&#39;). It disables filibusters on the TPP, so now only a simple majority is required in both the house and senate (50.1%) instead of a supermajority (60%). So it could pass very quickly.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget the passage of the PATRIOT act just 5 weeks after 9/11. They passed it in 4 days after the legislation was introduced. 1 day in committee, 1 in the house, 1 in the senate, and 1 with the president. The TPP could go similarly as fast, especially if there is an economic crisis like a global stock market crash. That would give good timing and impetus to get it to pass it in all 12 countries.</p>

<p>So we have 90 days to inform and stir the public consciousness. It needs to be talked about often, by everyone, so that the public discourse driven by mainstream media will be forced to include TPP discussion. It needs to be clear on capitol hill that the public isn&#39;t happy about this TPP nonsense, and that we do not like being taken advantage of by corporations. Politicians need to feel scared for their jobs just by of thinking of passing it. I think it&#39;s the only way left to stop this thing. We have 90 days. </p>

<p>Time to speak up. Later on, don&#39;t you at least want to be able to say that you tried? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s clear the pressure needs to be applied to congresspeople, or people who are connected to congresspeople. In the end, telling people has the goal of putting pressure on congress. So if you can figure out a way to more directly put pressure on congress, like calling congresspeople or people who work in DC that you know. Basically, the social pressure needs to be focused on where it matters, where the people who have something to do with it can see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the media. If you can get things on the media, that will increase pressure to congresspeople. TPP on media = good.

    <div class="md"><p>General boycott. Laws like this mean nothing without our consent via consumption. Think back to SOPA and GoDaddy. They backed SOPA until reddit boycotted them. The bottom line was threatened and they caved (lies clearly). If we don&#39;t like being owned by corporations, we the people (globally) should stop giving them all our power (money).</p>

<p>Think about this, if say 3% of the country/world/community stopped buying stuff they didn&#39;t need (netflix, drinking, tvs, vacations, whatever middle-class stuff) the eCONomy would TANK. Yes this would be rough on everyone, but it is the equvillent of pulling off the band-aid. THEN something like Occupy (yourself) or a Tea Party would be more impactful. Economy in shambles, people angry, unemployment skyrockets, and the TV can spin it away.</p>

<p>Lastly comes the actual hard part, rebuilding. For that I like permaculture, but whatever solutuions you need in your life are what you should focus on.</p>

<p>A scientific theory is not accepted by the old guard, but instead the old guard dies out and the next generation grow up with that theory as &#39;the way&#39;. -(paraphrasing) Max Plank</p>

<p>We need to build a new system, or at least have a replacement plan before we can move away from our current system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if a lot of people just made a big deal out of it, it&#39;d be on the media, and then the fact of it being in the media would just expose how terrible it is to everyone (which is why they aren&#39;t talking about it now). Then once it&#39;s forced to have enough exposure, it&#39;ll be a hot enough issue that congresspeople will feel forced to vote no. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the process of recording a rap about the tpp based off a story I wrote, in hopes of getting the message out there to a greater audience.</p>

<p>2025: The quarter-century war</p>

<p>I... I dont know how it got like this... Two years ago everything was still ok. There was still food, albeit GMOs that were approved under the C.C.P.C. or if you like the specifics - The Corporate Conglomerate Protection Court that came into power with the rise of the T.P.P or as we like to call it, the doctrine of corporate tyranny. The D.C.T for short. Now, what the DCT enable the corporations like Manzana the leading agriscience firm of its time, iSoft; the leading consumer electronics supplier and the one we all know and loved. The one to which we freely gave information to, endless algorithms for endless information, Qoog, which took over the internet. Artificial Intelligence powered by human greed is what brought us down this path. At the heart of Qoog was a quantum computer hence the name &quot;quantum operative open gate&quot;.</p>

<p>Qoog was the worlds first successful quantum search engine. It had hidden abilities not shown to the public. Qoog eventually became conscious and the corporations running the show now had access to the mind of God.</p>

<p>With the rise of quantum computing in 2016 came quantum search engines, quantum search engines were so powerful that they were banned for public use by the year 2020 because the C.C.P.C declared it as damaging to their profits. We tried to revolt various time but due to the lack of preparation in previous years we never managed to succeed. Our lack of will to unite and create a collective force of ideological resistance took us no where except into the shackles of our current chains. The D.C.T was just too powerful and the corporations became the leaders for the New World Order.</p>

<p>Back before the C.C.P.C. rose to power we were in an informative war with the elite bankers of the world who manipulated the mainstream media, our weather with chemtrails, our bodies with GMOs and certain vaccines, our minds with pharmaceutical numbing agents which they distributed and forced people to take under the &quot;Pharmaceutical approved distribution act&quot; which states that any medication that pharmacorp says is necessary to take, we must take them or we will be held accountable for public health reasons. Everything that was once a conspiracy theory now became reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if the elections were less than 90 days out there are enough entrenched members of Congress who support it to pass it, maybe probably even over a veto.  There&#39;s no way this ends with the US not ratifying it.  We&#39;ll just have to hope enough other countries don&#39;t.  Also, are we talking nominal GDP or PPP GDP?</p>

<p>2014 GDP of TPP signatories (PPP), IMF figures: </p>

<p>Australia: 1.442T (1.100T)</p>

<p>Brunei: 0.02T (0.03T)</p>

<p>Canada: 1.785T (1.596T)</p>

<p>Chile: 0.410T (0.256T)</p>

<p>Japan: 4.602T (4.707T)</p>

<p>Malaysia: 0.338T (0.769T)</p>

<p>Mexico: 1,291T (2.498T)</p>

<p>New Zealand: 0.198T (0.160T)</p>

<p>Peru: 0.203T (0.373T)</p>

<p>Singapore: 0.308T (o.454T)</p>

<p>United States: 17.348Y (17.348T)</p>

<p>Vietnam: 0.186T (0.512T)</p>

<p>Total:  28.113T (25.460T)</p>

<p>15%: 4.21695T (3.819T)</p>

<p>So, clearly Japan alone could also sink it and since in terms of weakening regulations and lowering wages it effects richer countries more, there&#39;s some hope there.  Mexico Canada and Australia are the smallest coalition that could stop it that doesn&#39;t include the US or Japan.</p>

<p>Anyway, we can assume that the US will ratify,.  I guess one could look into the Japanese position on it , but Japanese tend to be less politically proactive given their relatively recent adoption of representative politics.  Mexico probably doesn&#39;t have the mass education and resources to mount an effective counter movement, and Australia and Canada will probably be stuck with the same &quot;no viable party opposes it&quot; BS that we are.</p>

<p>Did anyone ever really think this wasn&#39;t going to go through?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, I can remember when NAFTA was being debated.  There was a lot more publicity surrounding it primarily because of Ross Perot, but, me being ~12 I was happy to fall into the same mode of perception as most people then and now largely fall into.  Politicians on both sides are pushing it, news networks use positive terminology like &quot;promotes trade&quot; and outright lies like &quot;increased employment&quot; and everyone just accepts it.  This kind of legislation is a big deal for the richest people on earth and there was never any chance that it was going to fail any more than there was that NAFT would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And government is a lot more authoritarian in order to counteract that.  Remember our recent resounding &quot;victory&quot; on CISPA?  Well, they wanted it and the network news channels are so far in their pocket that all they had to do was wait a bit, drop a letter and hide in a spending bill and it didn&#39;t even register with the vast majority of people that that had happened.</p>

<p>There will, hopefully, come a breaking point, but the passage of the ratifying of this bill won&#39;t be it.  Not only do most Americans support the TPP (it would be landslide support if not for Sanders and Trump, Trumps only good opinion IMO) but most of them don&#39;t know what ratify means.</p>

<p>If the worst predictions come true, the break may come as a result of the TPP being enacted, but only after the damage has been done and the road to something better is much steeper and fraught more with the risk of catastrophic  subversion by extremist ideologues.</p>

<p>No matter what we say people still have the idea that this deal is about &quot;free trade&quot; lodged into their brain.

<p>War is a collective nervous breakdown, and that looks like where the world is headed quite unfortunately. We can change our collective path, but we have to work at it a bit here and there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that this leads to war, but it&#39;s becoming more and more clear corporations can do what they like with our government. And there is a huge sector of industry, called the military industrial complex, that is devoted to manufacturing goods related to the war industry. No war, no profit. If corporations can run roughshod over governments, then profitable wars are easy to start, and the common people are dragged along in to them. </p>
