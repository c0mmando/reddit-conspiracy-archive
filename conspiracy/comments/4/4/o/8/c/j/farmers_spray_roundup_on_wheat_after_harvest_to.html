       I wish this were talked about more, because it seems like a very serious issue that could affect the health of hundreds of millions of people. Over-use of RoundUp is the main problem with our food. It's a known carcinogen, and the GMO plants are engineered to be immune to it, so it gets over-used as the bugs become resistant to it, especially in the last decade or two.

       This is also why all the bees are dying out. And Mon santo is spending lots of effort and money to keep this information on the down-low.

       True. Only a very, very, very, very small percentage of the population is allergic to gluten. Everyone else is just "allergic" to RoundUp.

       Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid.
       <strong>
        In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate's known properties.
       </strong>
       These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate's toxicity to humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate.
       <strong>
        The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.

       Here's farmers talking about using roundup on crops just prior to harvest:

       And here is an excerpt from a German study on glyphosate desiccation:
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">
        http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer.

       Who would say desiccation is not a thing?  Every farmer does it to some degree.  Lentils especially since they mature very uneven.  The pods are ripe but the vines can stay green in high moisture spots.  Wheat, Durum and Malt Barley are prob the least desiccated of all my crops but its not unheard of.  Had to desiccate my wheat last year because of uneven germination from drought conditions during seeding.

       Yes I used glyphosate. Because it was the cheapest, quickest way to get my wheat harvested at a higher grade. I had about 80% swathed but some fields had a lot of weeds coming and using glyphos late in the year helps weed control the following year.

       Financially I would be against the marking of it because of the hysteria we both know it would result in. Ethically I think it's a fair option. I eat my own lentils and pasta made from my own durum. Although I should clarify that you can desiccate a crop without using glyphosate with a chemical called Reglone.  Used when you want to keep your seed and it also acts quicker so I use it on pulse crops whenever I can. No I do not have any kids.

       Wowza.  Your average person eats cereal and potato of some form every day.  They're spraying massive amounts of herbicides on all conventional cereal and potato plants soon before harvest to dry them out.  So your average person must injest a shitload of herbicide.

       Potatoes have very little surface area per volume though compared to cerial crops like wheat, so the RoundUp doesn't penetrate as much of the food. Just wanted to add that

       Potatoes, being tubers, the edible part is (mostly) underground, so very little Roundup would be applied to that portion.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roundup (and all glyphosate products) act
       <strong>
        systemically
       </strong>
       - meaning that they penetrate the surface of sprayed foliage and enter the plant's vascular (circulatory) system, so the glyphosate (and all additional components, such as surfactants, wetting agents, etc) spread through ALL of the plant - from root to fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that the chemical cocktail will spread even to the underground parts of plants (like potatoes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plants that have been genetically engineered to resist the toxicity of glyphosate (Roundup-Ready corn, soy, canola, etc) are of special concern, as, depending on conditions, they may be sprayed on multiple occasions through their life cycle for "weed control", meaning that the chemicals will build up in their tissues, and concentrate in the whole of the plant before it is harvested - and eventually - eaten.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may well be why many people seem to be more sensitive to "GMO foods".

       Oats are mostly treated the same as wheat.  The problem with swathing oats is if its a heavy crop the swath would take a long time to dry if it did rain.  Lots of guys desiccate oats then harvest them standing.

       I would say yes, but more so not eating gluten because it's in a lot of grains &amp; grains cause inflammation in the body. I wouldn't say gluten itself is a huge issue but it happens to be in a lot of grains &amp; carbohydrate dense foods.

       I have mentioned the pre-harvest use of roundup in many related threads. There is a link to Monsanto's Pre-Harvest Staging Guide [PDF] in my earlier post. It you might want to add it to your list of documents.
      </p>

       EDIT: Found an archived version of Monsanto's document - just in case they think it is obsolete and take it down.

       Type-O or misunderstanding.

       Either way, tasty AND nutritious Roundup is sprayed on these plants just prior to harvest, and there is no doubt that crops treated as such provide us with a healthy dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto IMPLIES that the treatment's primary use is to control perennial weeds, but the primary purpose is to "ripen" the field in a uniform fashion to facilitate harvesting.

       Note in the linked guide that they specify its use on FEED BARLEY, not on barley intended for brewing beer:

       <p>
        MILWAUKEE - June 11, 2012 - American Malting Barley Association, Inc. (AMBA) malting and brewing members will not knowingly buy malting barley that has been post-heading treated with herbicide, such as glyphosate, regardless of the barley's origin. The post-heading herbicide application of glyphosate to malting barley, as a pre-harvest aid to kill weeds, as a desiccant to dry down the crop, or for any other reason is not labeled for use on malting barley in the United States.  The use of such treatment on malting barley is strongly discouraged by the North American malting and brewing industry and residue testing is performed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The AMBA Board of Directors, citing concerns expressed by the organization's Technical Committee for potential herbicide residues or affects on germination in malt made from treated barley, has voted to disapprove of post-heading treatment of malting barley with herbicides.

       Yes. I had my malt barley swathed. I use glyphos in fall mainly to help ripen but there is the secondary benifot of weed control the following spring. Especially for Russian thistle, dandelions etc.

       I have read that glyphosate contained in round-up kills certain gut microbiota resulting in celiac-like symptoms, ibs, weight gain and the like. Destabilizes the entire digestive system. Conversely foods high in those biotic cultures, like Kefir and greek yogourt can restore some balance (although they won't have a positive affect on other related toxic/carcinogenic effects)

       Maybe I am being naive, but nobody I know who handles herbicides, no wheat farmers among them, would do something so reckless. Violating FIFRA (federal insecticide, fungicide, rodenticide act) is frowned upon.  Licensed applicators are required to report what, where, when, how, and why every drop of every chemical they use.

       Indeed, Monsanto has developed several genetically modified varieties of food-crop plants to be "immune" to the effects of Roundup/glyphosate - the idea being that farmers can spray entire fields of their crops, killing all plants EXCEPT those that have been genetically modified to be immune to Roundup's deadly actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roundup-Ready crops currently in widespread use include: Soy, corn,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola">
        canola
       </a>
       (consumed as oil), alfalfa (animal feed, consumed by humans as sprouts), cotton (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonseed_oil">
        consumed as cottonseed oil
       </a>
       ), and sorghum (animal feed, direct human consumption), and they are working on making Roundup-Ready wheat and other crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       As these crops are unaffected by glyphosate, they may be sprayed multiple times during a growing season to kill off weeds. With your experience in the nursery industry, you know well what happens to plants that are exposed even to tiny amounts of this "miracle weed killer":
       <strong>
        THEY DIE
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Roundup and similar glyphosate-based products act systemically: Sprayed on foliage and other aerial surfaces, they penetrate and are absorbed by the plant, and, entering the vascular system, translocate throughout the entire organism - from root to fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a field of Roundup-Ready crops is sprayed, the R/R corn, soy etc gets just as much Roundup as the weeds -
       <em>
        except it does not kill them
       </em>
       - rather, it remains, circulating through  the vascular system of the plant, migrating into new areas as the plants grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned above, depending on conditions, Roundup-Ready crops may receive multiple applications during a single season, with levels of glyphosate (and its accompanying chemical cocktail) accumulating in increasing levels with each application.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is glyphosate present in the end products (beans, kernels, seeds, foliage, etc) that we either eat
       <em>
        or feed to animals that we eat
       </em>
       , studies have shown that the application of this herbicide fundamentally alter the nutrient and elemental composition of the food crops:

        Abstract
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This article describes the nutrient and elemental composition, including residues of herbicides and pesticides, of 31 soybean batches from Iowa, USA. The soy samples were grouped into three different categories: (i) genetically modified, glyphosate-tolerant soy (GM-soy); (ii) unmodified soy cultivated using a conventional “chemical” cultivation regime; and (iii) unmodified soy cultivated using an organic cultivation regime. Organic soybeans showed the healthiest nutritional profile with more sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose and maltose, significantly more total protein, zinc and less fibre than both conventional and GM-soy. Organic soybeans also contained less total saturated fat and total omega-6 fatty acids than both conventional and GM-soy.
        <strong>
         GM-soy contained high residues of glyphosate and AMPA (mean 3.3 and 5.7 mg/kg, respectively)
        </strong>
        . Conventional and organic soybean batches contained none of these agrochemicals.
        <strong>
         Using 35 different nutritional and elemental variables to characterise each soy sample, we were able to discriminate GM, conventional and organic soybeans without exception, demonstrating “substantial non-equivalence” in compositional characteristics for ‘ready-to-market’ soybeans.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My rant above focused on Roundup-Ready food crops, but as you saw with the link I provided earlier, this "miracle herbicide" is used on many other food crops with the specific intent of KILLING the plants so that they can be harvested more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the food-crops listed in my previous link, there are others that are commonly treated pre-harvest, including sugar beets, potatoes,
       <a href="http://www.sunflowernsa.com/magazine/details.asp?ID=496">
        sunflowers
       </a>
       , safflower, oats, rye, and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, glyphosate can also be used pre-harvest to provide a "uniform kill" to
       <strong>
        non-GMO
       </strong>
       varieties of soy, cotton, corn, etc., so selecting shopping for products with a "GMO-FREE" label does NOT necessarily mean that the crops were not treated with glyphosate, just that the plants were (supposedly) not genetically modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is glyphosate
       <strong>
        <em>
         really
        </em>
       </strong>
       bad for us to consume? Does it really cause any of the health problems that many claim that it causes? That's a good question, and if you start reading, you'll see that it is a highly volatile topic, with some claiming that it causes EVERYTHING, and others insisting that it is completely harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things to consider when evaluating the arguments:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the vast majority of cases where glyphosate has been studied, it has been evaluated as a SINGLE, STAND ALONE CHEMICAL (glyphosate fed to rats, mice, etc), but it is virtually NEVER used that way in practical application - rather, it is mixed with numerous other chemicals such as surfactants, wetting/spreading agents, anti-foaming agents, and other chemicals that help with even distribution, reduction of surface tension, and allow the glyphosate to better penetrate and circulate within plant tissues. There is little doubt that, like glyphosate, these chemicals remain within the treated plants, AND that they change alter the way that glyphosate interacts within human/animal organisms. For proper evaluation, the products should be tested
         <strong>
          <em>
           as they are used
          </em>
         </strong>
         in the real world.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When evaluating the arguments presented,
         <strong>
          who stands to benefit
         </strong>
         ? If there is deception going on, who is motivated to deceive, and what is that motivation? Apologists for M0nsant0 and similar companies like to claim that their detractors are either pimps for the "organics industry", or, more often, simply claim that they are a bunch of
         <strong>
          <em>
           "kooky conspiracy theorists"
          </em>
         </strong>
         who are taking advantage of the "fear frenzy" to promote their shitty "blog" and irritate these harmless and benevolent corporate giants.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Every time a study is released that casts the products in a negative light, apologists will claim that the studies were "poorly designed", that the scientists are "unqualified", or use any other excuse they can conjur to try to convince people to
       <strong>
        ignore the implications
       </strong>
       . Meanwhile, "celebrity scientists" will come out of the woodwork to indignantly shout down the studies, poo-poohing the findings, and proclaiming that the study was conducted by "quacks". Perhaps not surprisingly, several of these "celebrity scientists" have been outed as recipients of substantial compensation from the corporations whose products and methods they so valiantly defend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it is VERY interesting to note that the manufacturers of these and other products have been campaigning
       <strong>
        HARD
       </strong>
       to prevent Federal and State governments from introducing mandatory labeling for ANYTHING related to these products.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this rant long enough yet?
       <em>
        (Yeah, I'm a long-winded SOB! Sue me!)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you make up your own mind as to whether the products are safe, and whether or not there may have been elements of corruption/collusion/conspiracy involved in the manufacture, approval, marketing and ongoing evaluation of these products - and if so, by who?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line and
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       the best question:
       <strong>
        Who stands to benefit?

       Worse still, genetically modified strains reproduce and cross-pollinate with other species in the wild, permanently changing the core genome of multiple species - often with unexpected and unpredictable outcomes on both plants and the organisms that interact with them.

       That's my main issue with ANY GMO's - plant or animal. Once this stuff gets into the wild, it can't be undone. We have changed species forever, and frankly, these blowhard scientists don't have a CLUE as to what the long term effects might be.

       I have heard multiple researchers making the claim that wheat is poison. Some citing the book Wheatbelly as a good place to start. I personally haven't spent energy looking into the claims but decided I would try to go wheat free for a month and see if it helped my non stop post nasal drip I have had since childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 weeks in I can say it has reduced significantly and I haven't been 100% wheat free. Saturday I was at my grandmothers birthday and ate pasta and cake. That afternoon and the next day I felt hungover.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think many of us have built up a tolerance to the poison When we stop eating wheat and then start again the difference is noticeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said I haven't spent time on research and have no proof but for me personally the evidence is there. I am not worried specifically about gluten but I will not be eating wheat as long as I can avoid it.

       They also do this with corn. I've seen it with my own eyes in North Central Texas. It is my opinion the primary reason they do this is that 'dry' product is much easier to harvest and process than normal healthy plants that naturally are full of moisture, as they should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means they effectively 'kill' the crop with Roundup (glyphosate) right before they harvest it, which means the product is full of glyphosate.

       RoundUp is an herbicide. It's not made to kill bugs. I'm not particularly inclined to trust your opinion on this matter if you didn't know that. And the stuff that's been implicated in killing bees is the neonicotiniod class of pesticides. Glyphosate has been found to be mostly harmless to them.

       Because I made one post, you think I assume that I am an "expert"? Sorry I made a mistake in calling it a pesticide when it is technically an herbicide. But your assumptions are mistaken, I am no expert, I am only trying to bring some concerning things to light that could affect a lot of people.

       I have an autoimmune disease and I've been on an elimination (AIP) diet since before thanksgiving. I have noticed great improvement in my health and as soon as I tried to add grains back into my diet I felt I'll again. My husband  wondered if it wasn't simply something like roundup causing my problems. This is so very interesting to me.
      </p>

       Also, I have heard of people (friend of a friend) moving to Europe and not needing to eat gluten free any longer.

       Yup, I know someone who has undergone similar things. That's a very familiar story.

       The larger story becomes especially interesting when you start considering the revolving door between government and mon santo, and that it's mostly them who are the ones using the US government to say RoundUp is safe! Look at these connections:

       I'll bet some hard charging local salesrep suggested a retarded farmer try to "desiccate" his wheat with poison weed killer. If there still was a investigative reporter he would discover that the information was shared with other regional salesreps, making its way to district, state, and national level within Monsanto. VP's were thrilled about the bump in sales, incentivized the reps, farmers, and support staff to PROMOTE this deadly, and insane practice, all piled on smiling at their bonus and commission checks. Now we have no oversight or enforcement in America and I'm sure the oligarchs don't care if a couple thousand people have shit health or die from this fucked up practice.

       When did the need for desiccants arise? What are the non-toxic alternatives if it is a need at all for the equipment. Which desiccants do not require the grain to be washed post application? I propose there is no need, or that it was an exaggerated need, a marketing ploy to get you stupid asses to spray poison on your neighbor's kids cereal!

       I actually just picked up my glyphosate for the upcoming year. 3500L to be exact. I'll write your name on a couple of the 1000 Litre totes. Give you a shout out when I fire up the sprayer. Your silly little tantrums inspired me to up the amount of round up I use this year. My Monsanto rep says "thanks you". Well played! Enjoy your cereal!

       Don't wear gloves or a respirator. Just get a cowboy bandana. The stuff is safe. Oh, I see you have a Mexican immigrant to do the actual work. His family and children appreciate the opportunity to make ten dollars a day. His wife washes his clothes in the creek by the shack where your chemicals run off year in and year out.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you care, they're seasonal and you won't see them again. I guess they should have thought first about illegal immigration. You won't see the mutations or the tumors or the dead baby.

       Sadly there is this little growth inside you fed, not by glyphosate, but by black bile, greed and hate. It's an even better feed stock for the cancer that kills you. It is said that your life passes before your eyes at the end, but also the consequences of the callous choices you've made. It is also said that once you see this story, St. Peter doesn't judge you, you do that yourself, realizing at last your evil that drags you into the flames.

       and yet you post zero alternatives. You are the exact reason nobody listens. Ramble on and on and not one reason for me to change how I farm. Give me a alternative to glyphosate that costs the same and does the same job. Until then I'll run my farm however I want and there isn't a single fucking thing you can do about it. Ever.

       You should be the one cognizant of the alternatives. You should study up on it. Then you should share it here for your fellow farmers. I suspect any low grade vegetable oil would probably work to shock the plants to mature quicker. You are really comfortable gaining the "drying" and oily substance from a god damn poison? Bad man. You are a bad man. Know it! Own it. Freak.

       Why should I? Glyphosate works just fine. You are the one throwing a shit fit. It's on you to come up with something. Besides vegetable oil you sniveling retard. I feed the world.

       Good one. Way to contribute to the convo. Do really think you will be taken seriously acting like a 3 year old having a tantrum? Anyways I'm off to get my sprayer ready for the season. Just keep in mind there will be 3500L of roundup sprayed in your honor this year. Enjoy your cereal!

       You remind me of Mr. Garrison's old boyfriend, Mr. Slave. I see how you talk a lot about your "sprayer". Is it large? Do you want to stick it in the verdant earth and let all 3500L juice out at once in an orgasmic discharge. Do you want to fuck the earth and all the children with your "sprayer"? Are you spent? Is it a substitute for any less than dominating areas of your life, substandard performance issues? Perhaps you would heal if you'd get off the chemicals.

       haha now you are getting fired up! Love it. Ya my sprayer is 110ft wide with a diesel chugging 440hp. I can cover 160 acres an hour in round up. Then I sell the crop as organic because there is no way to prove it isn't. And you eat it because you are now and forever my bitch. Can you taste it? You ever lie in bed at night realizing how your life depends on me feeding you whatever I want? Fuck it fells great to own you. Who's mr slave now? Enjoy your cereal!

       Long time no see my little Cereal Killer. You don't have a farm, you are a very strange provocateur. You are like a leech sucking divisiveness, sadistic. Ask yourself what you are doing and why. If you were a farmer how could you harbor such hate for your customer? You are a fraud. If you were a farmer you'd be in the wrong business. I'd suggest Xe or Academi where you could work directly for Monsanto and kill people directly which more closely aligns with your propensities.

But alas you are still pathetic moron grasping to a fight you can never win.  The fact of the matter is either we farm this way or billions starve.  Oh yea I guess I can spray my field with vegetable oil and save the world right?  Fuck grow up.

       Cereal Killer is back. How's it going? I think I said glycerin and mineral oil but you never wanted another solution for your imaginary field. Jeepers, Pal, why are you so upset? You should probably see if you can forget about a seed I planted in your tiny little head, and I'll use simple, down home country boy little words, caring for you in spite of your curses. What if I'm right? Remember Thalidomide? DDT? Agent Orange, PCB's, Chromium 5? They fought like the tobacco industry in each case. Too bad you're not a farmer anyway.

      <p>
       This is a defeatist attitude that causes people to give up and just eat whatever they want due to the false belief that there is no safe food anyways. If you can figure out a bunch of easily-achievable ways to reduce your overall toxin exposure, why not do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I will explain how to reduce the toxin load in your body through food choices, water, and air. I will also help you to get some sunlight, exercise, and reduce your grocery bill by a substantial amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Grow your own food. You might first think of this as work, but you will learn that it is pleasurable to have the power to feed yourself at least some of the time. I have never once needed to use any pesticides. Just grow a lot of different varieties. If you have a decent backyard, you can grow several varieties of trees which fruit at different times, ensuring you a steady supply of the fruit for half the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Find trails in your area and learn what is edible. Hint: There is a lot of edible food in the woods and much of it is tasty. Maybe do a bit of research on any industrial plants nearby the area. If you buy food from the store, you are taking a chance and have little idea where that food came from.
       <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters/polluters/new-york">
        Here's one tool you could use to determine what pollutants are in your area.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3 a) Find a local beef farmer (or chicken, whatever) and get to know them. Do they feed their cows crap food? Do the cows eat grass? How healthy do they look? Purchase a basement freezer and buy a half cow.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 b) Alternative to 3a: Buy some lead-free ammunition and a rifle or shotgun (or bow if you're feeling lucky). Find a spot away from the city to hunt. Lead-free ammo is better because the lead fragments as it passes through flesh, and can easily make its way into distant parts of the animal without you realizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) One very simple way to reduce indoor air pollution is to simply buy a high-end air filter. For central air/heat, buy the best filter to capture the smallest particles. Maybe go a step further and buy a portable hepa filter, running it in your bedroom while you sleep. Google "air quality map" and use those tools to help you determine if this is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Make sure to filter your tap water.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/44j57f/radioactive_material_has_leaked_into_the/czqlb37">
        Here is some information that I'm sure will convince you to do this.
       </a>
       Over the course of a few months, bottled water will be substantially more expensive than your choice of home filtration. There are a few options here. I usually recommend reverse osmosis or distillation. You could also go with Zerowater, but that is a bit more expensive in the long run, unless you use rainwater or if your tap has a very low amount of contaminants. There are probably a few more brands that work just as well. Do some research
       <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-14/news/ct-met-lead-water-filters-20110914_1_filters-cost-osmosis-systems-brita-pitcher">
        (Brita doesn't remove all of the lead, for instance).

       Been a farmer for 18 years... Have never sprayed roundup on wheat post harvest. When you harvest it, the seed is separated from the chaff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sprayed it pre-harvest a couple times, but those are years the weeds got away from us early in the summer. Mostly from large rains, or a bad stand of wheat that didn't shade the ground to prevent weed growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, the biggest  statement. When roundup is sprayed a "hot" mix is 24 ounces per acre... But, that is mixed with 15-20 gallons of water per acre.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's .009% roundup by volume.... less that one hundredth of one percent. When mixed at that ratio is has no taste, and is considered safe for oral exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       They spray it on what preharvest to kill weeds, and make the crop easier to harvest... Green wheat won't go through a combine, and elevators won't take seed with more than 18% moisture... Because it rots!

       Nope.  Crops are desiccated PRE harvest.  Used mostly to accelerate maturity in crops that are maturing uneven.  I prefer to swath it if I can but certain crops make a very light swath (lentils, peas) and wind would raise hell.  Desiccating a crop after harvest is completely useless and would only render the seed unusable for the following year.

       There is no definitive evidence showing Glyphosate has any appreciable negative health affects in humans. In fact, many of studies show no link to any health problems in humans with the highest measured levels of glyphosate in their urine. The humans studied were ones most exposed to the substance, farmers and their families. These subjects had levels far higher than the normal exposure to the average consumer, and yet showed no ill effects.

       the WHO used terminology not normally used in scientific papers. It did not definitively link glyphosate with cancer, it only concluded on the feeblest of evidence based on statistical model variation that Glyphosate should be categorized as a "Probable Carcinogen"
      </p>
      <p>
       It did not find a real link at all and the WHO paper has been heavily criticized by scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also many other papers that have looked for links to adverse health affects and glyphosate and have found none.

       Big Surprise! Snopes is wrong again!

       Celiac disease is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with gluten intolerance and a higher risk to thyroid disease, cancer and kidney disease, and there is also an increased risk to infertility and birth defects in children born to celiac mothers. While the principal diagnostic is autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, celiac disease is associated with a spectrum of other pathologies such as deficiencies in iron, vitamin D3, molybdenum, selenium, and cobalamin, an overgrowth of pathogens in the gut at the expense of beneficial biota, impaired serotonin signaling, and increased synthesis of toxic metabolites like p-Cresol and indole-3-acetic acid.
       <strong>
        In this paper, we have systematically shown how all of these features of celiac disease can be explained by glyphosate's known properties.
       </strong>
       These include (1) disrupting the shikimate pathway, (2) altering the balance between pathogens and beneficial biota in the gut, (3) chelating transition metals, as well as sulfur and selenium, and (4) inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. We argue that a key system-wide pathology in celiac disease is impaired sulfate supply to the tissues, and that this is also a key component of glyphosate's toxicity to humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and in human urine and blood has been inadequate.
       <strong>
        The common practice of desiccation and/or ripening with glyphosate right before the harvest ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply.
       </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
       And for the people who will inevitably claim that crop dessication is not a thing, see here:

      <p>
       And here is an excerpt from a German study on glyphosate desiccation:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en">
        http://www.ithaka-journal.net/herbizide-im-urin?lang=en
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Spraying crops to death”, as desiccation should be more aptly called, means that herbicides are being sprayed directly on the crops shortly before they are to be harvested to facilitate the harvest by uniformly killing off all living plants (including the crops) on the field. If crops can not fully mature due to excessive rain, as was the case in the summer of 2011, herbicides are used to bring the crops to maturity by means of a “death-spray”. The method facilitates the drying of the crops as well as removing all weeds for the next sowing period, and has become common for the harvest of potatoes, cereals, canola and pulses. For potatoes, spraying herbicides on the field immediately before harvest (2.5 l / ha), hardens the skin and reduces its susceptibility to late blight and germination, which improved the potatoes shelf life. Active compounds of the herbicide directly enter the potato through the leaves; however, decomposition of the poison takes place in the body of the consumer.

       <p>
        Frankly, I am shocked that its uses include intentional application of food crops.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Indeed, Monsanto has developed several genetically modified varieties of food-crop plants to be "immune" to the effects of Roundup/glyphosate - the idea being that farmers can spray entire fields of their crops, killing all plants EXCEPT those that have been genetically modified to be immune to Roundup's deadly actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roundup-Ready crops currently in widespread use include: Soy, corn,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canola">
        canola
       </a>
       (consumed as oil), alfalfa (animal feed, consumed by humans as sprouts), cotton (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonseed_oil">
        consumed as cottonseed oil
       </a>
       ), and sorghum (animal feed, direct human consumption), and they are working on making Roundup-Ready wheat and other crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       As these crops are unaffected by glyphosate, they may be sprayed multiple times during a growing season to kill off weeds. With your experience in the nursery industry, you know well what happens to plants that are exposed even to tiny amounts of this "miracle weed killer":
       <strong>
        THEY DIE
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Roundup and similar glyphosate-based products act systemically: Sprayed on foliage and other aerial surfaces, they penetrate and are absorbed by the plant, and, entering the vascular system, translocate throughout the entire organism - from root to fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a field of Roundup-Ready crops is sprayed, the R/R corn, soy etc gets just as much Roundup as the weeds -
       <em>
        except it does not kill them
       </em>
       - rather, it remains, circulating through  the vascular system of the plant, migrating into new areas as the plants grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned above, depending on conditions, Roundup-Ready crops may receive multiple applications during a single season, with levels of glyphosate (and its accompanying chemical cocktail) accumulating in increasing levels with each application.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is glyphosate present in the end products (beans, kernels, seeds, foliage, etc) that we either eat
       <em>
        or feed to animals that we eat
       </em>
       , studies have shown that the application of this herbicide fundamentally alter the nutrient and elemental composition of the food crops:

        Abstract
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This article describes the nutrient and elemental composition, including residues of herbicides and pesticides, of 31 soybean batches from Iowa, USA. The soy samples were grouped into three different categories: (i) genetically modified, glyphosate-tolerant soy (GM-soy); (ii) unmodified soy cultivated using a conventional “chemical” cultivation regime; and (iii) unmodified soy cultivated using an organic cultivation regime. Organic soybeans showed the healthiest nutritional profile with more sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose and maltose, significantly more total protein, zinc and less fibre than both conventional and GM-soy. Organic soybeans also contained less total saturated fat and total omega-6 fatty acids than both conventional and GM-soy.
        <strong>
         GM-soy contained high residues of glyphosate and AMPA (mean 3.3 and 5.7 mg/kg, respectively)
        </strong>
        . Conventional and organic soybean batches contained none of these agrochemicals.
        <strong>
         Using 35 different nutritional and elemental variables to characterise each soy sample, we were able to discriminate GM, conventional and organic soybeans without exception, demonstrating “substantial non-equivalence” in compositional characteristics for ‘ready-to-market’ soybeans.

       My rant above focused on Roundup-Ready food crops, but as you saw with the link I provided earlier, this "miracle herbicide" is used on many other food crops with the specific intent of KILLING the plants so that they can be harvested more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the food-crops listed in my previous link, there are others that are commonly treated pre-harvest, including sugar beets, potatoes,
       <a href="http://www.sunflowernsa.com/magazine/details.asp?ID=496">
        sunflowers
       </a>
       , safflower, oats, rye, and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, glyphosate can also be used pre-harvest to provide a "uniform kill" to
       <strong>
        non-GMO
       </strong>
       varieties of soy, cotton, corn, etc., so selecting shopping for products with a "GMO-FREE" label does NOT necessarily mean that the crops were not treated with glyphosate, just that the plants were (supposedly) not genetically modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is glyphosate
       <strong>
        <em>
         really
        </em>
       </strong>
       bad for us to consume? Does it really cause any of the health problems that many claim that it causes? That's a good question, and if you start reading, you'll see that it is a highly volatile topic, with some claiming that it causes EVERYTHING, and others insisting that it is completely harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things to consider when evaluating the arguments:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the vast majority of cases where glyphosate has been studied, it has been evaluated as a SINGLE, STAND ALONE CHEMICAL (glyphosate fed to rats, mice, etc), but it is virtually NEVER used that way in practical application - rather, it is mixed with numerous other chemicals such as surfactants, wetting/spreading agents, anti-foaming agents, and other chemicals that help with even distribution, reduction of surface tension, and allow the glyphosate to better penetrate and circulate within plant tissues. There is little doubt that, like glyphosate, these chemicals remain within the treated plants, AND that they change alter the way that glyphosate interacts within human/animal organisms. For proper evaluation, the products should be tested
         <strong>
          <em>
           as they are used
          </em>
         </strong>
         in the real world.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When evaluating the arguments presented,
         <strong>
          who stands to benefit
         </strong>
         ? If there is deception going on, who is motivated to deceive, and what is that motivation? Apologists for M0nsant0 and similar companies like to claim that their detractors are either pimps for the "organics industry", or, more often, simply claim that they are a bunch of
         <strong>
          <em>
           "kooky conspiracy theorists"
          </em>
         </strong>
         who are taking advantage of the "fear frenzy" to promote their shitty "blog" and irritate these harmless and benevolent corporate giants.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Every time a study is released that casts the products in a negative light, apologists will claim that the studies were "poorly designed", that the scientists are "unqualified", or use any other excuse they can conjur to try to convince people to
       <strong>
        ignore the implications
       </strong>
       . Meanwhile, "celebrity scientists" will come out of the woodwork to indignantly shout down the studies, poo-poohing the findings, and proclaiming that the study was conducted by "quacks". Perhaps not surprisingly, several of these "celebrity scientists" have been outed as recipients of substantial compensation from the corporations whose products and methods they so valiantly defend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, it is VERY interesting to note that the manufacturers of these and other products have been campaigning
       <strong>
        HARD
       </strong>
       to prevent Federal and State governments from introducing mandatory labeling for ANYTHING related to these products.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this rant long enough yet?
       <em>
        (Yeah, I'm a long-winded SOB! Sue me!)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you make up your own mind as to whether the products are safe, and whether or not there may have been elements of corruption/collusion/conspiracy involved in the manufacture, approval, marketing and ongoing evaluation of these products - and if so, by who?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line and
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       the best question:
       <strong>
        Who stands to benefit?
