       Here's how bigotry works, for OP and others:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're a white person?  You're allowed to mock whites.  Or call yourself "gringo."  Or call yourself "cracker."  Have fun with it.  When non-whites mock whites?  It's bigoted, but in a majority-white society, you should be thick-skinned &amp; grown-up enough to handle it.  Just because somebody mocks you, or even threatens you, doesn't mean shit.  Or shouldn't mean shit to you, if you're a fucking adult.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mormon?  You're allowed to joke around about Mormons.  Non-Mormons joking about Mormons?  Bigoted
         <em>
          .
         </em>
         In Utah?  Relax and handle it.  In majority-Protestant New Hampshire?  It's ugly, fair to be offended.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your family last name is "Gogog."  OK to make fun of "Gogogs"?  Yes.  OK for "Witherspoons" to make fun of Gogogs?  It's ugly and childish, but are you really so fucking sensitive that you're going to cry about it?  Take note of their bigotry.  Subtract credibility points from them.  Act accordingly.  Respond proportionately.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If OP thinks it's unacceptable for Beyonce to say the word "Negro" then OP is either socially inept or a passive-aggressive bigot who needs to grow the fuck up.

       Beyonce's exact words were:
       <strong>
        "I like my Negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils.”
       </strong>
       ‎
Under what circumstances is it acceptable for a person of ANY color to utter those words live on national television? That's a cute little theory, but why don't you try explaining it to the FCC. See if it'll fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit- it's rather obvious that Beyonce doesn't even live by those words since she obviously had a nose job, and even if it were meant to pay homage to Michael Jackson, it's a shitty way to do it since he obviously didn't like his God-given nose either.

       Oh wait, there's no problem with that.  Nor is there with Beyonce's words.

      <p>
       There's nothing shocking about a person making comments about their own race, or even epithets about their own race.  It's called autoimmunity.  But as for what you're doing, it's called passive-aggressive.

       So you want to bring my reddit handle in to the discussion, as if it's somehow relevant in the least? Why would you want to do that? I honestly only have this account because my original was shadowbanned.

      <p>
       Edit-if I told you the reason I was shadowbanned you wouldn't believe me, but I can prove it was indeed the reason.

       It's political because of CBS not bothering to censor Beyonce's use of "negro."  That word is as socially unacceptable as the N-word and everybody knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also pushed  the multiculturalism agenda hard in the halftime show, and during the entire telecast in general. I turned on the cbs telecast to find it being spoken in Spanish.

       I mean yeah, after asking for hundreds of years not to be called something you tend tend to get tired of people not listening to you. So if you want to put out that way, then yes. But you could also say white people do not have the mental capacity to follow simple instructions unless its accompanied by violence. But to each their own

       Not quite, boy. You admit negroes immediately resort to violence since they can't control themselves. That makes them unfit for living in a modern, civil society.

       Yeah right. Negro is just as unacceptable. When was the last time someone referred to Obama or any black person as a negro live on air in front of the entire world?

       It was. Did you see the entire crowd holding up signs spelling believe in love? They cut out then back in, all of the signs were just gone. Either they trained a hundred thousand people to cordinate or it was fake.

       OP, can you explain more exactly why you're upset? Are you black, and offended that she said this? I'm black and I didn't know negro was a bad word, nor do I think it's related to the N-word....this is actually the first I've heard about negro being an offensive word.  My grandma still says it. Are you personally offended by it because of history and race related issues, or are you offended because you think there's a double standard where white people aren't "allowed" to say it but black people are?

       She said "I love my negro nose and Jackson 5 nostrils." It's obviously racist and untrue, since she obviously hated hers enough to get a rhinoplasty, and so did Michael. Beyonce even lightened her skin. Way to embrace her blackness. Beyonce's racist performance was even more offensive due to her hypocrisy.

       So you want to bring my reddit handle in to the discussion, as if it's somehow relevant in the least? Why would you want to do that? I honestly only have this account because my original was shadowbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit-if I told you the reason I was shadowbanned you wouldn't believe me, but I can prove it was indeed the reason.
