I&#39;m seeing homeless people get treated like absolute shit, im seeing my friends act like Bernie Sanders can ducking save us. He&#39;s a communist! He&#39;s a socialist! Not to mention the WHOLE THING IS RIGGED AND IS A JOKE ANYWAY...I&#39;m watching all my friends and family go goo-goo over the Super Bowl, and the FOOTBALL GODS (I love football, but have recently realized how evil the NFL truly is). It&#39;s insane, it&#39;s like everyone is fucking on Prozac, they JUST. DONT. CARE. I&#39;ve never thought about killing someone until recently. I&#39;ve never had violence be the foreground of my thoughts with other people. Is this what they want? To drive the intelligent people out there crazy? I believe so. I REFUSE to succumb to your machinations you FUCKING SELFISH ASSHOLES! Grab a soul, NSA, fuck yourself. Paint the target on my back, as if I haven&#39;t already. You better scoop me up soon or I will play my full part in this.. Realize that your time is MUTHAFUCKING UP! I will personally lead the charge given the chance, otherwise I am willing participant of the destruction of all of our pre-conceived ideas of what is &quot;American&quot; and what is &quot;true&quot; and &quot;right&quot; God bless muthafucking America. Oh yeah I totally called it that the Broncos would win because there gonna rig this fuckkng game; get that through your thick skull. It&#39;s all fake. They gotta make Peyton (the white man) triumph over Cam (the black man) so that the racial, subconscious, social media-driven racial tension in this country gets another delicious morsel to feed its fat fucking face. Go America! Fuck all of us. I can&#39;t wait for the dream to become a nightmare for you shallow, self-serving, deceived proles. Then we&#39;ll see who&#39;s &quot;homeless&quot;. Sorry I&#39;m drunk and angry. Don&#39;t judge me based on this, we all have these emotions. I&#39;m having trouble containing mine right now and social media is NOT the place (clearly, I&#39;ve tried) to do it. Godspeed. Wake these fuckers up before they eat each other. </p>

<p>So? The capitalists haven&#39;t done you any good. Maybe the socialists can do for America what they did for most other developed nations? My little socialist hell-hole has more freedom, less tax and longer life expectancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America does not have free market capitalism- we have crony capitalism which is  quasi-socialist/fascist. I would love to see our country embrace free markets and let the creativity be unleashed. </p>

<p>Government isn&#39;t supposed to be mommy and daddy taking care of all our needs. Most of what they need to do involves enforcing contracts between consenting adults. Government should be kept as local as possible. </p>

<p>And is Bernie going to do anything about the Federal Reserve, the heart of evil in this whole system? Yeah, right. He advocates more government spending without dealing with the true problem of fractional reserve banking. </p>

<p>I&#39;m blown away by the people clamoring for more government run health care. Don&#39;t get me wrong, healthcare is ridiculously expensive and prices need to come down (free markets and competition will accomplish this) Some of us don&#39;t even want to participate in the allopathic medical system and I don&#39;t want to be taxed to death to pay for these things. I&#39;m tired of the Bernie stuff and I&#39;m embarrassed by how illiterate the masses are to simple economics. </p>

<p>Not really. I have more freedom than Americans, for example, and the chances of being killed by a cop are almost non-existent.</p>

<p>Hardly. We pay less tax than Americans, and we actually receive worthwhile benefits from it, thanks to the socialists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then, do the majority of New Zealanders just realize that to make a system like this work, you actually have to work and not abuse the system like so many people do in welfare state USA?

<p>You&#39;ve been swallowing too much elite-brand kool-aid. It rots the brain. We have a higher unemployment rate than the US. We still pay less tax, and we actually care for our poor people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/01/15/nzhe-j15.html">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/01/15/nzhe-j15.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of the National Party as our version of the Republicans. They are deliberately under-funding the system in order to break it - with the goal being to try and privatise it. But New Zealanders are not stupid. To quote the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the party’s conference in November, King declared that over the past 80 years “five Labour governments sought to build a public health system based on affordability, and accessibility for all New Zealanders. Five National governments have sought to corporatise, privatise, and dismantle it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to talk about the period 1984-1990, but what they fail to mention is that is the period where the corporate whores tricked New Zealanders by running as Labour candidates, but then introduced the most right wing policies our nation had ever seen.</p>

<p>New Zealanders were so outraged we actually changed our electoral system from &quot;First Past the Post&quot; to &quot;Mixed Member Proportional&quot; to try and take some of the power away from the now corporate-controlled major parties. For a time, there was literally no difference between Labour and National. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>After that, the Labour party members responsible for this undemocratic travesty left the party and formed their own party called the &quot;Association of Consumers and Taxpayers&quot; - ACT - and became the most hard right party in the country, but rarely got more than 5% support during elections.</p>

<p>They were literally crypto-fascists using our own &quot;people&#39;s party&quot; against us.</p>

<p>So the fact is, we have our problems. But we still have a public health system simply because <em>the people</em> will not tolerate anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said and thank you for some clarifications.  As usual I am just trying to figure out whats going on in other countries.  In the US it is so complicated. There is nothing to really get behind it seems.  People try to start movements but they lose momentum due to numerous factors.  I&#39;m a little confused by your first statement.  Maybe it came out wrong on my end.  I basically wanted to know if its a common understanding and nationalist pride among most New Zealanders that its important to work and not be lazy.  You may think that you know the unemployment numbers here in the US but those numbers are garbage.  They don&#39;t count the amount of peolple that are no longer looking for work.  Basically any news that comes out of the US should be taken with a grain of salt, but I am sure you know this already.</p>

<p>Actually, part European, part Maori.</p>

<p>Not true. There are safer places, like Japan which has a murder rate more than twelve times lower than the US and four times lower than New Zealand.</p>

<p>Still, it is a pretty good country. </p>

<p>By the way, I didn&#39;t mention this before, but the only time we have ever been attacked on our soil by a foreign government was when the French bombed the Rainbow Warrior in our harbour - so you can see why being called French was a touch insulting. Those arrogant assholes were saved by my countrymen <em>twice</em> - then came here to commit a government sponsored terrorist attack. Fuck the French.</p>

<p>The fact is, human beings are social creatures. We thrive <em>because</em> of socialism. The capitalists hate socialism because a united people are dangerous to them. So they prefer to make it &quot;every man for himself&quot;.</p>

<p>If you worry about the elites ruling the world, why would you adopt the political structure <em>they</em> prefer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just a difference of opinion my friend. Let me start by sayin I have absolutely no attachment or persuasion towards &quot;capitalism&quot;. I don&#39;t care frankly, I just want to live freely. Government is the problem, not economics. If you guys wanna do &quot;this&quot; that&#39;s fine, let us do &quot;that&quot;. We should be able to pursue different ideas, work together, and find out which one works best. Instead, intelligence agencies, corporations, and special interests groups (who all have the same handlers) work to distract the people&#39;s of the world and convince them that &quot;their ways our best&quot;. This is ridiculous, because its obvious that someone living in the Amazon rain forest is going to have a different experience than someone living in New York City. We can&#39;t all be fit into the same model; and that&#39;s what socialism is; placing us all in the same mutherfucking box, man. It&#39;s not okay. The UN is going to fucking take over one day and you&#39;ll understand why &quot;Socialsm&quot; (Marxism, Communism, SLAVERY) really is. Until then, your right. Your country is better, and nicer.

<p>No such thing. You are part of a society whether you like it or not. You would be dead if you weren&#39;t. The question is, would you rather be part of a society which shares its wealth with even the weakest members, or one in which the weak have to fight each other for every scrap from the ruling elites table, like gladiators in the Colosseum?</p>

<p>Divide and conquer. That&#39;s what the elites&#39; version of freedom you have bought into really means.</p>

<p>Funny, I&#39;m freer than you. I live in a socialist nation but I pay less tax per dollar earned than Americans. Even our top tax rate is lower than the top tax rate in the US.

<p>Never said I did. But when you benefit from being part of a society you have to pay your fair share of the cost. The best way to make sure everyone pays their fair share is via taxation.</p>

<p>Bullshit. There has never been a free market. All markets are controlled - either by the government of the people, or by the corporations of the elite.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. The world is no longer like it was in the days of the wild west. All the land is already owned, so there is no chance of striking out to claim and farm land. And thanks to greedy capitalists the cost of living increases much faster than the wages paid to the workers.</p>

<p>In an unregulated economy price gouging is the norm, not the exception. Did you see that photo that showed they were charging $7.00 for <em>water</em> at the Superbowl? That&#39;s the &quot;free market&quot; you love so much.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, no nation has operated under the libertarian &quot;ideal&quot; because it literally can not work. Only greedy, selfish morons think it can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the reply but you need to relax on the personal attacks- it makes your argument look really weak even though you make some decent points. I&#39;m not sure what the tax rates differences are in NZ vs US but you are correct that Americans pay a huge amount in taxes and it shouldn&#39;t be that way. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t mind paying taxes if the powers that be weren&#39;t a bunch of scumbag assholes bombing innocent people into oblivion and I don&#39;t mind keeping the government as local as possible so that money stays within the community. I just don&#39;t find our massive federal government all that necessary. NZ is a small country that is much more homogeneous than the US so what works for your country may not work for us. </p>

<p>I loathe paying federal taxes because the money is squandered on some truly awful things. I would spend that money much better than the government, I guarantee it. I would pay off my mortgage faster, support companies that treat their employees right, donate more to legitimate organizations. </p>

<p>If I could keep more of my wealth and pay off my mortgage I wouldn&#39;t have to stress about working as much and I would gladly volunteer and spend some money helping establish garden beds for people in my community who lack money to buy food (and I have done stuff like this before). This kind of a solution is libertarian in nature and preferable to the government paying out food stamps. Food stamps creates dependency and doesn&#39;t lead to true self reliance. It also taxes people without their consent. Furthermore, it enriches the awful GMO food companies. I am sure that with all the technology in this world, we can find creative solutions that meet people&#39;s needs without stealing from other people. </p>

<p>For fucks sake, the people in Flint Michigan are drinking poisonous water while our government hands over more of our hard earned wealth to the military industrial complex. It would have cost $80 a day to prevent the Flint water problems. Where the hell is all our money going? It&#39;s insane to give these clowns anymore money and power because they have proven themselves incapable of doing the right thing. </p>

<p>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting the same results. Concentrating massive power in the state and expecting it to bestow all good things onto the people is complete insanity when governments have been the biggest mass murderers and thieves in world history. I&#39;m just done falling for the propaganda that big government can be good. It can&#39;t because power attracts psychopaths. </p>

<p>As for the Superbowl, people paid an ungodly amount of money to attend and expect to pay those prices for these things. After paying a few grand for a ticket, I&#39;m sure the customer is OK with paying those prices for beer and water. This is an event for very wealthy people and the prices reflect that fact. They consented to pay outrageous prices and I see nothing wrong with it. It&#39;s not like the government forced anyone to pay or charge those prices at the Superbowl. </p>

<p>Besides being an economics teacher and homesteader, I also have a small fashion line on the side. When I sell my dresses at markets/online marketplaces, I often negotiate prices with customers until we settle on something that works for the both of us. That, my friend, is how free markets work: no one forcing anything and both parties leave better off for engaging in the transaction. </p>

<p>What&#39;s awful is the government printing more and more money to finance the worst possible things. It kills the purchasing power of the dollar making it even more difficult for the poor and middle classes to survive.  My fashion line prices have to compete with the slave labor &quot;made in China&quot; shit and I hate having to raise my dress prices when shipping/input prices increase (largely due to Federal Reserve created inflation). Shipping costs just went up and I am delaying increasing my prices until I absolutely have to. Many small businesses have this same mentality about raising prices. Customers leave and look for a better deal when prices go up. Only government protected cartels and monopolies can get away with charging ridiculous prices and not lose their customers because of the lack of competition.</p>

<p>I do not necessarily advocate for a gold standard but I would love to see competition and see what happens. Communities might start their own currencies backed by labor hours or something else. Maybe someone has a silver backed currency. Maybe the midwest has a currency backed by corn. Maybe Texas could start a currency backed by oil production. If one of those currencies collapse, the damage is localized. Once again, I would like to see the markets freed up so that we can find creative solutions to today&#39;s problems.</p>

<p>PS. I lived in Melbourne Australia as a kid. The biggest reason we left is because of the high tax rates. My mother worked as a perfusionist and resented how much of her money was taken in taxes after she worked so hard for her degree. Prices were so high, we couldn&#39;t afford the standard of living we had in the United States (going out to eat as a family every so often and going to the movies, etc). Maybe the people who are used to that life are OK with it, but it did not go over well with my parents who were used to having disposable income. </p>

<p>PPS. Libertarians are some of the nicest, generous people I have ever met. They genuinely believe that they have to take the initiative to improve their communities. They just believe in voluntary association and don&#39;t trust the greedy selfish morons that have proven themselves inept. </p>

<p>PPPS. Lots of love from TX!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I appreciate the reply but you need to relax on the personal attacks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What personal attacks? The part about you being brainwashed? That&#39;s not a personal attack, it is an observation based on evidence. The vast majority of Americans are brainwashed in one way or another. The media makes sure of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Concentrating massive power in the state and expecting it to bestow all good things onto the people is complete insanity when governments have been the biggest mass murderers and thieves in world history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why the people need to <em>actively</em> control their government. &quot;By the people&quot;. There is no separate &quot;government&quot; - it represents the people. When the people step back and let their government be taken over by the elites, that&#39;s when everything goes wrong.</p>

<p>This does not mean guns are the answer. They aren&#39;t. Guns give the elites the excuse to kill the people with impunity, and they sure as hell can&#39;t protect you from them. They have more and better guns, and they can use them against you as easy as they can use them against Iraqis or Afghans.</p>

<p>At this point, armed revolution is no longer possible because the government is always going to be more heavily armed than the people. The only way to defeat the government in a revolution today is to convince the people the government recruits to enforce their policies to refuse to obey their orders.</p>

<p>That won&#39;t happen if they think you&#39;re trying to kill them. Armed revolution <em>guarantees</em> failure, unless you have the backing of another government. But I digress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just don&#39;t find our massive federal government all that necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, if you were a black person in the south in the 1960&#39;s, you&#39;d have a different view. In those days the federal government was the only one that even tried to protect them from the racists that ran the state governments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could keep more of my wealth and pay off my mortgage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really believe that would happen in an unregulated economy? The only thing stopping banks from charging 200 or 1000% interest is the regulations they have to comply with. That fact is the reason why those regulations were put in place. Unfettered bankers are the greediest of the lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting the same results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply got confused. &quot;[E]xpecting the same results&quot; is exactly what you should do, if you do the same thing over and over again. I&#39;ll assume you actually meant &quot;different results&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This kind of a solution is libertarian in nature and preferable to the government paying out food stamps. Food stamps creates dependency and doesn&#39;t lead to true self reliance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh bullshit. The tiny amount they give out is nowhere near enough for a person to feel &quot;comfortable&quot; - but it does stop them from starving to death. Extremely few people, given the choice, want to live on welfare, and those few would not be productive in society anyway. The choice is simply, let them starve and deal with the consequences (increased crime, for example), or provide them a minimum safety net.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just done falling for the propaganda that big government can be good. It can&#39;t because power attracts psychopaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny how very few of man&#39;s greatest achievements were carried out by private industry. Everything from cars to computers were developed and implemented with government funding.</p>

<p>As for power attracting psychopaths, who do you think runs the corporations that have more power than most governments? You think deregulating them would make things <em>better</em>?</p>

<p>The libertarian ideal might work if everyone started from the same starting line. But the fact is, the race was won centuries ago. The vast majority of humanity is way behind, so unless you are talking about starting this libertarian economy of yours by first redistributing all the wealth equally amongst all people - ie communism/socialism - libertarianism simply can not work the way the libertarians claim.</p>

<p>The wealthy elites already have most of the wealth, and the only thing stopping them from taking the rest is regulation by &quot;big government&quot;.</p>

<p>Got to go to work, so that will have to do for now.</p>

<p>Not true. We went to war because we chose to stand with our allies when they asked for our help.</p>

<p>We fed your troops in the Pacific during WWII, after you <em>finally</em> joined the war effort. While we were fighting the Nazis, your corporations were helping them.</p>

<p>Then you assholes have the gall to claim <em>you</em> won the war.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We usually went to war when it was the right thing to do. We never invaded another nation. We never attacked another nation. We helped defend nations that couldn&#39;t defend themselves. And we <em>always</em> fought opponents that were much more powerful than us, unlike a certain &quot;superpower&quot;.</p>

<p>Having said that, we also were the first western nation to ban nuclear weapons. We actually stood up to the American government despite the then Vice President threatening to arm &quot;dissidents&quot; to overthrow our government (ignoring our long alliance).</p>

<p>We opposed the invasion of Iraq and refused to be involved in that war crime, but we did go to Iraq to try and pick up the pieces after the damage was done.</p>

<p>Oh fuck off. The worst things about our country right now were caused by the capitalists. The fact we have been socialist for so long makes it very hard for even the capitalists to fuck it up, because we already know they are liars.</p>

<p>For example, our government spends less per head of population on healthcare, but we have universal free healthcare meaning we have a <em>longer</em> life expectancy than Americans, and no one has gone bankrupt due to medical bills.</p>

<p>We do have private healthcare as well, so those that wish to can enjoy slightly better accommodations in a private hospital, but their healthcare is no better than the care I can get for free.</p>

<p>Not even the capitalists can take that away from us because we <em>know</em> what the benefits are. We take one look at the US and we <em>know</em> what the capitalists would give us.</p>

<p>So take that anti-socialism bullshit and shove it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you even on r/conspiracy, everything&#39;s dandy right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I happen to mention that you&#39;ve been brainwashed by the capitalists - the 0.1% - to believe that socialism is evil so that they can enslave you? Why else would you think I&#39;m here? There is a global conspiracy by the ruling elites to divide and conquer humanity, and the hatred of socialism is part of that strategy. Socialism is at its core about the people being united. <em>That</em> is the elites&#39; greatest fear, and that is why they have spent and still spend so much money on propaganda to brainwash people into believing their greatest strength - unity - is evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this scene you often read that our strength supposedly lies in numbers, but that&#39;s obviously not the case. In fact, it might be our biggest problem. There&#39;s too many barely cognizant cowards out there, who&#39;ve been conditioned into being docile little serfs that are just content enough when they get their bread and circuses. Well, getting might not exactly be applicable anymore. The neo-capitalist system has driven them to the point where they&#39;ll actually fork out vast portions of their miserable incomes to attend or buy absolute garbage that&#39;s detrimental to their own well-being in oh so many ways. Even though the quality diminishes visibly with every moment that passes by, the prices rise and demand still increases. That&#39;s what I call collective madness. </p>

It would seem there are even fewer than that within my circles. It&#39;s just depressing.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that racism is an entirely made up concept used to mentally enslave people and pit them against each other in endless squabbles. So really, it is working exactly as it is intended to.  I just have contempt for anyone who takes sides, and falls for the whole &#39;racism&#39; spiel, where we are expected to believe that people actually hate each other just because their skin is a different color.  </p>

<p>&quot;Hey Earl!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, Zeke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at that guy over there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What guy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That guy over there, the guy standing off by himself over there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yeah.  What about him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, just look at him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look at him.  Look at his FUCKIN&#39; SKIN!&quot;</p>

<p>I mean, look up the etymology of the word &#39;racism&#39;.  It didn&#39;t even exist as a concept before the 20th century.  It was just another one of the garbage concepts and belief systems created as rackets, mental prisons and weaponized cultural concepts by the bolsheviks, who were the greatest geniuses of human oppression that ever existed, and their toxic legacy has only grown over the decades.  </p>

<p>Humans have always been in conflict, but not individually, we tend to group together along family lines and geographic areas naturally by forming tribes and more complex governmental structures.  In the history of human conflict, it is natural to hate and fear outsiders and interlopers, and just as often as not the hated enemies were identical in appearance.  People fight, and they do terrible things to each other, and sometimes it just happens that their skins are different colors than each other due to any number of regional or cultural factors.  It was considered perfectly natural to target specific countries or groups or kinds of people for warfare or oppression, yet this was so commonplace and happened just as often to &#39;same colored&#39; people than to &#39;different&#39; colored people that there wasn&#39;t even a word used to describe it.  Is it &#39;racism&#39; when a white dog attacks a brown dog?  I know we aren&#39;t animals but it seems like even animals see through the old &#39;racism&#39; trick.      </p>

<p>People back then seemed saner somehow, even though they believed in witches and other stupid shit, they were sober and reasonable enough to know that whites don&#39;t bully people with our thoughts, the mere existence of whites isn&#39;t oppressive due to the privilege of being alive, and we don&#39;t magically run society to the extent that we are responsible for their employment and their incarceration.  It&#39;s called MERIT, people...in 2016 blacks have it really good, if they would just take care of their societal problems.  Even hispanics are integrating pretty well, in spite of all the furor about illegal immigration on the right....with some exceptions, of course. </p>

<p>I am especially mentioning black people because there is something definitely pathological and nihilistic in their culture, and even Jesse Jackson himself acknowledged this in his famous &#39;when I hear steps coming up behind me&#39; statement, where he admitted he was afraid of young black males.  The facts are stacked against the existence of the concept of &#39;racism&#39; yet the trick works so well that merely pointing this out would be considered &#39;racist&#39; in itself, and is such a genius concept that it took on a life of its own and has become a sort of &#39;Frankenstein monster&#39; of immense proportions.  I have even seen &#39;racism&#39; used as a racketeering operation, where Donald Sterling, owner of the Clippers, was blackmailed by his wife and then extorted by the head of the NAACP, who promised him absolution for his &#39;sins&#39; if he donated some large sum.</p>

<p>Those of you who this post enrages are the type of people who never learned that a large portion of the slaves in America were white; that the first person to own slaves in the US was black; that the word &#39;slave&#39; came from an entire race of white people who epitomized slavery and yet didn&#39;t demand reparations generations down the road; and that there are lots of black folks own slaves all over the world, right now this very minute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware that the INDENTURED SERVANTS (Not slaves) were white. There was indeed a difference. Aittle something to do with one of the races being considered sub-human. I have zero &quot;white-guilt&quot;; yet another program intended to distract and divide the human race. I&#39;m happy to be white, but I also am not a fool and I know my history. We have conquered the planet, squandered her resources, and pushed our culture to the corners of the Earth. You are clearly three things; Intelligent, White, and a bigot. But if you can&#39;t see this then you are fatally flawed. As far as your references to the tribal origins of humanity goes; it&#39;s called evolution. We look back on those days in horror, and for good reason; they were much, much harder times. People like you would have us revisit these times? Not that it can even be avoided per se. But accepting it with such glee is disgusting. We should strive to achieve new feats, new ways of living; better living. Finally, as far as black Americans go; you shouldn&#39;t spit on their graves; they are not nihilstic; they are simply overlooked and bullied; only in recent decades have they been bamboozled into thinking that they have a chance at real equality in America. I wish they did, my best friend is black. However, in the current paradigm where people like you are in charge they sadly must take a backseat to our imperialistic whims. Fuck that. </p>

<p>the propaganda has a strong hold on you I see, right off the bat.  Excuse me, I am typing this as I read your long non-paragraphed post.</p>

<p>Ah, a bigot.  How nice.  Did you know that while it is true that we have squandered many of the earth&#39;s resources, we will never even come close to what some organisms can do.  Actually there are a lot more wild lands in the united states than ever, and so many deer in some places that they starve because they eat all the food, if anything is overpopulated these days it&#39;s wildlife.</p>

<p>Anyway, very early in the Earth&#39;s history, there was an organism, not sure exactly of the scientific name, but it was related to the &#39;red tide&#39; organisms that we have now.  A search will turn up a lot of info, I am not going to link to it or anything.  </p>

<p>Anyway, this organism pretty much exuded cyanide as a waste product, and it killed...everything.  It also &#39;polluted&#39; the environment to a degree that humans could never, ever attain.  We are just a drop in the bucket.  </p>

<p>Sure, there are some problems in some places with human overpopulation, and sure there are some chemicals released here and there in rivers and sure there are toxic waste dumps, but this is infinitesmal compared to the toxic exudations of a volcano, or the large amounts of perfectly natural radiation coming out of the ground in the LA gas leak, happening right now.  No humans required.</p>

<p>You just fall for lies, like that &#39;save the whales, we are all gonna die of pollution&#39; bullshit, and the race bullshit, and even the &#39;we look back on those days with horror&#39; bullshit.  We should look back on right now in horror, and we will someday.  Except the horrors right now are the same things you are mindlessly defending and parroting without even knowing what you are talking about.  </p>

<p>FInally, I am not spitting on anyone&#39;s grave, I am just typing the raw truth.  The prisons aren&#39;t full of blacks because our society is just scooping them up on purpose to be racist, the prisons are full of blacks because they embrace a culture of criminality and rage, and because they would rather sell drugs and play &#39;the knockout game&#39;, in the 21st century where blacks are fully integrated into our society. </p>

<p>Do you honestly think blacks had it any worse than Chinese immigrants?  They were basically enslaved, too, and forced to build the railroads.  They were even massacred and lynched on occasion.  And their kids do ok in schools, you don&#39;t see them being responsible for most of the firearm homicides out there.  </p>

<p>And all the massacre and slavery were par for the course in these cultures home countries, too, so don&#39;t be getting all excited, now.  The Chinese and Africans can be quite cruel to white visitors and residents in their lands, hatred and savagery is not inherent in whites, in spite of what was pounded into your head in school.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am finished reading your post, I have no more running commentary, so I will just end here.  Before I save this reply, I would like to note how amused I was to read</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more thing, you misunderstood the spirit behind my &quot;squandered the earth&#39;s resources&quot; comment fundamentally. Yeah, long, lonnnnng time ago things were pretty chaotic, as in, meteors, gas, volcanoes, etc but seriously, man? What does that have to do with human being cutting down half the world&#39;s trees in one century? What does that have to do with wealth disparity? Nothing. I&#39;m not arguing some kind of global warming scam pitch like you appearently think I am, I&#39;m saying that while we have this temporary paradise on earth (and it is a paradise) we should be good stewards of it and each other. We should move to eat less and/or no meat. We should plant more garden, grow organic crops, and change the way our cities are fueled. Not even for Earth, for US. We ARE Earth. That&#39;s the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You literally disgust me. Don&#39;t bother responding to this. I know I&#39;m not &quot;worthy&quot; of your glorious white privileges, because I have a black friend, but please hear me out; I&#39;m not writing in paragraphs because I am on a cellular device. So, think of this as a long, angry text. And when your done reading it, go fuck your own face. Your sweeping generalizations of African American culture are simply false. First of all, there are more Hispanic prisoners than Blacks, anyway. Black people are particularly targeted for various reasons. I don&#39;t claim to understand them all, each situation is different. However, it is clear to me that they are human beings JUST like us. You have a firm grip of the gritty reality of life here on Earth, but have absolutely no soul, at least that I can contrive. Yes, if I go to China, they&#39;ll be pretty fucking rude to me BECAUSE THEYRE ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL CHINESE. America = Melting pot. It&#39;s a different game you generalizing son of a bitch. This was an experiment. An experiment that has failed MISERABLY, because of backward thinking racists and narcissists like yourself. The experiment was to see if various cultures could come together in harmony and live together. We have, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries more or less done this, but now, with these &quot;new revelations&quot; that you have had, white people will simply have to kill all the blacks, and the Browns. Oh! And don&#39;t forget the &quot;yellows&quot;, kill them too! &quot;If we don&#39;t they&#39;ll take what&#39;s ours!&quot; Oh wait, we stole that from the Reds. Seriously, man, I&#39;m not religious but you need some kind of higher power in your life or something. Sheesh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will respond, just because you are pretty funny.  I like the &#39;fuck your own face&#39; part.  </p>

<p>I know black people more than you could ever imagine. I grew up around them.  I was babysat by them.  I stayed overnight at their house.  Matter of fact, I was one of only two white kids in my entire school.  I grew up in the ghetto, I know black people intimately.  And guess what, I ended up marrying a black woman and I have biracial kids....her in-laws and family, I hung around them for years, I even had my brother in law live with me for a year, and I know how they live.  Most of them are good people just like you or me, but they have a higher proportion of criminality and lower intellectual performance overall than whites, that is just a fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it I get it. You just simply lack the balls and/or historical knowledge to accept responsibility for generational grievances that (of course, you are not responsible for. Neither am I.) we have played into, and been a part of. In order for us to heal, we have to address the wound. If you continue to blame the victim, the victim will become rabid and may act out. I.e. Ferguson, LA riots, and blacks being the &quot;most incarcerated&quot; (seriously, bro how about some fact checking?). Here&#39;s an example. &quot;John is black. John&#39;s father was black. John&#39;s grandfather was black, and so forth. John&#39;s ancestors were black, and they were brought here via slave ship. John&#39;s parents were discrimated against via Jim Crow laws. John went to college, because white people finally realized how big of assholes they were being. John is happy. Good luck John.&quot; That&#39;s their story. I feel deeply sorry for your family, that you think of them, by default, in such a way.</p>

<p>You have shown enough immaturity in this discussion that I am not a bit surprised that you are bringing out the old &#39;generational grievance&#39; bullshit.  Everyone else got over the bad things that happened to them, except the poor, fragile blacks, eh?  I bet you also believe that affirmative action is a good idea.  I mean, since you think blacks are so fragile and broken that they need help getting a decent job, right?  They can&#39;t get over slavery and brutality yet every other society on earth, who each one has had some sort of tragedy, got over it just fine, but not blacks, eh?</p>

<p>The real racists are the ones who think blacks are so weak and helpless that they need special consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were white slaves and black slaveowners. I teach US history/gov/econ and from what I have researched, this is true. You are correct that there were indentured servants. But white slavery was a thing for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I have heard of white &quot;slaves&quot; before in college and I&#39;m aware of the conditions they faced. However, it wasn&#39;t a racial thing. They were not treated as cattle and they were regarded as a full 5/5 of a human (at least the males) rather than 3/5 of a person. As far as black slave owners go, that&#39;s a ridiculous assertion. Maybe it happened, but to suggest that it was anywhere nearly as common as white slave owning is kind of ridiculous to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the first slaveowner in America was black. <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Earihuang/academic/abg/slavery/history.html">https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~arihuang/academic/abg/slavery/history.html</a></p>

<p>Blacks as slave owners wasn&#39;t widespread as time went on but for a while, blacks could earn their freedom and own slaves and property. For a while, it was not the case that children would be sold into slavery. Being born into slavery developed over time. </p>

<p>There was a movement away from keeping whites (mostly Irish) as slaves. Too many white slaves would escape and blend in to society easily. If I remember correctly, it became a practice to keep blacks as slaves and keep their children as slaves because it was easier to differentiate the slaves from non slaves. Laws against interbreeding began, in part, as a way to ensure that the races wouldn&#39;t mingle and that slaves and non-slaves could be easily determined. </p>

<p>I could be wrong on some things but this is what I remember learning in my anthropology classes in college. Certainly that 3/5 shit and all slavery is/was ridiculous. I just think a lot of truth is obscured because it doesn&#39;t jive with the current narrative spewed by mainstream media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, and I know the guy arguing these points was right on some levels. I just feel that discounting the mental stigmata of &quot;White supremacy&quot; and acting like it never happened (it still is) is incredibly offensive and amnesiac. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You literally disgust me. Don&#39;t bother responding to this. I know I&#39;m not &quot;worthy&quot; of your glorious white privileges, because I have a black friend, but please hear me out; I&#39;m not writing in paragraphs because I am on a cellular device. So, think of this as a long, angry text. And when your done reading it, go fuck your own face. Your sweeping generalizations of African American culture are simply false. First of all, there are more Hispanic prisoners than Blacks, anyway. Black people are particularly targeted for various reasons. I don&#39;t claim to understand them all, each situation is different. However, it is clear to me that they are human beings JUST like us. You have a firm grip of the gritty reality of life here on Earth, but have absolutely no soul, at least that I can contrive. Yes, if I go to China, they&#39;ll be pretty fucking rude to me BECAUSE THEYRE ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL CHINESE. America = Melting pot. It&#39;s a different game you generalizing son of a bitch. This was an experiment. An experiment that has failed MISERABLY, because of backward thinking racists and narcissists like yourself. The experiment was to see if various cultures could come together in harmony and live together. We have, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries more or less done this, but now, with these &quot;new revelations&quot; that you have had, white people will simply have to kill all the blacks, and the Browns. Oh! And don&#39;t forget the &quot;yellows&quot;, kill them too! &quot;If we don&#39;t they&#39;ll take what&#39;s ours!&quot; Oh wait, we stole that from the Reds. Seriously, man, I&#39;m not religious but you need some kind of higher power in your life or something. Sheesh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more thing, you misunderstood the spirit behind my &quot;squandered the earth&#39;s resources&quot; comment fundamentally. Yeah, long, lonnnnng time ago things were pretty chaotic, as in, meteors, gas, volcanoes, etc but seriously, man? What does that have to do with human being cutting down half the world&#39;s trees in one century? What does that have to do with wealth disparity? Nothing. I&#39;m not arguing some kind of global warming scam pitch like you appearently think I am, I&#39;m saying that while we have this temporary paradise on earth (and it is a paradise) we should be good stewards of it and each other. We should move to eat less and/or no meat. We should plant more garden, grow organic crops, and change the way our cities are fueled. Not even for Earth, for US. We ARE Earth. That&#39;s the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said and thank you for some clarifications.  As usual I am just trying to figure out whats going on in other countries.  In the US it is so complicated. There is nothing to really get behind it seems.  People try to start movements but they lose momentum due to numerous factors.  I&#39;m a little confused by your first statement.  Maybe it came out wrong on my end.  I basically wanted to know if its a common understanding and nationalist pride among most New Zealanders that its important to work and not be lazy.  You may think that you know the unemployment numbers here in the US but those numbers are garbage.  They don&#39;t count the amount of peolple that are no longer looking for work.  Basically any news that comes out of the US should be taken with a grain of salt, but I am sure you know this already.</p>
