       It's been known for using pre-recorded music for a while now. The performers are lip synching , instruments not plugged in... Even the crowd on the field are  extras from a casting agency and are part of the choreography of the show.

       I saw some clips, here in the UK not too many people get into it the pooper bowl, but I did notice the flashing colors and sounds they deployed in this brain washing ceremony appears to turn people into homosexuals. It's amazing that just by watching something that gay it can actually turn you gay.

       Right, except for the fact that there were about 70,000 people in attendance at the game who would be witness to the fake, pre-recorded halftime show.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be a little weird if they were all there for the game, and nothing was happening on the field at halftime, don't you think?

       I don't get this either. Unless they played it on monitors for the audience? Which would be stupid... It was definitely recorded live, audio-wise, but the whole way it looks is SO strange. There was definitely a LOT of green screen happening, as someone else mentioned. It was super obvious. I don't know what was going on but whatever it was it was stupid.

       YES.  The lighting was all off - it looked like mid-afternoon, or even morning, but the "performance" was at 5:30pm local time (in the middle of winter).  On upward angles where you could see the sky it was completely white.   Then when they panned out at the end it was clearly dusk.

       This could have just been filters, but it made it look completely fake.

       There's always the chance that the halftime ON TV was prerecorded for perfection and so that no "ugly" pictures of Beyonce were released this year, WHILE an identically choreographed live performance was also occurring at the stadium. Maybe Beyonce "almost falling" was the little flub that is supposed to keep us convinced it was all live.
      </p>
      <p>
       More proof that it was faked: Notice how the kids don't first run out into the arena, they are already standing there waiting. When it shows them jogging behind Chris Martin, most of them wave at the camera or make the climax of their excited face while they are hidden behind Chris, as if they didn't know he would be kneeling there; NONE of them actually look at Chris in the process. When Chris runs up the line of people trying to give high fives, he not only misses 99% of everyone, but he doesn't even attempt to make eye contact with a single one of them.

       No one has mentioned this yet, and I'm only speculating, but since this is conspiracy I think we could consider holographic projections. They already projected Michael Jackson after his death so he could do a concert. Why not do 3 pop stars at the superbowl? Someone in this thread mentioned that Beyonce's arm go into Chris Martin's shoulder. Possible explanation. What do you guys think?

       portions were definitely prerecorded. Beyonce puts her hand on the Coldplay singer at the finale and it goes into his shoulder...

       I thought perhaps it was filmed with drones, which made it look so odd.

       I thought that too. But something about it seemed too odd. I can't place it yet, I'd have to rewatch.

       The movement on screen looked unnatural, as if it was sped up or something, and it looked very much like everyone was composited into the scene and it was all filmed in front of a green screen. There was just lots of post-production and editing and weird unrealistic camera movement, it looks like. It SOUNDED live though... I'm really confused about what was happening.
