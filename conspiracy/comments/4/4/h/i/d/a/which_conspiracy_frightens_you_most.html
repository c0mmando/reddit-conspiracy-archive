       None.  Obviously their plan works better if I was scared.  I am not.  If anything I feel empowered by the fact that I have the option to understand these things.  With a bright understanding of how the world works it gives me the chance to make an informed decision opposed to just going with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the way the world is is terrifying.
I am one person.  One person with a voice and ideas I can converse to those close to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       One person who can grow a garden, can/ferment my vegetables, learn to sew my own clothes.  Be as self efficient as I can.  One person who can take a stance to love and help and cherish those around me.  To use my intellectual power to ask questions and seek for answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, after all my research (which is very very minimal compared to some of the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       followers) I feel safer, knowing that I can make the choice to actively avoid becoming a pawn.  Where as, most people can't.  If I were to be destroyed in any sense of the word at least I know I wasn't welcoming my destruction with open arms.  Ready for a long embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I die, standing up for something I honestly believe in.  If I become stalked, at least I know that my life was lived for the better of me, my friends/neighbors, and my family.  That perhaps through the ultimate sacrifice of losing the freedom to live in a society full of hypocrisy, I choose real freedom.  By getting rid of my apathy and acceptance.  I can at least stay true to myself instead of holding my molded shape.

       Not to say I wasn't scared at one point.  All I can do at this point is remember I am only in charge of myself and make the most.  No point playing into someone's hand when they clearly have a card up their sleeve.

       That the government, along with other nations, are planning something so big the average american couldnt even fathom. Gore won the election but Bush still got to sit in the high chair. Anythings possible. Now with Trump actually doing "good" in the polld, where as in the last elections he was quickly dropped. Hillary or Trump will win, while Bernie gets the most votes. Its been proven that you can win a presidential electipn amd still not be president. The people behind the scenes call the shots. Also, the TPP, its not good for any of us poor or middle class people, but will benefit the rich more than anything else. Its scary to me that no matter what the majority of americand want, it all boils down to what the people in the highest power want with no regard for the average american. Were fucked any way you go about it. Just a matter of time. The NSA knows you and what you do, its nothing to them to get rid of you if you pose a threat to their agenda. Just my 2 cents, which cost more to make than they are actually worth.

       It is easy for the average person to discount this belief out of hand, but once you actually research a bit, the data points line up to trend in a very disturbing direction. At that point, even the   skeptics must consider the implications. This was my reaction when researching my latest novel. Some of the stuff I found gave me chills.

       I have random tidbits thats ive searched deep into, and it isnt unreasonable for the government to take out a target who they see as a threat, even if it is just info that they have that would make the government look as bad as it is. Numerous activist dying under mysterious circumstances, files being lost of redacted once theyre finally released under the FOIA, just seems like too much of a coincidence. And as far as banks go, I leave enough in my account to cover my bills, cause eventually i see the banks shutting down and saying you cant access your funds. better safe than sorry.

       Widespread child abduction, abuse, molestation, trafficking and even sacrifice by people at the highest levels who have the power to shut down and derail investigations into their wrongdoing. And then the thought that these are the people who are going to (try to) establish a fascist government rule where they will then have the power to take away our kids at will for their twisted belief system and ritual practices.

       I believe murders are disguised as satanic or sacrificial to guarantee an element of doubt if things ever became public.

       You are asking two separate questions. The one in the title, what scares me most-is David Icke's lizard people running the world conspiracy. That is scary. I don't believe it and never would, of course, but it's scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which conspiracy theory is the most plausible, is the one where the Bushes and Clintons trafficked cocaine through the Mena, Arkansas airport in the 80s. There is a good amount of evidence that this took place, and it is more than a little suspicious that Clinton did not campaign for Gore in 2000.

       Dude, hate to break it to you but the elite, military and intelligence agencies trafficked cocaine as if it were legal.  Sure they still do today. There are far scarier things than black market drug monopoly/drug war/CIA being so dirty.  That is, unless you live in Mexico.

       I am not scared by the fact that the CIA/Bushes/Clintons trafficked cocaine during the 80s. That's the one conspiracy theory that I am most sure is true. I am scared by the idea of a shape-shifting lizard ruling class, which for the record I do not think is true, but is scary as fuck.

       '.  The conspiracy of depopulation as a gambit to ensure the Elite's dominance in the New World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why: Technology from here on out will continue to replace humans in the work force.  We're not just talking about low level jobs, but doctors, educators, and even computer programmers will soon lose job security.  Without augmentation, few will be able to compete with the machines. We are facing a brave new world, and only a very few are positioned to gain from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what frightens me:  What are the Elite going to do with the rest of us? Certainly a rebellion would grow if the populace found that losing their job to a machine enriched the fortunate few. And dear God, if the Plebs ever got their hands on the technology all bets are off. The future is a very scary place if you're standing on the backs of other people.

       I've heard the numbers range from 25% - 90% total reduction. Sometime between now and 2050. The truth is, the longer they wait, the more dangerous it gets for them. Especially now that people are waking up.
