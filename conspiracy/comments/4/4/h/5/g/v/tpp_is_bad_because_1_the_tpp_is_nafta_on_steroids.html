    <div class="md"><p>A common retort to ISDS (your point #3) is that it has existed for a while under a number of bilateral trade deals, and so far we don&#39;t have any egregious examples of its use trumping national sovereignty. This is a fair point. </p>

<p>My best counterpoint to this argument is in the form of a thought experiment. Let&#39;s assume that ISDS is meant to erode national sovereignty in favor of a system which gives international corporations a distinct advantage. How would you implement such a system? You&#39;re not going to be able to get all 200+ countries to sign up for it at once, so you have to do it piecemeal with smaller agreements. </p>

<p>Okay, so you implement it in that fashion, but the number one thing you have to make sure of is that the process is not abused. If opponents can point to even one example of corporations unfairly overruling a nation&#39;s or municipality&#39;s laws, no other country is going to want to sign on to the system. But if you have the system in place for some 15 years without incident, you can use that as evidence to support your contention that the system works. </p>

<p>Tl;dr: that ISDS has not been abused is not a good argument that it will not be abused once the system is law between all nations. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I know we discussed this in another thread, yet this is not my understanding. The deal was signed a couple days ago, but it has not yet been introduced into Congress. The 90 day clock starts when the bill is introduced, not from the point when the agreement was signed. Please correct this if I&#39;m wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because out of all the papers I&#39;ve read about NAFTA, they all agree that net employment effects were negligible. Papers from the EPI, for example, look at the jobs lost in manufacturing and then conclude with &quot;NAFTA destroyed jobs&quot;, without considering that other industries saw growth. Like I said earlier, it&#39;s 100% true that some industries will lose jobs, but overall, there was little effect.</p>

<p>Okay, now it&#39;s your turn to admit I have a point, that NAFTA has negatively affected the average worker. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven&#39;t said that until now.</p>

<p>Your post references exporting jobs and my comment was regarding employment as well.</p>

<p>Regarding your first paper, it&#39;s from the EPI. As I said before, they usually only look at one side of the equation. The methodology used here is strange. Their estimate for jobs lost is based off the increase in trade deficit. They don&#39;t actually use employment data. Krugman&#39;s work in the 90s talked about how trade deficits aren&#39;t inherently bad. Increases in trade deficit are offset by increased foreign use of the US dollar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the flood of foreign investment in Mexican manufacturing, average workers have seen little of the benefits. Wages in the manufacturing sector have dropped 9.5%. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve already agreed that the manufacturing industry did not benefit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, the productivity growth that has occurred over the last decade has not translated into growth in wages. Despite predictions to the contrary, Mexican wages have not converged with U.S. wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The growth was small in wages, but it was positive.</p>

<p>See table 2 on <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18508.pdf">http://www.nber.org/papers/w18508.pdf</a></p>

<p>Real wage growth was 1.72%, .32%, and .11% for Mexico, Canada, and the US, respectively. The average worker has benefited. However, it is true that workers in the US without a high-school education have not benefited. </p>
