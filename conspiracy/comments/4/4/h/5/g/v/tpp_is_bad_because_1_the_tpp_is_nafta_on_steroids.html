       A common retort to ISDS (your point #3) is that it has existed for a while under a number of bilateral trade deals, and so far we don't have any egregious examples of its use trumping national sovereignty. This is a fair point.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best counterpoint to this argument is in the form of a thought experiment. Let's assume that ISDS is meant to erode national sovereignty in favor of a system which gives international corporations a distinct advantage. How would you implement such a system? You're not going to be able to get all 200+ countries to sign up for it at once, so you have to do it piecemeal with smaller agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so you implement it in that fashion, but the number one thing you have to make sure of is that the process is not abused. If opponents can point to even one example of corporations unfairly overruling a nation's or municipality's laws, no other country is going to want to sign on to the system. But if you have the system in place for some 15 years without incident, you can use that as evidence to support your contention that the system works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: that ISDS has not been abused is not a good argument that it will not be abused once the system is law between all nations.

       I know we discussed this in another thread, yet this is not my understanding. The deal was signed a couple days ago, but it has not yet been introduced into Congress. The 90 day clock starts when the bill is introduced, not from the point when the agreement was signed. Please correct this if I'm wrong.

       You seem unwilling to change your mind as well. I'm sure I could produce several papers backing up my conclusions and you would reject them. You are writing me off by saying I call everyone a shill, when I have done no such thing. This is an impasse. Goodbye.

       That's because out of all the papers I've read about NAFTA, they all agree that net employment effects were negligible. Papers from the EPI, for example, look at the jobs lost in manufacturing and then conclude with "NAFTA destroyed jobs", without considering that other industries saw growth. Like I said earlier, it's 100% true that some industries will lose jobs, but overall, there was little effect.

       Your post references exporting jobs and my comment was regarding employment as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding your first paper, it's from the EPI. As I said before, they usually only look at one side of the equation. The methodology used here is strange. Their estimate for jobs lost is based off the increase in trade deficit. They don't actually use employment data. Krugman's work in the 90s talked about how trade deficits aren't inherently bad. Increases in trade deficit are offset by increased foreign use of the US dollar.

       The growth was small in wages, but it was positive.

       Real wage growth was 1.72%, .32%, and .11% for Mexico, Canada, and the US, respectively. The average worker has benefited. However, it is true that workers in the US without a high-school education have not benefited.

       What was inflation in those same time periods? If it's higher than those wage raises, then it's a net loss. And it's clear that corporate income is increasing while real wages have been stagnant for several decades in the US

       People don't understand that international tribunals have been a part of lots of trade agreements for many years already. TPP isn't new in that aspect.

       This whole sub seems to be swallowing the old idea that trade protectionism saves jobs and protects people. This is the farthest thing from the truth. Protectionism allows companies to extract artificial profits while the rest of the world continues competing and getting lower priced goods and saving money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TPP spreads rules on innovation that greatly support the USA. That country has proven to be one of the most innovative in the world and increasing protection for that will provide great resources for the US.

       The TPP's ISDS rules also reflect issues that have arisen from past agreements. Like how it specifically protects legislation against tobacco for public health reasons.

       You shouldn't. Instead you're supporting a lack of protectionism, which is corporate welfare for
       <em>
        international

       companies, which is almost all of them.

       You make no sense. I shouldn't support protectionism for domestic companies, but it's also bad to support no protectionism. You're contradicting yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, lack of protectionism is not corporate welfare for international companies. Welfare is either a transfer of money or regulatory barriers put up to support a company. A lack of regulatory barriers is not welfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       And provide some evidence that "almost all of them" are international.

       It's the corporations trying to help themselves, and take an even bigger crap on the working class. NAFTA already cost us millions of jobs. Don't expect us to be dumb enough to buy the free trade is great for everyone lie again. It's the Corporations pouting that outsourcing their products to third world manufacturing results in a lot of piracy of their stuff. So they want to try to make it harder for pirates, and easier to keep outsourcing. That's all.
