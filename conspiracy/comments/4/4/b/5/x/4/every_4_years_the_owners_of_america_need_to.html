      </p>
      <p>
       They know that we're cynical and they try to appeal to that (like the Snowden psy-op). Every tiny new detail of every minor scandal is another chance to get their candidate more publicity, to distract us with more circus politics. And, despite the presence of vote-brigades, there are still too many people here supporting and believing in this nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The greater point here is that none of these candidates matter, at all. None of them will audit or nationalize or dismantle the Federal Reserve. None of them will stop the empire building through covert war with the CIA, whose arsenal now includes torture, drones, and the knowledge that they are above the law. Even if we reach a point where the candidates are promising to do these things (instead of never once mentioning them), a competent review of history will prove that there is no expectation for them to keep any promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       And perhaps most telling of all, none of these candidates will ever dare to do anything but bow and scrape before Israel.

       While high priest of slack is right, I believe people understand that you still have to vote symbolically, otherwise a non-vote is a symbolic approval of the other side, or approval for the establishment to consider your nonparticipation as consent in continual wrongdoing.  Voting for something funny as a means to defy the establishment, such as voting for 'nobody' or 'money' or 'F  the police' doesn't help the situation either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should go out, vote for who you think is best, dont play into the poiltics game and instead invest your time in a victory garden and try to support 100% of your food on your land for the inevitable collapse.  Also, learn foraging and wildcrafting and bushcraft skills in case the assholes with the guns take over your garden. Set up traps to kill / eat them.

       yeah he died shortly after but he was 88 so it is not too suspicious, if he really had those thoughts he could have said something in the 30 or so years earlier he was a senator

       Politics are exactly like professional wrestling, you have your bad guys, your good guys, your epic fueds and matches (sometimes end in DQ/cheating/whatever and business just keeps going like its just a thing that happens).
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all getting worked and politics is a big part of it. Regardless of what people think, this kind of government is not necessary and is more damning to the people then anything else we've created.

       Nowhere does OP imply those are the only things. Why do you think pointing out the most critical things to change is naive?  Yes the POTUS makes a ton of decisions day in and day out, but the White House is bugged.  When it comes to the decisions that really matter, their "decisions" have already been made, and that's the point.

       Some alternate theories about Bernie (not mutually-exclusive):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The establishment does not want him to become president with a passion.  It's because of his anti-establishment policies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The establishment can tolerate him as president since he's already in bed with them, but they prefer Hilary since she's a bigger ass-licker.  With Bernie as president, they would have to acknowledge at least some of Bernie's campaign promises, which takes time, instead of hitting the ground running with a yes-man like Hillary as president.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The establishment wants Bernie to become president.  They create a narrative where Bernie has to fight back against corruption so that people root for him.  With him elected despite things going against him like voting fraud, corruption, and other obstacles, the electorate celebrates their win and feels that they won their country back from the corporations.

       I want to be wrong but I believe 3 is probably most accurate. Having supported Ron Paul and watching how easy it was for them to just deny him any publicity.... Even tampering with votes, etc....if they didn't want us to know and like Bernie, we wouldn't.

       No. 3 is my pick as well. Government has a pulse on what people are thinking. They control the population with media thus programming the people to believe and think. They also listen to your phone calls and digital information to check the pulse of the population. Spying on its own population has nothing nothing to do with catching a bad guy.

       I think it started at number 2, but they adjusted their game plan and went for number 3 instead.

       I think Bernie was supposed to be a straw man candidate, but when he became popular the establishment switched gears.

       We all asked for nothing, we all fight over nothing. What you get in return is nothing. No one has a clear goal. Not entirely our fault, but dang shit just gets crazier every day. Try to stay grounded, the light is being shed on a lot of darkness. Stay humble and rooted. Even the rockiest of storms eventually blow over.

       I partially agree with this, but I think a distinction needs to be made for Sanders which justifies the pro-sanders shilling. Those of us on this forum that understand the true nature of the shadow govt, banking cartels, etc. Can appreciate the uniqueness of his campaign. He is the only non-millionaire in the election (and the only candidate in my lifetime for which that is the case). He has taken no super PAC, no wall-street money, and basically focuses his campaign on reforming the financial industry. Every other candidate in my lifetime has entered the election with a major scandal which links them to the shadow cabal besides Sanders. His only black mark is being arrested for fighting for desegregation. Coming from someone who has great skepticism and cynicism about the powers that be, I can confidently state that he is the first trustworthy candidate in my lifetime (which is the reason I am going to vote for the first time in my life).
      </p>
      <p>
       You can claim he's just another puppet but if you look at the facts, both his words and his actions tell a very different story.

       That could all be true but what needs to be realized is once they are in the leader roll outside forces beyond the persons control will influence his factors after being elected.

       We always have to remember that the system is not in favor of the public but in favor of big businesses controlling all the resources on this planet.

       Fair, but I would say that his attempts to cull corporate hegemony through policy change is one of the few realistic avunes we have to affect any sort of change in the real world.
Unfortunately, most of america will never get on board with "conspiracies" and will not awake to the reality of how our government operates. 
More importantly however, if he is elected against the other candidates who have massive corporate funding, it means that there are enough people here that are starting to wake up and get involved politically. This may seem insignificant given those "other factors" which you referred to, but consider the exponential curve. Generally, generations are segregated to possess a unique political ideology, but within generations, that ideology is consistent. Thus, the "millennials" are the largest voting population in history, and appear to share mistrust for our corporate-govt complex. If elected, it means that most young people in this country share his political aspirations. As this generation ages and becomes the influencers of society, new officials will be elected that will more closely reflect a Sanders ideology. Change will not happen overnight, but to say that as president he would be helpless to affect real change is not true, and quite defeatist. Even if he accomplishes 10% of what he claims, that's still momentum in the right direction, and that's certainly something worth supporting. Nothing will ever repair this country overnight, and we may be an empire already beyond saving, but not to try would just be foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most amazing parts of Americans history have all come from overcoming what seemed as insurmountable odds...nothing he is proposing is out of reach if he attains the support of people. As much as our government is a sham, it is still a working government, and votes still count. Most of the evil actions of our government (such as corporate control) are a direct result of political apathy. These things can change only when people start getting involved.  Someone like Sanders has the potential to kick start and inspire an entire generation to pay attention to their politicians instead of advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just an anecdotal case from my life:
In Texas, pediatricians tried to pass a bill that would allow expanded access of vaccines to poor kids. This bill had widespread support until the vaccine-autism scare started. Regardless of our opinions on that subject, the point is that 94 peopled called their congressman in one day and got the bill shutdown(a bill which on its face does nothing but help poor, sick kids). The point of this is that, while money can buy elections, votes are the ultimate decider. No amount of cash can replace real votes, and politicians know this.  When young people start getting involved, calling congress, and making their opinions known; political decisions will begin to shift towards our communal desires...our democratic system can work if we learn to use it properly (or at all).

       Yeah, that’s not even remotely accurate and it completely ignores the fact that the USSR retained an ever-growing military force (again, for the purpose of oppression and genocide of its own peoples) long after WWII. Oh, and China, but you don’t care about that. And Cuba. And Vietnam. And North Korea.

       to be fair though, top links in r/conspiracy aren't a reaction from the sub base, but from the larger reddit base.  Many of the primary conspiracy theoris this sub focuses on, like 9/11, will never be contributors to top posts.

       No, but it was socialism that gave us bailouts. There is no "too big to fail" in capitalism. In capitalism, you make it or you don't. Instead, the STATE (which bernie wants to expand) SOCIALIZED the losses.

       I think you are confusing corporate welfare with socialism. Rampant capitalism uncontrolled by the government caused the collapse. If the bailout was socialism or communism, as this cartoon implies, the president would have removed the bank executives and appointed his own, and given more power to the workers. The banks and corporations have too much power because the government doesnt have enough power. Socialism would have bailed out the people, not the banks.

Just the hard core nationalistic low percentage votes and then all the rest of you whine and say "see? nothing we do matters!!!" while millions upon millions stand on the sidelines, beating your chests and furiously pounding your keyboard.

       Based on population and how many votes those states get. Popular vote still doesnt count because you can still have the majority of the votes nation wide, but you didn't win the states with the large amount of electoral votes. You can argue that the broken system works and isnt rigged. You're delusional and suffer from cognitive dissonance if that's your position. Our whole government and economy needs to be scraped and rebuilt. It's all a farce and you know it.

       All of this is true. None of it applies to what you said. The government does not need to be scrapped. The economy does not need to be scrapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things, that you said? They are ILLEGAL. They are UNCONSTITUTIONAL. They 100% need to be scrapped. Destroy the Federal Reserve. Execute everyone responsible for it. End the income tax. Return to the silver standard. Make usury illegal. Yes. Do all these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has no bearing on the government and the economy. The LEGAL government and the LEGAL economy. This must be stressed. It is not the fault of the Constitution that the world is the way that it is. So when the guns finally come out and the ropes are finally knotted, PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR SYSTEM ARE GOOD. Removal FROM them is the problem, not implementation of them.

       Our Constitution was hijacked in 1871. It's a corporate constitution for a corporation. Until we get rid of it, and go back to the original constitution, everything that you said is illegal, is actually legal. And our current form of government needs to be scrapped because it's not a republic. And an economic model that's based off fiat currency, constant consumption and usury needs to be scrapped. AND.....our Constitution is to blame for the way the world is. We've allowed a ruling class of people to amend it to no end for personal profit and the destruction of our freedoms. It's allowed presidents to declare war without the consent of the people. Scrap it. Tear it down. Get rid of it. People need to understand that we are all sovereign, and a governments power is only achieved through the consent of the sovereign. As it stands right now, we're "citizens" not sovereigns. Huge difference.

       IT LITERALLY DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.

       You don’t have the first fucking clue what you’re talking about, you don’t even know what the Constitution is, and I’ll be damned if people like you are allowed to destroy the one thing remaining in this country that makes it work. There’ll be a bullet between
       <em>
        your

       eyes when this is all said and done, not mine.

       Get medical help immediately. At least I now understand why you don’t comprehend the constitution; you think “sovereign citizen” is an actual thing.

       All of this is true. None of it applies to what you said. The government does not need to be scrapped. The economy does not need to be scrapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things, that you said? They are ILLEGAL. They are UNCONSTITUTIONAL. They 100% need to be scrapped. Destroy the Federal Reserve. Execute everyone responsible for it. End the income tax. Return to the silver standard. Make usury illegal. Yes. Do all these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has no bearing on the government and the economy. The LEGAL government and the LEGAL economy. This must be stressed. It is not the fault of the Constitution that the world is the way that it is. So when the guns finally come out and the ropes are finally knotted, PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR SYSTEM ARE GOOD. Removal FROM them is the problem, not implementation of them.
