       Hey everyone,
      </p>
      <p>
       This might not be the best place for this, but there are many posts in this sub about the lack of police accountability that I thought this perhaps might be useful for some users. If not I will remove the post. Ever watch a video on this sub where a cop arrests someone for a charge that seems like total abuse of power? Or read an article where a cop made a "lawful demand" for someone to stop recording? How about when a cop demands to see I.D and you are not sure if your state is a Stop and Identify state? Ever been curious about the legality of situations like these? Well, I've been researching a ton of case, federal and state laws for the past 7 months and I've been linking everything I've come across in a Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when we see a cop say: "It's illegal to film me". Well
       <a href="https://np.www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/filmingpolice">
        here are case laws that supports filming police
       </a>
       . If you are curious what
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/obstruction_of_justice">
        Obstruction of Justice
       </a>
       is, or the laws about
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/checkpoints">
        Checkpoints
       </a>
       or
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/trafficstops">
        Traffic Stops
       </a>
       . I've been putting all these laws into
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index">
        one central location
       </a>
       that's easy to digest and find.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a cop in Arizona says they will arrest someone for
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/disorderly_conduct">
        Disorderly Conduct
       </a>
       and you want to know
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/arizona">
        Arizona's criminal code
       </a>
       for disorderly conduct. Or if
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/vermont">
        Vermont
       </a>
       has a stop and identify law and what it says. If a NM cop threatens trespassing and you want to know what's
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/new_mexico">
        New Mexico's
       </a>
       trespassing laws are. I have all
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/statelist">
        50 states
       </a>
       with their criminal codes linked and all the common charges police love to threaten or arrest people for also linked. I also have laws on
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/stopandidentify">
        Stop and Identify
       </a>
       and case law helps qualify when police have RAS or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have plans on making this Wiki massive. From from case law dealing with police encounters, to how to conduct effective 1st amendment tests or laws surrounding using a drones.

       great work from what I seen it works great, maybe add some brief description on where to find some of the info when you direct to page with full codes(laws) on it. Like the DC present and ID law took em a moment to find it at the bottom of the page, but honestly this is a great and very well done resource. Thanks OP.  Have Hypothetical GOLD cause fuck paying reddit to say"good post" for me.

       DC isn't completed yet. Which is why it's like that. It's mentioned
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/comments/43pdmo/welcome_please_take_a_moment_to_read_this_post/">
        here
       </a>
       under "Working on right now". Most states like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/wisconsin">
        Wisconsin
       </a>
       link directly to the specific law. However some states have HORRID webistes and don't allow linking to the specific code. So with
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RightToRemainSilent/wiki/index/south_carolina">
        South Carolina
       </a>
       I made sure to write down the code next to the law, so someone can find it when they navigate to the link. Thanks for the GOLD!

       If they do, you should look into it. I ask, because it looks like you already put a lot of work into this. If you'd like development/technical advice to help getting started with a site, let me know. I'm a web developer.

       No problem. I don't really have time lend coding/development, but if you have questions about hosting, buying a domain name, and software, I can point you in the right direction.

       I forgot to ask, do you plan on incorporating company pages into it? For example, if someone owned a small farm that grew organic a or something, would they be able to make a different kind of page specifically for representing the business?

       Looks great dude.

       Quick question: could you make a Canadian version of this as well? The Criminal Code of Canada is quite hard to follow and has very few solid definitions of what constitutes as a crime (most definitions are grey and let the officer decide whats wrong and right) and we only sort of have free speech in the form of "freedom of expression".
      </p>

       I've only had a few encounters with police but 4 out of 5 have been negative and would like to stone wall them next time I get hauled over.

       Should people use this to harass police officers? Looking at your examples, mostly I just see people who start arguing with the police and triggering the "be treated like a dick because you're being a dick" policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The side of the road is not a courtroom, so if these idiot roadside lawyers want to try to turn it into one the cops are going to be glad to send you to someone who gets paid to engage in legal arguments.

       No one said anything about harassing anyone. And who cares if people are arguing with police? Why doesn't that even matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me get this straight. You are suggesting people shouldn't be educated on case laws while encountering police on the street simply because it's not a courtroom? You do realize people DO NOT have to be lawyers to understand law right?

       I'm not suggesting any of what you said. Don't get hysterical with the creating strawmen out of my words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at, for instance, the obstruction of justice video examples you posted: those people are total dumbasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that people don't have to be lawyers to understand the law. But if you're going to start arguing with a cop about the constitutionality of a checkpoint, you can think you're right all you want but don't be surprised when the cops don't change their minds. If you're so darn right, then obviously the court will agree with you.

       Not hysterical. I'm trying to understand your point of view. Truly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watch those videos and don't think they are dumbasses, but even if they were. It's not illegal. Plus, police are supposed to be the professionals they should be able to handle a dumbass without arresting them on some charge they KNOW won't stick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is important to challenge law enforcement and be educated on what the law actually is. You mentioned checkpoints and many people don't understand that they are seized at these checkpoints and think police need reasonable suspicion of a crime (Like a Terry Stop) to justify the checkpoint detention and it's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are very confused on what the law actually says. I swear if I watch one more video of some guy refusing to get out of the car during the traffic stop because (it's their right) I'm going to lose my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you have good points, but the Wiki is more about the legalities of the situation, not common social cues. It might not be practical for a guy to video a cop and start name calling, but that doesn't give that same cop the authority to infringe on rights because police lack measurable accountability

       Here's my point of view. If someone wants to run into a brick wall they can feel free. I also think the wall, being a professional, should be able to tell which people are harmless and which people are dangerous idiots and in the case where they are harmless, the wall should be less wall-like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, what your going to see is someone running into a wall. And they're probably a dumbass.

      <p>
       This whole "Am I free to go" crap is too much Jefferson and too little Locke (you know, the guy who Jefferson lifted all his prose from). We concede some power to the state, and the executive branch is the part that has to apply some force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't worry about having drugs in my car or being breathalized because I don't do drugs and I don't drive drunk. It's part of being in a civil society. there are lots of people less civil than I am. Some are harmless and some are dangerous. I don't see any reason to send messages to the cops that I'm more trouble than I actually am.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that some cops are truly power hungry bullies. I love it when they get whats coming to them. But I'm not going to button push one of these guys into arresting me or beating me up. And I think people that do are dumbasses.

       I disagree with your opinion on Am I Free to go. It's not a sovereign citizen thing. (that's what I thought you were hinting at)
      </p>
      <p>
       I DO agree that some people are intentionally pushing buttons with police, however, I think a lot of it is warranted. Police lack meaningful accountability and some people are pissed. I disagree with their methods since it's counter productive in my eyes, but who am I to tell them not to? If they follow the law then I don't care if they are the biggest asshole in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       To bring it back, those videos are just examples of how police can use "catch all" type charges to violate a persons rights. Doesn't matter if the person is a dumbass or not. My Wiki mostly consists of direct links to specific law on a federal or state level. I think that info hold value and is important for people to have. I just wanted a central place for it all.

       Which is unacceptable. Almost every other line of work uses 'secret shoppers' and the like to hold employees accountable. I see no reason the same shouldn't happen with police.
