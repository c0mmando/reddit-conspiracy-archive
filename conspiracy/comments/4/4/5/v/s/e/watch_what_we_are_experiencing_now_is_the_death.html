<p>Educate yourselves</p>

<p>The purpose of the ESF (Exchange Stabilization Fund) is to defend the integrity of the dollar to be the currency used in international trade. The ESF was put above any oversight so it doesn&#39;t answer to Congress and was given the ability in the name of national security to operate above all laws foreign &amp; domestic. With that said they&#39;ve been involved with regime change, narcotics trafficking, murder for hire, arms running, etc...and they answer to nobody. Under U.S. law they&#39;re not held responsible for their actions (This is explained at 8:34 within the video).</p>

<p>Eric DeCarbonnel created a 5 part YouTube exposé on the ESF who disappeared a couple months after he released it, nobody knows where he is. Proof of this? Well there&#39;s not much out there but it was said he went missing 6 months after releasing the exposé and the last thing he put on his website was 6 months after uploading the last exposé video. </p>

<p>His website is still up and running where he has a blog including the links to his exposé. <a href="http://www.marketskeptics.com/2011/06/the-esf-and-its-history.html">http://www.marketskeptics.com/2011/06/the-esf-and-its-history.html</a></p>

<p>This is very important information that needs to be shared! I also recommend downloading all of these videos in case they&#39;re ever taken down so that we can reupload the truth and spread awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, eye-opening.</p>

<p>Too bad they&#39;re working behind the scenes to censor and effectively neuter the internet. The technological revolution is allowing people to come together and share information like they never could in the past. You get more of an education by watching stuff like this than any class you&#39;ll attend in college.</p>
