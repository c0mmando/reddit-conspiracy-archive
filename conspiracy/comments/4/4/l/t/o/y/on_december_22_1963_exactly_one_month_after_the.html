       "I think it has become necessary to take another look at the purpose and operations of our Central Intelligence Agency—CIA. At least, I would like to submit here the original reason why I thought it necessary to organize this Agency during my Administration, what I expected it to do and how it was to operate as an arm of the President.
...
For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas. I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Some of the complications and embarrassment I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigue—and a subject for cold war enemy propaganda.
...
But there are now some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President, and that whatever else it can properly perform in that special field—and that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere. We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.”

       Interesting commentary on this letter
       <a href="http://grassyknoll.us/John_F_Kennedy/Trumans_Warning">
        here
       </a>
       . The letter only appeared in the early edition of that day's Post and was never picked up or written about anywhere else.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If we could know to absolute certainty — as clearly we cannot — that Truman had no hidden agenda in mind when writing his article, it still would stand as a statement of the first order of importance by any objective measure. But the timing of the article makes it potentially even more crucial and explosive, for it implicitly suggests that Truman may have been also warning us, as subtly as he dared under the circumstances, consistent with his view of the public interest, that elements of the CIA may have had a hand in the assassination. Consider: Truman’s article appeared on December 22, just thirty days after JFK’s murder. The country was still reeling in shock. Rumors were rampant about possible conspiracies, foreign and domestic. Truman was not a reckless or irresponsible man. It would at least border on irresponsibility for him to release his article for publication so soon after Kennedy’s death unless he was trying to warn the public, implicitly and obliquely, since it must surely have occurred to him that his words might be misconstrued to mean just that.

       I just learned that!  The CIA succeeded in removing Truman's letter from later editions.

       In other words,   when the nation needs to conduct secret international operations,   there could be elected officials and military forces do it,  not a rogue agency set up for plausible deniability.    In practice,  it would take a congressional committee rather than the full congress.   Or else how would you maintain secrecy where necessary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Information gathering in an intelligence agency can and is done in secret.    Its when you have "operations"  that the secrecy becomes more and more dubious.    And likely to be over used,   and worse,   abused.    So,  Truman wanted to eliminate operations from CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets be honest,   as long as our government is for sale to the highest bidder,  it is not going to represent the interests of the nation.     And the people who buy it now are not going to let go easily.

       Agreeing with you here. There was at the time a broad awareness already that the unique existence of twin roles by the (rogue) CIA (1. collect info 2. act on that info) was a problem (Truman said - the twin roles lead to an independent policy by the CIA) and it was probably a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he was saying was already widely believed.

       I'm actually the first person to deny any attempted justification for the CIA, but if people who are suppoaed to carry out secret operations are elected, then they're not secret atleast and can be targeted.

       The operations side (those who carry out operations) is either set up as now,   with too much independence and accountable to who?,   or its is set up to answer to elected officials,  even if only a small selected committee of congress people.    I never suggested elected officials carry out operations.   Most agencies report first to the executive branch,   so also should theoretically be subject to legal challenges through the courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is only relevant if the intelligence gathering and operations sides all work together.    In the US,   it seems like we almost do not want our institutions to work,   or that they are being played by particular egos who each  have their own fiefdoms within the bureaucracies.    Seriously,   we are talking about almost a dozen intelligence agencies with over 100,000 people.     Its nuts.

       The “former” CIA director was so determined to control the JFK death story spin, as Talbot chronicles below, that he even tried to strong-arm former president Harry Truman when the plain-spoken Missourian broadly hinted that he suspected the Agency was involved in Kennedy’s murder.

       Yes!  Allen Dulles, "former" (cough) CIA director flew to Independence, MO to pressure Truman into recanting.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Former CIA director Allen Dulles tried and failed to change Truman’s story
Four months later, former CIA director Allen Dulles paid Truman a visit. Dulles tried to get Truman to retract what he had written in the Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No dice, said Truman,” according to McGovern/Marcus.
      </p>
      <p>
       But four days later, in a formal memo for Lawrence Houston, the CIA’s general counsel, Dulles fabricated a retraction. He claimed that Truman told him the Washington Post article was “all wrong,” and that Truman “seemed quite astounded at it.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Truman denied it. In a June 10, 1964, letter to Look magazine, Truman restated his critique of covert action, emphasizing that he never intended the CIA to get involved in “strange activities.”
      </p>
      <p>
       As the country grieved JFK’s death and suspicions of conspiracy mounted, many current and former U.S. officials publicly rallied around the official story that Oswald had killed JFK alone and unaided. But privately many people familiar with the workings of the CIA had their doubts. Truman’s article was one of the earliest expression of those doubts. Others would follow."

       If something were to happen to him after election, that would be the final straw to ignite all the stress and incredible resentment and frustration this country has been under.  People have contempt for any group opposite them in the political spectrum.  There is so much insulting and sneering going on.  People don't forget that.

       He was Grand Master of Masons in Missouri, as each state's Grand Lodge is autonomous. I was just poking fun at the sorts of posters here who are always insisting that everything Freemasons do is somehow aimed at nefariousness.

       The praetorian guard conspiracy that posits the CIA is a rogue element setting its own agenda and deciding policy and removing anyone who dissents is a myth. A comforting myth. Its nice to think everything is hunky dory except for subversive outside force taking over everything. And that if it didnt exist nothing would be going wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the writings of former case officers and critics like Philip Agee and Ralph McGehee, look at how in the Bush administration the CIA was forced by Rumsfeld and Cheney to cook its findings and then when that wasnt good enough sidelined as they tried to run intelligence through the Pentagon. If they're secretly in charge why are they being run roughshod over?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the rogue CIA in the 20s and 30s overthrowing Central American governments? Invading the Philippines? Or in the 19th century overthrowing Hawaiis monarchy and massacring the Indians?

       Yes that's the point. In the 1910s and 1920s and 1930s the USA was going around Central America installing friendly dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1899 the USA invaded the Philippines, killed about a million people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 19th century it carried out a policy of extermination of the indigenous population of the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there was no rogue CIA hijacking policy while all this went on.

       I think he knows that, but is saying that they weren't around when the U.S. was pulling off their stunts in the Philippines and Central America. Of course, we all know that the U.S. has been a troublemaker and has interfered with sovereign states well before the establishment of the CIA, but for whatever reason he wants to downplay the role of the CIA since it was established in 1947. Oddly, he mentions Philip Agee, but Agee was a fierce critic of the CIA.

       I'm not downplaying the role. I'm saying it is not rogue. I'm saying its a convenient excuse to pass the blame off onto a rogue agency. Agee and McGehee both former case officers and both critics state it takes its orders from the executive

       But the Executive Branch has been captured, and the National Security Act of 1947 has made it easier for the interests who are actually in control to use the CIA to further their own interests. If you believe LHO killed JFK, then you believe the integrity of that branch of government is in tact. I personally believe a coup took place in '63, and the CIA was used to carry out the assassination of JFK. It's not to say that the entire agency is compromised. Just a good chunk of it.

       The executive represents the power elites and always has and nothing has hasnt been captured because you don't capture what you already control.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a coup took place, what changed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kennedy ramped up South Vietnam involvement. 'Military advisors', 'strategic hamlets', and American jets in Vietnamese markings bombing and spraying defoliants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Began a terrorist war against Cuba. Tried to invade it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the president of the Congo assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authorised the FBIs cointelpro to go after the civil rights movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Began the era of national security police states in South America.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a whole myth about how wonderful Kennedy was and was going to change whatever it is the person you speak to didnt like and was taken down by what they're the most paranoid about. He was killed by the CIA. He was killed by the federal reserve. He was killed by the NSC. The masons. The illuminati. The church. So many different claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is Kennedy was a bum. Do you know how much he beat Nixon by? 100,000 votes. That's not even a fraction of a percent, thats a rounding error. And they came at the last second. From Chicago. Home of Mayor Daley and some of Papa Joes Italian business associates...
      </p>
      <p>
       His was the first media campaign in which image trumped facts. In the first ever televised debate between him and Nixon a very curious thing happened. People who watched though Kennedy won. People who listened on the radio thought Nixon won. Why the difference? Kennedy was well made up, his hair coifed, wore his back brace, a fresh pressed suit. Looked a million bucks. Nixon was his typical frumpy self, 5 o'clock shadow, had worn his suit all day and it was rumpled and had sweat in the pits from the harsh studio lights. People watching were deluded by the image Kennedy projected. People listening were able to actually think about what they said.
      </p>
      <p>
       He appointed racist segregationist Dixicrats across the South he was no friend of the civil rights movement, he could have ended the Cuban missile crisis by accepting the Soviets offer to withdraw the Jupiter missiles from Turkey in exchange for withdrawal of missiles from Cuba and this would have been the easiest thing in the world with no net loss because what the Soviets didnt know was that the Jupiters were obsolete and were going to be replaced in a few months with much more lethal SSBNs and despite this he refused the offer because the Imperial authority of the state to place missiles on another countries border couldn't be allowed to be challenged so in his macho hubris brought the country and the world to brink of nuclear annihilation. The man was at the extreme hawkish end of the spectrum he was not a dove looking to pull out of Vietnam and end wars, this myth is constructed by people in his administration who want to distance themselves from the disaster it came to be seen as.

       It's not what has or hasn't changed, it's what wasn't stopped. The National Security Act (NSA) of 1947 was a phase in a coup that was probably solidified after the assassination of JFK. Truman, the former President who signed the Act, is telling us in a letter published in the WAPO one month after JFK was murdered, and 16 years after he signed it, that he has misgivings and is concerned about the CIA. Not to mention that 14 years after it was signed we got our first warning from President Eisenhower in his famous farewell speech:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But you know the speech well I'm sure. And this from a General, a guy who knows the racket well. The next POTUS after Eisenhower is assassinated, and despite the usual claims from those who defend the official story, JFK was very much at odds with the military and intelligence establishment. There is hardly any question at all that the CIA and The Joint Chiefs were very much at odds with JFK. On top of it, he had back-channel communications with Khrushchev and Castro and was trying to scale back American "military advisors" in Vietnam, not escalate, despite claims to the contrary.

       Well this simply isn't true. If it were, the JCS and the CIA would have loved him, and he them. I'd say more but having a lot of difficulty with a half-broken spacebar key that's making writing this very difficult and frustrating,

       Was to ostensibly create an intelligence gathering apparatus for the government to know what's going on around the world to make accurate policy decisions. There are instances where it has done legitimate intelligence gathering work, Taskforce 157 and Project Aurora come to mind. However what then immediately happened and what has been its bread and butter ever since is the executive directed it to begin covert operations like strike breaking of the anti-fascist organisations in France and Italy to ensure they lost post war elections (and to do this they employed mobsters and ex-SS like Klaus Barbie and funded them by re opening the french connection) and arming the monarchists in Greece which arguably started the Cold War. This was 1947. This was Trumans actions, Truman who lasted questioned it. Funny that.

       And again: what changed? Normally when this occurs there is a dramatic shift. Mobutu gets assassinated and goodbye nationalism in the Congo and hello decades of conflict. Allende gets assassinated and goodbye social democratic reforms and hello 17 years of military junta and neoliberal economics. Kennedy gets assassinated and...? Nothing changes.

       You'll notice that Eisenhower is concerned at the end of his presidency, he's not concerned at the start when he's overthrowing the governments of Guatemala and Iran and helping Chiang Kai Shek set up a secret army in Indochina to mount raids into communist China or sending Marines into Costa Rica or aiding numerous friendly dictators around the world or directing the FBI to begin its cointelpro program of disruption and subversion against the communist party of the USA a legally recognised and law abiding political party.

       More Arthur Schlesinger mythology. The record clearly shows his intent was to only remove troops once they had victory which is of course when you remove troops. He expanded the Vietnam involvement. Under Eisenhower it was just another support for a friendly dictator. Kennedy sent in troops. Kennedy began bombing. That's not scaling back that's escalating.

       Any conflict he had with the CIA was probably over the bay of pigs not succeeding. And what was his response to that? Operation Mongoose. A terrorist war against Cuba. Is that someone having back channel discussions and wanting peace?

       Nothing has changed the scope is just now international. Before that the violence was confined to the Western Hemisphere and before that to the Americas itself. What goes on in the Middle East and the rest of the world is just a bigger version of what the Indians went through.
