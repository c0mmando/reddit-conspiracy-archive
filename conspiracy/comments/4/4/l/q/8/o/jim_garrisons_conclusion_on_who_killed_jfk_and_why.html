       New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is the only law enforcement official who tried to bring President Kennedy’s actual murderers to justice after the 1963 coup.  His efforts, which began in 1966, were documented by his books:  “A Heritage of Stone,” and “On the Trail of the Assassins:  One Man's Quest to Solve the Murder of President Kennedy,” on which Oliver Stone based his movie “JFK” (along with Jim Marrs’ book “Crossfire”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout his investigation and trial Garrison was infiltrated and sabotaged by the CIA, which was determined to hide their role in the assassination.  The CIA waged a propaganda campaign to destroy Garrison and squelch his efforts to obtain justice for President Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Garrison attempted to alert the American public to the crimes against their president and country, and fight back against the propaganda onslaught, by appearing on television.  In these appearances Garrison was very clear about who killed President Kennedy and why.  Here is a summary of his conclusions.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The Jim Garrison Tapes interview with John Barbour
      </p>
      <p>
       -John F. Kennedy was killed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       -LBJ changed US foreign policy for Vietnam within 72 hours.  In fact after JFK’s eulogy he met with Chiefs of Staff to tell them he was changing Vietnam policy by sending combat troops in.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Steve Allen--1971:
      </p>
      <p>
       -When asked if the CIA killed John Kennedy Garrison responds “Of course.”
      </p>
      <p>
       -Garrison states that JFK was killed for his refusal to send combat troops to Vietnam, a policy that was reversed by LBJ 48 hours after JFK’s murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Garrison points out that the media lies about JFK’s Vietnam policy to mislead the public.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Johnny Carson--January 31, 1968:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Garrison repeatedly warns listeners “Your government is covering up.”
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Fairness Doctrine Reply:
      </p>
      <p>
       -President Kennedy was murdered by men who sought a radical change in our foreign policy, particularly with regard to Cuba, which JFK did not regard as an enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The plot was directed by men from the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The most powerful news agencies in the country have worked hard to convince you that everything is alright.

       Well, this is an explanation on the vague side. I've seen many people attempt to explain who or what killed JFK. The best explanation and most detailed research that actually put everything into account while forming up the hypothesis was featured in the documentary called "Everything is a Rich Man's Trick" (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       I wholeheartedly recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested. It is long (3.5 hours) but it is thorough.

       I know Jim Garrison, when pushed, chose to indict Clay Shaw. I believe he knew Clay Shaw would be his legacy, what he was remembered for, the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder why he chose Clay Shaw. I feel he must have known something that has never come to light.

       Yes, Garrison knew that Clay Shaw was Oswald's CIA handler in New Orleans.  David Ferrie was also a frequent presence but his role was to fly a plane out of Dallas with some of the plotters after the assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Garrison's two books "On the Trail of the Assassins" (about the investigation) and "and David Ferrie were "Heritage of Stone" (about the trial) are highly recommended.

       Garrison could have revealed how he knew for sure. He certainly doesn't in 'On the Trail'. I haven't read Heritage of Stone.

       Try watching the statement he made directly to the US public, thanks to the now defunct Fairness Doctrine, 
on July 15, 1967.  The Fairness Doctrine legally forced NBC to yield time to Garrison to respond to the “NBC White Paper,” a program attacking his pursuit of justice against Kennedy assassination conspirators which the FCC had concluded was biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is quite direct about his conclusions.

       If I remember correctly, LBJ had ties to Bell Helicopter Corporation, and had even convinced Bell to move to Texas. Lawrence Bell had long supported LBJ, and in the '60's the company was in financial trouble. That all turned around after the assassination, and the subsequent entry into Vietnam.

       By 1969 Bell Helicopter Corporation was selling nearly $600 million worth of helicopters to the United States Military. According to Robert Bryce: "Vietnam made Bell Helicopters"."

       “For assistance in federal payments, the company turned to the local Congressman, Lyndon B. Johnson. Brown &amp; Root was the principal source of campaign funds after Johnson's initial run for Congress in 1937… After other very profitable construction projects for the federal government, Brown &amp; Root gave massive sums of cash for Johnson's first run for the U.S. Senate in 1941.
...
Brown &amp; Root continued to pour money into Lyndon Johnson's career, not just making massive contributions to Johnson's campaign funds but also making (and causing their subcontractors and others beholden to them to make) unusually large political contributions to enable Johnson to manipulate and influence other members of the House and Senate to obtain further huge contracts and other benefits (such as continuing the oil depletion allowance and the pricing of natural gas) for Johnson's friends in business. 
...
Following the death of Herman Brown, Halliburton Energy Services acquired Brown &amp; Root in December 1962. According to Dan Briody, who wrote a book on the subject, the company became part of a consortium of four companies that built about 85 percent of the infrastructure needed by the Navy during the Vietnam War. At the height of the anti-war movement of the 1960s, Brown &amp; Root was derided as "Burn &amp; Loot" by protesters.”

       I'd love it if you could provide some sourcing for that.  I'm getting convinced that going after the fed was a factor.  I'm less convinced that going after Israel was a factor.  But I'm open to the possibility.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One month before he was murdered in Dallas, President John F. Kennedy told the American Zionist Council (AZC), which would become AIPAC, to register as a foreign agent, which was and still is the law for all countries, except Israel.
       </p>
       <p>
        On October 17, 1963, Judge Rifkind, representing the AZC, asked that they not be required to register as a foreign agent, since "it would eventually destroy the Zionist movement."
       </p>
       <p>
        The plea was denied by JFK's DOJ, led by his brother, Robert Kennedy.

       Do you doubt that these particular men were not both gay and psychopaths? They certainly were. I'm not saying gays are psycho or anything but there are many credible witnesses to the odd sexual practices in military intelligence in that time. Kay Griggs, wife of Colonel George Griggs of the joint chiefs has a lot to say on that. The use of homosexual abuse on soldiers by commanders for psychological reasons traces back to ancient Greece, it was used by the Nazi party, and it was brought to the US military by German officers we brought over. Henry Kissinger is implicated to name one. It's not about them being gay, it is about them being psychopathic killers.

       If you look into Bohemian Grove, even Richard Nixon himself said on camera it was the gayest affair he'd ever witnessed, and it's a thing these individuals do. If you hear from eyewitnesses at length about these cia guys and their affiliates, there are tons of odd things they did for fun. They come off like pirates in a way. Carelessly destroying everything and anyone between them and power, while involved personally with hard drugs, ritualized orgies, murder, etc.

       "Dark Legacy" shows the scene, unfortunately, in grim detail from the Zapruder tape. You can see that Oswald's bullet almost missed and just sheared a section of his skull causing the skin and flesh to roll up so fiercely it causes the back and to the left action.

       That's funny, because when the FBI tried to get a bullet sample from Oswald's gun, the barrel was so bent that they couldn't hit the dead cow (I think it was) until they stood right next to it.
