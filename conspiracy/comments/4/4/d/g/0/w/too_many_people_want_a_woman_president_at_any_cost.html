       Lots of people mistake outward appearance for real progress. Take Obama for example. The man promised a lot of great things he never delivered on, and made a further mess of our relations in the ME (except with Iran, that's debatable). Sure, he's black, but so what? Who cares if the president is black? That doesn't mean there's progress, it just means we're
       <em>
        ready
       </em>
       for a black president.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for Hillary. Too many people think that because she's a woman, she needs to be voted in so we can make "real progress". What's the point of voting a woman president in if if she's only voted in because she's a woman? That's not to say that's the only reason people are voting for her, but the driving force? Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       When she debated Sanders, he called her pro-estalishment and her response was "I don't see how a WOMAN could be pro establishment". In other words, she's a woman, and the establishment is male dominated, so she MUST be the right person for the job.
      </p>

       Give me a fucking break.

       Ziovision is indeed part of the problem, but everything isn't just solved if you stop watching it (which I still have all the same.  Haven't owned a TV in 17+ years).  EVERYONE needs to stop.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       the problem will be well on its way toward being solved.

       I've found that there are a couple types of people who support her. Older women who respect her experience and find her relatable, and young feminists who blindly want a woman president (not all feminists). I haven't seen other types and I have no clue why anyone else would want her.

       As a woman [living in the EU], I agree. They seem to want to get the 'minorities' out of the way, so they can reinstate elderly white men. First with a black President, now with a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US presidential election is a big circus, with two clowns in it and one person I have no idea what he stands for.
That's who you can vote for:
      </p>
      <p>
       A nutter.
      </p>
      <p>
       A liar woman.

      <p>
       Someone else, that will never win.

       While you cant do anything about the nutter or the liar, why dont you do some research on the guy you dont know? You might be surprised.

       There is no need to have a woman president. A woman wouldn't do anything different than a man would, and the fact people would vote for a woman just because she's a woman is just as bad as the idiots who voted for Obama simply because he's black.

       Obama carried 95% of the black vote, but Kerry carried 90% of the black vote. The "just because he's black" crap is a false narrative pushed by racists to discredit Obama before he even took office. Stop believing obvious bullshit.

       I think you misunderstood me. The OP there was taking about "idiots who voted for him because he was black".
      </p>
      <p>
       You cited the black vote numbers. I was trying to point out that the "idiots" he's talking about could also have been white.
      </p>

       I am not saying either are idiots, you can vote for who ever you want for whatever reason, I don't care.

       And I'm saying it's reductive to to presume voters punched Obama's chad simply because of his skin color, especially when there is no data to back up the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, do you really think these supposed sensitive white guilt voters would otherwise have voted for Romney or McCain/Palin? It's ridiculous on the face of it, and I'm sick of seeing supposed freethinkers parrot talking points intentionally crafted by spin doctors to muddy discourse. This frustration may have led to my brusqueness, and I apologize for that.

       A bigot (Trump) who says he will build a giant wall around the US and bomb the middle east back to the stone age.

       It was cool and trendy to bandwagon with obama because he was black.  Wonder why the same thing hasn't translated for women.  I suspect it's the obvious lack of moral fiber?
