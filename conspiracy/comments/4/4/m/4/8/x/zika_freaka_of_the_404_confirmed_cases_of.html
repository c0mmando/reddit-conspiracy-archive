    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. The Zika virus has been known of since 1947 and has no historical association with microcephaly in infants. It looks the Brazilian government is trying to pin the blame for a spate of deformed babies on this virus, and incredibly, nobody is questioning it. So what we have is another phantom epidemic that our Western governments and pharmaceutical companies will take advantage of to whip up hysteria and sell drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold the phone. So, zika has been around since 1947, but sometimes diseases like it take decades to get a foothold. </p>

<p>Ebola is one good example. It is highly virulent, but was known for many years (since the 1970s) before it reached a situation where enough people became infected to allow the chance of contact with an infected person to drastically increase. Diseases have a basic reproduction number, which tells you how easily a disease spreads from person to person. With zika this is not yet known - we don&#39;t actually have a good understanding of how fast or how easily it even <em>can</em> spread - but it is likely to be similar to dengue and be pretty virulent (the two are closely related)</p>

<p>Another example of this sort of &#39;foothold effect&#39; is dengue itself. It was first discovered around 200 years ago, but it wasn&#39;t until around world war II it began to rapidly spread worldwide, in epidemic levels. The virus just languished away infecting a few people here and there, causing local outbreaks, till it fucking <em>exploded</em> around the world very suddenly and it now infects millions annually. Sometimes, this just happens. </p>

<p>Epidemics can also happen (this seems the case with zika) because a virus that is endemic in one area spreads into countries where that virus has not been well established. In some countries, zika seems to have been around for many years - it&#39;s been known since the 1940s but has probably existed for longer. In some countries, it seems the majority of people are exposed by childhood -  giving partial or complete immunity. That&#39;s the working theory anyway - epidemiologists are still trying to get a good grasp on zika because until recently it seemed innocuous and so no one gave much of a shit about it. </p>

<p>A good example of a sudden explosive spread in a new area is small-pox. This disease used to kill around 1 in 10 who got it, and it was endemic in Europe. People in those populations had at least <em>some</em> latent immunity. However, when it spread into the Americas, entire tribes died because they had no immunity whatsoever. It was almost universally fatal. Sometimes, if a virus shifts into a country with a large never-before-infected population, it spreads more rapidly and is more serious. </p>

<p>With zika, we&#39;re probably seeing a combination of the above. It&#39;s reached a sort of &#39;critical mass&#39; where it&#39;s able to infect more people, and it&#39;s moved into a country with no latent immunity, so suddenly everybody is getting it and no one has had it and the thing is spreading like wildfire because of the lack of individuals who have any immunity at all. And more cases = more complications occurring.</p>

<p>Which is why another thing to consider is that while zika doesn&#39;t have a known association with birth defects, this doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t been causing microcephaly for years. In African populations where it has been endemic for some time, few people would likely get to adulthood without having had it - and as long as you don&#39;t get it while pregnant, it seems to cause no significant effects. It&#39;s also completely asymptomatic in most people - some 80% or more, and it probably spreads easily which means it&#39;s probable most people will get it before adulthood... but if an unlucky person <em>did</em> happen to get it during pregnancy, and had a baby with birth defects, it&#39;s also unlikely people would have made the connection between a disease they never knew they had months ago, and microcephaly. There weren&#39;t enough cases (also the defect probably doesn&#39;t happen in <em>all</em> pregnancy cases - maybe not even most, we just don&#39;t know yet). </p>

<p>Consider also, Africa is highly rural without much of a medical system to speak of, even in large cities. This means if anyone infected with zika during pregnancy <em>did</em> have a baby with microcephaly, it would probably be put down to bad luck. That baby might not even be diagnosed, and would quite likely die during infancy if they needed any significant care - and microcephaly babies often do. Hell, in Africa 1 in 5 infants die if they&#39;re born perfectly healthy - largely due to exposure to infections, poor nutrition etc; so the chance of a baby with a severe disability living long isn&#39;t high. Official reporting of possible microcephaly cases also isn&#39;t something that happens easily (or at all) in the middle of nowhere, in a third world country  where there is 1 doctor to 20000 people. It&#39;s only now that zika is spreading very, very rapidly into an area where it wasn&#39;t previously established, and where there is a more advanced medical system, that we&#39;re seeing a massive upsurge in microcephaly cases. These may well have been happening before, but with fewer cases of zika during pregnancy (due to fewer infections of adults), no one noticed and no one was looking for it.</p>

<p>Also - I&#39;ve seen many people reference the idea there are not so many microcephaly causes connected to zika as some reports suggest. Some say 6, some say 17, some say a few hundred are all the cases in which zika has been confirmed in the baby. But even those few confirmed links are statistically enough to <em>strongly</em> implicate zika as the cause. Microcephaly is a rare defect (and sometimes borderline cases take months to confirm). The upsurge in cases currently seen is up to 15 times what is usual in a year or so, and this <em>must</em> have an explanation. Many cases have been anecdotally confirmed - based on symptoms or diagnosis at the time of the mother&#39;s infection. Remember too 80%+ are asymptomatic - and at least another 10% or so are so mild a person would think they had a cold or flu. This means few people get tested for zika (and the test is not widely available anyway) - so it wasn&#39;t possible for those cases to be &quot;confirmed zika&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>We also can&#39;t check now. The virus also only stays in a person&#39;s system for a week or two, and past this window no existing test <em>can</em> confirm it was ever there - just as you can&#39;t test for a cold you had six months ago. So the connection to zika virus is based on the specific geographic spread pattern of zika, compared to the increase in microcephaly cases (and where they&#39;ve happened in relation to zika&#39;s spread), the absence of any other logical cause, anecdotal evidence of infections/bites, confirmed infections in the mother <em>and</em> the significant number of actual confirmed infections in microcephaly babies. It&#39;s all pretty fucking compelling evidence. Most scientists aren&#39;t ready to rule out other possibilities, but the evidence connecting zika and microcephaly (while not 100% certain) is very, very strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your post. Even though Africa is quite different from Brazil, one would still expect reports of microcephaly to have been recorded during the last 6 decades on that continent, since that is where zika originated. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the absence of any other logical cause..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you, or anyone else, has established that Zika IS a logical cause of microcephaly, or that there is no alternative possibility. Brazil uniformly vaccinates pregnant women, and it seems more likely we have another governmental/pharmaceutical scandal, like the thalidomide case of the 1950s/1960s, than a well-understood virus which suddenly decides to disfigure unborn babies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no. A vaccine used the world over, with billions of doses over decades, does not magically begin to cause deformities. It just doesn&#39;t. The fact Brazil <em>slightly</em> changed its vaccine program 10 months ago is completely irrelevant - it is nothing more than a coincidence, and it occurred after the first babies with microcephaly developed anyway. It is absolutely NOT the vaccine - that can be said with certainty.</p>

<p>However, the same cannot be said of zika. It is by far the most likely cause, but the media has more or less ignored the often repeated caveat: &quot;we are not ready to rule out other causes&quot;. So, the evidence is very strong, but it&#39;s not definite. The spread of zika could <em>possibly</em> turn out to be merely correlative. Scientists have repeatedly said there seems to be a causal link, but more evidence is required. </p>

<p>Also, just yesterday a four year survey of 100,000 babies found increased patterns in microcephaly and other birth defects, finding microcephaly in 2-8% of babies (or around 2000-4000 babies - remembering microcephaly is not always easy to confirm at birth) - which is a rate of around 1000 times greater than the previous &quot;normal&quot;. This survey spans four years and predates the epidemic phase of zika and <em>may</em> be evidence zika is not the cause after all. The survey also speculates that zika has been present in the country for much longer than initially thought (i.e. as an epidemic - and now only being noticed now that enough <em>severe</em> cases are occurring. This may be the case as zika probably only causes severe defects in a handful of infections. Others may result in mild abnormalities which may go unnoticed. Many of the microcephaly cases too are mild). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s not it. The TDAP vaccine has been given to pregnant women for decades, all over the world, in early and late pregnany. The program Brazil just began last year has been in place in other countries for more than half a decade, and its predecessor saw women still getting the exact same vaccine in pregnancy - just much sooner, in the first trimester. It&#39;s now given in the third trimester and much, much too late to even possibly cause microcephaly,  which develops early in pregnancy (for info - it is given late now because if given between 27-36 weeks, it gives some immunity to baby against deadly whooping cough). So - by the time a woman gets the TDAP vaccine now her baby is at most a month or two from being born and is fully grown. In the third trimester the baby is developed and really only puts on weight and improves their lung function. The window for microcephaly is well and truly over by that time. If TDAP did cause birth defects (and it fucking absolutely doesn&#39;t), you&#39;d expect the changes to the TDAP program to cause a dramatic <em>drop</em> in congenital abnormalities, not a rise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/new-link-between-zika-virus-and-microcephaly-is-found-in-brazil/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/new-link-between-zika-virus-and-microcephaly-is-found-in-brazil/</a></p>

<p>The above PBS, published on the same day differs significantly.  I;m stuck with Google translate so all this guy&#39;s source article says is that &quot;404 cases have had microcephaly confirmation or other disorders of the central nervous system - 17 of them in connection with the zika virus.&quot;  That could mean that 17 have been tested for Zika and been found positive or that all had been tested for Zika.  I don&#39;t know how well repected that paper is as I am no Braziliqan.</p>

<p>According to the much more in-depth PBS article however:</p>

<p>A) The 4,783 number was never claimed by the government as the number of cases of microcephaly (I can&#39;t speak for irresponsible reporting).  It is the number of children born with heads below the minimum circumference to be tested further for microcephaly.  Of those 4,783 cases, as of the date these articles were published only 1,313 had been further investigated and those alone had yielded the 404 cases of microcephaly.</p>

<p>B) The article alludes only to 12 infants with microcephaly in Pernambuco who were tested for Zika, all of whom came back positive.  Another source suggested the link was originally suggested by two miscarried fetuses which had microcephaly and tested positive for Zika.</p>

<p>C) This would mean that 14 cases of microcephaly have been linked to Zika in Pernambuco alone.  Pernambuco holds less than 5% of Brazil&#39;s total population and accounts for about one third of its cases of Zika.</p>

<p>D) Multiple sources including wiki list the total number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil in 2014 as 147, thus, a jump to 404 (or far more if those 404 were confirmed from just 1,313 tested cases out of 4,783 possible cases as this article states) in a 10 month period is a beyond explaining by chance.</p>

<p>E) A pediatric infectious disease specialist in Pernambuco, where about 1/3 of Brazil&#39;s cases of Zika have been diagnosed, said that since August (about 4 motnths after the beginning of the outbreak) the number of cases of miicrocephaly in Pernambuco has gone from 10 per year to 10 per week.</p>

<p>So, these two articles give very different overviews and I would recommend reading the PBS article before you jump to conclusions as it is far more in-depth than the Portugese source (which I at least, have to stick into Google translate) and certainly more so than this guy&#39;s bullet points of the Brazilian article.</p>

<p>The UOL Noticias article is hard to pin down on &quot;confirmed in those tested for Zika&quot; versus &quot;confirmed with ll 404 cases tested&quot; partly because of the translation.  The PBS article suggests a very strong correlation between the outbreak and the cases of microcephaly.  Regardless, it seems clear that <em>at least</em> 404 cases of microcephaly have been documented since the outbreak began less than a year ago which means that <em>something</em> has driven up Brazil&#39;s rate of microcephaly by at least 3 times and possibly by 14 or 15 times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>update:</p>

<p>The Brazilian researchers then went in and took a closer look at that figure.  They walked it back and said there were, at best, only 404 confirmed cases of microcephaly.    </p>

<p>Going from 4,000 cases to 404 cases was a revelation.  It means there is no reason to claim, so far, that there is an epidemic of microcephaly.</p>

<p>Then, another stunner.  Of the 404 cases, only 17 &quot;had a relationship with the Zika virus.&quot;  Therefore, obviously, there was no Zika-causing-microcephaly story, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, if you look at my comment, you will see that according to the PBS article (the most thorough account I&#39;ve seen):</p>

<p>A) Those 404 cases of microcephaly were confirmed from the 1,313 cases that had been further investigated from the 4,783 initial cases of babies with cranium circumferences below a certain size.</p>

<p>B) That in all of 2014 Brazil had only 147 cases of microcephaly, so even assuming that 404 is the total since the outbreak began 10 months ago (and it seems more likely that it will be about 3.5 times that high) this very much qualifies as an epidemic of microcephaly.</p>

<p>As far as the 17 with a relationship, that could be the number confirmed but confirmation requires a spinal tap of the newborn and it seems unlikely that they have conducted and completed spinal taps on 404 newborns so far.  The article does however mention that in a sample of 12 micrpcephalic newborns in Pernambuco (the hardest his territory) showed that all 12 had Zika.  It also mentions that since August Pernambuco has gone from 10 cases of microcephaly per year to about 10 per week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Brazilian researchers noted that other areas of South America with an increase in Zika did not experience an increase in microcephaly.  Only those areas with increased pesticides noted the increase in microcephaly.  Some of the pesticides were spread on water supplies to kill mosquitos.  Other pesticides were agricultural herbicides.</p>
