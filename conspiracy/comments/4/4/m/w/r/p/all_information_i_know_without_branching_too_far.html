       There is only one way to fight back.  Become a spiritual warrior.  Break rules that are easy to not get caught breaking (that don't hurt anyone or yourself) as a symbolic gesture of your disapproval and nullification of said laws.  Like if you are at a long stop light at 3am and no one is around, run that fucker like it's not even there.  Scoff at the system.  Undermine it with your words, spread the word that it's a joke and by extension so are they.  The best way to fight evil is to laugh at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       About becoming a spiritual warrior.  They say Jesus is a mushroom.  Look into that.

       I would like to give a shout out to 'Earth Mother' as I call her. Always helps me with an infusion of love when I find I need a bit of help.

       I mean literally the soul of the Earth energizes my soul with comfort and warmth in my solar plexus when I ask her to. Subject to her approval, of course.

       I would also like to use this opportunity to shed some light on mother earth and the beings with her. She is the bearer of all and through her we have all knowledge. Knowledge is knowing, today we know very little but we are rused to believe we know a lot. Once we realize we know nothing we can listen to Earth Mother and the beings who we share this planet with.

       Stopped reading at the word 'illuminati'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, look; I enjoy a good conspiracy theory, but I believe that % 99.99999 of the information presented to us is either erroneous interpretations of mundane occurrences, or just outright disinformation to 'muddy the waters' and cover for the % .00001 of the really bad and scary shit going on behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, whenever I see the word 'illuminati', my brain immediately shuts off and I disengage from the material at hand.  Not sure if that is a survival mechanism, or a bullshit detector, but let me tell you, it works just fine for me.

       Yeah I don't know what the word you want to call it, there are some sort of elites pushing these buttons behind the scenes. Illuminati or dogteam101 someone's shaping this world into whatever they want I guess..?

       Or, maybe you are uninformed. Here's one of George Washington's letters talking about the Illuminati (it does mention 'Illuminati' though, so I guess you can't read it):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/library-congress-confirms-george-washington-aware-nefarious-illuminati/1122149/">
        http://consciouslifenews.com/library-congress-confirms-george-washington-aware-nefarious-illuminati/1122149/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned."

       Maybe I am uninformed.  I mean, I do know about the existence and history of the classic 'illuminati', but as far as them running the world or even existing in the 21st century, I gotta say, I'm not a believer.

       Use whatever term you want to refer to them. If we all stopped using the word 'Illuminati' it won't change reality.... I prefer the agnostic TPTB (The Powers That Be).

       I prefer that term as well.  Thanks to the aforementioned 'muddying of the waters', the word 'illuminati' has so much baggage that it is basically just used nowadays to make 'conspiracy theorists' look like delusional goofs.

       If they look like goofs to you, then you've been duped, not us.  Because we know that the CIA created the pejorative 'conspiracy theorist' to taint and thereby suppress and discredit any attempts to independently investigate the intelligence agencies themselves, specifically re: JFK's assassination.

       sigh......I am not going to explain in detail how our positions on this subject are identical, and how I described conspiracy theorists as goofs because that is how I have heard them described before, not because that is my personal belief, and how you are 180 degrees wrong in your interpretation of my post and my intentions in making the post....it is all just too complicated and exhausting.

       Well clearly its not the same illuminati because those people are all dead by now unless you believe in vampires, which you shouldn't because there's no evidence.  But since you rely on evidence, then go prove that the Bilderberg group or CIFR doesn't exist or the UN or the freemasons, because generally speaking when people say illuminati, they are referring to secret societies's members who work within and through these groups towards the very same stated goals of the classic illuminati

       Well you may need to see a doctor if you don't believe in the illuminati.  Most people here do, although it's really just a catchall for people who pull the strings, and there is no universal agreement on which group that is--but there is evidence and therefore agreement that competing factions of powerful people are shaping world news, events, perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you subscribe to this idea that "we have collectively created a system that emits emergent phenomenon from crowd behavior that only appears to some to be the movements of a tiny cabal of powerful people pulling strings from the shadows".... then guess what?

       Because this is
       <em>
        exactly the narrative that this group we can prove exists is trying to pull over on you
       </em>

       I don't believe in the illuminati, full stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that world affairs are primarily directed by a nameless, factional, secret organization that is constantly embroiled in intercine warfare and uses other well-known power groups, both real and fake, as cut-outs and mercenaries and scapegoats et. cetera and et. al., but that is neither here nor there.

      <p>
       Sorry, I don't do doctors, unless I need emergency trauma surgery I try to avoid them as much as I can.

       it's not crazy stuff. Do you realize fracking causes earthquakes. That alone is manmade. If we can do it that way you don't think the government has already found a way to weaponize that? And we've creating storms for at least 30 years. Japan does it all the time but on a smaller scale. Again, the public doesn't see the direct effects of this stuff but it's already being done.
