    <div class="md"><p>There is only one way to fight back.  Become a spiritual warrior.  Break rules that are easy to not get caught breaking (that don&#39;t hurt anyone or yourself) as a symbolic gesture of your disapproval and nullification of said laws.  Like if you are at a long stop light at 3am and no one is around, run that fucker like it&#39;s not even there.  Scoff at the system.  Undermine it with your words, spread the word that it&#39;s a joke and by extension so are they.  The best way to fight evil is to laugh at it.</p>

<p>About becoming a spiritual warrior.  They say Jesus is a mushroom.  Look into that.</p>

<p>I would also like to use this opportunity to shed some light on mother earth and the beings with her. She is the bearer of all and through her we have all knowledge. Knowledge is knowing, today we know very little but we are rused to believe we know a lot. Once we realize we know nothing we can listen to Earth Mother and the beings who we share this planet with. </p>

<p>I mean, look; I enjoy a good conspiracy theory, but I believe that % 99.99999 of the information presented to us is either erroneous interpretations of mundane occurrences, or just outright disinformation to &#39;muddy the waters&#39; and cover for the % .00001 of the really bad and scary shit going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>That said, whenever I see the word &#39;illuminati&#39;, my brain immediately shuts off and I disengage from the material at hand.  Not sure if that is a survival mechanism, or a bullshit detector, but let me tell you, it works just fine for me.</p>

<p>Or, maybe you are uninformed. Here&#39;s one of George Washington&#39;s letters talking about the Illuminati (it does mention &#39;Illuminati&#39; though, so I guess you can&#39;t read it): </p>

<p><a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/library-congress-confirms-george-washington-aware-nefarious-illuminati/1122149/">http://consciouslifenews.com/library-congress-confirms-george-washington-aware-nefarious-illuminati/1122149/</a></p>

<p>&quot;It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.</p>

<p>The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well clearly its not the same illuminati because those people are all dead by now unless you believe in vampires, which you shouldn&#39;t because there&#39;s no evidence.  But since you rely on evidence, then go prove that the Bilderberg group or CIFR doesn&#39;t exist or the UN or the freemasons, because generally speaking when people say illuminati, they are referring to secret societies&#39;s members who work within and through these groups towards the very same stated goals of the classic illuminati</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you may need to see a doctor if you don&#39;t believe in the illuminati.  Most people here do, although it&#39;s really just a catchall for people who pull the strings, and there is no universal agreement on which group that is--but there is evidence and therefore agreement that competing factions of powerful people are shaping world news, events, perspectives.</p>

<p>If you subscribe to this idea that &quot;we have collectively created a system that emits emergent phenomenon from crowd behavior that only appears to some to be the movements of a tiny cabal of powerful people pulling strings from the shadows&quot;.... then guess what?  <strong><em>You have been mind-controlled.</em></strong>  Because this is <em>exactly the narrative that this group we can prove exists is trying to pull over on you</em>.</p>

<p>I do believe that world affairs are primarily directed by a nameless, factional, secret organization that is constantly embroiled in intercine warfare and uses other well-known power groups, both real and fake, as cut-outs and mercenaries and scapegoats et. cetera and et. al., but that is neither here nor there.</p>

If we can do it that way you don&#39;t think the government has already found a way to weaponize that? And we&#39;ve creating storms for at least 30 years.
