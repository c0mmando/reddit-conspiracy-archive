    <div class="md"><p>Given that you had me pegged, I won&#39;t pretend I&#39;m not a Sanders supporter, and I think you are probably not so much a regular as you are a hyper regular who thinks only bad things can happen, and good things literally never, ever, ever happen, because the Military Industrial Complex would nuke NYC, pretend to be Russia, and start WW3 before allowing...tax increases on the wealthy to substantially lower than Eisenhower&#39;s 90% in order to pay for things that are not only extremely popular but also all but necessary for this country to continue being a dominant economic power.</p>

<p>My opinion, however, is this:</p>

<p>I believe it to be more analogous to the movie Cube, where the U.S. is this monster that no one built but everyone maintains, a monster that also destroys some people effortlessly, without any oversight. But once in a while, people actually get mad or otherwise motivated to participate.  When this happens, popular mandates happen. Sanders understands that he has to create a movement, unlike Obama, whose naivety caused him to think he could get by with a groundswell.  This forced him to be a pragmatist once he was in the isolation of the Oval Office, and so he has been more or less a lame duck who has almost completely cow towed to the established powers.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m done interacting with you, though, unless you want to interact about the subject of my submission. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ll see, friend. </p>

<p>If we can get Sanders elected, I will find myself right or wrong. If Clinton, I&#39;ll never know.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m for finding out. You are not, that&#39;s cool, I get it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t do this as a job, I&#39;m a regular dude, who is a realist. I don&#39;t live in fantasy land, and I suggest you do not either. Maybe, if we talked about real issues, honest people like Ron Paul or Sanders could actually change shit. But, in the system we have now, people like them couldn&#39;t change anything. Nothing short of a revolution, could change what we have. You make assumptions and try to muddy what I say, yet you have no idea what I actually think or suggest. You sound misguided/naive or like a PR account for the establishment (Sanders), at worse.</p>
