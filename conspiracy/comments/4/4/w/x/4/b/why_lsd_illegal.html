       The only reason LSD is still illegal, is because certain interest parties with political influence benefit from its illegality. These include big pharma, divisions of the FBI, police unions, religious groups and conservative political groups. With professional guidance and evaluation, LSD has no negative effects. LSD is not toxic. The only reason LSD ever damages a user is because they are ignorant of its workings, ignorant of how to interpret the experience. This is knowledge that is lost DUE TO THE FACT THAT LSD HAS BEEN ILLEGAL FOR HALF A CENTURY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discuss LSD and its political status here. It's one of the biggest issues in modern society.

       It's all those things OP, but it's also the fact that LSD causes people to question their cultural baggage, and question their government, and question authority generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a common thing, that when you do psychedelics and listen to the news or radio, you say to yourself, "What that f are these people telling me?  Who are these psychopaths?  What gives them the right?  What are they trying to pull over on me?"  Questions that many of us have never, ever asked of TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, LSD--and psychedelics generally--is the "THEY LIVE" sunglasses of your mind letting you see the cultural engineering at work and the spiritual parasites trying to trap you in their webs.

       Do you know anything about the history of LSD and when it skyrocketed with American youth?

       Edit - Yes, I have also read Acid Dreams and Electric Kool-Aid...building counter-culture is important for the establishment because it:

       A. Builds an internal, harmless enemy for the corn-mowin' folk to be against, as they can't be against the WAR that is killing nearly 50,000 members of their brothers in a foreign land.

       Yeah dude, I read Acid Dreams.  Also, read the Electric Cool Aid Acid Test, so I know Kesey was also introduced to to it by the CIA.  Yes, the CIA seemed to have a hand in it.  Haight-Ashbury could've just been a big experiment.  Maybe.  But in the end the shit was outlawed wasn't it?  If it was an experiment what did they find?  That it made kids anti-war.  Turn their back on the establishment.  Return to nature.  Which leads me to the conclusion that you can't have that shit when you're trying to run an empire.

       Yes, but people that don't take acid are far less likely to be anti-war to begin with.  I fully get that the CIA was very interested in LSD.  I just think in the final analysis it actually wasn't that useful.  I think the conclusion in whatever secret report that never saw the light of day, is that it tends to create values inconsistent with capitalism and empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the final analysis it doesn't matter what the CIA did.  The statement I made stands on its own as the general outcome of its use:

       Prohibitions have always been used to marginalize specific social segments or even individuals while at the same time making

       amounts of money funneling illicit sales.  From opium to heroin to marijuana to alcohol to cocaine to crack cocaine to psychedelics to ecstasy  - the cycle has been repeated successfully for hundreds of years.

       I'd say psychedelics are prohibited more to keep your programming in check rather than marginalizing people. They remove the veils that society has been piling on since birth.

       There's definitely something to be said about certain people wanting to keep the status quo.  Keep in mind though that The CIA made hundreds of millions selling LSD in the 60's and 70's then abandoned it in favour of the cocaine and heroin trade.  I'm not sure the psychopaths financing opium fields in Afghanistan give a shit about enlightenment,  I suspect all they care about is their revenue stream.

        there is no discussion about L in there - at all

       I know the link is a little tired, I couldn't find a better source - radio shows from the 80's are hard to come by.  That video is all about LSD though, from inception to manufacture to distribution.

       I would dispute the idea that the CIA "made hundreds of millions" (though they might have).  I instead am under the impression that the CIA purposely flooded the streets with LSD for very little cost to the end users, specifically the streets of California, during the '60's and '70's as a way to marginalize pro-peace/anti-war activists by turning them into a bunch of drug addled hippies.  Allegedly LSD was just being handed out like candy at festivals and shows of those days to anyone and everyone who wanted some.

       I don't know man, to me it's likely that the CIA
       <em>
        was not
       </em>
       the complete mastermind of the LSD/counterculture movement during the '60's and '70's, so I do agree with you to some extent, but to deny they had any involvement at all is just ignoring a lot of evidence in my opinion.  To me it probably followed the sequence that a lot of other movements have followed: starts out organic, becomes sort of a threat, and is infiltrated/co-opted/used by the state mostly via intelligence organizations.

       I agree.  Hard evidence is scant and much of it is speculative or circumstantial.  I tend to just weigh the probabilities and try to look at as many different perspectives as I can and this theory - that the CIA was involved with and trying to control/steer the counterculture movement of the '60's and '70's - just seems a lot more logical to me than the idea that they weren't involved based on things I've seen and read.

      <p>
       As just one example of what led me to this, check out the background of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley">
        this guy.
       </a>
       By most accounts, he had a near endless supply of LSD and other drugs and basically just handed them out for free at Grateful Dead shows.  He has a pretty interesting and shadowy background/family life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Timothy Leary specifically is a tough one though, I've heard so many different things about him and what his real agenda was and who, if anyone, he was actually working with.  Personally I think he was mostly his own man acting autonomously but at a certain point he had to (or decided to) "play ball" a bit in order to get some of the heat off of his back.

       He was making LSD when it was legal. And then got busted and spent time in prison. Even today I know people who dose people for free because they think it is 'helping' the world/them.

       Once again, the CIA pushing L on the masses narrative seems to have just popped up with no evidence, but with alot of accounts acting like its common knowledge. But when asked for evidence on the matter - literally none is produced - just stories and written 'interviews'. Coupled with the idea that L makes you question everything, I find it hard to believe that it would be in the best interest of a group intent on controlling a population.

       I don't know man.  I know people like this too but handing out a few tabs to friends is a bit different from handing out tens of thousands of dollars of acid repeatedly, over the course of years, which is what Owsley allegedly did.

       Well if you only read the wikipedia article then yeah.  He also spent over a year in a government insane asylum at the age of 15, dropped out of school, then had no issues getting accepted to UV.  He also later worked at Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory before settling with the Grateful Dead in a house which was apparently right next to a brothel (which is exactly what the CIA did during many of its LSD experiments as part of "Operation Midnight Climax").
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, all speculative and circumstantial but I do think he has an interesting family background, as do many of the counterculture figures and bands of that era.

       As someone who has done LSD and had profound experiences with it I certainly agree that it opens the mind and makes people see things in new ways.  But it's equally true that what began as the peace movement/anti-war movement during Vietnam ended up morphing into the hippie movement which was marginalized quite easily and discredited as just a bunch of dirty bums who didn't care about anything beyond fucking and getting high.  So I can see both angles and I think it's possible if not probable that elements of both were involved.

       I've got friends who hand out sheets at every festival they go to and they go to them seemingly weekly. If I had the means and know-how to manufacture it, I would be too. The tens of thousands of dollars claim would also be if sold on the street and not the actual cost of production.

       Fair enough but I really just think you're underestimating the quantities we're talking about here.  He was giving away
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of tabs by some estimates and according to many he was basically providing the entire California music scene with LSD singlehandedly.  This is different from making an extra batch to bring to a festival and hand out.  Also $20k-$30k was a ton of money in the '60's and '70's as compared to now.

       I mean it makes sense. LSD heightens your senses in every way, and in that sense if you microdose as to not overstimulate, you can be more in tune with the happenings around you which is important as a SS member.

       Ok this is just false.  I love acid as much as the next guy, but I've seen the negative effects firsthand multiple times. A friend of mine had a psychotic break and tried to immolate himself while camping, we had to keep restraining him for about 6 hours, and it took him probably half a year before he was mostly normal. This person had taken LSD before without issue and extremely intelligent. That being said, he has a family history of schizophrenia.

       While true that it can exacerbate undelinning problems, LSD is not to blame here - genetics are.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same sense that if a person allergic to peanuts, has an adverse reaction to peanut butter, the peanut butter is not to blame.

       This is just not true, HPPD and PTSD are both long lasting negative side effects which are possible.

       The exact causes of HPPD are still not yet known. However you are right we have noticed a correlation of hallucinogenic use and HPPD.

       Now you're just getting into semantics. If someone has an allergic reaction to peanuts, it is the peanuts causing the reaction. If the peanuts were absent, then the reaction would be as well

       It's not semantics at all. There will always be a minority of people in the world that will have an adverse reaction to literally anything.

       Some people are allergic to water, but I don't hear you telling people to avoid water because it has been known to cause adverse reactions in some people.

       Yes you are right that the peanuts are needed to cause the reaction in that sense. However, if this is the route you want to go down, then literally everything we ingest for the first time has some inherent risk to it.

       I made sure to be clear that I was in no way encouraging LSD use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I meant virtually non-existant in the same way that peanuts' negative side effects are "virtually non-existant". Yes you could be allergic to them, yes you could choke on them etc.  But if we are being this litteral, then nothing could be said to have no "negative side effects". Air is lethal if injected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clear things up, this would have been a better way of saying what i meant in my first post: LSD use is generally very safe (with little, to no adverse side effects) especially when compared to other illicit drugs.

       Yeah, don't take ANY psychedelics if you have a family history pattern of Schizo. Very very important, including marijuana and MDMA. If you are in this group, your brain is simply different and will react completely differently to such substances. It really isn't worth the risk.

       I would tread lightly into psychedelics. The fact that you have had a fine experience with Marijuana is a good sign; that is usually the first place you will identify a problem. But make sure you are prepared when you trip, let go of all responsibilities and be in a good environment. I would say you are at risk of having a bad trip over someone with no history, but that shouldn't deter you if you wanna try. Experience is the best experience. I have never had even the slightest inkling of a bad trip with the 30+ times that I have tried it. Everything is always good forever

       Not that guy, but I have also had a bad reaction to it. It's common knowledge in the psychedelic community that some people aren't meant to trip. A lot of people--before doing DMT--meditate and reflect, they take steps to make it a positive experience. A novice user who just pops it might end up having a bad time. Psychedelics just aren't meant for everyone and they're nothing to fuck around with (especially DMT). Some people should avoid hard liquor because they turn into violent assholes, some people should avoid psychedelics because they end up snapping internally (I watched my entire belief structure melt away over night, it's hard shit to deal with it, and if you aren't ready, it will mess you up--it fucked me up for a while).

       yeah and I very much agree. I have never once had a bad experience with DMT or LSD, but I know what I am doing when I take them. I make sure that I am mentally ready for whatever the trip has in store, and relieve myself from responsibilities for the remainder of whatever day I plan to trip, as well as often the following day. Conditions in which you take them are also extremely important, and if you don't account for all of this you can easily find yourself overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not all psychedelics are for everyone. I have never had a good experience on my multiple tries of taking mushrooms (not life-changingly bad, but simply not enjoyable.... would have rather been sober the whole time), and will therefore never take them again.

       It does good things if taken in the proper setting with a good ambiance to begin with. if it were legal and a lot of people misused it than there would be a lot of people having bad trips, injuring themselves, and injuring others. Imagine the people driving or operating machinery or anything that could kill innocent people under the influence of it. Psychedelics can be very good or extremely bad trip wise, there isn't much of any middle ground with them and the trip you get.

       "Imagine the people driving and operating machinery or anything that could kill innocent people under the influence of it" -- Now I'm not going to state the obvious; I'll let you figure this one out. Does this quote fit any other mind-altering substances that are in-fact legal right now?  Not only are they legal but they're all but encouraged in our culture. Of course, ding ding ding. Alcohol is legal, yet that quote applies to it even more than it does to LSD. I'm so sick of these arguments that they are dangerous; "What if people drove on them! Imagine the damage!" People will be people, that is no reason to try to prevent them from the liberties inherent in being a self-conscious individual -- I think it's fucked up to tell people what to and what not to do with their bodies. Call me crazy.

       The

       thing anyone tripping on shrooms or LSD is thinking about is getting into a car. I can barely use my phone to text of I'm tripping, starting my car would be impossible.
It's just a poor argument, and it's blatantly apparent you've never tripped from your comment.

       That's just not true. You can do anything while you trip if you think about it enough. And the argument that LSD has no bad side effects if you plan properly and have no family history of mental disorders is false. I've seen people lose their fucking shit even when they knew what they were getting into.

       I guess I was mostly replying to OP saying that LSD has no negative side effects, just people who are stupid and don't know how to interpret their experience. That's just wrong. It can effect anyone in a bad way.

       Yep.

       Plus, at the same time the CIA'S was experimenting with it, psychiatrists were also using it with patients.

       In  other words, the CIA'S wasn't the only group to have L crossover into use by the general population.

       I don't buy that story for a second and neither does the lead surviving LSD researcher. We have different conclusions, but we both agree Hoffman's story is a lie. My conclusion is human experimentation led to what we know about LSD and Hoffman either helped it escape out of the lab for good or bad, or even just as the cover story.

       LSD is a powerful tool for reprogramming the bio-computer. The CIA used it to try to program assassins. In the hands of a few enlightened individuals seeking a shift in global consciousness towards a more unified society, it could take power from TPTB and disrupt the status quo.

       Why did the CIA see it as advantageous to have a generation, which was extremely politically active, under the influence of LSD? Why did it go hand in glove with their mind control operations? Does it make the user's reality easier to shape by outside forces? I don't know, but I ponder these questions. 
I still say that going to the grave without a psychedelic experience is akin to dying a virgin, but I do have some irritating questions regarding that organization's love affair with said chemical.

       Wait, what? I was under the impression that LSD was synthesized in 1938, but remained unstudied until the late 1960's when university professors started using it, and
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       were the ones that would give it to anyone they could (as any user of LSD would want to do [y'know, that "everyone has to hear about this stuff!" feeling it gives you]) since they had access to mass quantities. And then it was promptly made illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt the CIA has studied LSD and how they can use it to their advantage, but I don't think they wanted the masses taking boundary-dissolving drugs that make you question authority.

       Nah, man. They were dosing people early. This article describes how the put LSD into the bread of a French town in 1951:

        So one could consider the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) cruel for administering LSD to an unknown number of unsuspecting Americans during the 1950s and '60s. The agency conducted clandestine experiments on college students, drug addicts, veterans, soldiers, sailors, johns, mental patients, at least one young mother and a jazz singer. For a time, the drug was so prevalent in the CIA, agents dosed one another for fun. And for a punch line, the heyday of 1960s counterculture -- including its subversion of the establishment -- was preceded and directly created by the CIA's acid tests.

       This was the case with Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters crowd. Kesey was an MKUltra volunteer who was dosed, loved it, and took jars of it from the facility he was being experimented on. This resulted in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Acid Tests, and Furthur.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were other people who got turned on by profs and researchers- Tom Robbins and Timothy Leary come to mind, but they were doing mind control experiments with it in the 50s even.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel like doing the research right now, but IIRC the CIA bought up the world's supply of LSD from Sandoz, then  went through it and got the government to sanction Eli-Lilly to produce it for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allen Ginsberg was one of the counter-culture figures who first got to the upper echelons of the LSD supply and was horrified to see the CIA there.

       One psychiatrist used LSD in conjunction with electroshock in such horribly unconscionable ways that he left many of his non-consenting victims comatose, children unable to recognize their parents, people unable to go the bathroom by themselves, etc.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Donald Ewen Cameron (24 December 1901 – 8 September 1967)[1] — known as D. Ewen Cameron or Ewen Cameron — was a Scottish-born psychiatrist who served as President of the Canadian Psychiatric Association, American (1952–1953) and World Psychiatric Associations, the American Psychopathological Association and the Society of Biological Psychiatry during the 1950s. Notwithstanding his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for his administration, without informed consent, of disproportionately intense electroshock therapy and experimental drugs, including LSD, which rendered some patients permanently comatose. Some of this work took place in the context of the MKUltra mind control program.[2]

       yeah and I very much agree. I have never once had a bad experience with DMT or LSD, but I know what I am doing when I take them. I make sure that I am mentally ready for whatever the trip has in store, and relieve myself from responsibilities for the remainder of whatever day I plan to trip, as well as often the following day. Conditions in which you take them are also extremely important, and if you don't account for all of this you can easily find yourself overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not all psychedelics are for everyone. I have never had a good experience on my multiple tries of taking mushrooms (not life-changingly bad, but simply not enjoyable.... would have rather been sober the whole time), and will therefore never take them again.

       I would tread lightly into psychedelics. The fact that you have had a fine experience with Marijuana is a good sign; that is usually the first place you will identify a problem. But make sure you are prepared when you trip, let go of all responsibilities and be in a good environment. I would say you are at risk of having a bad trip over someone with no history, but that shouldn't deter you if you wanna try. Experience is the best experience. I have never had even the slightest inkling of a bad trip with the 30+ times that I have tried it. Everything is always good forever
