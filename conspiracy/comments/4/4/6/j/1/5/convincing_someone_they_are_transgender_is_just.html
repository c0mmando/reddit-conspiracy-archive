There is a long history of the medical community resisting trans people and working against their existence. There is overwhelming evidence that transgender people are the gender they identify as and that transition is the most effective way of treating gender dysphoria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/"><strong>study</strong></a> frequently misrepresented as supposed showing high rates of suicide after transition says absolutely nothing like that.</p>

<p>The study found no statistically significant difference between the suicide rates of trans people who transitioned between 1989 and 2003, and the general population.</p>

<p>A slightly higher than average suicide rate was only found among people who transitioned prior to 1989. And even then, the suicide rate was only 2.7%, with suicide attempt rates at 7.9% (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/table/pone-0016885-t002/"><strong>Table 2</strong></a>). This is higher than the general average, but considerably lower than the <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf"><strong>40%</strong></a> rate of suicide attempts among trans people <em>before</em> transition.</p>

<p>Transition <em>vastly decreases</em> suicide risk. What slightly heightened risk remains is a result of the cumulative abuse, discrimination, degradation and violence the victims is subjected to. And even with this widespread mistreatment, it is still <em>much better</em> than the conditions they suffer by not transitioning.</p>

<p>See <a href="/u/Chel_of_the_sea">/u/Chel_of_the_sea</a>&#39;s post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/367d1j/cmv_being_transgender_to_the_point_of_wanting/crbe84o"><strong>here</strong></a> for information on the incredible benefit transition has to the psychological and emotional health and functionality of trans people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;fact&quot; is based on a single study, and comes from some pretty selective reading of the study. The facts are that suicide rates for trans people (both pre and post-op) are higher than the average population. However, these rates go down a) when the individual has support from friends/family/medical doctors and b) when transition steps such as surgery and hormones are taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Toronto Sun article is about a study and includes links to the cited study. Yes, the final one was just an article, but I provided it to show that that study is often misinterpreted. You don&#39;t need studies to show that suicide is a result of discrimination and lack of support. When supported by their community and given access to transition related healthcare, trans suicide rates go down. Full stop. I&#39;m not sure why you oppose trans people (and if I&#39;m wrong in believing you&#39;re against trans rights, please, correct me). This is the civil rights issue of our time and, as had been proven time and time again, history will look poorly upon those working against progress. </p>

If such a drug existed, I&#39;m fairly sure I would have heard about it. As a trans person, these sorts of things are incredibly important to me and I try to pay attention to any news that comes out. And as I said before, it is <a href="http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=protocol-hormones">widely accepted</a> by the medical community that the <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/transgender.aspx">most effective way</a> to treat trans people is through affirmative healthcare, whether that be hormones, surgery, or whatever is decided to be the best approach by the individual and their healthcare provider.  I can also personally attest that once I was able to start hormone therapy, my quality of life greatly improved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a gender identity is not mental illness, and attempts to &quot;cure&quot; dysphoria by changing the patient&#39;s gender identity by drugs, therapy, electroshock, brain surgery, and every other means imaginable, have all proven to be futile, catastrophic disasters. These attempts leave nothing but a wake of ruined lives and suicide.</p>

<p>Transition, on the other hand, is spectacularly effective. Transition allows formerly suffering people to have healthy and productive lives. Dysphoria is an illness - transition is the cure.</p>

<p>... a google search for that term isn&#39;t getting any results. Literally none. The terms Google suggests I might mean are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finzomine (a purveyor of quality sportfishing apparel and accessories)</p></li>
<li><p>Benzamine (a chemical used in rubber processing, herbicides, and the production of blue dye)</p></li>
<li><p>Penzone (of Charles Penzone Grand Salons)</p></li>
<li><p>Pinzimini (a bunch of restaurants).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Looking up vaguely similar sounding medications, I&#39;ve found Pantoprazole (used to treat damage to the esophagus from stomach acid) and Prelone (reduces inflammation).</p>

<p>Not seeing anything even remotely related to trans people. And a quick search on <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> isn&#39;t turning up anything relevant either. Sure you didn&#39;t dream it?</p>

A lot of people live unhappy lives because of fear of the discrimination, disowning, threats, etc.  Some choose to express their feelings in the form of their body.

<p>I have no idea what you&#39;re trying to say here.  So, if they are treated so shittily by people who have a problem with a decision that effects only themselves they would have killed themselves anyway because psychiatrists implanted a mental illness in them?  God this is retarded.</p>

<p>I, as a trans person, have been raised in a society which has two stances regarding my existence.</p>

<p>The other half tell me not only that my suicide is inevitable either way, but that if I transition I might as well kill myself, so suicide is a better option</p>

<p>Then, when we do kill ourselves, our peers romanticize our deaths and idolize those individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a canard.  Sorry.  No one is convincing others they are transgender, nor <em>can you even accomplish that</em>.  In fact, the opposite is happening.  With young children, more often than not, parents are worried for their gender dysphoric children and resist any gender change.  There are tests for these things.  One part of the test is asking the kid what they want to do at a certain point when the other tests have shown severe enough gender dysphoria to warrant a change.  Ultimately though, kids don&#39;t have a say, only the parents.  I think you have to be 18 to make the choice yourself.</p>

<p>Yes transsexuality is becoming &#39;popular&#39; or even &#39;fashionable&#39; in our culture.  If history is any indication, this is generally a warning sign of the collapse of societies, similar to the fall into decadence of Rome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are actually parts of the brain that differs from men to women.  You can identify aspects in which the brains of transgender people and of those planning to have the surgery are in certain ways like that of the gender to which they want to change.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan/">Here</a> is one article about it.  I saw a Nova program about a similar but not identical finding a couple years before this article was written and I&#39;m sure there are plenty of other sources.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also of course the fact that many of these people, even as young children wanted dolls not trucks, pants not dresses etc.  I guess the psychiatrists somehow got to them without ever meeting with them!</p>

<p>The idea that this is all a scam by doctors to make money is beyond retarded.  As well say that churches are turning kids gay to make money off of &quot;fixing&quot; them.</p>

<p>People begin to realize that there are things made taboo by tradition that don&#39;t need to be and each time something else begins to gain acceptance there are people who A) blame some outside agency for this <em>obvious aberration</em> and B) incorrectly think that it is any of their business and that they should tell people how to live their lives.</p>

<p>Just stick with Satan makes them that way.  It&#39;s at least more straightforward than &quot;The vast majority of psychiatrists who claim to have devoted their careers to helping people&#39;s mental states are really just in it for the money.  So, in order to make fractionally more money, the small fraction of psychiatrists who actually deal with this kind of case invent a disorder that requires extensive surgery and hormone therapy (with costs dwarfing their own revenue increase) and ruins the otherwise non-gender dysmorphic people&#39;s lives.</p>

<p>OMG.  I just realized.  You think it&#39;s the Body Thetans don&#39;t you?  And you say they&#39;re being scammed by fake psychiatry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because of the widespread social acceptance of transgender people and that nobody thinks of them as &quot;sick&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; letting them feel like they fit in with the rest of society, instead of feeling like outcasts and broken.</p>

<p>Or the opposite, I suppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;fact&quot; is based on a single study, and comes from some pretty selective reading of the study. The facts are that suicide rates for trans people (both pre and post-op) are higher than the average population. However, these rates go down a) when the individual has support from friends/family/medical doctors and b) when transition steps such as surgery and hormones are taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cause people are judgemental dicks. It&#39;s pretty obvious. Go dress up in cross dress &amp; walk down the street. All the bs you get called, stuff thrown at you, threats etc. Now walk into the opposite sex toilets. That&#39;s why the high post op rate exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Toronto Sun article is about a study and includes links to the cited study. Yes, the final one was just an article, but I provided it to show that that study is often misinterpreted. You don&#39;t need studies to show that suicide is a result of discrimination and lack of support. When supported by their community and given access to transition related healthcare, trans suicide rates go down. Full stop. I&#39;m not sure why you oppose trans people (and if I&#39;m wrong in believing you&#39;re against trans rights, please, correct me). This is the civil rights issue of our time and, as had been proven time and time again, history will look poorly upon those working against progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/"><strong>study</strong></a> frequently misrepresented as supposed showing high rates of suicide after transition says absolutely nothing like that.</p>

<p>The study found no statistically significant difference between the suicide rates of trans people who transitioned between 1989 and 2003, and the general population.</p>

<p>A slightly higher than average suicide rate was only found among people who transitioned prior to 1989. And even then, the suicide rate was only 2.7%, with suicide attempt rates at 7.9% (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/table/pone-0016885-t002/"><strong>Table 2</strong></a>). This is higher than the general average, but considerably lower than the <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf"><strong>40%</strong></a> rate of suicide attempts among trans people <em>before</em> transition.</p>

<p>Transition <em>vastly decreases</em> suicide risk. What slightly heightened risk remains is a result of the cumulative abuse, discrimination, degradation and violence the victims is subjected to. And even with this widespread mistreatment, it is still <em>much better</em> than the conditions they suffer by not transitioning.</p>

<p>See <a href="/u/Chel_of_the_sea">/u/Chel_of_the_sea</a>&#39;s post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/367d1j/cmv_being_transgender_to_the_point_of_wanting/crbe84o"><strong>here</strong></a> for information on the incredible benefit transition has to the psychological and emotional health and functionality of trans people.</p>
