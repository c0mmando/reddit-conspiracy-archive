He left so many breadcrumbs... videos, phone numbers, names, dates. I can&#39;t believe web slueths aren&#39;t all over this. I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if anonymous showed up. And yet... nothing.</p>

<p>Are there developments somewhere that I&#39;ve been missing? Has this all been found to be the ramblings of a mad man? I mean, who WAS that guy standing outside the carpet cleaning van? His face is so visible. Nobody recognized him? Is he LE? Maybe somebody with a felony working for a deal? And what WAS the deal with the neighbor&#39;s rental?</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m on the assumption that Lang&#39;s theory wasn&#39;t what materialized. The details needed to bolster or dismiss his ideas were there in his posts. It seems like somebody, somewhere must have dug into it. If they&#39;d found anything supporting Lang I feel like we&#39;d be hearing about it.</p>

<p>His coroner report is still pending, I&#39;m checking on it multiple times a day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve identified his ex wife and sister through public records and tracked down their Facebook profiles in an effort to reach out to them and see if either has information or even a photo of the guy.</p>

<p>All Fresno media outlets, and especially ABC30, have gone pretty dark on the story and are already pushing the suicide narrative before the coroner has made it official.</p>

<p>As a Fresno native and a big fan of whistleblowers, I&#39;ve been digging into this on a daily basis whether this sub stays on board or not...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I want to clarify my frustration here. Reddit has a history of web sleuthing, and it&#39;s not all pretty. I know I know there&#39;s the Boston Bombing fiasco. Valid point. But here is the problem: The Boston Bombing wasn&#39;t truly ripe for reddit. The mainstream media was on it. The FBI was on it. Homeland security, in general, was on it. And reddit&#39;s attitude was &quot;We&#39;re going to find what none of them can&quot; and it backfired. Now I feel like everyone is shellshocked. Scared. Inactive.</p>

<p>I&#39;m the first to admit, I&#39;m not one of the web sleuths. And I&#39;m not going to become one in the John Lang case. But my frustration is that I KNOW there are many out there who ARE web sleuths. So I have to ask....</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>the fuck</p>

<p>are you?</p>

<p>What are you working on that is better than this?! And why should this be better than other things? Because this is a case that IS ripe for reddit. Mainstream media isn&#39;t on it. Big gov agencies have seemingly taken the path of least resistance and concluded that Lang is a paranoid crazy. If that isn&#39;t true, YOU are the one that can prove it. YOU are the one who has the tools nobody is using. (that Lang so diligently left you) YOU are the one who could resist spinning your wheels on the story that mainstream media has <em>told</em> you is important, and instead be the one telling mainstream media <em>this</em> IS the important story you should be telling and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Stop living in fear! For fuck&#39;s sake NOBODY is <em>on</em> this goddamn story. If it&#39;s solved, if YOU can solve it, the entirety of our justice system&#39;s integrity hangs in the balance. That&#39;s a big deal.</p>

<p>This story IS ripe for reddit. And, Reddit, please do what you do. We need you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/ButcherCover">/r/ButcherCover</a> -- Your point is well taken. What am I doing on this? Nothing. But, the fact is, I&#39;ve chosen my avenue of activism elsewhere and I&#39;m knee deep in it. While it isn&#39;t their forte, I can assure you that my efforts will ultimately help people. Perhaps even web slueths to some extent. Not, in the sluething, but their lives in general. I&#39;m &quot;doing&quot; something, it just isn&#39;t this. But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t ask the question. The consequence of what has happened in fresno affects all americans. I do my thing, they do theirs. And they can be great at it! So this, for me, is appealing to experts the same way you appeal to your doctor for truth. You guys do this stuff all the time, you know how to do it, so why haven&#39;t we heard about where all those phone numbers lead, or who the guy is outside the van, or who&#39;s in the van thermal imaging, or what actually IS &quot;Garaunteed&quot; cleaning.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, butcher, but Lang teed this up beautifully and folks apparently are sitting back waiting for the mainstream to take this ball and run with it. I don&#39;t get it. I do my best for change in areas I&#39;m active and respect other&#39;s right to question my efforts, and how they could be more effective, even if they aren&#39;t &quot;in the trenches&quot; themselves. So it&#39;s the reverse here, I&#39;m questioning <em>their</em> efforts and feel rightful in doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I was afraid of. So sad. It seemed like Lang was essentially saying &quot;I know this is going to happen... here are the tools if it does.&quot; And nobody is using the tools. Admittedly, I&#39;m among them. But, at the end of the day, I never am. I&#39;m on another path. But, I&#39;m happy to support those who do, and many are passionate about doing so. So, where the fuck are they? Seriously. I don&#39;t mean to sound like a dick. I admit I&#39;m not the guy, but what I&#39;m saying is that history has borne out that there are &quot;the guys&quot; out there. People who do sleuth. People who do aggressively investigate dubious stories <em>in general</em>. Where are they? What are they currently looking into? Why isn&#39;t it this?</p>

<p>What you are speaking to is an undated idea that the internet still clings to, that Anon will deliver us.

    <div class="md"><p>So sad. But, again, that makes the stakes all the greater. Why not return reddit to the forefront with explosive data on this story? If reddit were credited with breaking it, how big would that be for the community? Redditors have a history of getting their hooks into things and producing results (when they want to). And, if they did want to, we&#39;d know a lot more about this story now. So one can fairly conclude (<a href="/r/osairis">/r/osairis</a> aside) that the typical group of reddit web slueths aren&#39;t on this. The story has the chance to do some much needed damage control for the reputation of reddit. To say nothing of justice itself.</p>

<p>The conspiracy includes, according to his own videos and writings: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Fresno Police Chief and dozens of officers</p></li>
<li><p>The county water supervisor</p></li>
<li><p>Dozens of municipal employees including Department of Public Works employees who never questioned why they were going into someone&#39;s house and moving things, </p></li>
<li><p>Several fake neighbors paid to live near the guy <em>for over 7 years,</em> </p></li>
<li><p>Several dogs and dog walkers designed to condition his own dogs into submission by merely walking them past his house at night,</p></li>
<li><p>At least 100 unique individuals who pass by his house </p></li>
<li><p>Owners  and employees of several fake front companies (plumbers and cleaning companies)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I was aware.  If we establish that police corruption exists, and that gang stalking exists, nothing whatsoever precludes them from happening together.  Particularly if the public doubt that it&#39;s happening so much that they don&#39;t want it investigated further.  Thus, police gang stalking - if and where it happens - is both funded and passively enabled by much of the public, and this is a vital matter the citizenry needs to hear about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing I wrote would indicate that. </p>

<p>The website I named goes into detail about the factual history of Cointelpro, and describes some of the ways that Cointelpro still operates. What&#39;s crazy about that?</p>

<p>When I was younger I never would have believed that Cointelpro ever existed. I would have rationalized it away, even in the face of evidence. But everything about our current society washes that brand of skepticism away. You have to be foolish <em>not</em> to believe it. It is not longer a willful ignorance, but a stubborn and stupid denial.</p>

<p>Anyone can make a conspiracy in their head. As far as reddit detective work look up salt lake city daycare. Members of reddit and 4chan committed crimes to figure this out. </p>

<p>Problem with them is they want to find something wrong. Hell after Sandy hook someone posted the address and names of people involved with children dead. Sure its public record, but its just not good.</p>
