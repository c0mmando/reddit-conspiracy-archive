        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;ve noticed the number of posts that have received disproportionate vote counts for their post quality, this may explain why. </p>

<p>Sites like <a href="http://boostupvotes.com">http://boostupvotes.com</a> and <a href="http://buyredvpotes.com/">http://buyredvpotes.com/</a> are selling upvote packages with up to 1000 upvotes, close to the number of upvotes needed to get almost anything to the front page of Reddit. </p>

<p>Just looking at BoostUpvotes they&#39;re selling 500 upvotes for $77, which would seem like a fairly high price at first. When you consider how much PR and marketing companies spend to change the public view of their companies in other ways it would almost be surprising if most companies weren&#39;t at least thinking of using these upvote services to manipulate Reddit&#39;s userbaseand get PR and attention for their products. </p>

<p>I see the &quot;forcibly&quot; part in action when I browse numerous threads. Someone will bring up something that&#39;s totally relevant to what&#39;s being discussed in an unorthodox manner and some other lemming will respond along the lines of &quot;take it to r/conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>I, however, am in the business of returning r/conspiracy to r/eddit :)</p>

Basically, the main retardation-points of this website are misleading titles, then top comments/outrageously long response chains to a single top comment, then low quality reposts. My main argument to make this place better, is let us see exact analytics on the flow of upvotes and downvotes on posts and comments, down to a second. They will never do that as it would show how terribly affected this place is with artificial votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve been doing this for a long time.  When I was doing internet marketing years ago there were guys buying these packages to boost their websites up in the search engines and to get page views.  So it&#39;s not just for propaganda but it&#39;s also for marketing.  They also buy and sell old reddit accounts for this purpose.  There&#39;s a massive market for old reddit accounts.</p>

<p>A lot of internet marketers with older accounts will ban together and up vote each others stuff too.  One good thing is that they always complained about how it was hard to do this on reddit because people were too smart.  At least we&#39;ve got that going for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont even need to buy old accounts. Just create a bunch of new ones, feed the credentials into a well written bot system and it will start to seed those new accounts with fat karma by simply reposting old high-karma posts from years ago and cross posting the most successful comments with different accounts.</p>

<p>If you pay close enough attention you can already see it in action. Most of the shit on the front page are reposts, same content, same exact title, the same comments.</p>

<p>Once you have enough karma-seeded accounts, you simply program them to behave similar to human users to stay below detection. You can obfuscate deliberate karma manipulation with random votes on non-target posts.</p>

<p>When you get an order for upvotes, you spread the manipulation out over a few hours between a randomly rotating set of shill accounts.</p>

<p>It is impossible for reddit to detect a smart enough rig. Thats why they have to resort to vote fuzzing and fake downvotes to balance out their estimation of how much rigging is going on.</p>
