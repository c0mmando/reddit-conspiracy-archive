       If you've noticed the number of posts that have received disproportionate vote counts for their post quality, this may explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sites like
       <a href="http://boostupvotes.com">
        http://boostupvotes.com
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://buyredvpotes.com/">
        http://buyredvpotes.com/
       </a>
       are selling upvote packages with up to 1000 upvotes, close to the number of upvotes needed to get almost anything to the front page of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just looking at BoostUpvotes they're selling 500 upvotes for $77, which would seem like a fairly high price at first. When you consider how much PR and marketing companies spend to change the public view of their companies in other ways it would almost be surprising if most companies weren't at least thinking of using these upvote services to manipulate Reddit's userbaseand get PR and attention for their products.

       Yeah... not really true because I used to work for a marketing agency that has been scammed by all these:

       I see the "forcibly" part in action when I browse numerous threads. Someone will bring up something that's totally relevant to what's being discussed in an unorthodox manner and some other lemming will respond along the lines of "take it to r/conspiracy."

       It all started right after the removal of seeing how many downvotes a post has. For the last 2 years, I've pointed those posts out as a method to water down the actual substance and community this place used to have. And don't even get me started on how badly top comments have destroyed this website.

       There's a lot of depth to the comment issue. Basically, the main retardation-points of this website are misleading titles, then top comments/outrageously long response chains to a single top comment, then low quality reposts. My main argument to make this place better, is let us see exact analytics on the flow of upvotes and downvotes on posts and comments, down to a second. They will never do that as it would show how terribly affected this place is with artificial votes.

       They've been doing this for a long time.  When I was doing internet marketing years ago there were guys buying these packages to boost their websites up in the search engines and to get page views.  So it's not just for propaganda but it's also for marketing.  They also buy and sell old reddit accounts for this purpose.  There's a massive market for old reddit accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of internet marketers with older accounts will ban together and up vote each others stuff too.  One good thing is that they always complained about how it was hard to do this on reddit because people were too smart.  At least we've got that going for us.

       You dont even need to buy old accounts. Just create a bunch of new ones, feed the credentials into a well written bot system and it will start to seed those new accounts with fat karma by simply reposting old high-karma posts from years ago and cross posting the most successful comments with different accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pay close enough attention you can already see it in action. Most of the shit on the front page are reposts, same content, same exact title, the same comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have enough karma-seeded accounts, you simply program them to behave similar to human users to stay below detection. You can obfuscate deliberate karma manipulation with random votes on non-target posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get an order for upvotes, you spread the manipulation out over a few hours between a randomly rotating set of shill accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible for reddit to detect a smart enough rig. Thats why they have to resort to vote fuzzing and fake downvotes to balance out their estimation of how much rigging is going on.

       That's very interesting, and it's a lot cheaper to do that way too.  They just need a ton of proxies.  Man we are so screwed.  I wish we could fight back by playing their own game.  It's a catch 22 because then we'd be doing the exact thing we're fighting against.

       Thats why I mentioned using TOR. There are thousands of exit nodes you can use to hide your real location.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is just what you can do without breaking the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if you had access to black hat resources such as bot nets, compromised networks, etc.

       With a combination of server space, TOR, death by captcha, and some time, I could easily set up a network of bot accounts to do just this. It's ridiculously easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also set up a click farm in some shit hole country if you had the right contacts and startup capital.

       Someone created a click farm for captchas, and an API to send the image to their system, have some click monkey type in the result, it sends it back, you post the form data... wham. You pay a few cents for a human to solve it for your bot.

       small part of me is pondering if it would be worth it for us to get together and fight fire with fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       there have been so many awesomely written posts and exposes done in this sub, why not use their own tactics against them and force them to the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't like the idea of feeding these companies but the reality is what they are doing is working and drowning out real peoples views, the only issue at that point is douchey mods deleting what they disagree with.

       Running the franchise into the ground! The intelligentsia left the boat a long time ago, after they turned Reddit into a Political Correct, (Ironfist) Censored, Commercialized Media Platform. Those (smart &amp; educated people) who did not leave willingly has been systematically banned for posting unwelcome input (the truth). Now it has become a echo camper for the Corporate Owned Mass Media, populated by idiots and fools cheering along the path of mediocrity, padding each other on the back. You might as well get drunk and watch Fox News or participate in a US presidential election!
