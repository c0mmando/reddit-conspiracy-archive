       Free university is done in other nations because facilitating economic growth leads to an expanded tax base.  It was also done in the U.S. with the G.I. Bill.  It's ordinary common sense, like building freeways &amp; ports to facilitate economic growth.

        No.
       </strong>
       Government has three primary functions. It should provide for military defense of the nation. It should enforce contracts between individuals. It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property. When government–in pursuit of good intentions–tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost comes in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player.

       Except that’s not at all how it works. Tuitions have exploded because of government loans. End all government loans and they’ll be forced back where they belong.

       Retard McMoron has absolutely no right to get a worthless fucking degree in “gender studies” ON MY DIME and then go on the dole for the rest of his life ON MY DIME because no one sane would hire him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government actually operated like it should, government loans would only be applicable for specific majors AND success therein. If you want a degree in 18th century Spanish lesbian poetry, you’re paying for it yourself. And if you fail your engineering classes, your government loan is revoked entirely.

       1) socialism only works when someone else is footing the bill. Your appeal to stupidity is meaningless, because we pay for Europe’s defense. That’s the only way they can have “free” healthcare. Note that their systems are collapsing entirely and their quality of care pales in comparison to ours.

       How have democracies faired in the past? Are we still waiting for the great American experiment to end? Oh and I'm guessing you won't be taking out any social security, Medicare, or using tax dollars in any way in the future? I think socialism has been here for a while, most are too blind to realise it. Society is changing, and so should govt. Checks and balances are meaningless when everyone is just giving money to get their point across.

       No, governments did, otherwise your 9 year old would be working in a factory 60-80 hours a week. Regulated capitalism is fine, unregulated capitalism eats its young. And governments provide the infrastructure to allow capitalism to survive and profit.

       I always thought the idiot was the one who had to resort to name calling to make his point because he lacked the communications skills to make it on his own . But thanks for correcting me. I really appreciate your deep insight. You must be a real intellectual. You have a great future here on reddit, little guy.

       Pro tip: government is the reason that third world 9 year olds are doing just that. Not capitalism.

       If I was an intellectual, that’d be true. “Intellectual” is a grave insult. You know nothing whatsoever about this topic and are deluded into thinking that commies are sane.

       Fuck property taxes entirely! They’re not constitutional. You literally cannot ever own
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       anymore. You have to pay it until you die or the government takes your house (which you may own) on the land itself.
