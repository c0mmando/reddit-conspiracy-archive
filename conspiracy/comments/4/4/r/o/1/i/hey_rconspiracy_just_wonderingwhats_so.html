<p>OP left a message talking about experiencing some &quot;brain zaps&quot;, and as you can see in the responses I left, I was like &quot;wth is a brain zap?&quot;  Went back and forth with OP for a little bit...and then <em>zap</em> (pardon the pun) - his OP was just gone.</p>

<p>So then I asked &quot;Bro, what happened?  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/44n2pm/brain_zaps/czrbhac">Why&#39;d you delete what you posted?</a>&quot; and he said &quot;What?  I didn&#39;t delete it?&quot;</p>

<p>and I said &quot;Yes you did, man.  It&#39;s no longer up.&quot;</p>

<p>and he said &quot;I didn&#39;t do that.  The mods must have deleted it.&quot;</p>

<p>So...either dude&#39;s fucking with me, or...or what?  The mods deleted a post about &quot;brain zaps&quot; for some reason or the other?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused.  Somebody ELI5 or something.  What&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>EDIT:  There&#39;s also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/44n2pm/brain_zaps/czs3ib0?context=3">this post right here by /u/whipnil</a> that made me wonder even more what&#39;s going on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experienced &quot;brain zaps&quot; about 5 years ago when my psychiatrists would not refill my prescription for anti-depressants. It feels like an electric jolt in your brain which caused me extreme pain and nausea. The pharmacy finally ordered an emergency supply of my meds, just enough to wean me off them. 
Long story short that experience confirmed that taking anti depressants was doing more damage than good; I felt that as long as I was medicated and reliant on prescriptions I would be trapped and helpless if my DRs once again decided to withhold the very meds THEY got me hooked on.
Once you let them medicate you, they control you.
Those brain zaps lasted about 4 days until the emergency supply was given to me which I then took in smaller and smaller doses until I was weened after 4 weeks. Those brain zaps changed me; they traumatized me. My boyfriend had to take days off of work to be with me as I went through that and he too will never forget the misery I was in. I worry at times that my thought processes have been altered even since that experience, but negativity aside, it opened my eyes to the dangers of anti depressants and dependancy.</p>

<p>Independent of what you said about your brain zap experience (which I don&#39;t discount or doubt happened at all), I would nonetheless agree with you that taking meds of that sort are usually more harmful than helpful.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  I have a really good buddy of mine that&#39;s been on them for a <em>long</em> time.  He found himself without them during a trip he took, and got so twisted in the process that when he got back a few days later, ended up eventually waking up to find out that he A) got in a massive fight w/the girl he was w/at the time, B) punched <em>through</em> a car window (he&#39;s a massively huge dude), and C) ended up in the hospital with a grip of pins put in his arm since he shattered his hand after punching through the car window.  Fucking good times.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very glad you are more aware, knowledgeable, and conscioenscious about the negative effects such things can have on a person.</p>

<p>Thanks again for coming on here and sharing your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, if the technology exists, which I tend to believe it does, then it most definitely has been used and some of the claims are probably true. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is what if perceived EM targeting symptoms is actually just due to natural occurrences like atmospheric pressure or sinus pressure or whatever, and they are trying to implant this idea in the &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; who read this kind of stuff, that maybe their ears just popped or they have a head ache because they&#39;re being bombarded with microwaves, fostering paranoia.</p>

<p>Weaponized ideas. It&#39;s a concept I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while now. It started with the &#39;nocebo&#39; effect, the opposite of placebo, where exposure to something you perceive as detrimental to your health (whether it&#39;s an actual threat or not) will cause a negative physiological impact. </p>

<p>I like to give the benefit of the doubt though and hear everyone out, that&#39;s just my two cents. Thanks for posting this by the way, strange how it&#39;s -radio silence- from the mods. </p>

<p>While it seems very correct indeed to say that a good portion of the aches and pains that people get are likely due to <em>non</em> EM things, if indeed EM targeting exists (and both of us seem to think it does), then it would also seem that at least <em>some</em> of those individuals that make mention of it bothering them <em>are</em> indeed valid in their claims.</p>

<p>As such,it seems that preceived EM targeting symptoms aren&#39;t <em>only</em> due to just natural occurrences and they <em>can</em> indeed be manipulated by others/outside forces.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that itself placebo?  If you <em>think</em> you&#39;ll be effected by exposure to something, and you end up being effected regardless of whether it&#39;s an actual threat or not, then it <em>is</em> a placebo, right?</p>

<p>Quoted from the mod that removed the post in question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;d have to agree that the post was pretty vague and that the OP made no attempt to even describe the phenomena which vexes him/her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I removed the post which only used a 2 word title:  Brain Zaps</p>

<p>There were only 3 or 4 short sentences which made up the rest of the self-post...OP didn&#39;t elaborate on &quot;brain zaps&quot; except to say the brain zaps began after watching Loose Change in 2006 (was it the 9/11 documentary--or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfHQ3ToiqE">Taylor Steele&#39;s surfing movie</a>?)  </p>

<p>Out of 4 sentences--half of those were questions.</p>

<p>I checked the user history--which was very short but revealed nothing (so I didn&#39;t consider it in my overall decision).</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a agenda against EMF warfare posts, I&#39;ve seen many of them myself thrive here.  The navy yard shooter spawned quite a few.  </p>

<p>This particular post got noticed, was vague and also, to me, seemed like a plea for medical advice... Which we shouldnt really jump into IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brain zap seems to be a viable topic here, like anything else. Something tells me the OP may have been a troll from TMOR. They had already been harassing a user who was posting a lot about brain zaps and EMF recently. What these trolls would do is create mock questions in various subs to get the regulars and experts to team up against this one guy&#39;s viewpoint in a convoluted attempt at proving him wrong or something. Once their ruse was up, they&#39;d delete the fake accounts and start over. A little crowd-sourced beat down for one guy they really don&#39;t like. Just a guess though...I didn&#39;t catch the OP. I&#39;m guessing it was leaning towards not being a legitimate discussion anyway.</p>

<p>I believe I was the individual who he communicated with the most in that OP - if not the <em>only</em> individual he communicated with in his post - and, although he seemed very vague, he didn&#39;t strike me as a <em>troll</em> per se.</p>

<p>Oh.  Okay.  I certainly didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>I can understand that tactic getting used - and it is indeed a shitty one definitely.  However, it didn&#39;t seem to me that they were using that with me when I was questioning them.  Vague?  Yes.  Trollish?  I didn&#39;t feel that in particular.</p>

<p>I caught it, and although definitely vague, I didn&#39;t get the impression that it was posted specifically to troll anyone or the subject, ect.  I could be wrong though.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s a troll, then so be it.  He seemed like a mighty bad one, however, in the sense that I didn&#39;t get any troll vibe from him when I communicated with him.</p>
