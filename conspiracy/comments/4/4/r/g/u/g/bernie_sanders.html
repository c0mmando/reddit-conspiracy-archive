       I just want to do a quick poll. How many of us, if any, here on reddit (I'm speaking to Americans, anyone else; chill the fuck out) support Bernie Sanders? I'm just curious. I am wondering how close we are to him actually becoming president?

       I'm not planning on voting. I feel like we are damned if we do damned if we don't with every candidate. Plus I also believe Americans voting doesn't mean shit anymore and all of this is just a big charade.

       I understand your position. However, I think it's possible he's some kind of intelligence program/plant. I mean the youth of America LOVE the guy. Maybe he is just there to get our hopes up, only to disappoint in the election, but, maybe he's there to really win. If the guy wins, what next? UN takeover? Israeli takeover? I don't know. I'm very intrigued by this guy, and not in a good way. He wants to make us more like the rest of the world (which would  be good in some ways, bad in others) and for that I'm a little suspicious. I mean, didn't we see this play out with Obama already?

       I agree with you. He almost seems too good to be true . Just waiting for the other boot to drop. That said, he is still my first choice. I however feel like voting really won't matter in the end . What ever candidate  tptb what in office will be elected.

       Luckily i live in Texas and we typically dont put up with that sort of shit. We have a $9 billion budget surplus, a booming economy across multiple sectors (Energy, Medical, Pharma, Finance, Real Estate, Ranching, Private Water), &lt;$1.00/gl gas and a low cost of living. I highly doubt Bernie Sanders is going to be able to stick his grubby ass hands on any of it. The fact is, if someone promises me a bunch of free shit and doesn't explain the economics of it, i assume they will also show me the unicorn farm, its just a bunch of bull to get elected by the E Pluribus Venom.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 Trillion Dollar Annual Budget of Free Shit is either going to be Zombienomics (bloated dead economy just siphoning markets to rob Peter to pay Paul) or what the educated call "Hocus Pocus Fuckery"

       quite the opposite is true.  millenials are the most educated generation america has ever seen, but they are also the lowest paid generation america has ever seen.  its no wonder they love this guy.

       yeah, they exist.  anytime someone says "all young people today are just lazy, stupid, worthless etc etc" is shortsighted.  all previous generations said that about the up and coming generations.

       Thats a natural transition. I am not that old, i remember being young and i thought i was an indestructible moron. Its the nature of youth. However, the successful ones of a generation, typically start pretty young and dont get caught up in things they have 0 control over. They can decipher the concept of the circle of influence vs. the circle of concern. fairly easy and their life is pretty productive

       Of course the youth love him. If you just got thrust into the real world, and things were more grim and harder than you ever thought, you'd want to elect someone who would give you everything you needed without having to sacrifice and work hard for it just like mommy and daddy did the past 20 years too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the unreality of the hardline "bootstraps" mentality, especially in the face of the waning american dream, but the youth of today still want to be coddled as adults (see "safe spaces"). They have gone entirely too far the other direction.

       To the original topic, of all the candidates around, Sanders will sell the US out to Israel the fastest. And that's saying something considering the competition.

       Looks like I pushed a button. Maybe you should go out and change something instead of blaming the previous generation?!

       Say what you will about the cushy setup the baby boomers made for themselves at the expense of their kids, they ended a fucking war by protesting. What has this generation done except sign away their liberties and whine about it? lol

       The Youth love him as a result of the 90's everyone gets a trophy bullshit. Basically, Bernie is saying "you dont even have to try and ill reward you, college will be free, your debts forgiven, ill give you money, healthcare and tuck you in at night, just like your parents did when you were a child" The "Everyone gets a trophy" concept started in youth programs and public schools in the 90s, the youth today are a direct result as they become of voting age

       ITT: a bunch of ignorant, boisterous nuts who would sooner shoot themselves in the face than ever allow that "evil socialist man" to stick his "grubby fingers" in what they've "earned" by being born. Never seen so many angry old scared white men. The anti-Sanders crowd is just as depressing and backwards as what they claim to fighting against.

       Newsflash: young people are smarter than the nitwits in this thread. The sheer amount of mockery and slander illustrates perfectly how the current generation has set up the next several for failure. It also illustrates how fucking gullible you guys are. The $18 trillion myth has long been dispelled, along with a lot of the other shit people love to falsely point out. Then again, this sub has moon-landing hoaxers as visitors too. Don't take yourselves too seriously ;)

Who allowed and encouraged the behavior trends being generalized across today's young people? Right. The generation before them.  Buck's gotta stop somewhere.

       But, but, but....they fought in wars! Real wars! They must be right about stuff! Pulled themselves up by the bootstraps, all of them. None of them benefited from being white and priveliged, or having rich parents, none of them.

      <p>
       The way old right-wingers talk is ridiculous. They don't want a single thing to change, because they got theirs. Fuck everyone else. That's the baby boomers for you. At least the ones I've met or heard speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind the world has completely changed, the job market is entirely different, and society doesn't depend on world wars to keep the economies spinning.... And people are waking up. Going into the army doesn't make you a hero anymore. Most guys I knew went for free or substantially reduced college rates.

       Marxism has universally failed and cannot succeed, by definition. How stupid do you have to be to want someone who believes in it in charge of you?

       I will also point that every election since Woodrow Wilson has been Hegelian in nature. Both sides are apart of the same coin. They will do and say whatever is necessary to get and remain elected. If the power behind the throne demands something, it will happen regardless of Dem or Rep at that point. Thats why the spiral down has been pretty consistent since ole Woodrow boned us by allow the elitist to co-op his presidency

       i know my vote doesnt count.  but like captain america rying to get in the army even though he knew he was ineligible, i still vote.  im voting for sanders in the primary.  i vote democrat about 80% of the time.  im not voting for hilary because i feel as though shes already bought and paid for by wallstreet and others.  im not voting for trump because of obvious reasons.  and the rest of the GOP field doesnt stand for anything close to what i stand for.  i wanted jim webb to get the nomination, but it was a pipedream.  sanders is a good second though.

       I will never support a self defined socialist. Fascism takes the guise of socialism to obtain power, then morphs into a totalitarian state once that power is obtained. I would prefer a reptilian overlord that supports big business than a bloated government that tries to dismantle the country so that it can co-op it.
