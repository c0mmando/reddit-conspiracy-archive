<p><strong>Some Excerpts:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, John Kennedy had problems of the same kind, and he fired Dulles. And that was a no-no. You don’t fire people like Dulles. Kennedy embarked on a new course. He talked with Khrushchev, he had people, interlocutors, who talked with Castro, and, worst of all, he issued two executive orders, saying that 1,000 U.S troops would be pulled out of Vietnam by the end of 1963 and the bulk of the rest by 1965. He was going to give up Southeast Asia to the Commies, and God knows what would happen next with the dominoes falling and Indonesia, and my God… So he was killed by the “deep state.”</p>

<p>I am, and I am also familiar with an earlier book by James Douglass, which is the most persuasive of all. It’s called “J.F.K and the Unspeakable.” Now this is all necessary background, because when Obama comes in, even though it’s been a lot of years, he faces the same kind of military power—even enlarged—and a security apparatus that has grown like topsy since 9/11. The CIA’s budget has grown three-fold since 9/11.</p>

<p>There are aspirations and then there are policies. I think we really can’t talk in terms of a unitary policy being made by a government as headed by Obama. I do not see Barack Obama as being in control. I see him buffeted about, very inexperienced, advised by similarly inexperienced advisers on foreign policy.</p>

<p>You may recall that [at the RT conference] I cited a secondhand report from a very reliable source who told me that his source was at a small gathering where President Obama was talking to well-heeled supporters. There was a lot of criticism to the effect, “You’re supposed to be a progressive. We put you in there and gave you a lot of money, so why don’t you act like a progressive?” Finally, Obama stands up and he says, “Look, it’s all very well for you to criticize me, but don’t you remember what happened to Dr. King?” If I had anything but the utmost respect for my primary source, I would not be repeating this. But I can very easily believe it happened. When people say, “If he felt that way he shouldn’t have tried to be president,” well, that’s easy to say. You get pushed into these positions, even if he’s just afraid for his children or for Michelle. So I am willing to include that as a factor for why Obama often seems wishy-washy. Others say, “Ray, for God’s sake he’s 100 percent in with them. [Laughs] </p>

He&#39;s one that&#39;s been speaking for a LONG time time and nothing has ever come of anything he&#39;s said.  not to say he&#39;s not right or accurate, but after years and years of claims by McGovern, nothing happens.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a reason to respect him, not to not respect him. He continues the good fight even though he knows that he cannot win. The reason that nothing happens is not the fault of McGovern. The MSM does not cover his message, and therefore it does not reach the people. The people are dumbed down and strung out on beer and TV. These things are not his fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Vietnam bills were a final slap in the face as they were taking place very close to JFKs death. It definitely played a role because Johnson and the joint chiefs had counter bills waiting in the wings. One NSAM was passed the day after JFK died that effectively reversed the planned pull out and implemented the road to troop insertion, if I recall correctly. </p>

<p>Kennedy was outright attacking the military industrial complex, and wanted to minimize their power. That&#39;s the key reason why he was killed. Vietnam was but a part of that. Deescilating the Cold War, not sending in troops to the Bay of Pigs, being cautious during the Missile Crisis, shooting down Lemnitzer and Operation Northwoods, Firing Dulles, wanting to &quot;crush the CIA into a million pieces,&quot; filtering money from the military into scientific research (NASA), Civil Rights, etc. All part of removing power from the military industrial complex, or deep state. He was a threat to their power, which has clearly been made evident in the years hence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. This article is sorta shitty. It is not that I disagree with McGovern&#39;s statements so much. It is just that there is not much supporting evidence provided..
