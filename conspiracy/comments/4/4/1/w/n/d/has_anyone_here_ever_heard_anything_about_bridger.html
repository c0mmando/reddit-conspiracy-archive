       In a Martin Shkreli interview from earlier this morning on The Breakfast Club(a mainly hip-hop station), Charlemagne Tha God mentions this place and Martin is pretty blown away by the fact that he does business there.
      </p>
      <p>
       He starts treating him completely different and refers back to this place several times during the interview.

       No, Skreli is a douche and Charlemagne was calling him out for it. He's not a rapper and didn't have to respond in the way he is, which is only making him look further like an attention seeking douche.

       Come on man. Not defending shkrelis antics but if Charlemagne wanted to really call him out he couldve been less lazy. Shkreli had no problem subtlety pointing him out to be the real douche without ever really getting in his face. Watch him backtrack on the 36 seasons comment.

       This is pretty spot on except for a few things.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are a large portion of pedos in this uber elite illuminatis and they abuse children, look up the stuff in England for examples.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some of them for sure follow the left hand path. Whether this is something they openly talk about? The LHP is very popular with the Hollywood elites.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are things that have been in the works since the 50's that are only just now coming to fruition. This takes major planning and passing down thru generations.

       Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi, "recognized as the founder of the first popular movement for a united Europe", wrote in 1925 :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.

       Not at all. This man in question supports jews, not the white race.

       Check his other quote :
       <em>
        Instead of destroying European Jewry, Europe, against its own will, refined and educated this people into a future leader-nation through this artificial selection process. No wonder that this people, that escaped Ghetto-Prison, developed into a spiritual nobility of Europe. Therefore a gracious Providence provided Europe with a new race of nobility by the Grace of Spirit. This happened at the moment when Europe's feudal aristocracy became dilapidated, and thanks to Jewish emancipation.

       I'm just curious as to how you are so sure there is nothing else above what those elites do besides wealth accumulation and control?

       Totally agree, but at some point there is going to be too many of us for the planets resources to support. So considering these elites will maintain control till that happens, then what's the endgame?

       It's the same in advertising (my industry). Everyone thinks we're all super geniuses trying to fuck everyone over and manipulate people, but the reality is most people are just normal people who wanted to be an artist but didn't have the guts to live without a salary. Half the things people post on
       <a href="/r/hailcorporate">

       are just coincidence, and what people think is malice is often incompetence.

       I think incompetence and personal greed are much more prevalent in the world than manipulation and evil.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        shill - an accomplice of a confidence trickster or swindler who poses as a genuine customer to entice or encourage others.

      <p>
       In what way am I posing as anything? My account goes back 5.5 years. It's my real name, and if you Google it you'll find about 30 different social media profiles that have tons of info on who I am and what I do. You could find out my place of work, my height, my weight, my favourite sports teams, and pretty much anything you want about me simply by Googling my username. I've done lots of public speaking on advertising which you can find on YouTube and Vimeo, often to audiences in the 1000s. I talk about advertising regularly on here (and contribute to
       <a href="/r/advertising">
        /r/advertising
       </a>
       amongst others) but always fully disclose my involvement with any brands before posting about them, and have done for years. I'm the complete OPPOSITE of posing as something I'm not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you don't like or agree with my (informed) opinion doesn't mean it's incorrect or I'm trying to trick anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying advertising is full of saints or that we all want the best for anyone. I'm just saying it's full of incompetent people who couldn't trick you if their life depended on it, and people who wish they were artists and begrudge their role. Obviously some bad shit goes on, but a hell of a lot less than you'd think.

       Out of curiosity, what is it about the conspiracy subreddit that causes you to frequent it? I often wonder about the demographics about this subreddit....I've often got the sense it's a buncha paranoid schizos, def don't expect to see advertising execs and angel investors in here. What conspiracy-related is appealing to you, if you don't mind me asking?

       I don't really frequent it, I just watched the same vid and ended up here via Google. I do use reddit all the time (too much if anything), but not really on this sub much.

      <p>
       I'm all for skeptical thinking, but I think people are too quick to reject anything that challenges their assumptions here. Becomes too much of an echo chamber for me, even though some of the ideas probably have a kernel of truth to them.

       Really interested to find out more about the topic in OP though. Looked like Charlemagne fucked up mentioning it.

       EDIT: Worth mentioning that lots of advertising people use reddit - not to push shit to you, but to take stuff from you. Reddit is funny as fuck (at times) and has lots of witty observations and insights that are useful for advertising. Obviously some people get it wrong and end up on
       <a href="/r/fellowkids">
        /r/fellowkids

       How does either of us match your definition? You said 'without disclosing they have a close relationship', yet both of us explicitly did that in the opening sentence.

      <p>
       You're definition of 'shill' is basically 'anyone who knows what they're talking about'.

       In what way am I grunt level? I'm not saying I'm Martin Sorrell, but I have met him. He was in the green room with me when I spoke at Cannes last year alongside Al Gore, David Droga, Maurice Levy, etc. He's the most influential person in advertising (worth about $250 mil) and I spent close to an hour with him last June.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not one of the people running the ad business, but I do get a lot of exposure to them. I've been on private yachts with C-level people from WPP, Publicis, Omnicom, etc. I regularly get paid to fly to different conferences around the world (4 different continents so far, 14 different cities around the world last year) where I speak to audiences of thousands. My work has been covered by every major publication in the world (The Guardian, The Daily Mail, The Times, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, etc). Sources for all of this on my
       <a href="http://www.felixmorgan.com">
        website
       </a>
       , but also on Google generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying any of this shit to show off, but just to show how you don't know what you're talking about. I may not be at the top of the pyramid in advertising (and I'm definitely not, don't get me wrong) but I definitely have more of an educated perspective than you do.

       I didn't deny shady shit goes on, I'm just saying less shady shit goes on than people think. Your average video that gets to the top of
       <a href="/r/hailcorporate">
        /r/hailcorporate
       </a>
       and has a bottle of Mountain Dew hidden in the background is not a big product placement campaign that involved them manipulating votes - some people just like Mountain Dew. Most brand people are a lot stupider and lazier than people think, and utterly incapable of the high level deception people accuse them of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think brands do a lot of shady shit at an operational level (like Nestle with all of their water scandals), but if that ever comes near the marketing department it gets shut down instantly because we know it would do awful things for brand perception, which is basically our job. One of the biggest trends in marketing right now is 'brand purpose', which is basically doing good shit for the world because people are more likely to like you as a result. It's about transparency, ethics, and sustainability. It's not because brands are good people - it's because the most effective way to get people to buy your shit is to not be an asshole, and not get caught doing something shady.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't want to come off super naive like I'm preaching for brands and saying all advertising people are saints - we're definitely NOT. We're just lazier and more incompetent than most people realise, and also aware of how easy it is to get caught doing something you shouldn't be, so the best way to do business is not normally to try and trick people.

       exactly my thoughts. this guy might be rich enough to shake their hands, but he's not kicking back taking shots with them.... They are definitely into the occult; Aleyster Crowley, Helen blavitzki, Alice A. Bailey, Albert Pike, etc are like their fucking prophets. Anyone with common sense can come to that conclusion.

       Yep, they are 100% into the occult.  There is no doubt in my mind.  This is my specific area of interest and I spend way too much time researching it.  These people are worshiping lucifer, whether or not anyone else believes in this is irrelevant.  It only matters that they believe it.  The symbology is everywhere and once you open your eyes to it you can never "un-see" it.  It's in their commercials, tv, movies, music, books, magazines, jewelry, clothes etc.  It's an absolute obsession for them.

       I had a college class in which part of it we studied music videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did 4 artists: Madonna, Lady Gaga, Prince, I forget the 4th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, when we got to Lady GaGa we studied Bad Romance and the professor came to the conclusion that the song was a worship to the God "Ra" of Egypt and that the elite of the music industry had been in charge of the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind my professor came to this conclusion without having any idea of what the illuminati is. And that is when I went down the fucking rabbit hole and realized how evil the music industry is. It's a very interesting study that shows a lot of scary proof.

       I am super interested in learning more about this.  Can you explain to me or direct me somewhere to read about it? I am super confused as to how the illuminati are involved with hollywood elite and also what the occult and the devil have to do with it.  Do they worship the devil and believe it's what makes them rich?

       I think people are just over reacting to the comments by this idiot on the video, Bridger is a small hedge fund compared to others out there.  I believe in elite plans for world domination and the illuminati but I think this Bridger Capital would have a small part in that if any at all given their size.

       all great points. Funny you referenced frat mentality a few times because that is at the core of these Illuminati groups. The idea of a secret club, where you have to show and earn your spot and secrecy and dedication are of the top importance. Plus this is where they picked up their weird habits of rituals and such. They are just older now with more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all grew up together, had each others backs, helped each other get rich and are lounging to this day.

       This, if 3 'blood' friends start to pull towards the same objectives, example, money, and power, they will surpass basically anyone and they will get them both. Now 50 or 100 all searching for the same things and helping each other, who's going to stop them?

       Dang, dude, I wish I could. It was elaborate and made me check out his post history. Mainly posts in Conspiracy, Finance, Personal Finance, and life stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, he said that he grew up very wealthy and met with and engaged with people who were even wealthier. He said that the Illuminati are real, but not in the fearful way they are portrayed today. I believe it was the sense of old money being passed down over time with traditions. Lots of occult things like Eyes Wide Shut, but not as extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wish I had more. Let me see if I can find any way of seeing it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I just remembered him mentioning Bridger and other VC firms. If I remember correctly her basically said that there are a level of venture firms that no one knows about. These firms work for old money bosses or are the old money bosses themselves. When someone gains access to them it basically is a fast track to unimaginable wealth. Insider tips, laundering, etc are all in place. He said that when people are angry at the likes of Chase, Bank of America, etc. they have good reason to, but they should equally be as angry with these good ol' boy firms that are literally not allowing anyone outside of the clique a seat at the table.

       I just mean that if someone doesn't follow the game plan they are out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume you are a singer for example. The record label is interested in signing you, but the problem is, they just don't like the direction of your music. They want you to focus more on partying, sex, materialism, etc and they are interested in having their songwriters put together some hits for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either play ball, or there are a million other pretty faces with good voices to take your place.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent example would be the interview with Katy Perry where she talks about how she was doing Christian music and was being squashed by the industry, spinning her wheels and then "sold her soul to the devil" She then of course put out "I kissed a girl" at the direction of the label and is now a corporate slave pushing sex, partying, self worship, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       /conspiracy loves to believe she actually meant she really sold her soul with some kind of ritual but she just meant that if she wanted fame and fortune she had to follow the labels direction on what her music must be about.

       This video was just posted today, and as it turns out, there is a front page Reuters article about Shkrelli's E-Trade account getting hit for 40 million (the exact amount discussed on the radio show) that just posted this afternoon. Save the video, this page, and the article. It will be a good reminder about who runs our country if we forget.

       He's a big political donor too. He gave like 500k to chris christies campaign this year already. Idk man... I've looked into a lot of the stuff surrounding Christie and his donors, and it gets borderline cronyist. Some of the major donors are trying to build a 4.2b dollar casino in Jersey city, but they need gambling legalized there first. Exxon Mobile gave him a small contribution, but he is in favor of cutting their fines from 8b to 225mil or so (my numbers are probably off as I'm remembering this from a presentation today). idk I got off on a tangent, but yeah.

       The W.H.O. may not "set" regulations, but their word is what influences public opinion.  As such, if the W.H.O. say &lt;10% (ideally ≤5%) of daily energy intake should come from refined sugars, then sales of applicable products will, ipso FATso, decline.
Not much 'Common Core' mathematics trickery to required to proof this equation...

       Err I don't think "fat" is being blamed for the nations obesity problem - fat doesn't make people fat contrary to its name. Although certain fats like trans fats and saturated fats can lead to heart problems, the obesity issue is known to be from sedentary lifestyles with too much calorie consumption. Too many people live sedentary lifestyles and don't get anywhere near enough exercise daily

       Great minds think alike :) Currently Googling them after watching the interview and stumbled upon this thread. Didn't really come up with much except they manage a couple billion dollars. Hopefully someone else will chime in, but doubt it considering how martin mentioned them being secretive illuminati lol.

       Was answering a few question about Bridger Capital and was told to head here on reddit to continue the discussion. Read through the comments and don't know what else i can add to or correct in this thread. Im sure most of you by know what Bridger Capital is. The reason Martin said "that is some illuminati shit right there" is because it is so Elite, Secretive, and hard to get into. I would kind of compare it to Faraday Future that new car company. Faraday Future was able to secretly pouch some of the smartest and high up individuals from Apple, Google, BMW, GM, Jaguar, and Tesla to help build the company. No one really knew what the f they were doing. From my understanding Bridger did the same thing but in the financial world. So their employees are some of the best and most connected people in the industry. They keep it hush hush because that is the kind of people they work with very private elite high net worth individual. These people don't just trust anyone and they want their money to be in good hands. Bridger Is very inner circle they wont manage just anyone and not anyone get even get into the doors for a discussion. Keeping it small like that makes it easier for them to be more focused and connected too the client which is better for everyone in the end. I hope i explained that well enough i'm exhausted and this is what i know from my friends who work in the elite side of finance in New York.

       for someone who says he is not scared of anything, Martin was visibly shook after hearing the name Bridger Capital. The entire video he kept it cool and didn't skip a beat while they called him names and threw questions but just saying a companies name made him take a break.

       Hey, I'm in this industry (pharmaceutical banking). Bridger likely does a lot of insider trading, and the reason he joked about them being "illuminati" is because they likely have a SEC commissioner in their pocket. They are very closely tied to Steven Cohen, everyone is aware of SAC Capitals tremendous insider trading scandal which they got a slap on the wrist for.

       The reason Bridger keeps their returns "extremely secret" is likely due to the fact that they are quite high due to the same insider trading that they themselves perform.

       Something to read up on Bridger :

       Honestly though a lot of hedge funds have their websites set up just like this, Bridger Management says it manages over a trillion dollars, I think these are vehicles the real wealthy use to keep their names off of the Forbes list.  The Rothschild family for example has several hedge funds set up in different continents so you can never really know how much money they have because it is hidden in some hedge fund that doesn't have to disclose where the money came from thanks to a law passed over 60 years ago.  You have funds like Cerebrus, Blackstone, Blackrock etc.... valued in the trillions of dollars when you combine them all, but there is no way to know where the money came from originally.  If hedgefunds were required to show who their investors are like Publicly traded companies, I think we would all be shocked, well some of us not so shocked........

       There are a lot of trillionares out there. None of us will ever know who they are or what families have these trillions of dollars, because they have hidden the money so damn well. There was a really great article about a small town in Utah or Nevada where basically these trillionares have found a loophole to hide their money.

       The script in the head was generated by a program and almost impossible to figure out what's going on.

       Looks just like an investor login that's hidden, there's probably more to this site once you login. Nothing too special.

       My guess: It doesn't.  It looks like some content management thing or something that they bought and they hid that with some CSS.

       There's probably a different host that people actually log in to.

       its pretty normal to talk differently in different circumstances. you use different language when you hang out with your friends vs your family or if you hang out in different friend groups. also using slang terms like fam and talking about source code aren't mutually exclusive at all lol.

       They manage billions of dollars and you call asking what it is.... Obviously they don't have a desire to talk to you. People who would have the money they are interested in know what Bridger is and would never call like that so she determined within seconds that she should stop talking to you.

       If you should be calling them you know exactly what they do. By not knowing what they do you showed that you shouldn't even be calling them. Completely normal response in my eyes.

       Know how to find how important a company is in its market? Find what employees work there, what their positions are and how that evaluates against their last positions with previous employers in the same markets. So for example if the CEO of a fortune 500 is answering calls and fetching coffee for someone else at said company, you know that company is pretty fucking huge.

       If hedge funds like Bridger Management, Blackrock, Blackstone, Cerebrus etc... were required to show who their investors are like publicly traded companies, I think there would be a few new faces on top of the forbes richest people list.  These hedge funds have secretive websites and operate like this because it is a bunch of rich guys throwing money into one fund so they can invest in secret.  I am sure there are people far more wealthy than Warren Buffet or Bill Gates but you don't know their names because they have their money stored with XXXX hedge fund who only publishes that it manages XX trillions of dollars but you can never find out where the money came from originally.  You can read that two jewish guys started this hedge fund with a billion dollars and
 now its worth 10 billion for example, but they don't say where the original billion came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       This fund is only around 2 billion (bridger) certainly not one of the larger hedge funds out there.  I think his reaction to the Bridger Capital comment is getting people to search for something that isn't there with this company.  The Founder Mignone probably is in a few secret societies, but in the vast underworld of hedgefunds and secret society world domination, I think this one is a small part of it.

       Just noticed that during the video @ about 23:10 into it, CTG brags about being at the Bridger Capital building and that he posted from IG and Snapchat there, even showing the pic on IG...well now he has removed any trace of the images from Instagram.

       I'm pretty sure Charlemagne over heard some one talking about Bridger Capital and knew it would strike a reaction. Charlemagne doesnt have hedge fund connections or money. He is an idiot and know finance, banker, hedge fund guys would ever want to associate with this clown.

       So after that Martin Shkrelli interview where he brags about being worth more than 40 mil, and openly talks about Bridger Capital being illuminati, his E-Trade account gets hit for 40 mil today.  It's real, message received.

       KBIO's stock was halted a while ago. Theoretically the value of Kalos Bios dropped on the day he was indicted, not the day of this interview. When it resumed trading under KBIOQ (was delisted to the OTC market during shkreli's arrest) the value dropped from 40 bucks a share (ish) to around 2 bucks a share. I don't think you understand how this works... the illuminati didn't put an economic "hit" out on shkreli... this is just how normal trading works.

       Watching this interview again it's Charlamagne who brings up Bridger (trying to show up Shkrelli, watch his face when he says that name).
      </p>
      <p>
       Shkrelli keeps bringing it up which probably got him into trouble because he says "it is one of the most elite and secret places there is" and how he should not be talking about it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this will be a fairly well referenced interview in the future.

       I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it...kinda surreal to see this on video...people like Shkreli don't get thrown off easily so to see CTG mention the company and him react to it in such a way.

       Its just a hedge fund, basically they pool money together from investors and place bets in different asset classes. They usually take a 2%ish management fee and 20% performance fee.

       As someone that has worked for Bridger, this post is hilarious. Martins just surprised since this hedge fund is fairly small and unknown to people outside of finance. No offense but I wouldn't think that guy would know about it either. it would be like if you met a 50 year old white guy who knew about Some unknown underground rapper.

       From wikipedia I think this is very interesting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shkreli told Vanity Fair that he developed an interest in chemistry when a family member suffered from treatment-resistant depression.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Huh.  I wonder what he manufactured (ketamine?) and if it made him smarter?  Or if it made him a shitton of money; or was decisively subversive (psychedelics) and caught the attention of the drug-dealing mafia intelligence agencies for some insider positions.... "since youve proven to be very good at this, we have a job placement for you in the inside trading and biotech biz, son"  After all, he's the one who mentioned the illuminati

       This video was just posted today, and as it turns out, there is a front page Reuters article about Shkrelli's E-Trade account getting hit for 40 million (the exact amount discussed on the radio show) that just posted this afternoon. Save the video, this page, and the article. It will be a good reminder about who runs our country if we forget.

       Err I don't think "fat" is being blamed for the nations obesity problem - fat doesn't make people fat contrary to its name. Although certain fats like trans fats and saturated fats can lead to heart problems, the obesity issue is known to be from sedentary lifestyles with too much calorie consumption. Too many people live sedentary lifestyles and don't get anywhere near enough exercise daily

       I just mean that if someone doesn't follow the game plan they are out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume you are a singer for example. The record label is interested in signing you, but the problem is, they just don't like the direction of your music. They want you to focus more on partying, sex, materialism, etc and they are interested in having their songwriters put together some hits for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either play ball, or there are a million other pretty faces with good voices to take your place.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent example would be the interview with Katy Perry where she talks about how she was doing Christian music and was being squashed by the industry, spinning her wheels and then "sold her soul to the devil" She then of course put out "I kissed a girl" at the direction of the label and is now a corporate slave pushing sex, partying, self worship, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       /conspiracy loves to believe she actually meant she really sold her soul with some kind of ritual but she just meant that if she wanted fame and fortune she had to follow the labels direction on what her music must be about.
