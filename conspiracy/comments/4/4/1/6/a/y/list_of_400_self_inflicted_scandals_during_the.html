        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Adding  three demolished skyscrapers,  an &quot;attack&quot; on the Pentagon,   four questionable plane crashes and an anthrax mailing to the list must be too much of a hurdle?  <a href="http://www.netrootsmass.net/hughs-bush-scandals-list/">http://www.netrootsmass.net/hughs-bush-scandals-list/</a></p>

<p>Seriously,   people are believing the official lies because the alternative,   that the Bush administration was somehow involved is beyond believable!!    Compared to the collaboration required by the Manhattan Project (a well kept secret),   the crimes on 9/11,  logistically, were relatively less of a challenge.    Besides,  there would have been a lot of help from contractors and other outside agents,  and some of these connections are now far from secret.</p>

<p>All that is left is media complicity.    Anyone think the media is not complicit in deceptions at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Khalezov alone?    Weak.    I would like to see more than one guy,   and especially someone who could point out that US were already using bunker buster mini nukes.    </p>

<p>There are Alex Jones quality of conversations.    And then there are Kevin Ryan quality of conversations.    If information can&#39;t reach the tipping point of serious people,   and stays in the realm of half baked sensationalists.....    I would not even buy a car from people like that.   No matter how many Phd&#39;s behind the name.    If its speculation,   and you admit it,   fine.    But if you make claims of proof when really more study is needed,   serious people are going to be turned off.    It actually sets the field of study back,   poisons it,   even if there was some merit to looking into it further. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean you have to be an egg head,   but you have to be honest enough to the scientific method that you don&#39;t blow your wad of credibility in the first five minutes.    Hurricane Erin was not heading for Manhattan for example,   not in a million years.    </p>

<p>and fwiw, khalezov talks quite a bit about mini-nukes in other operations - although i have to stress that the devices used on 9/11 were 150 kT (not &quot;mini-nukes&quot; by any means)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,  I am telling you its not happening,   this conversation,   by serious people who would know,   from the US side.    So in the US all you got is speculation among people who are not highly expert in the technical matter,   who have no experience in the field.   And from Russia,  someone who is a loner.    Who not only cannot be verified,   but whose claims are dubious.      It hasn&#39;t got any traction among serious people yet.    And it gets a lot of attention from people who are already tainted.    Not a good sign.</p>

<p>Also,   I am not saying you are not intelligent.   You are obviously bright.    What I am saying is that most people who try to get a result (and are expert at it,  as in demolishing stuff) use the most conventional means available.

    <div class="md"><p>the current official world record for an implosion demolition is 29 stories. and brick construction. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP1HJoG-1Pg">here&#39;s a video of it</a>. wtc1 and 2 were each over 3 times this tall and of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwc49cZKunQ">steel construction</a>. even wtc7 was about twice as tall as the official world record. (interesting coincidence, this same company that has the official record did &#39;clean up&#39; work after 9/11 and after the oklahoma city bombing)</p>

<p>i&#39;m an engineer, myself, but even a layperson could see that a conventional implosion was not used for such a project. simply compare the above video to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhyu-fZ2nRA">wtc collapse</a>. and that it <em>couldn&#39;t</em> give the results we saw.</p>

<p>we would have seen thousands of steel segments crashing down. instead, the buildings turned to billowing mushroom clouds of microscopic dust. we should have found office furniture, bathroom fixtures, telephones, elevator cars. instead we see microscopic dust. </p>

<p>the results simply are not consistent with any conventional demolition. they are very consistent with nuclear demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points about wtc one and two,   but seven looks pretty conventional.</p>

<p>Yet persisting molten material at all three locations implies some common technology.</p>

<p>I never said conventional commercial demolition practices were used.   I am sure you are aware the military also has demolitions experts and has access to explosive materials not used in normal demolitions.     There are plenty of materials that are very explosive without being nuclear.    Or there could have been a combinations of materials.    If it was me,   I would not have hesitated to load any aircraft or missiles used with additional materials besides fuel if it would have assisted in the demolition.</p>

<p>We did see a lot of steel come down,   a lot of steel collected,   a lot of steel shipped out.    But the dust also has a lot of steel in it.</p>

<p>I agree this is all interesting.    But if I found thermite,   I think I would give that some weight as well.</p>

<p>If you can find thermitic material in dust,   then what nuclear material should you also find in dust if nuclear was used?    Or if not,  if you had no smoking gun,   then would you not keep your speculations close to you chest and focus on the kind of presentation that would most likely have the clout to initiate an investigation without esoteric and controversial debates that would divide the attention and weaken your overall thrust?    Especially if all I got is one Russian guy.    And especially if I have not one from the US,   and no one who is a nuclear weapons designer from the west.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thermite is used for cutting. something had to turn those buildings and all their contents into dust. the pile should have been roughly a third of each building&#39;s height. i dont doubt it was used for select demolition tasks, but finding some thermite doesnt mean it was responsible for the entire job.</p>

<p>there are a few isotopes you would expect to find - and they were found: <a href="https://app.box.com/shared/hf1eev4jvv">Proof Of Advanced Fission Devices Used In New York City On September 11th, 2001</a> and it would explain all the hundreds of first responders that have developed leukemia, thyroid, prostate, skin and dozens of other rare types of radiogenic cancers that asbestos or &#39;toxic cloud&#39; would not explain. </p>

<p>the reason this matters is that it shows israel has access to thermonuclear devices within the usa and the willingness to use them on a civilian population. &#39;samson option&#39; anybody?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>thermite is used for cutting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>they found thermitic evidence in the dust,  but evidently there may be some nano thermate type of materials that are not commercially available or studied.    Also did they test for all other kinds of explosives?    But the main thing is that there may be a kind of thermate that can function as a propellant?    Have you listened to everything Jonathan Cole has said about it:  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Cole&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8#q=jonathan+cole+9%2F11">https://www.google.com/search?q=Cole&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8#q=jonathan+cole+9%2F11</a>,  or studied his experiments?</p>

<p>Links to Israel are not limited to nuclear.    The US (including covert ops,  maybe especially  covert ops) contracts out a lot of stuff to a lot of people.</p>

<p>John Prager&#39;s fission analysis has received any peer review?  What are Prager’s Science Qualifications? Retired magazine publisher?   I would like to see more comments on his analysis.    But that is also what a real investigation is about.    You don&#39;t conduct a real proof or investigation with a single paper that no one has heard of,   or parade a single paper as final absolute proof.    That looks more like sensationism than science,  or even how courts work.</p>

<p>Jumping to &quot;proof&quot; is implying that a public forum is going to convict the criminals.    That&#39;s what the criminals did,  use shoddy tricks to get agreement and conclusion.    That is the last thing we need to be doing or condoning.    </p>

<p>Lets do what it takes to get a consensus for a real investigation.    Lets not use sensational means to get people to fall for some possibly half baked ideas that have not had a chance to be vetted.    The criminals already did that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not how the criminal justice system works.    Until you build enough consensus and interest,    the process remains stuck.    </p>

<p>Possibly half baked.    Possibly good science.    One man&#39;s analysis is going to have to be investigated by those expert in the science.   But we can&#39;t even stay on topic about needing an investigation,   and yes,   it amounts to sensationalism to claim this is enough to issue an arrest warrant.    That&#39;s not how it works.    Whoever issues the warrant is going to have to consult a handful of experts who are able to be cross examined.</p>

<p>Right now,  science is being turned off by presenting stuff as proof that hasn&#39;t yet been even considered.    More professionals need a chance to look at it.    Thats what it took to get thermite even talked about.</p>

<p>I think its pretty obvious that the Zelikow commission report is fatally flawed.  </p>

<p>There is a lot of evidence that the Bush administration is lying and that there are factors that point to something other than Osama,  19 hijackers etc.,   and also point to explosive demolition.

<p>Who&#39;s this guy to say there&#39;s a 50% chance of crashing into a Twin Tower, the two tallest buildings in the city? Runways are much smaller targets and airplanes hit them thousands of times every hour, with almost 100% success.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a preponderance of evidence that shows 19 foreign men, funded by al Qaeda trained to hijack four airplanes and crash them into buildings, boarded those planes and hijacked them.

    <div class="md"><p>No,  it the combinations of tall tales that combined,   effectively reduce the probabilities to zero.     Its bad enough that one factor is unbelievable,   but if you add two unbelievable stories,   the odds of that is much worse than the two earlier stories combined in themselves.    Got it?</p>

<p>Improbable individuals,   improbable boardings,   improbably take overs,   improbable piloting ability,   improbable flight trajectories,   improbable flight speeds,    improbable identities,   improbable passports and other claimed &quot;findings&quot;,   and on and on and on.     Then improbable non response of air defense case one,   improbable case two,   improbable case three over an hour and a half.    Then improbable impact results compared to shown building results and failures and debris patterns.    It goes on and on.</p>

<p>By the way,    why would it be improbable that the same people who would lie to go to war,   who would result in over 15,000 US service deaths and a million innocent civilian deaths,   who would waste trillions of the nations wealth for lies and quadruple opium exports,    the same faction that used to and probably still imports cocaine,   please explain why it would be impossible to think that they might be willing to sacrifice a few of us if thats what it would take to motivate us,  out of fear,   to get involved in 15 years of middle eastern war?</p>

<p>Speaking of evidence,   what is your standard of evidence from those who you believe?     Seen any videos?   Any proof?    </p>

<p>Besides,  there is a lot of substantial evidence of the early war planning,  even before 9/11,   evidence that the hijackers were not who we say they were,   etc.   Lots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of that is improbable, with the possible exception of the passport, though other passengers&#39; drivers licenses, luggage tags, etc. were found too. It&#39;s not like everything evaporated.</p>

<p>Besides, who plans this sort of conspiracy and decides &quot;We&#39;d better drop a Saudi passport a couple blocks away from the towers. That&#39;s the detail that will make people really believe it was done by foreign terrorists!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p>All the runways at JFK are 150&#39; wide. The Twin Towers were each 207&#39; wide. Also, you have to land in the center of the runway, flying straight and level, at a certain airspeed. The 9/11 hijackers had no such constraints. They weren&#39;t straight, they weren&#39;t centered on the building.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a professional pilot, but I&#39;ve flown planes before. Landing is far more difficult than crashing into a building. The Austin IRS guy did it, the kid in Tampa did it. You just point yourself at a building -- it&#39;s not hard. It&#39;s like saying crashing a car into a building is a challenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitting 207 feet may not be easy for someone who can&#39;t fly a cesna.    On the other hand,  didn&#39;t know the 150 feet width for runways at JFK,   thought it was wider.   Thanks,  and I stand corrected on this.</p>

<p>But since you have some experience in flying,  what is the airspeed claimed for the second plane to hit at the WTC site.    I have heard this was not a realistic speed to operate a commercial jet at close to sea level.    Have you looked into it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never flown a jumbo jet before, but apparently it was going 510 knots, which a 767 is certainly capaable of.</p>

<p>at sea level this would be problematic according to commercial airline pilots.    to the point of a plane breaking up or more specific regarding your claims of easy to hit a target,   uncontrollable.    </p>

<p>No you don&#39;t.  You have claims from those who also claimed Saddam had WMD,  and not any believable evidence.   </p>

<p>The fact that Saddam didn&#39;t have WMDs is pretty strong evidence against a conspiracy.
