       How do you explain all the documentary footage from Hiroshima and Nagasaki? What killed all those people? Do you believe no one died and they just razed whole cities?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know guys. This is one of those conspiracy theories that requires too much buoyancy in order to stay afloat. There are way too many people involved and too many historical incidents that require explaining away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would also have to invalidate the Manhattan project, which some say is the evidence that large scale conspiracies exist.

        /u/DirtyBird9889

       said. Unlike Dresden and Hamburg, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had wood and paper houses mostly. Note that the Bank of Japan building, right next to ground zero, and other brick/mortar/concrete buildings
       <em>
        stood up
       </em>
       , and that the trees are merely scorched.

      <p>
       Personal note: I'm undecided about the question myself, but I found I can't rely on the argument you are forwarding - waay too shaky.

       I am not sure if I believe it or not, but the idea is that those cities were firebombed by a fleet of B-29's rather than a single bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently the wreckage from the atomic explosion is indistinguishable from other Japanese cities that were firebombed.

       It would take hundreds of air raids to level the city so thoroughly, and no such mass raids were documented or reported, as far as I'm aware.

       don't know that it would invalidate it, if you can have thousands of people unknowingly working on something, you just as easily can have thousands of people unknowingly working on nothing, but otherwise yes it is a bit out there

       Don’t do that, for fuck’s sake. It’s just not true. It’s not a matter of you “have” to believe in this garbage. If something isn’t true, it isn’t true. If it doesn’t match up with sanity, that doesn’t mean YOU’RE wrong.

       I believe there are nukes, there's countless footage of weapons tests that were filmed prior to cgi, creating a cloud impossible to create with just TNT or other high explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason there are so many flat earthers is because there has been an ongoing attempt to confabulate (mostly) americans' understanding of science and truth, which they seem to generally have a very loose handle on to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, anyone who knows
       <em>
        even the most basic
       </em>
       newtonian laws of motion, physical laws of statics and dynamics; and chemical laws of phase change, the 3 laws of thermodynamics--
       <strong>
        <em>
         all of which are taught in high school chemistry/physics and are easy to remember
        </em>
       </strong>
       ---can  easily apply those principles to the 3 building collapses on 9/11 and cannot help but come to the
       <strong>
        <em>
         inevitable conclusion
        </em>
       </strong>
       that the offical story of 9/11 is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm saying most people are either willfully blind, or just stupid and unlearned; and that's why they are falling for this flat earth theory.  Another component to it is that the establishment that is perpetrating this anti-intellectualism trend use strong propaganda to have you believe others before you believe your own experience.  This is what a culture of abuse does:
      </p>
      <p>
       It says that 'sanctioned authority figures' know more than you do, and therefore you must give up your powers of thought to them.  This is how NIST got away with egregious nonsense until the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth actually forced NIST to correct itself with an independent analysis of their own data!  That's powerful: and it's power we all still retain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earthers for example, have no excuse if they've ever been on an aircraft.  You can look outside of the window and see, yep, it's a damned sphere (you have to be a very  high altitude and it helps to be travelling from night to morning, eastbound to see it very very clearly--that scenario is almost like being in space)  My point is, despite air travel, they will deny their own experience because they've give up to our culture which is trying hard to brainwash us because the cultural engineers have a particular agenda in mind and I talked about it here if you are interested:

       A bold claim. The mushroom cloud shape is actually typical for all things that rapidly go poof or boom with lots of heat (toroids form from turbulences induced by buoyancy), no nuke required for that. A "mushroom cloud", generated by heavy artillery, is depicted on an 18/19th (I don't remember) century painting (featured on Wikipedias "mushroom cloud" article).

       In this, though, I agree with you, as I often do, and if you allow, let me go one step further. "Getting" 9/11 is quite traumatic, at least it was for me,
       <em>
        and I'm not even American
       </em>
       . If you do not re-visit outrageous conspiracy theories again, and try to go back as far as possible to build a solid foundation for your world view to stand on, to check if and where popular understanding of the universe took the wrong turn to allow for the wide-spread acceptance of NISTs non-explanations,
       <em>
        you are doing something wrong
       </em>
       . IOW, you also look at flat earth/moan hoax/NASA fraud/JFK assassination/space lizard theories with different eyes (I am exaggarating on purpose here). I am not a flat earther, the gods forbid; but if you are really, really honest about it, and take a step back, you must admit how much you merely accepted as a given without really scrutinizing it yourself. At least I had to, it was not easy to find solid ground again. Not having the means to build a satellite or weather balloon ourselves, which arguments are left to us "globalists" other than appeal to NASAs authority and the proof by induction from the shape of the moon? One argument put forward by flat earthers for example is extremely compelling and I have a hard time debunking it: there is no time lapse video of rotating earth that does not come out of a computer. There aren't even that many stills of the blue marble which are not photoshopped. That does not prove flat earth. But it doesn't exactly help us to argue for the pear-shaped oblate spheroid either.

       I would like to say that we should consider the possibility that the scientists who have directly worked with these materials are possibly keeping some discoveries of fundamental realities about the atoms and their relationship with the aether under wraps. Very few people have had direct access to plutonium, it isn't hard to prevent the understanding of what exactly is going on with it if everyone thinks it is the most dangerous substance on earth. Who owns the plutonium?

       99% sure it's another psyop to deflect attention away from 9/11 being nuclear. "9/11 can't be nuclear because... umm... because nukes does exist! Yeah that's the ticket!"

       That... isn't undoctored... It's footage from a movie: Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie, as hosted by William Shatner. It's cleaned, steadied

       I did not realize that the video I linked was from a Shatner movie and I appreciate you pointing that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the footage you linked cuts at the 3 second mark.  If this is real undoctored footage that displays a nuclear explosion, why is there a need for a cut at the very onset of the explosion?  Why does the shape and nature of the explosion change so drastically between cuts (I counted 5), and why is there a need for cuts at all?  The final frame doesn't look anything like the initial explosion and it is hard for me to imagine how the initial explosion would morph into the final mushroom cloud.  Are you aware of an actual clip of this explosion in real time?

       The first two cuts were because those cameras ceased to exist in the first 20 seconds of the explosion, given the fireball itself was just shy of two miles wide, with overpressure which demolished everything out to 4 miles, with +20psi and +5psi out to 6.5 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash burning happened at that test site out to around 18 miles, igniting materials, thus any sort of camera, within that radius would have been destroyed. Also, anything within the initial 2 miles would have been dosed with 5Gy of gamma radiation, which is equivalent to the radiation absorbed by the film from taken by Igor Kostin, which wiped most of the film, save several photographs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downrange from the site, between 10 and 100Gy would have been a further source of film degradation.

        this article
       </a>
       after some googling because that's actually a pretty interesting question I hadn't considered previously.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't answer your question directly, IE how do you protect photographic film from gamma rays when filming, but the diagram makes the answer fairly obvious. You use a mirror to bounce the light from the camera aperture into a shielded area where the film is contained. Visible light is reflected and hits the film, gamma rays aren't.

      <p>
       Also, I have a question about filming an event with massive gamma ray output. How does the film capture the visible light but not be destroyed by the gamma rays? Some dosimeters are made from photo film because they are highly sensitive to radiation. How could this footage survive? I assume a shielded film roll, but how to let only visible light hit the film and not the gamma rays? I don't believe you can shield from gamma rays and not visible light. If you block gamma rays you block visible light, yes?

       , as I was curious and looked up some information on it. Basically, you keep the film in a shielded container and use mirrors to bounce visible light from the camera aperture onto it.

       how about... shielded whole camera?

       A weak argument - there were VFX loooong before there was CGI.

       A bold claim. The mushroom cloud shape is actually typical for all things that rapidly go poof or boom with lots of heat (toroids form from turbulences induced by buoyancy), no nuke required for that. A "mushroom cloud", generated by heavy artillery, is depicted on an 18/19th (I don't remember) century painting (featured on Wikipedias "mushroom cloud" article).

       In this, though, I agree with you, as I often do, and if you allow, let me go one step further. "Getting" 9/11 is quite traumatic, at least it was for me,
       <em>
        and I'm not even American
       </em>
       . If you do not re-visit outrageous conspiracy theories again, and try to go back as far as possible to build a solid foundation for your world view to stand on, to check if and where popular understanding of the universe took the wrong turn to allow for the wide-spread acceptance of NISTs non-explanations,
       <em>
        you are doing something wrong
       </em>
       . IOW, you also look at flat earth/moan hoax/NASA fraud/JFK assassination/space lizard theories with different eyes (I am exaggarating on purpose here). I am not a flat earther, the gods forbid; but if you are really, really honest about it, and take a step back, you must admit how much you merely accepted as a given without really scrutinizing it yourself. At least I had to, it was not easy to find solid ground again. Not having the means to build a satellite or weather balloon ourselves, which arguments are left to us "globalists" other than appeal to NASAs authority and the proof by induction from the shape of the moon? One argument put forward by flat earthers for example is extremely compelling and I have a hard time debunking it: there is no time lapse video of rotating earth that does not come out of a computer. There aren't even that many stills of the blue marble which are not photoshopped. That does not prove flat earth. But it doesn't exactly help us to argue for the pear-shaped oblate spheroid either.

       It would take hundreds of air raids to level the city so thoroughly, and no such mass raids were documented or reported, as far as I'm aware.
