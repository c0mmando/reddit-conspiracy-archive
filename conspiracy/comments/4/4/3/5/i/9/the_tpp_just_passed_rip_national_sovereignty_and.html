    <div class="md"><p>It did not pass today; it was signed by the 12 member nation signatories in New Zealand today. Obama sent the US trade rep instead of signing it himself. The countries now have 2 years to pass and ratify the treaty. In the US at least, the fast-track process approved by Congress last year requires a 90-day waiting period between when the bill is introduced into Congress and when it can be voted on. It is not binding until it is passed by both houses and signed by the president. Best guesses for the vote are either this summer, or in the lame duck after the general election in November.</p>

<p>It does not surprise me at all that this made the frontpage. The signing was (I believe) specifically chosen to occur between the Iowa caucuses and NH primary so that it would be buried in US news coverage, and the media has by and large not covered this event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m somewhat surprised they didn&#39;t cover this in the media a little bit more, but only to the extent that people assumed like you did that the TPP had passed Congress, in an effort to discourage people from thinking it could still be stopped. </p>

<p>It would surprise me if the decision over whether or not to cover this signing was debated amongst the media and those who have an interest in passing the deal. My guess is their calculus showed them that it would be better to not say anything at all, to keep it out of public consciousness.</p>

<p>I upvoted your post, because I think the fact that they&#39;re keeping this quiet in US media implies they don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the bag yet, and therefore we should talk about it and try to come up with ways we might stop it. I still think it&#39;s a longshot to stop it, but not impossible, yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I understand it, yes. There&#39;s some provision that applies if not all 12 nations ratify by the end of the 2 years. It&#39;s something about the two biggest countries, US and Japan, and then at least four other countries get to decide what to do from a number of a options. The article I read was not particularly clear on it what happens in such a case, particular if the US has not passed it at that point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not entirely clear on the details of fast-track, whether there&#39;s an upper limit on how long they have between introduction of the bill and voting on it, or whether they have one or multiple attempts to vote on it under fast-track. I could see them setting up the vote for mid-late November, then possibly waiting for the new Congress to be sworn in before going ahead with it if they felt they had a better shot. </p>

<p>There&#39;s still a lot of mechanics of the actual voting procedures and specifics on the logistics of the deal I&#39;m unclear on. After a moderate amount of searching, I&#39;ve yet to find a clear, concise, well-written article that lays all of this out. There&#39;s a number of sites and groups opposed to the TPP that have a lot of info on what the text of the deal would institute, but nothing I&#39;ve found that goes into how it gets passed in detail. </p>

<p>There are a few different way to do voting on bills. (Usually figuring how to determine which version of a bill is to be passed.) and AFAIK the exact process for this treaty hasn&#39;t been officially decided. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXXX">here</a> is Standing Senate Rule XXX which is for treaties.</p>

<p>It will need a 2/3 majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, they&#39;re not treating this as a treaty. The fast-track bill allows the president to negotiate trade deals, and congress has to pass it with a simple majority, up or down vote, where the Senate cannot use the filibuster to prevent a vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really because as far as I know, only the president can negotiate treaties, but must have the advice and consent of the Senate (as in they vote and pass it). </p>

<p>That&#39;s in the constitution. </p>

<p>Fast track has nothing to do with the issue of whither or not it is treason. Fast track is not new nor is it abnormal for treaties. In fact the whole question arose after the last approval for fast tracking treaties had expired. </p>

<p>And fast track in someways makes sense, you can&#39;t really negotiate a treaty and have the senate just change the terms before approving it, that would require having the other nations approve that new treaty. Which means another round of negotiations another edit and another vote in the senate etc.  When the constitution was written there was no possible way for the senate to be involved in negation at all (unless a negotiator came to the Capitol in person) , in our modern world they can be. </p>

<p>But I would like to note, I don&#39;t agree with the TPP. In my opinion the Senate should throw it away. </p>

<p>The constitution states a 2/3 majority (of present senators that constitutes a quorum) is needed for ratification. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there is no way a court would decide the TPP is not a treaty. </p>

<p>I think this is a similar thing to how congress doesn&#39;t declare war anymore, they just pass an AUMF. It appears with fast-track that Congress abrogated it right to make changes to the deal, as well as how the vote actually proceeds. I&#39;ve seen nothing to suggest they will need a 2/3 supermajority in the senate to pass it, and everything to suggest otherwise; though I would love to be proven wrong on this. Everything I&#39;ve read so far suggests a simple majority of both houses will pass this.</p>

<p>I agree that it doesn&#39;t affect the question of whether it&#39;s treason, but I haven&#39;t really even addressed that issue here. I also oppose the TPP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see nothing in that article that changes the need for a 2/3 majority to ratify a treaty.</p>

<p>All I see is it give the president the right to present a treaty to be voted on in totality. </p>

<p>Meaning when they vote on the treaty they can&#39;t make amendments to it, it&#39;s either all of it or none of it. (No line item veto) </p>

<p>It would still need a 2/3 majority (of present senators that constitutes of quorum) to be ratified. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, you&#39;re right. <a href="http://netrightdaily.com/2015/04/14-things-you-have-to-know-about-fast-track/">Here&#39;s</a> another article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast track <strong>allows a treaty to be ratified with a simple majority vote in both houses rather than the constitutionally-required two-thirds majority in the Senate.</strong> It also requires that a treaty be brought up in a short time period after submission by the President and prevents Congress from amending it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/05/fast-track-violates-the-u-s-constitution.html">Also this</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Constitution’s two-thirds Senate rule regarding treaties is violated by Fast Track as it currently stands and has stood; and that provision of Fast Track (reducing the required two-thirds down to merely half of the Senators voting “Yea”) would need to be eliminated and the Constitution’s two-thirds-Senate requirement restored, in order for there to be able to be any further applications of Fast Track;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curiously (or not) I&#39;ve had a lot of trouble finding this in more mainstream news sources. I&#39;ve found a number of conservative and progress outlets and blogs that bring this up, but almost nothing from the big US papers or media networks actually make this distinction. The conservative blogs for the most part take the position that this <em>is</em> unconstitutional, but that&#39;s how it appears to be proceeding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unconstitutional but it still technically stands until the SCOTUS has official deemed it unconstitutional. But to do that they need a ripe case to rule on. (As all laws are assumed to be constitutional when passed as a matter of course)</p>

It looks like it got a 60-38 (60-37 in some sources) vote to end debate and bring the bill to a vote (end the filibuster), and though I&#39;m having trouble finding what the actual vote was, I believe it was less than 2/3.</p>

<p>Incidentally, NationalLibertyAlliance.org is making its final push to activate the common law courts nationwide we were always supposed to have by law.  Juries of, by, and for the People capable of holding errant representatives accountable to our common law.  Juries of the People able to try both the law as well as the facts of the matter.  And well able to indict for high treason.  Rather than sign a petition against treasonous globalist treaties to representatives who already know better, consider working with NLA to reestablish our common law courts so there&#39;s accountability to law on not only the TPP but many other matters as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it will be learned helplessness.  Rather, I think people will start to resort to hidden un-coorninated assassination violence, where the targets will be those who sign unpopular bills, the lobbyist/companies behind these bills.  People are learning that the system is unfair, and that it play&#39;s dirty.  The result of these learnings will be on the same level of dirty nasty fighting, as there&#39;s no other way of honorable change and reform.</p>

<p>The other possible outcome is that the system is so efficient and knowledgable that it can detect and kill all those who may oppose it, resulting in two classes of people.  Sheep and those at the top.  This, however, seems unlikely, because nature is always seeking to grow and evolve.</p>

<p>I know it hasnt been finalized but lets face it it will push through. And this is a good example of something that even after so long and so much resistance from activists from all over the world, you still cannot stop something unless they allowed it to be stopped.</p>

<p>And the burden on knowing it and also knowing you cant do anything, leads to a question of wasnt it better to not have known of it.</p>

<p>The TPP is just a step to extend the US system of property rights globally. In exchange the participating countries get to manufacture goods to sell in the US.  Hell the US does the bulk of investment around the world so that clause is thee to protect the US more than anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize the scale of Trade deals, with anything so large in scale the details will not be known to everyone.  The secrecy of the TPP has led to many things being said about it that may or may not be true.  NAFTA was a disaster.  Look at Detroit, it is a large ghetto struggling to survive where it was once a thriving metropolis, NAFTA had something to do with that.  Look at our latest GDP numbers the only thing growing is Imports and government spending.  That is not good for the manufacturing sector of this country, &quot;If you don&#39;t make anything, you can&#39;t buy anything&quot; - Ross Perot.</p>

<p>This statement is becoming truer by the day as our currency grows stronger and the rest of the world devalues.  In trade deals the country with the strongest currency gets cheaper goods at the expense of off shoring jobs.  With the TPP even more service jobs will be offshored as well such as customer service, technical service, and any other kind of service line you need to call.   If the minimum wage is raised we might be talking to someone in India when we order fast food to avoid higher wages.  </p>

<p>Trade deals are bullshit for America.  It doesn&#39;t help anyone except for people who are invested in companies who cannot reduce their operating costs any more which is limiting their EPS growth.  The TPP will greatly enhance the flexibility of companies to reduce their operating costs and thus increase their EPS.  This is good for the 1% obviously like every other trade deal out there.  </p>

<p>Americans are being fucked out of money by going to schools that have increased their costs over the last 20 years for degrees that have decreased in value over the last 20 years all while the government is working to offshore the jobs that might have been available with these degrees.  </p>

<p>Even if there isn&#39;t loss of sovereignty, there is loss of jobs which means more welfare and a greater strain on the deficit which eventually leads to Greece which in case you missed it was basically loss of sovereignty.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the majority of Americans will suffer because good jobs are being shifted overseas to lower costs. This deal benefits the wealthy American 1% and ensures the rest become slave like service workers for them. This is exactly what the elites in the US want. Manufacturing jobs will always be under pressure to reduce costs and will jump from country to country in the future. I understand everyone wants to go back to the &#39;good old days&#39; but globalization has permanently changed the world. There are no good old days to go back to. </p>

<p>The US is shifting to a knowledge based economy where workers generate innovation and knowledge. That then is protected via TPP and disseminated around the world for production. Believe me the elites in the US are very well positioned for the future. As usual the bulk of US society will be maintained somewhat above poverty levels to service the country. Knowledge workers are the new &#39;upwardly mobile&#39; class when before it was old fashioned union production workers.</p>

<p>No sovereignty is being lost however. </p>
