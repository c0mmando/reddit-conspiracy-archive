      <p>
       We’ve previously noted that polls show that Americans are in a “prerevolutionary” mood, that less than 1 in 5 Americans think that the government has the “consent of the governed”, that government corruption tops the list of Americans’ fears (gee, we wonder why), and that 3 times as many Americans supported King George during the Revolutionary War than support our OWN Congress today.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might assume that such statements are over-the-top … or that the results come from partisan pollsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a  group of Republican and Democratic pollsters and political strategists reviewed polling data last week, and revealed some stunning results:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        84% of all Americans believe political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right
       </li>
       <li>
        81% percent believe the power of ordinary people to control our country is getting weaker every day as politicians of both parties fight to protect their own power and privilege
       </li>
       <li>
        80% believe the federal government is its own special interest primarily looking out for itself
       </li>
       <li>
        79% of all voters believe we need to recruit and support more candidates for office, at all levels of government, who are ordinary citizens, rather than professional politicians and lawyers
       </li>
       <li>
        78% believe that the Democratic and Republican Parties are essentially useless in changing anything, because both political parties are too beholden to special interests to create any meaningful change
       </li>
       <li>
        76% of Americans agree with the statement that America cannot succeed unless we take on and defeat the corruption and crony capitalism in our government
       </li>
       <li>
        75% believe that the US government is NOT working for the people’s best interest
       </li>
       <li>
        75% believe that powerful interests have used campaign and lobbying money to rig the system for themselves
       </li>
       <li>
        74% see the biased and slanted coverage of the media as part of the problem
       </li>
       <li>
        72% of Americans believe the U.S. has a two-track economy, where most Americans struggle every day, where good jobs are hard to find, and where huge corporations get all the rewards
       </li>
       <li>
        72% believe that the reason families in our middle class have not seen their economic condition improve for decades and economic growth is stalled is because of corruption and crony capitalism in Washington
       </li>
       <li>
        71% believe our government is not only dysfunctional, it is collapsing right before our eyes
       </li>
       <li>
        70% believe the government in Washington does not govern with the consent of the people
       </li>
       <li>
        The majority – 56% – say they wish there were a third party with a chance of success to fight for their interests
       </li>
       <li>
        Only 15% say the “values and principals of my political party are so important that I strongly prefer to vote for the candidates of my party…”
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They concluded:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The country [is] in a prerevolutionary moment.
       </li>
       <li>
        This election could mark the beginning of the end of two-party duopoly in the United States.
       </li>
       <li>
        The people believe the real struggle for America is not between Democrats and Republicans, but between mainstream America and the ruling political elites of incumbent politicians, lobbyists, big business, big unions, big banks, big special interests and the big media.
       </li>
       <li>
        The power elite asks, “When will this be over?” Although this is seen as a chaotic and temporary situation by most of the political and media establishment, our research shows a strong, evolving tidal wave of discontent and growing pressure for real and dramatic change.
       </li>
       <li>
        Real change is what that the establishment fears most and fights hardest against. It is ultimately a losing battle.
       </li>
       <li>
        This, in fact, is a revolution.
       </li>
      </ul>

       I hope you know there are those among us who refuse to worship celebrities and refuse to participate in this mockery of an election, because while we're certainly sparse, I have faith that there are many more like myself than I see in real life. This sub does give me some hope though, at least some people are awake. It's good to know that even if most Americans are blind to our own woes, that some of my European brethren can appreciate just how badly us Americans are getting fucked. I hate to say it -- but I have the feeling you're next.

       I don't know in which european country you live but most of them are US vassals and controlled by US assets in politics and media. The media products even look more and more the same over the last 15 years in the one I live. It's all just merging to the lowest common dominator with people getting gradually dumbed down and their cultural identity being destroyed.

       Many of us would like to escape, but there seems to be major crises everywhere.

       No one knows what to do. I stopped feeding into the corporate machine the best I could ten years ago, by getting rid of my television, cooking my own meals, not watching sports or going to movies, working for little pay at small businesses, but this often alienates me socially. There are those of us Americans who are trying to slow the corporate machine by not participating. I hope more will soon.

       What you're seeing is the equivalent of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Cold War never ended for us - that's why we're all exceptionalistic in our attitudes and believe we're the best, and etc. It's because we're still drumming out cold war propaganda on the daily.

       Knowing and doing are two very different things. For an actual revolution to occur, there has to be a significant portion of the population who has nothing to lose. That portion of the US is being placated with bread and circuses.

       Yeah that's the push for Socialism in a nutshell. Though Socialism is only a temporary solution. You eventually run out of other people's money to spend as they say. Then the party is over. What's comforting is it seems like the majority of the US population understands this, and want no part of it. It's only a loud minority of younger people with nothing to lose that seem to be screaming for Sanders.

       I don't believe that socialism is their goal, just a means to an end. The hypersurveillance, the militarized police, attempts at disarmament, and coordinated economic decimation of the middle class are indications that they know that unrest is likely and are planning accordingly.

       I don't think they care about socialism or capitalism.  I think they care about control and upward flow of capital.  I also think to some degree they feed on human misery.  Otherwise, people who are allegedly 'so powerful' could actually do something to make the world better, but they don't.  They spend a lot of time at NGOs and secret clubs in order to accomplish the opposite of their public claims.

       We're not at a revolution yet.  That's not to say that one won't happen, but it seems to me that too much of this society is still a bit too status quo for a revolution to happen yet (if at all).

       They will decriminalize all drugs soon.  That way they can use it as a big distraction away from their criminality and corruption.  when that happens, and it will happen, say "thanks, but what else you got".

       I'm not sure about that. The US government is deeply involved in the illegal drug trade I suspect. All those times the CIA has been caught smuggling drugs. I never understood why. Though someone put up a theory saying the US actually has a massive black budget or dark fund outside of our official treasury/debt. Illegal Drug money, and arms sales fund it. If that's true they wouldn't want the drug trade to end.

      </p>
      <p>
       If it's legal, more people can buy it.  Nothing saying that the price has to even go down.  The sellers decide the cost initially, but when you're the big provider of the source (ie: the government itself), you can adjust the market price by adjusting the seller's initial price and assume a certain amount of markup.  That gives them monopolistic margin control

       Ironically, the Founders of America designed the Republic to face a potential revolution every 4 years, now 8. When the system is hijacked by multi-national interests who hold allegiance to no nation, it's not surprising nothing works but the billing system.

       You're dreaming, and here's why: For a 'revolution' to succeed the people have to
       <em>
        abandon support
       </em>
       for the
       <em>
        status quo
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But when

        45% don't pay taxes

       and
       <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/12/7-facts-about-government-benefits-and-who-gets-them/266428/">
        70+% get .gov benefits
       </a>
       you have to ask, "who's going to withdraw their support?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Down at the rabble-rousing level, those people are not going to be receptive to a revolutionary 'tear it down' message
       <em>
        until their personal situation collapses
       </em>
       . By then,
       <em>
        by design

       they'll be too geographically fragmented and

       to form any viable resistance.

       Why do you think they are trying to make weed legal and ban guns? Weed is a mass seditive for the populous, to make us accept and embrace our life of fast food and reality television. Don't get me wrong, I'm a libertarian and am for the decriminalization of drugs. But that is the only reason the government is even pretending to care.

       Weed has been proven to open neurological pathways that lead to expanded thought, which may help many people see through the BS and disconnect from mainstream propaganda. This is something they don't want. I haven't seen a push for legalization by the federal government to this point, have I missed it?

       At some point, the people themselves will need to re organize and begin to create non-profit organizations and businesses that provide social good within our local communities, building up useful skills, feeding, clothing and providing shelter in more innovative ways than we have before...
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to cooperate, using open source best-practice sharing and build new
       <em>
        structures
       </em>
       that can help to meet the needs of the community from a multifaceted approach using state of the art technologies and new online-based collaboration systems that will allow the emulation of innovation to flourish in our communities. We need the younger generations to be willing to have garage-business-projects that provide self-sufficiency, new skills and efficiencies that can authentically provide Individuated Unity, peace and prosperity. I believe that we can use appropriately structured nonprofit organizations to supersede the status quo and make our current socio-economic and political structures obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must each uniquely work to make the contradictory aspects of society- our fiat money, our corrupted food, health and local municipality systems obsolete. EVENTUALLY, I believe that we will have to use new technologies and open-source cooperation to have independence from the corporatocracy! Open Source Civilization Building is the Revolution, and it will be Unstoppable, because soon we will witness the limits of our contradictions, nearly to our own peril, and we will know that now is the time to take the reins of our own collaborative volition.

       There is a realization by Americans that the system is skewed, but no one has acted on making a change to it. We will still have a two party system and either a Democrat or republican PotUS. Thus no Revolution has occurred to change the political structure.

       As long as you buy into the "party" thing and "representatives", there will be a small number of people with real political power to vote on laws. These people will be bought off by the mega-corporations which have no shortage of money or guile. The only way we could move forward would be with direct democracy (no representatives). And even then, we would need a open-source voting system.

       It really sucks for them that the Internet has usurped the television as the most abundant source of information. Over the past year, I'm seeing more and more discontent with government from others, including those in my corporate office building who would normally vote Republican with their eyes closed.

       The elites have severely underestimated man's resolve and knack for finding truth. Their desperation is growing. Contrary to what many around here may believe, I really don't think they don't actually want a revolution. As they've recently discovered, disarming America is gonna be a little harder than they thought. They will instead try to get us to use our armaments against each other to thin out as much populace as possible, but again, they're working well outside of their reach.

       This only shows that people are aware, but it's not a revolution.  Unless a large percentage of US citizens are ready to take up arms there will never be any revolution.  Even if people were prepared to fight and risk death to save this nation, it's doubtful a revolution would succeed.  You need the military and the police on the peoples' side.

       But there may be parallels.

       If he's talking about Americans, I.E. colonists who have been there longer than the newer colonists, or first generations, second generations etc, then there would certainly be differing opinions due to recent exposure - But I don't have a history book open and I'm not sure what the comment you replied to really meant.

       Obama was funded by wall street and super PACS. Sanders can't be bought. He is a purely grass roots organizer and the only one that wants to end the war on drugs, the prison industrial complex, and provide free healthcare/education. To boot, Obama was stonewalled in congress endlessly. He had the people behind him for a bried period under a vague concept of change that never manifested. Sanders has been exactly the opposite and has 30 years of performance to back him up.

       my tax burden (or anyone making under 250k yearly, or 85% of Americans) will not increase with the college and healthcare I will get which has shown to be a positive ROI for the government.

       I get your distinction, and I actually really like Bernie Sanders - I've been a fan of his ever since he helped get the Fed audited in 2011. Nonetheless, his budget proposals regarding healthcare and education are totally unrealistic because they'd never in a million years make it through Congress. Most of our  elected officials are beholden to the corporations and 1%ers who would supposedly foot the bill for everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he were to be elected, he'd be stonewalled even more by Congress than Obama has. The POTUS is just a figurehead at this point, anyway. The system is broken and there's no one person who can fix it within the current framework. IMHO. 😉

       You're assuming everyone who uses cannabis is a walking teen movie stereotype. Not true. I'd venture to say that people's obsession with entertainment and social media is more of a distraction than anything else.

       Weed has been proven to open neurological pathways that lead to expanded thought, which may help many people see through the BS and disconnect from mainstream propaganda. This is something they don't want. I haven't seen a push for legalization by the federal government to this point, have I missed it?
