      <p>
       You may remember that last year Chipotle was the first restaurant chain to announce that it would phase out the use of genetically modified foods, also know as “G.M.O.’s”. Shortly thereafter, and quite mysteriously, an E. coli outbreak was reported, across fourteen states, from Washington to Pennsylvania, and only in Chipotle restaurants. According the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention” (C.D.C.), the odds of an E. coli outbreak crossing a single state line is only three percent, as restaurants generally buy their produce and meat regionally for freshness. The likelihood of an E. coli outbreak crossing fourteen state lines, coast to coast, is probably a small fraction of one percent. Additionally, as many restaurant chains use produce and meat from the same sources, it is probably a fraction of a fraction of one percent that such a nationwide E. coli outbreak would only effect one restaurant and not any others.
      </p>
      <p>
       After six months of thorough investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.), the C.D.C., fourteen state and local Health Departments, as well as scientists hired by Chipotle themselves, all have independently concluded that there is not a single traceable source of E. coli from any Chipotle restaurant, in any food ingredient, surface, or piece of equipment. Literally thousands of individual tests were conducted on the all the foods, on all the surfaces, and on all the equipment at the suspect Chipotles, and no trace whatsoever of E. coli was found in any restaurant or food ingredient. The C.D.C. being unable to trace the source of a restaurant’s food poisoning, after thousands of tests and half a year of effort, has never happened before in the entire history of the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As employees of Chipotle enjoy free meals after a shift, it is also noteworthy to report that not a single employee suffered an illness, although customers did. Furthermore, with the advent of precise D.N.A. testing, there were two, specifically different, strains of E. coli discovered, when there should have been just one, though they both “coincidentally” appeared simultaneously in different locations, one type for eleven of the states, and another type for the other three states, the latter being a very rare strain of E. coli, normally found only in food research labs.
       </strong>
       There was an additional
       <strong>
        “coincidence”
       </strong>
       that the C.D.C., known through their own interdepartmental memos and former employees as a submissive servant and propaganda arm of the G.M.O. food industry,
       <strong>
        “just happened”
       </strong>
       to have federal staff members on a
       <strong>
        “random”
       </strong>
       visit to the very local Seattle Health Department lab, at the very time, where and when the Chipotle E. coli bacteria was first analyzed, so as to immediately report the incident nationally,
       <strong>
        even though this was quite the opposite of standard operating procedure
       </strong>
       , which was suddenly changed in Chipotle’s case, as normally the release of information about an outbreak is withheld until an in-depth investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all this mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       G.M.O.’s are estimated to be a twenty billion dollar a year industry. As G.M.O.’s are banned in much of both Eastern and Western Europe, in advanced countries like Germany, France, and Russia, one has to ask,
       <em>
        “What do their scientists and doctors know that we don’t?”
       </em>
       , or perhaps even better, “Why does Russia, Germany, and France care more for the health of their citizens than the United States Federal Government?”, as obviously the bans only exist because of ill health effects from eating such genetically altered “Frankenfoods”, as they have been nicknamed.

       Great post. Not sure how many people "died" or "got sick", but every angle should be entertained. First, is the entire thing trumped-up propaganda by a zealous media cabal that whores for GMOs at every turn? In other words, did they see a couple of "e-coli" cases @ chipotle pop up, regardless of the fact that it can happen every day at any restaurant, and then turn around and make a HUGE deal out of it on a national scale? Or, was there
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       a spike in real cases that would point to sabotage? Either way, the United States of Amercinary pulls no punches, as black ops are the MO these days. Hired masked men and a liar media legalized by the repeal of the NDAAs Smith-Mundt Act can make for some cute stories based in pure fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another angle of course would be, is chipotle
       <em>
        in on it
       </em>
       ? CEO shuts-down his stores to lecture his staff of the dangers of non-GMO food and how to "deal with it" moving forward. A "child-psychology" way to get uneducated people to say under their breaths, "man, this NON-GMO crap is waaay too dangerous, screw that crap."

       It's plausible this was a common issue that got turned into a media circus. Monsanto has puppets in major media outlets. Look what happened when Steve Wilson and Jane Akre tried reporting about rBGH milk on Fox News:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Their four-part news series on rbGH was scheduled to begin on February 24, 1997. It was going to expose Monsanto's lies to the world, and show how the milk from treated cows was dangerously linked to cancer.
       </p>

       Thanks for the update on this story, almost forgot about it. I read the CDC reports on it a while back and it was clear they had no fucking clue what was going on. They said the strain was unique and not normally found contaminating food...don't forget there was also a Norovirus outbreak.
      </p>

       Mike Adams may have been right when he was calling for an FBI investigation:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's funny how the usual Monsanto lovers and pro-GMO journalists tried to discredit him in the heat of the moment:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2016/01/publishers-platform-chipotle-must-denounce-mike-adams-conspiracy-theory/">

      <p>
       And then you have Genetic Lunacy Project, run by John Entine, one of Monsanto's public mouthpieces, which had this to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/07/28/fbi-turns-up-heat-on-mike-adams-as-health-ranger-fiasco-widens-plus-adams-archive/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That article, like most things on GLP, starts out by quickly laying into the defamation tactics. He calls people anti-science and plugs his pro-GMO buddies.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I should point out the GLP article is from 2014, it wasn't a response about Chipotle, it was an attack on Mike Adams. Look how he drops names for Karl Von Mogel, Keith Kloor, David Gorski, and even Kevin Folta shows up in the comments. This is the Monsanto crew. They were busted in a FOIA request for Kevin Folta's University emails. Look at them run to the big M's defense and publish articles all over MSM about it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I called out Entine on his own blog for being a hypocritical lunatic who attacks real scientists, here's the archive:

       Without even knowing there were two different strains, this attack on Chipotle looked fishy from the start. Just calculating the odds as OP did gives one reason to suspect sabotage from the get-go.
      </p>

       Too many locations at the same time in too many different places to be "natural".

        Leaky pipes can allow contaminants into our drinking water. "Many of us will have had a 'dodgy tummy' in the past that we couldn't quite explain, often putting it down to something we'd eaten. It now seems possible that some of these illnesses could have been caused not by food, but by water."

        Contrary to popular belief, purified drinking water from home faucets contains millions to hundreds of millions of widely differing bacteria per gallon. These facilities also add chlorine or other disinfectants to kill bacteria and prevent them from thriving in water distribution pipes. Nevertheless, it's not possible to totally eliminate bacteria with current technology

        The researchers acknowledge that it is not easy to find a definitive solution to these water-borne infections, which are found all over the world. Since the parasites can overcome the normal water treatment systems used in waste water and drinking water treatment plants, there are frequent outbreaks of epidemics, even in developed countries.

       I know food and cooking / cleaning areas are an obvious thing to test for contamination, but I wonder if they tested things such as the packaged plates and cups which come from a different place. They are only briefly handled by the employees, which could explain why only the customers got ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they are looking for a food chain contamination when it's really the other supplies?

       Regardless, they use Morton's Kosher salt in their food. Which uses an
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_ferrocyanide">
        "anti-aging agent"
       </a>
       called
       <a href="http://www.ahealthysliceoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/salt-comparison-Morton-Kosher-salt.jpg">
        yellow prussiate of soda

       which is in reality sodium ferrocyanide. "They" say it is safe as long as it does not come into contact with an acid (human stomach) as it will lose the bond with the iron (ferrous) and release the cyanide. They are still poisoning you no matter how natural their ingredients claim to be. Doubt me? Look it up for yourself. I claim no responsibility in this discovery as God guided me to look at and lookup the ingredients as I poured it into my family's chicken soup for the last time obviously.

       I love how the molecular shape of the compound resembles the symbol on the Israeli flag NICE!!!
