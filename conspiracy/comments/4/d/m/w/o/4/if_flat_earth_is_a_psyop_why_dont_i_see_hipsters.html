Why does he regularly use &quot;Flat Earther&quot; as an epithet for the most stupid if there aren&#39;t really any Flat Earthers anywhere?</p>

<p>Why did Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/562456798020386816?lang=en">&quot;the Earth is round&quot;</a> as a preamble to an across-the-board promotion of all vaccines (with no discussion of any of the harms)?</p>

<p>Why does Director of National Intelligence James Clapper assure us that the Earth is <a href="http://www.popsci.com/james-clapper-believes-earth-is-round-and-other-revelations">&quot;definitely a sphere&quot;</a>?</p>

<p>Why does Celebrity Scientist Neil DeGrasse Tyson need to diss Flat Earth in a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/drtyson/flat-to-fact">rap battle</a>?</p>

<p>Why are these extremely influential individuals lining up to tell you not to look at Flat Earth? Why do they protest so much?

<p>This would be strange enough of a phenomenon on its own, but they aren&#39;t alone.</p>

<p>Why is the Guardian trying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/20/flat-earth-believers-youtube-videos-conspiracy-theorists">paint Flat Earth as a religion</a>?</p>

<p>Why is Vice&#39;s Motherboard <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-is-the-flat-earth-conspiracy-still-a-thing-b-o-b-neil-degrasse-tyson">framing the topic as annoying</a> instead of hip and dangerous?</p>

<p>Why does LiveScience ask <a href="http://www.livescience.com/24310-flat-earth-belief.html">if Flat-Earthers are &#39;serious&#39;</a> and then go on to interview the president of a parody group instead?</p>

<p>Why is New York Magazine trying so desperately to <a href="http://nymag.com/following/2016/01/consider-the-flat-earth-theory.html">associate Flat Earth with Tila Tequila and the parody group the Flat Earth Society</a>?</p>

<p>Why does the Huffington Post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flat-earth-truthers-tila-tequila_us_56a0f23ae4b076aadcc55c6c">focus their coverage on divisive and untrusted individuals in the Flat Earth community</a>?</p>

<p>Why does the Atlantic offer <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/flat-earth-bob-outside-physicist/431583/">a &#39;defense&#39; of Flat Earthers that isn&#39;t written by a Flat Earther and instead insults anyone who questions</a>?</p>

<p>Why does the Express <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/629355/Flat-Earth-News-Thousands-believe-madcap-theory-world-is-REALLY-a-dome-topped-disc">focus its coverage on one divisive and untrusted individual within the Flat Earth community who offers unsupported speculation</a>?</p>

<p>Why are all of these media outlets in unison in their message? Who are they talking about, if none of them can find any actual Flat Earthers to interview? Why are these articles littered with examples of them disparaging other truths (9/11, vaccines, etc)? Why do they always focus on known parody sites and suspected shills?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>VICE won&#39;t support something so preposterously unbelievable to their audience which is an affluent middle class demographic--ie the only ones that can afford expensive montly cable required to have HBO.  HBO is basically 120 dollars a month, no matter how you cut it.  You have to have cable to get HBO, so that&#39;s where I&#39;m getting that figure.</p>

<p>Unless they&#39;ve managed to start a streaming service untethered to cable company contracts and that would be something I don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>Affluent, educated people will not accept flat earth whatsoever, because they&#39;ve actually been inside of an airplane and don&#39;t believe that the view from their window is some kind of hologram screen.  They&#39;ve traveled  around the world, and if the world were flat, there&#39;d be some mechanism like an asteroids arcade screen that &#39;resets them back&#39; on the other side of the &#39;screen&#39;, which means teleportation, which means the whole theory falls apart.</p>

<p>Some say, &quot;no it&#39;s flat like a record, so they are going in a loop.&quot;  Ok, well some have encircled antarctica, so try again...  this disk thing implies that beyond antarctica is &#39;infinity&#39; or another world or &#39;more world they won&#39;t let us see&#39;...this is simply not true, as people have encircled antarctica</p>

<p>Finally, regular people like myself have been in planes at very high altitude at night, flying into the daytime (against rotation of earth), this particular circumstance demonstrates very clearly the curvature of the earth just by looking out the windows.  I got this when I was 7, a very good impresison of the &#39;globe of the earth&#39;.</p>

<p>So there are 3 ways that flat earth is wrong, and anyone who suggests otherwise is either very willfully ignorant or they are a person working for a group that is pushing this agenda to bring about a dark enlightenment of some sort; or is just trying to taint the conspiracy community with nonsense and thereby discrediting other conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I expect more of these people if they are in the former group, and I would offer for them to take a plane flight to dispell their ignorance.  The other two are doing humanity a disservice, so unless you&#39;re actually evil, think about how what your&#39;e doing hurts humanity as a whole by harming people&#39;s connection to the Truth.</p>

<p>Have a good day</p>

I just got finished watching this doc about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4do2i2/the_simulation_hypothesis/">Simulation Hypothesis and posted it here</a>. The hypothesis is that we are a simulation of a greater intelligence. If you&#39;re interested in alternative thoughts, I&#39;d suggest checking out if you haven&#39;t. These things blow my mind.

    <div class="md"><p>Because they want to keep the door holding the secrets of the earth, its shape, the nature of space, and the relationship between all of these things closed <em>at all costs</em>.  If we start questioning any one of these things, we might start to get closer to the truth (whatever it may end up being), and we can&#39;t have that.  It would cast doubt on everything if we found out that the shape of the world or the nature of the universe isn&#39;t what we&#39;ve been told: it would beg the question of what else we&#39;re being lied to about, it would show that modern science/physics is false, it would show that something is being hidden in or around Antarctica, it would show that the conspiracy goes back hundreds of years at minimum and involves easily thousands if not millions of people, etc., etc.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s all one possibility arrived at through logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because whenever anyone engages you in discussion you run off and hide as soon as you realise you can&#39;t defend your nonsense premise - which is usually immediately.</p>

<p>But OK, let&#39;s look at two of the claims you made in the linked thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) The constellations in the night sky can be photographed slowly rotating around Polaris, the Pole star</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, in the Northern hemisphere only. <strong>But because the Earth is spherical</strong>, the Pole star gets closer and closer to the horizon the closer you get to the equator.</p>

<p><strong>And because the Earth is spherical</strong>, in the Southern hemisphere you can&#39;t see the Pole star. And the night sky revolves around a different point.</p>

<p>On a flat Earth, that would not happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) Lighthouses can be seen at distances that should be occluded by curvature</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not when you account for refraction of light and geography you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>And if the Earth was flat, you&#39;d be able to stand hundreds, or thousands of miles away and still see the lighthouse if you used a more powerful telescope. But you can&#39;t, <strong>because the Earth is spherical</strong>.</p>
