       I had never thought of the prospect that
       <em>
        inversion
       </em>
       , shell accounts / tax havens would be the primary means by which a global public is convinced of the need for a world government but I'm guess that this will be the trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone thought it would be wars, or starvation, or overpopulation or even climate control (hi, bill nye).  But I think the trick TPTB will use will be to propose a fix to corporate crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's not just America doing it.  It's every transnational or large corporation in
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       country.  There's a story here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (which reads a lot like swiss/russian propaganda btw, but it's not untrue), that corporations in other countries are using Reno, NV and other places throughout the US as tax havens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it's all about legally subverting your government's jurisdictions.  The UN can only pass measures but ultimately countries have to abide them.  All it takes is one country to profit off tax shelters and then they are all doing it for each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass surveillance works this way too.  The CIA may have to abide by domestic federal laws on domestic spying, but nothing saying they can't (nudge nudge), phone the Queen's special wire service division and ask her for updates.
      </p>
      <p>
       This effectively means we're already
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       the NWO.  A world government would only really be for administrative purposes of saving money and streamlining process
       <em>
        for TPTB
       </em>
       .  In terms of control, it might be easier for them to control us by maintaining the illusion of different country lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, our governments don't protect us, they abuse us.  They don't shield us, they extort us.  They don't respect our rights, they allow everyone else to tromp them, and in fact, they've designed a system that encourages this behavior as it yields fruits that TPTB can then use in many other ways, to make money while further inhibiting our ability to prevent them from doing so.

       Just to add to your post, we are moving toward a cashless society which will make it even easier for a global government to regulate all "money" and tax it "appropriately".   The NWO doesnt work if there are ways to earn/spend money outside of its control.

       That's why Iceland had to go. Because they are against the NWO.

       This is about more global financial regulations.  The world banking capital is going to move very soon.  I'd project that another large part if this is going to come in international corporate regulations.  Something that can be taxed at a global level.  Like carbon.

       While that is true, I think there are fascist policymakers that control corporations by creating laws that enable them to do this.  Those policymakers have so much money that it's actually meaningless, which means their game is about something else--I believe that game is acting as the jailers.

       I do not think that it is meaningless. You can lose it all very quickly. Their positions are constantly under attack from all directions. They compete with one another.

       I think that they are interested in power and control. In addition to money, they also want information, access, the media, and of course violence.

         we

        are highly restricted to 'security clearnance' information.

        everyone particpates in an effort to create a new A-la-carte government where you pay for what services you support.  This way you can opt out of paying for war or paying for welfare or for schools (you don't have kids, why pay for schools). If you don't own a car, you pay for public transportation and that includes the cost of roadways.  If you own a car, you have to pay for the roadways.  That's just common sense.  Then no one can complain about anything.  If there's not enough money to help the poor, then expect tent cities.

        everyone participates in decriminalizing all drugs worldwide. This would drastically reduce crime, policing costs, prison costs, wars, occupations, mafia crime, gangs, and blackmarkets.

        degrade government in any way you can by opting out, not participating, not giving your money, time, attention, admiration of it.

       I hate that you're right, but you are.

       If the world hopefullly doesn't collapse in 2017 as many have predicted (starting later this year), then give it 5-10 more years and a huge demographic shift towards the young being in power will happen because the boomers will die off in droves.  I call it the neocon die-off.  Now this wont' solve things, but it will give us an edge.  So focus on 'waking up the millenials' or 'revitalizing the smartest x-ers'  Focus on singletons, families are like trees, they aren't going anywhere.  Also, that's who we fight for, so best to let them do their thing.  Sometimes this knowledge, this awakening can be like mental terrorism to a family that just wants to raise a familiy and not be drawn into world politics and events.  In other words, they've cocooned and don't count because they are abdicating all their powers and rights to the status quo, so just leave them alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a neocon and you read this and think it's insane, well that's why we're looking forward to a future without you.  You've not payed attention or you don't accept the paradigm of truth, which is that our government has betrayed you and us.  I understand how you want to take your incorrect model to bed with you--you don't accept it as incorrect.  However what you consider integrity is now what the rest of the world thinks it is

       Compost based heating is one example.  Painted soda can pipes and glass / plexiglass scraps for solar air heating is another.

       I'm behind you on literally everything you said, man, I just don't think the stupid masses of brainwashed morons we live with have any chance of waking up in time to save themselves. Save yourself, fuck everyone else; at least the ones who just won't hear it. And especially the religious people, fuck them. We need them to take a hike anyway.
