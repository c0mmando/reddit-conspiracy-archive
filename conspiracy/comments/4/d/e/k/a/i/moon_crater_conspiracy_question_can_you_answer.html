       It's an interesting question, but it's based on a flawed assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are assuming that most meteorites approach from the direction of "away from the Earth."  Really, most meteorites are in orbits similar to the Earth's around the Sun.  So most impacts happen in the direction of the orbits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon rotates once every 28 days in relation to the direction of the Earth's orbit.  So it gets evenly exposed to impacting objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth might shield the moon from some impacts.  But it also pulls objects into a collision course with the moon that otherwise would have missed the moon.  You'd have to do a lot of math to figure out how those numbers balance out.  It could be the Earth is a net cause of impacts to the moon, who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       The main thing to consider is that the moon faces the direction of incoming impacts more or less evenly.

       No.  I am saying that the fact that the moon is tidally locked doesn't mean that the Earth's gravity sucks up all meteorites passing by.  The fact that the moon is held in orbit, and the fact that the moon is tidally locked, are reflections of other facts: the way the moon first entered the Earth's orbit, and the amount of time it has spent in that orbit, along with the fact that the moon does not have a molten core.
      </p>
      <p>
       You bring up the moon's orbit like it gives you information about the strength of the Earth's gravity.  It does not.

       <p>
        NASA calculates that the Earth obscures only about 4 square degrees out of 41,000 square degrees of the sky as seen from the Moon. "This makes the Earth negligible as a shield for the Moon. . . . It is likely that each side of the Moon has received equal numbers of impacts, but the resurfacing by lava results in fewer craters visible on the near side than the far side, even though the [sic] both sides have received the same number of impacts."

       Do. Your. Own. Research. For. Once. If you're actually interested and not just trying to get me to keep showing you proof because you want the blissful ignorance of not understanding things so you can make far out claims, then maybe do some research and Google it or go to a library if you don't trust Google. And if you don't trust books, contact a professional in the field. And if you don't trust the Professionals, become a professional. If you don't want to go through the motions before you ask questions easily answered already then you're just getting in the way of actual questions that don't have answers.

       Ah, so you are copping out with "do your own research". If you were so educated in your beliefs, you could help a nigga out. But, atlast you cannot. Which leads me to believe, you are full of shit and do not even understand what you are saying. Welp, that was fun. Next time, come more prepared, or just continue sticking your head in the sand and spout what ever gets pumped into your rear. Cheerio!

       I'm not copping out. I answered your original question then a series of other questions and if you can't get farther on your own I don't have time to "help" you. I've got my own life to take care of and questions I don't have answers to, to actually go and research like you should be.

       You gave me a sketchy link about lava/seismic activity. That said we have sensors on the moon, but then you said they were turned off in the late 70's... Calling people trolls only makes yourself look stupid and it contributes nothing to discussion. Sigh, you probably went to public schools. Have a nice night wanking to anime.. I mean your busy life of your own....

       Look dude seriously the answers are out there. I'm not an astrophysicist or anything so I don't know how to make you understand. I'm a learner not a teacher and frankly I don't really give a shit if you believe that there should be literally 0 impact craters in the moon because the earth gravity catches every single billion+ meteor that has ever crashed on either planet over millions of years. If you truly want to know, go study the mechanics of space. You will find your answers. Don't sit here smug in your misunderstanding because of how you THINK things SHOULD be. I've already entertained you people long enough and bow off to better things. Here's to hoping you actually go figure it out. Maybe you can show the mathematical equations to support why the earth' gravity should soak every single asteroid out of the moon's path. Good luck.

       Lol great rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, to add to your earlier point,  the moon was not always locked into its current orbit of the earth, but did at one point spin on its own axis. Thus, that 4% obscuring was at one point spread across the moon overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is in addition to the fact that the far side of the moon is "heavily cratered" while the near side is less so for reasons already discussed.

       This doesn't mean what you think it means.  Meteorites are much faster than the moon, too.  Being lighter and faster, they aren't captured into orbit around the Earth.  The moon is in orbit around the Earth because it is big and slow-moving.

        Why wouldn't the meteorites get pulled into a earths orbit?

       It depends on how fast they are going, and how closely they approach.  Mostly, they are going way too fast (relative to the Earth) to be perturbed much by the Earth.

      <p>
       A gravitational force is an acceleration.  It changes a velocity.  If the velocity is huge, the changes don't make that much difference.

       And let's not forget that the moon has gravity too. There is a point in space between the earth and the moon where if an object was left floating, it would fall towards the moon rather than the earth because the gravitational field from the moon has a greater effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how we can put spacecraft into orbit around the moon.
      </p>

       It is perfectly possible for an asteroid to enter into a decaying moon orbit where it orbits the moon a few times and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       impacts the surface, and that impact could happen on our side of the moon.

       it is not perfectly geostationary. i dont know the number but its gradual. like a degree every 400 years. So several thousands of years ago the other side of the moon faced the earth

       You have to bear in mind the distances involved with the moon and the earth.  Take a basket ball, and set it on the ground.  Thirty feet away, set a tennis ball.  This is pretty close to the actual ratio of sizes and distances for the earth and moon.  To help give you some perspective, the international space station would be about an inch off the surface of the basket ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think of all the angles you should shoot a BB gun at the tennis ball, and still hit the side facing the tennis ball.

       Two things:

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Just as the moon occupies only a small portion of the sky on Earth, Earth occupies only a small portion of the sky from the moon (sure, it's probably 10 times bigger, but still, it is
         <strong>
          NOT
         </strong>
         blocking impacts from both directions).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The moon wasn't
         <strong>
          always
         </strong>
         in a locked orbit around the Earth. This happened gradually over millions/billions of years from friction between the outer surface and a molten core.
