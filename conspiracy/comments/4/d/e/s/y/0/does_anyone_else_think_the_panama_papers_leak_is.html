       Do you have any idea at all how bat shit crazy you sound?  Why don't you wait a little while and see what the coming days, weeks, months bring?  There's a ton of information to sort through.  The biggest mistake that could be made is not going through every piece of data before putting anything out there.
       <br/>
       Anyway, so let me get this straight.  You believe "who" exactly conjured this all up to distract "who" from the "Hillary Email Scandal"?  Seriously?  C'mon?  See I think Aliens released the Panama papers so as to distract everyone while they take the UFO the government took from Roswell back.  And I think Obama may have leaked the papers as well so we're so distracted that we forget about the election and he gets to stay in for four more years.   Ya ever think about that?  Hmm?

       All of it collated by George Soros, so there won't be a single meaningful American in the list. Don't kid yourself.

       The one where Hillary finishes up her work on Mr. Trump from her knees, wipes the little dribbler off her chin, cuz some got loose and she's fastidious. She looks up into his eyes and humbly says "Pardon me, Mr. President. Those hands don't look so small at all."

       Generally, it is pretty close. So what you are saying is the american president and politics dont have an impact on the world stage? Id have to disagree with that. Especially knowing that many top politicians from around the world can be greatly impacted by US politics.

       My opinion: no. Unless there is an all-out war going on among the elites, I dont believe they would sacrifice that many people to put a single person in power. Especially when they can simply control anyone who gets in power. "sit here and watch this film of what happened to the last president who opposed us." roll zapruder film.

       Medium sized scandal? The biggest and most powerful country in the world had their secretary of state and possible future president sending classified communications with world leaders about sensitive issues through an unsecure and now hacked and released email server. Seems pretty damn major on a worldwide scale. And the only way to cover a major scandal on a worldwide scale is to release/create a bigger one to bury it. It isba way for the most powerful country to get one of the most corrupt politicians on a worldwide scale as leader of their country. What about this is medium sized?

       Yes. International top secret information being spread on an unsecured and hacked personal server of a head of state of the most powerful country on earth vs. corporations and officials hiding dirty money in tax havens. I can see how something we all assumed was going on anyways is way more major than top secret information being spread to all.

       So, no other countries are impacted by the US presidency or US politics? I think most UN and NATO countries would disagree with that. Especially when we delve into her emails and find an extreme amount of subversive communications and connections with those countries and its leaders.

       More than the US, it is more likely caused by Russian insiders close to Putin who are looking to make a run at the Russian presidency in 2018. Putin and his cronies have been bombarded with a lot of this information, and much of it could only have come from very close to the President of Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is anything to do with it on the US side, It's probably more likely a counterpunch to all of the interference Putin has been making on the election cycle in the US this year, using his social media troll army and clever propaganda tactics to drum up support for Trump and Sanders and undermine traditional candidates who represent American strength.
