<p>We know they manipulate us.</p>

<p>We know they are CIA-DoD bootlickers and have LIED us into wars--costing the U.S. trillions of dollars (in addition to the loss of 1 million+ dead Iraqis, the 5,000+ U.S. soldiers who died, the destruction of countries/regions, the refugees which the wars create).</p>

<p>We know that even when the Corporate News tells us the truth--it often is not presented in a timely manner and most likely contains glaring omissions.  Think about the 18 months the NYT held back the James Risen Patriot Act article which revealed the FISA court abuses (and helped GW Bush win a 2nd term).</p>

<p>Obviously there are others to choose from as well--Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, LA Times, cbs, nbc, abc, fox--but NYT and cnn both laid off workers in January 2015 and are low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p>We need to kneecap these LIARS and lower their traffic volume, which ultimately will lower their advertising revenue.  Until we do -- it will be business as usual -- the LIES will keep coming, the disinfo will continue to manipulate our society.  </p>

<p>The media conglomerates are planning on making $4.4 billion from the federal elections this year--maybe we can surprise 2 of them...</p>

<p>Please consider boycotting the New York Times and cnn...do NOT buy the NYT, do not watch cnn, do not visit the NYT or cnn websites, do not link to their articles...(find alternative sources for the articles...or post with the Wayback Machine...or just copy/paste the entire article).</p>

<p>Voting new leaders into office is only part of the equation--the media cabal must be hit hard, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been boycotting all but independent news for a long, long time.  It&#39;s best IMO to drop all cable programming.  The most we do in our household is watch movies on the DVD, almost always purchased 2nd hand.  We won&#39;t give Hollywood a nickel either.</p>

<p>buying them second hand gives them value (people who are still buying those first hand know they can sell them latter and buy new ones with that money)</p>

<p>If you really want to hurt them - pirate (just be smart about it, use anonymous proxies and/or VPNs)</p>

<p>I personally do not watch movies at all (one or two a year if even that much) - not because I protest them , but because they are same over hyped thing over and over again - I am mainly into podcasts and various internet channels/VideoShows/WhateverPeopleCallThem </p>

<p>regarding Cable News channels - solution is Cord Cutting - you can learn more on CordCutting subreddit</p>

<p>There are issues with some sport events I think , but there are also solutions so you might want to check it out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People should look into r/cordcutters if they are thinking of disengaging.  It&#39;s one of the best things we ever did.  It wasn&#39;t that hard to either, with commercials constantly interrupting anything you want to see, and the volume ever-increasing on those pharmaceutical commercials.  It&#39;s like Chinese water torture to watch regular tv when we are in a public place.  We cut cable, then for a few months went with Netflix, then later cut it out as well.</p>

<p>People should also ask for stations to be changed in public places, if they are playing one of the news propaganda stations.  Gradually things will change if people do this. TPTB count on their propaganda working. </p>

It&#39;s so obviously &quot;bread &amp; circuses&quot;, except you pay around $100/month for the privilege of being manipulated.  I think it was the pharmaceutical commercials I really just couldn&#39;t take any longer.  I especially loathe the commercials for things like viagra.  Never-ending succession of stupid commercials showing granny and gramps (who look suspiciously youthful) implying they were about to get it on.  I especially liked the one where they were in <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/wp-content/blogs.dir/398/files/2012/05/i-6b648a4c89c8d360c469b0c62afdda84-Cialis.jpg">adjoining bathtubs,</a> out in a forest watching a sunset or some shit.
