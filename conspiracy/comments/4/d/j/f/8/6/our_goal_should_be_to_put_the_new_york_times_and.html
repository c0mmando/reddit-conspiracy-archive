       We know the corporate news LIES to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they manipulate us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they are CIA-DoD bootlickers and have LIED us into wars--costing the U.S. trillions of dollars (in addition to the loss of 1 million+ dead Iraqis, the 5,000+ U.S. soldiers who died, the destruction of countries/regions, the refugees which the wars create).
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that even when the Corporate News tells us the truth--it often is not presented in a timely manner and most likely contains glaring omissions.  Think about the 18 months the NYT held back the James Risen Patriot Act article which revealed the FISA court abuses (and helped GW Bush win a 2nd term).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there are others to choose from as well--Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, LA Times, cbs, nbc, abc, fox--but NYT and cnn both laid off workers in January 2015 and are low-hanging fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to kneecap these LIARS and lower their traffic volume, which ultimately will lower their advertising revenue.  Until we do -- it will be business as usual -- the LIES will keep coming, the disinfo will continue to manipulate our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media conglomerates are planning on making $4.4 billion from the federal elections this year--maybe we can surprise 2 of them...
      </p>
      <p>
       Please consider boycotting the New York Times and cnn...do NOT buy the NYT, do not watch cnn, do not visit the NYT or cnn websites, do not link to their articles...(find alternative sources for the articles...or post with the Wayback Machine...or just copy/paste the entire article).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting new leaders into office is only part of the equation--the media cabal must be hit hard, too.

       CNN is the anus of "news" broadcasting.  As I've said here a couple of times, I credit Wolf Blitzer in particular with my awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been boycotting all but independent news for a long, long time.  It's best IMO to drop all cable programming.  The most we do in our household is watch movies on the DVD, almost always purchased 2nd hand.  We won't give Hollywood a nickel either.

       buying them second hand gives them value (people who are still buying those first hand know they can sell them latter and buy new ones with that money)

       If you really want to hurt them - pirate (just be smart about it, use anonymous proxies and/or VPNs)
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally do not watch movies at all (one or two a year if even that much) - not because I protest them , but because they are same over hyped thing over and over again - I am mainly into podcasts and various internet channels/VideoShows/WhateverPeopleCallThem

       regarding Cable News channels - solution is Cord Cutting - you can learn more on CordCutting subreddit

       It's across the board, nearly every western 'news' outlet: CNN, FoxNews, BBC, MSNBC, Al Jazeera.. And most of Reddit, tbh - the shills are hip deep here, whether promoting military objectives, the pharmaceutical industry, or simply consumer electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
       rather than simply putting them out of business, i'd rather see people improve their media savvy (incl. online interactions) so they can see through the lies.

       What about Fox News? It's just as much of a shithole. And what about right wing radio? Oh, and also the Washington Times. I mean if you're going to go after misleading, propaganda-spreading, co-opted media outlets, you shouldn't leave those out. Right?

       There's really no way to boycott MSM because their stories are used across the board by everyone. I do agree that the NYTs is a danger and has been for over 100 years. I agree that these propaganda outlets should just be shut down. They serve no purpose except to sway opinion. Let's get back to news and reporting and away from journalism and public relations.

       Not true--you can ask OP to copy/paste the article--or wait for the alt media to cover...the alt media often posts clips of the "news" as well.

       People should look into r/cordcutters if they are thinking of disengaging.  It's one of the best things we ever did.  It wasn't that hard to either, with commercials constantly interrupting anything you want to see, and the volume ever-increasing on those pharmaceutical commercials.  It's like Chinese water torture to watch regular tv when we are in a public place.  We cut cable, then for a few months went with Netflix, then later cut it out as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       People should also ask for stations to be changed in public places, if they are playing one of the news propaganda stations.  Gradually things will change if people do this. TPTB count on their propaganda working.

       I agree. I honestly cannot remember the last time I've had cable TV. Maybe ~4-5+ years? My brain thanks me, and so does my wallet.. When visiting others who have cable TV, it actual irritates me. Something about that frequency. Live in the woods long enough without it, and you'd understand..

       We also live in rural NW, just further south than you.  I understand completely about TV being pretty much intolerable now.

       It's comical and seems surreal. Then there is that humm. idk how to explain it, but I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. Good on you though! More people need to move away from this shit. Because that is what it is, it's shit. Looking up at the stars at night is far more inspiring, than the shitty "dancing with stars".

       It is surreal.  I don't know why more people refuse to watch at this point.  It's so obviously "bread &amp; circuses", except you pay around $100/month for the privilege of being manipulated.  I think it was the pharmaceutical commercials I really just couldn't take any longer.  I especially loathe the commercials for things like viagra.  Never-ending succession of stupid commercials showing granny and gramps (who look suspiciously youthful) implying they were about to get it on.  I especially liked the one where they were in

       In Syria there is a sitcom about a village that has their village snitch 'disappeared.' The town gets paranoid. Before they knew who was betraying them to the government, now it could be anyone. They wish for simpler times when they still had their village snitch.

       I wonder if losing CNN might be similar to this.

       I definitely appreciate users who simply copy/paste the article--seems to be a growing trend...

       and, yes, you're right--it is about people being media savvy...I'd definitely rather spend my time watching James Corbett (etc.) than reading the latest NYT-cnn disinfo.
