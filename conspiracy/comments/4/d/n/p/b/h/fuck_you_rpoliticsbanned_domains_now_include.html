    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... good point, I&#39;m not sure if it was ever actually officially banned though.  I know we talked about it and I personally supported its being banned but I don&#39;t remember what the conclusion to that convo was.  I also don&#39;t know how to program or check the automod so I can&#39;t confirm.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any threads from that domain in the spam filter though so that makes me suspect it <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been banned yet.  Otherwise it would probably be showing in the mod queue.  Either that or just no one has posted a link to that site recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To understand the lock-down on Reddit, look backward to a time when the site was more free to express alternative perspectives. </p>

<p>The Boston Bombing fiasco. At that time, a collaboration between 4chan and Reddit fingered wrong suspects and disseminated a conspiracy of men in military gear having planted the bomb. Alex Jones took the images disseminated from Reddit and made full length programs about having &quot;caught the bastards&quot; (US intelligence running a covert False Flag) red handed. Even recently, Paul Craig Roberts has written an essay about the Boston Bombing with the factoid - that it was a US intelligence false flag - as the main thrust of his story. </p>

<p>From the perspective of the FBI, having thousands of amateur sleuths contact them with this info-graphic diverted them from their main investigatory mission. And if you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist, consider how the government would react - true or not - to the mass dissemination of such information. </p>

<p>Next, The Fappening. A dissemination of images of nude celebrities, violating their privacy rights and - most importantly to the companies who back them - damaging their asset value and profit potential. Leaked by 4chan and disseminated through Reddit. This cost US $BILLIONS of dollars for mass media companies. </p>

<p>How would a media monopoly react to the mass devaluation of their prime assets - celebrities?  </p>

<p>They would work together to lock down the sites involved. Which, if you&#39;ve been following 4chan and Reddit, you&#39;d know is exactly what happened. Meep sold off 4chan and now works for Google. Reddit is run as a public relations arm of Conde Nast. </p>

<p>And this has happened <em>because</em> these sites have audience and that audience irresponsibly <em>abused</em> the free speech forum in ways the government and corporate oligopoly really didn&#39;t like. </p>

<p>And now they&#39;ve turned the screws to prevent it happening again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, in your opinion, the 10 or so writers at INFOWARS are worthless? They&#39;ve never contributed anything substantial? Or, do you just hate Alex Jones and appropriate that hate to 10 individual writers who write about what they want?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you seem to have a problem and should seek professional help.  </p>

<p>Please review my posts and then read your above question again.  Does that make sense to you what you&#39;re saying?  You are inferring quite a bit and IMO your jimmys seem to have been rustled.  </p>

<p>This leads me to believe that you&#39;re A) affiliated with infowars and are one of those 10 individual writers or B) spending all your time on infowars and find them to be the pinnacle of information and maybe C) just a pedantic troll sent to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to keep the tinfoil flowing freely.  </p>

<p>But, since I&#39;m here writing this nonsense back to you.  IMO NOTHING SHOULD BE CENSORED.  People can do whatever they want.  Those 10 writers can write about anything they want.  They are &quot;free&quot; to do just that.  I, however, am also &quot;free&quot; to not read it or give a shit about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not shit (I feel that I have to defend it).</p>

<p>It&#39;s run as a business. Does it spend it&#39;s time devoting to exposing the truth? Yes. Does it have some sensationalized titles? Yes. But I can tell you first hand that InfoWars aims to expose corruption.</p>

<p>Too often people here like to shit on InfoWars without realizing that millions like me first learnt about the NWO through InfoWars and Alex Jones. However much you despise InfoWars, it has done enormous amounts for growing the conspiracy theorist base. I truly believe Alex Jones is passionate about what he is doing. But, like I said, it&#39;s run as a business - so yes there is some exaggeration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do go onto other people and listen to what they have to say.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that Alex Jones has made millions of people stop and question the NWO and provided a window into the world of the Conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not fair that he gets shit on 24/7. He&#39;s done a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that he has gotten a lot of people to start questioning. I&#39;ll give him credit for that. I do think he&#39;s likely controlled op of some kind, but if he&#39;s opening some eyes it might not be the worst thing. </p>

<p>The problem is people accepting him as an authority (not implying you are), because that&#39;s the mindset we need to get away from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much what CelineHagbard stated.  </p>

<p>I would put it in the same bucket as Glen Beck and Bill Oreilly.  They both started out as hard hitting &quot;outsiders&quot; and then after creating huge followings they start to be less hard hitting and more lobbing soft balls.  Glen beck especially starts putting in so much bullshit that you can&#39;t even tell fact from fiction.  I don&#39;t watch any of these shows but at one time I did.  </p>

<p>The site is called infowars.   That to me is the textbook definition of propaganda.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think on this a moment.  A story/event is much larger than a narrative.  Even something so benign as an Easter egg hunt.  The &quot;source&quot; that is giving the narrative can skew the facts in such a way to make the reader understand something different.  If we stick to a single source.  Or even a few sources.  We limit ourselves and our understanding of a story or event.  </p>

<p>The majority of the populace doesn&#39;t have the time, take the time, make the time or give a shit because all of that stuff is hard.  It&#39;s much easier to believe the narrative and go on with your day playing with the kids, going to work or taking a walk.  </p>

<p>Many narratives are in our minds.  They collect in the brain and when enough of them are collected they can be used to control.  Very subtle yet very powerful.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Patriotism, Religion, God &amp; Country, Red vs. Blue team politics, build a wall, free college.  All of this is used to control us.  Carefully listen to campaign speeches.  They talk about very interesting things.  They never give solutions or paths they just give goals.  This is very powerful.  They work the narratives in the mind and get votes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He gets shit on 24/7 because he&#39;s so clearly paid for controlled opposition.  As stated here, Jones MUST release as much truth as possible as part of his shill efforts.  If he acted like the shill for Israel that he really is all the time, people would stop listening to him entirely.  His MO: release 9 truths, then 1 big lie to cover for his &quot;globalist&quot; employers.  To deflect the truth.  He&#39;s an act.  100% fraud.  A half assed, piss-poor actor at that.  See <a href="https://youtu.be/l9RBXlE86Ng">here</a></p>

<p>It is wonderful that he&#39;s played a part in waking many people up.  This is an unintended and undesired response.  Hia job is to make you, the conspiracy theorist, look as batshit crazy as he purposefully acts.  To deflect responsibilities from his zionist employers, and just like with your nightly propaganda news networks, to keep you in a constant state of fear.  All the while, the bitch is selling useless fear gadgets and potions.  </p>

<p>Scum, of the highest degree.  May he fuck right off into obscurity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had something similar happen more times than I can count. You say something that goes against the narrative. Then you come back a little bit later and your comment is no longer visible.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still there, but they fold it into one of those &quot;load more comments (3 replies)&quot; thingies. And it&#39;s not a coincidence either. You always get this when the total comment number gets into the thousands. Say something &quot;controversial&quot; though, and watch your comment get folded out of sight even when there&#39;s less than a hundred comments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s effective, it&#39;s subtle and it&#39;s bullshit.</p>
