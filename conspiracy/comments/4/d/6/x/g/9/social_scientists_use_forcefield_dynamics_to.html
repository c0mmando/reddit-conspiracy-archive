     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Recently I've been reading books by social scientists that describe how to bring about managed social change. The method is incredibly sophisticated. It turns out there are "National Training Laboratories" (here's a
       <a href="http://authorityresearch.com/Articles/National%20Training%20Laboratories.html">
        list
       </a>
       of them) in the United States that study this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your goal is to spread the Blue Pill what you need to do is capitalize on people's resentment towards the Father. 
Growing up, the Father necessarily moderates the child's carnal desires ("no desert until you finish your vegetables." ) This is
       <strong>
        good
       </strong>
       - the Father represents right-wrong/objective truth (i.e. Patriarchy.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans, however, often become fixated on dopamine rushes and therefore start to resent the Father for preventing access to sources of "dope" in the environment ("If I catch you doing X, Y, or Z you're grounded" etc.) Pleasurable sensations can come from a range of activities, so we’re not just talking about drugs and sex here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state exploits this tension to step in and replace the Father as the authority in the child's life. This is first done through the school system and colleges, which separate kids from the family and use
       <strong>
        force-field dynamics
       </strong>
       (or group psychology) to change kids' values.
       <strong>
        Kurt Lewin
       </strong>
       headed the "Group Dynamics" department at MIT and founded the first
       <strong>
        National Training Laboratory
       </strong>
       in 1947. This groups
       <a href="http://www.ntl.org/">
        website
       </a>
       says on the homepage: "Our mission is to advance Applied Behavioral Science (ABS) in the service of social justice, oppression-free societies..." In other words, they create social-justice warriors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ways, what Lewin discovered is something we all intuitively know: people are much more impressionable in group settings. If
       <strong>
        The Group
       </strong>
       appears to hold a certain belief, then individuals will adopt that belief in order to fit in. So if you want to change people's beliefs, what you should do is get them in groups that are led by trained facilitators who can lead the group discussion toward a predetermined outcome. This has the added benefit of making the consensus seem organic.  Check out
       <em>
        The Change Agent’s Guide to Education
       </em>
       (1976) if you want to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you also want to do is promote as much dopamine liberation as possible. So casual sex, liberal attitudes on drugs, party culture, etc. are all encouraged. Again, this has the effect of turning people's gaze AWAY from the Father (who is the voice of restraint, right/wrong, etc.) and towards moral relativism. Benjamin Bloom, who literally wrote the book on modern education (called
       <em>
        Taxonomy of Educational Objectives
       </em>
       ), had this to say in Book 1: “We recognize the point of view that truth and knowledge are only relative and that there are no hard and fast truths which exist for all time and places." (1)
      </p>
      <p>
       Group settings, dopamine liberation, moral relativism, separation from Father figures...sounds pretty similar to an American college, doesn't it? American colleges are actually based on the
       <strong>
        Soviet model.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Blue-pill environments cause cognitive dissonance because they go against our natural wiring. Social scientists purposefully construct them this way (they call it a "force field.") Lewin writes,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Change in organization can be derived from the overlapping between play [dopamine emancipation/fun with peer group/liberalism] and barrier [the Father's influence] behavior. To be governed by two strong goals is equivalent to the existence of two conflicting controlling heads within the organism. This should lead to a decrease in degree of hierarchical organization. Also, a certain disorganization should result from the fact that the cognitive-motor system loses to some degree its character of a good medium because of these conflicting heads.  It ceases to be in a state of near equilibrium...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So kids' natural orientation is overridden in Blue Pill environments and their brains are literally scrambled. Lewin refers to this practice as
       <strong>
        “unfreezing”
       </strong>
       values and beliefs. The goal is to then implement
       <strong>
        “change”
       </strong>
       (i.e. download your preferred values) and then permanently
       <strong>
        “freeze”
       </strong>
       them into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tension between these two conflicting world views (Natural Law vs. Blue Pill) is too much for most people to overcome. Bloom writes,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "[Reconciliation] is too challenging a goal for the individual to achieve on his own, and the net effect is either maladjustment or the embracing of a philosophy of life developed by others."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Felt-Needs vs. Objective Truth
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       To give an overly-simplified example: when you eat fast food, they want you to focus on the sensuous experience ("mmm this is delicious") instead of the objective truth ("this stuff makes me unhealthy.") Sense-perceptions are subjective truths - they differ for every body, can change from day-to-day, etc. If you rely on your feelings for the truth, you are stuck in what’s called the Affective domain. You will make decisions based on phenomena that has no objective truth to it, and open yourself up to being Gamed by others. So you see feminists constructing entire political philosophies based on their hurt feelings, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This quote has a bit of a Christian flavor, but I think it's 100% right overall:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are not to be lovers of the creation.  Those who are driven (liberated, emancipated) by the environment, are under the control of the environment and therefore are under the control of those who manipulate the environment for their desired ends (supply or accentuate the "appropriate information" to produce their desired outcome), they are slaves to their flesh and the environment (real or illusionary) which "drives" (stimulates) it.  Consider this as you look at what is happening around you, in the world (environment) you live in.

       Yes, and the "soft sciences" are particularly vulnerable, including HISTORY.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does one succeed or excel in such an "educational" environment? By accepting and
       <em>
        agreeing
       </em>
       with whatever the professor TELLS you to believe. Anyone who is foolish enough to raise objections or even to as the "wrong questions" - especially regarding certain "special" topics is playing with fire.

       My best college professor displayed the opposite behavior; supported engagement in discussions and with questions which certainly didn't need to agree with his ideas (There is a particular humanities professor whom I will never forget, and I went to an engineering college.  That says a lot about him)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have much experience with college humanities courses so I didn't get to fully grasp those professors who do what you said.  Can only imagine how horrible it'd be.

       Yup.

       Carl Rodgers was President of the American Psychological Association, and was voted the “sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.” (1) He was
       <strong>
        against
       </strong>
       Communist brainwashing, but had this to say in his book
       <em>
        On Becoming a Person
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Behavioral science is clearly moving forward; the increasing power for control which it gives will be held by some one or some group; such an individual or group will surely choose the purposes or goals to be achieved; and most of us will then be increasingly controlled by means so subtle we will not even be aware of them as controls. Thus whether a council of wise psychologists (if this is not a contradiction in terms) or a Stalin or a Big Brother has the power, and whether the goal is happiness, or productivity, or resolution of the Oedipus complex, or submission, or love of Big Brother, we will inevitably find ourselves moving toward the chosen goal, and probably thinking that we ourselves desire it. Thus if this line of reasoning is correct, it appears that some form of completely controlled society - a Walden Two or a 1984 - is coming.” (386) (2)
