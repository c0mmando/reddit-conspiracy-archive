       There is no good test though, no right and decent way for us to decide who qualifies to hold power. So, the only sensible option: no more rulers. no kings, no lords, no premiers, no presidents, no supreme leaders. No man should dictate the lifestyles or decisions of any other man. we don't need someone to tell us how to live or when to work or who to love. the only law we need is "do no harm, cause no loss."

       anarchy means no rulers, not no rules. we passed the point of needing "ghettos" many years ago, problems like that and socio-economic crime are solved very easily via a universal income and a removal of the greed/parasite principle from basic needs like housing, healthcare and food

       They have a working conscience.  It's just only shown to their immediate family and friends.  We don't count.  We are seen as less than they are - as less than human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you eat meat?  I assume you do - as most Westerners do.  A good argument can be made then that most of us humans cannot be said to have a good, working conscience either where it regards not harming non-human animals and other sentient life.  Most of us call ourselves moral, but we have no problem eating the meat of a butchered cow, the leg of a murdered bird, or draping the skin of another being who was killed for it over our shoulders (or on our hands, feet, or legs).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the .01%, it is
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       who are looked upon as not being worthy of any consideration.  The .01% definitely have a conscience.  It's just not extended to
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       .  It's applied only toward those beings that they see as being "worthy" of it...and they don't put us in that category.  It's similar to how most humans look upon non-human beings.  Most people think they are "better" and "more evolved" than anything that isn't human.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite think the same way.  It's just that to them, we aren't human.

       You're right.  Racism is another window into this phenomenon.  A racist can brutally torture and murder a member of the race they hate, go home, kiss their wife, tuck in their kids, genuinely love
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       and have a good night's sleep.

      <p>
       The thing is that we turn empathy on and off based on what we perceive to be our equals.  For some, all humans are equal and for those people the pain and joy of all other humans would matter to them if they observed it.  For others, some humans are inferior and for those others the pain and joy of some humans does not register in the same way in their minds.  Some people even extend their empathy to animals.  It's even possible to extend it to some animals and not to certain humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about the disassociation of personal identity from the subject.  THAT is what allows people to be callous to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we shouldn't elect people that are callous to the pain and joy of segments of the population.

       Exactly this.  Very appropriate example.

      <p>
       I agree with this as well.  However, even for those who consider all humans “equal”, it is important to dig deeper and
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       find out just who and what these people consider “a human being” to be.  This is, believe it or not, an important qualifier because 120 years ago, say, a white person in America could say “all humans are equal” with a completely straight face in one moment, and then proceed to put on a white hood and go take part in the remorseless lynching of a black person the next moment - and they wouldn’t consider such a paradoxical abomination as being contradictory in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, you are right in saying that it’s important to consider all humans equal.  However, it’s also important to consider all
       <em>
        different races
       </em>
       and ethnicities of people as being humans as well.

       I often say and feel that “all is One”.  I try to imbue what this means in my life as often and as much as possible - though I admit it is often not easy.

      <p>
       I agree with this wholeheartedly.  What this means, however, is that we would likely have to kick literally
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       out that is in office presently and replace them with a completely different order of people.  I’m all for this, by the way…but we might encounter a touch of resistance along the way.

       I agree with you to an extent. However, eating meat is a function of the requirement  to gather energy for our physical processes from the material available to us. We ultimately have no choice but to eat living things. Were we to  have such a choice about consuming living matter most of us would opt out.  The difference is that they voluntarily  base their decisions solely on personal greed.  It shows.

       No it isn’t.  It’s a function of our laziness and ignorance.  Nothing more.  We don’t need meat to survive.  Not in the least.  Matter of fact, study after study show that a non-meat diet is
       <em>
        significantly
       </em>
       healthier for the human body.

       EDIT:  None of this is meant to turn into any sort of “eat meat” vs “don’t eat meat” debate.  Not in the least.  I’ve been a non-meat eater for as long as I have, but I’m also not a 12 year old.  Before I stopped eating meat , I ate it just as much as (if not more than) the next person.  As such, I’m not judging you or anyone else for eating it.  This is the society we live in.  However, what I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       saying is that we most certainly don’t
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to eat meat.  There’s absolutely nothing nutritionally necessary in its consumption that we cannot get from non-meat products.  Additionally (and again) not eating meat is actually
       <em>
        healthier
       </em>
       .  It’s healthier for our bodies, it’s healthier for the planet, and it’s a
       <em>
        hell
       </em>
       of a lot healthier for the animals we’re killing and eating.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see how you’ve reacted to this whole “eating meat” dynamic, however?  You haven’t been mean or a jerk here in the least, so that’s not what I’m saying.  However, you very matter of factly made a very confident argument for why it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in fact right and indeed
       <em>
        necessary
       </em>
       for us to eat meat.  Think about that mentality you illustrated there for a minute.  It’s the result of an indoctrination that’s been pounded into you from
       <em>
        birth
       </em>
       by society - one you wholeheartedly buy, no longer question (if you ever actually did question it in the first place), and absolutely take very much for granted as fact; as “just the way things are”.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t think for a moment about the harm we human beings cause to all other non-human beings we kill and consume.  And why don’t you think about it?  Well, you don’t think about it because you were born and raised to think that human beings are “the most important beings”.  If a thing isn’t a human being, then it’s okay to kill and eat it.  It’s just as simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make you a bad person, however?
      </p>
      <p>
       No.  It doesn’t.  You have a mom and a dad and possibly some siblings, and friends, extended family, etc…and I’m sure you all love each other very much and have exhibited and extended great acts of warmth and love toward one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there’s likely not a chicken or a cow or a sheep or a lamb in existence that wouldn’t look at you and your family and say
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the same thing that you said in your OP about the elite.  It is
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       who don’t have a “working conscience” for them.  That much is certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have a working conscience, right?  You
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       .  You just don’t apply it to anyone or anything that’s not in your circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same modus operandi tends to apply to many groups - including the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is to try to excuse the elite.  It is, however, to let us know that - deleterious as are the actions of the elite against the 99% - we the people won’t be able to do much about it until we collectively raise our
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       level of consciousness up significantly and become more aware of our connection to the planet, our connection to each other, and our connection to all other beings living here with us.  Once we do that, then the harm being caused to us by the elite will be
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       obvious and glaring that we’ll be able to see right through all the undermining indoctrination they’ve brainwashed us with from birth, come together as the one people and species that we indeed are, move collectively/together
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       their manipulation, and then break free from it all toward a better planet and civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must first raise our level of individual and collective consciousness, however, and respect all life in general to such an extent that we no longer support the manipulation that we perpetrate upon other non-humans, and that we allow the elite to perpetrate upon
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s all connected.

       I agree.   No more psychopaths in office.  How to ID them?  Easy.  From this day forward, we will interview ALL public officials under an MRI, administered by a lie detector specialist with neurology training, a person chosen by the public.  The interview will be broadcast live at the expense of the federal government.

       OK, but I also want a bona fide medicine man from a native American tribe, a Buddhist monk, and at least three people that claim they have "psychic powers". Additionally, A grandmother with at least two grandchildren, and six of the best criminal defense attorneys available.

       That's the point of the MRI.  To my lay knowledge on the subject, it's infallible in terms of catching liars. A neurologist will see activity in the brain that shows clear fabrication of details and 'processing' verusus an honest persons' 'memory recall'

       This is true... however, they have a tremendous personal incentive to keep their positions. Furthermore, they are lacking the personal conscience that prevents most of us from engaging in violent acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we have a bunch of shitheads that will immediately resort to violence to maintain their power. Unfortunately, they also have
       <em>
        symbols
       </em>
       and an institutionalized (and largely accepted) means of social control.

       That will simply not help them retain their power in the face of overwhelming  public opinion. If we opposed them with violent revolution their violence would be  effective though. They can hire endless numbers of mercenaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I'm not talking about taking any of them out of positions they already hold. I'm talking about causing their replacements, as they come along, to become more human.  It's not a sudden change but it would still be quick.

       This is our only shot. I'm sorry to see  opposition. I'd be glad to hear your alternative way of getting rid of such  leadership.

       There's really only two options in my book, the hard way and the easy way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easy way would be to rise up as a whole, destroy their symbols and break their institutions, by fire and blood. The tree bares poison fruit, so we cut it down. Many will perish, and the net-result remains completely up the air. Historically, probably more of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hard way is we strike at the root of the issue, which is simply people's belief that our current system is the "best we can do", or that "we can change this shit by doing the same things again". People's beliefs that they are powerless in the face of these forces. People's beliefs that there isn't enough, and that they have an exclusive line on the correct path a soul should take. People's beliefs that they have the right to imprison or kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like you want to take the hard way ;)

       I'm not really sure what led you to that conclusion. Wherein my responses do I give the impression that I want the world to burn, exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to take the easy way either here...Changing what people believe they are capable of doing will be the most effective way to heal this society, and it will prove to be the most difficult. People have built their entire lives on beliefs, and they are often the strongest things people possess.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you hope to swing public opinion when people just don't care? They don't care anymore because they no longer believe they can do anything about it. Thus, the only path to change is to educate.

       Yes they are. Let me tell you why that doesn't matter. They will fake it, they will lie and they will fool people at least for a little while.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the  vast public wants a show of conscience then our example  animalistic leader needs to hide his uncivilized behavior, like making excuses for torture for instance. It's  the way racists must hide their racism from the open public. You can still  be a racist in 2016 but you better not let it get to be a label that the public puts on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The magic of that is that there are automatically less opportunities for them to act  in ways that make their true intentions obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less opportunity to do evil (or even practice racism as in my earlier  example) means an actual reduction in the actual evil done.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what they do to hide it. Their practices  would have  to be reduced to an amount that can be hidden.  Public relief would follow.

       The vote is completely corrupt for the same reason.

      <p>
       People without conscience count and manipulate the vote They decide for us who the candidates will be. They do this fro personal gain alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the public was to notice the problem of lack of conscience in virtually every leader of every kind, they could slowly reduce the animalistic qualities of our current leadership.   We are better than animals, aren't we?

       It's a great sentiment but...

        People who can't provide evidence of having a working conscience should never have power over others.

       They'll just fake it. If you don't believe me, look at all the shit people do just to get into "the right school".

       Besides that, you need another power that can supervise/decide who's eligible for leadership and who isn't. Any such group itself would be a target for corruption and/or subversion by those who seek power for their own selfish gains.

       There is an alternative though. In some African traditional cultures, there are secret societies the exist. The function of these societies is to act as a counter-balance to the power of an "unworthy chief". In one way, this is a similar concept to the checks and balances found in the American constitutional system.

       It's probably no coincidence that the political constitution of the US is based on the Masonic concept of a constitution. Most people aren't aware of this, but Mason's lodges all have their own constitution and that the Masonic idea of a constitution predates that of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why bring Freemasons into this? Because they might very well be an example of a secret society similar to the African ones I mentioned earlier. A group of people that act to balance or counter the actions of an unworthy leader.

       On the other hand, they may also have been corrupted or subverted by those same people long ago.

       The most important thing you will write? Then you should have expanded and explained it better. How do you test someone for "working conscience" as opposed to "pretending"?

       I have explained, you don't need to. Just hiding sociopathy reduces its scope and the harm done..
