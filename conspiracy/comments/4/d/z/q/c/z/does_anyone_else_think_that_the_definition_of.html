    <div class="md"><p>Just keep talking. Personally, I&#39;ve found that qualifying my thoughts with, &quot;I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist, but...&quot; helps others not react so strongly to my thoughts and consider them without balking immediately. But I have had random strangers I&#39;ve stuck up conversations with correct me when I say I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist with, &quot;No, you&#39;re a critical thinker&quot; and that&#39;s pretty kickass. We&#39;re everywhere.</p>

<p>Friends and relatives will now seek me out for my insight on things, saying, &quot;Hey, dejenerate, I know you&#39;re a crazy conspiracy theorist, what&#39;s your take on $some-batshit-insane-news-item-that&#39;s-obviously-a-conspiracy?&quot; In fact, I&#39;ve had some relatives bring (incredibly plausible and original) theories to me.

    <div class="md"><p>That is amazing. I&#39;m glad people around you are more open to understanding. Thank you, this validates that hope can never be lost as long as the truth exists. </p>

<p>I also think being a &#39;Conspiracy Theorist&#39; in this day and age is pretty great because if someone decides to fact check you they might get their face blown off with evidence rather than just a &#39;theory&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I think that that is the most palatable term, the most accurate is &#39;heretics&#39;. </p>

<p>Not only do we question the orthodox narrative for a variety of subjects, we are treated with the same disdain as heretics of old. If you put aside your religious beliefs and read heretical arguments from a purely secular point of view, you will find that they are not very different to the sorts of things we talk about here. Heretical arguments, from both sides, are often along the lines of &quot;we believe that you are mistaken in your interpretation of the evidence and that we are correct in ours&quot;. Another common theme is &quot;you are lying and unjustly profiting from that lie&quot;, albeit not always outright stated.</p>

<p>The greatest heresy to ever successfully threaten the Catholic Church was the Protestant movement. We call them Protestants because people protested what they saw as a corrupt Papacy and, by extension, a corrupted religion. The issues of simony and indulgences, which in part led to the Reformation, are little different to the issues at the top of this sub right now: corrupt people in positions of power using their status to further their own wealth or agenda at the expense of the pissant majority. </p>

<p>What? The Archbishop paid for his position? He might be the second son of the local lord, but he <em>earned</em> his position through merit. You&#39;re just a conspiracy theorist! trying to sully the good name of a good man with your ignorance. The Church <em>needs</em> those indulgences to spread the word of the Lord, those people telling you about palaces and gold don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about! Have you ever been to Rome? I have, and I can tell you it&#39;s just a normal town like yours. We should burn the stupid book you read that in, and the person who wrote it!</p>

<p>While the subjects are a little different, the arguments, tactics, and results are, more or less, the same: ridicule and attempts at suppression which sometimes lead to convenient deaths. The heretics of five hundred, or a thousand, years ago threatened Catholic hegemony in the same way that conspiracy theorists threaten governments and corporations today. If a region converts to heresy, they no longer pay tithes to the Catholic Church and this might spread, shaking the World Order and threatening to bring the whole structure crashing down.</p>

<p>When you come here and question the official mainstream narrative of 9/11, you are engaging in heresy. When you come here and discuss corruption the MSM is ignoring, you are engaging in heresy. When you discuss climate change, vaccines, UFOs, the CIA, Monsanto or Reptilian Satanist Jews, you are engaging in heresy. Even if you&#39;re a God-fearing, rosary-wearing, Church-on-Sundays type of Catholic, you&#39;re a heretic when you challenge the orthodoxy as we do in almost every thread in r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>Gutenberg&#39;s Press led directly to Martin Luther and the Reformation. Berners-Lee is the modern Gutenberg and we are the heretical protestants spreading dangerous ideas. To stretch the analogy further, as the self-described &quot;front page of the internet&quot;, reddit is very much like the apocryphal cathedral door getting shit nailed to it all day. Reformation 2.0 is in full sway. Some know it, more sense it, but most still look to Rome for guidance and mock those silly heretics.</p>
