       As I promised last night I dug through my old hard drives and found what I could from my old stuff from then. On September 11th, 2001 I was a Private First Class in the U.S. Army, and was stationed at Ft. Myer, Va. Ft. Myer is separated from the Pentagon by Arlington National Cemetery. Close enough that we felt the shock wave from the plane's impact in our barracks. While the firefighters were getting the fire under control we got tasked to walk the entire cemetery to find any wreckage of the plane we could. Then, September 12th in the evening we went over to the Pentagon and waited for the Firefighters to give the all clear. That night we started going in to perform rescue/ recovery operations, but in all honesty at that point it was more find, bag, and tag. The platoons in my company each got a 4 hr shift inside doing recovery. When we weren't inside we were either perimeter guard around the pentagon, or guarding the North Parking lot where the  airplane parts were being gathered for the FFA to collect.

       Here are some pictures from inside the Pentagon

       At one point we found a section of the cabin still in take with passengers flash burned to the chairs. We had to build set ups of tarps around them to get them out, because the people couldn't be separated from the chairs to be put in body bags. We also had to carry around red biohazard bags to put remains in that were too small to tell what they were, so the coroners could DNA test the pieces individually. Even with my deployment included that was the busiest two weeks of my military career. The few days that were given off from recovery there was to do the military funerals for the people killed there, and the funerals were in the section of the cemetery you can see in the aerial Pentagon picture, so we still got to see it and smell it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other questions please feel free to ask. I'll tell you now the only thing I'm telling you right now is that the 100% truth is that a plane went into the Pentagon. That is it.
      </p>

       I look forward to talking to you all, Thanks

       You're lying.  A 757-200 is over half a football field long, with a 125' wingspan, and a tail standing 45'.  It has two huge 7000 lb engines, a massive landing gear, literally miles of wiring, and over 200 seats.  The operating weight when empty is about 130,000 lbs.  There is no way that a 757-200, over 130,000 lbs, over half a football field long, folded its wings and tail, and went into

      <p>
       In the first picture, which may or may not have been taken at the Pentagon, there is nothing resembling a 130,000 lb plane over half a football field long.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second picture, that may or may not be a plane part, but there is nothing resembling the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the third picture, we are shown a hole in what is purported to be the C-ring of the Pentagon.  There is nothing in that picture big enough to punch that hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the Pentagon, arguably the most protected building in the world, we have been shown no pictures or videos of the engines, the wings, the tail, the landing gear, the wiring, the seats, the luggage, or the bodies.  We have been shown no proof that a plane crashed into or near the Pentagon on 9/11.  Your words are not proof.  Those pictures you posted are not proof.

         The picture you reference for no damage on the ground is a straight shot of the damage from behind a firetruck. The plane came in from and angle off to the right of the picture.

         When you smash a plane into another solid object it is not going to stay in nice big identifiable pieces for your convenience. There were big pieces, there were little pieces, and there were pieces you couldn't tell what belong to the plane or the building.

         and 5. Exactly! The Pentagon is part of the department of defense. The only people allowed in with any type of camera were members of the 3 letter agencies and the coroner offices.  When talking about/ dealing with D.o.D. establishments the F.O.I.A. doesn't cover them. You can ask till you are blue in the face and they will drop you the finger and smile at you. What ever pictures that haven't been released you will never see.

       A 130,000 lb plane over half a football field long is going to leave something identifiable.  For instance, there were over 200 seats on that plane...you yourself said you saw a section with multiple seats intact, yet We The People haven't been shown a picture or a video of a single seat.  Are you trying to make us believe that the rest of the plane vaporized?  That it turned into a vapor?  Bullshit!

       So you can show us a picture of what may be inside the Pentagon, and what may or not be a plane part inside what may or may not be the Pentagon, but that's all, because you might get in trouble.  Right.

       Look, you will believe what you want to believe. The truth of the matter here is I was there. I saw these things and I carry them with me everyday. I will not have my integrity questioned by you. Who are you? You are the person that when this topic comes up snickers to yourself because you think you are being lied to and you know the truth and think you are privileged to have some great insight. Now, what do I have to gain from coming here and telling you what happened there? The answer is nothing except to help you actually know what happened. I'm not a member of the cia, fbi, or whoever else you have nightmares of keeping you awake because you seem to think you sitting on this sub is even a blip on their radar. 
I'm here to tell you one thing and one thing only. A plane crashed into the pentagon. I spent two weeks knee deep in that bullshit. I make no claim to 100% know who or why that plane ended up in that building but it did, and I did my job, found who I could in there, and then I escorted those people their their final rest in Arlington.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong I have questions about that day myself. Like, the crash of flight 93 in PA. The official story being that the passengers rose up and took the plane down, but from the debris field and the fact that before we heard about that plane going down two F-16's went flying over our base heading in that direction as fast as they could. I personally believe that 93 was shot down, but the better story for morale is that those passengers did it rather than some official having to make what could have been the toughest decision of their lives.

       It's clear nothing will ever convince you otherwise, even a detailed analysis like the above site provides, using a large number of varied sources. But these simulations also help paint a clear picture as to how both the

       If you honestly look at these three links and still have serious doubts, then there's no point in anyone else really arguing with you unless you have some kind of aeronautics or structural engineering degree to help us understand why you believe the physics don't exist in the real world.

       It doesn't take a degree in anything.  Nothing we have been shown, including your bullshit "simulations", is proof that a plane flew into the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need "some kind of aeronautics or structural engineering degree" to determine a plane crashed in any other passenger plane crashes, because we can see recognizable plane parts in other plane crashes.  There's only two passenger plane crashes where we're shown nothing resembling a plane, and they both happened on the exact same day that we're told to believe that two 110-story towers turned to dust because of jet fuel.

       The simulations were never intended to be literal proof, but more proof of the fact that yes, this could in fact be a plane crash. And not just a plane crash, but one that could 'fit in that hole', miss the cable spools, not create any lawn damage, and leave little-to-no visible evidence of a plane. You said it wasn't physically possible, but physics seem to be telling you otherwise and you're still ignoring it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious more where the proof of a missile attack lies. The supposed lack of plane evidence is not proof of anything, and if you ask me, there seems to be more evidence pointing towards a plane crash than a missile, including literal images of plane parts at the crash site. You can hand-wave them away as government plants, but then that just means you're ignoring evidence without proof of your own which undermines your entire argument, which is apparently a foothold on lack of proof.

       It's not "Well, a plane hit the Pentagon, and at the exact same time, a plane didn't hit the Pentagon."  Either a plane hit there or it didn't.  It's not a situation where we can just "agree to disagree," because one of us is right, and one of us is wrong.

       They should have at least tried a little harder.  It would have been the most extraordinary day(s) of their life, but only 2 paragraphs?  Looks like pics anyone could get from the internet, including "their" picture.  Just happens to coincide with the post re: actual witness of the woman who survived?  Really sloppy, and not at all convincing.  Yeah, sure, huge wings (with titanium engine parts) just folded perfectly inward.  There are pics of the lawn before they had time to destroy the evidence, and there was no evidence a plane hit the ground there.  There are no photos, but there were over 80 cameras, IIRC, that should have captured the "plane" slamming into one of the most secure buildings in the world.  Our government and zionist Israel did this to start endless war for profit.

       I seriously wish I could have more to help, but the only people that had cameras in there were members of the 3 letter agencies or coroners. We were tasked with gather pieces up and trying to figure out what was what. The hardest part was discerning smaller plane parts from building wreckage. By the end of the first week in there I could tell if I had picked up human remains by touch and texture.

       Nothing new, just the work of a kid who googled some pictures of pentagon on 9/11. Same stuff we've seen before. And there is one pic of him with his unit. He looks like a very young chap. Probably the same people behind anything to do with 9/11 are in the propaganda wing of the military today.

       Well, two years ago when I went to talk about this I got a bunch of attitude like some of the other comments that you see in here, but the other night I commented on another post, and there were some open minded questions. I decided to do this. Look, if you are open minded and what to find out good on you and I will tell you whatever I know from my first hand experience. The part that really sucks is the photos to back stuff up. This happened almost 15 years ago. It's not like now where everyone has a phone with a camera on it. Also, this is the Pentagon it is considered a military installation, so after it happened agents confiscated ever possible cctv footage they could. You can put in FOIA requests till you are blue in the face, but since that directly affects national security/ defense they will drop a finger to you.

       It doesn't matter what you say at this point.  You're military and the people who command you betrayed the country so we can't trust you in any way.  Also, you said yourself you were not on the location when it happened.  I can burn a dead possum and I guarantee you cannot tell me it's not a burning human if you didnt' see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really sincerely believe you're serving the people of this country, then good on you.  But understand this: a lot of people think you haven't and you have to respec their opinions also and not turn into some kind of murderer bully authoritarian when the shit goes wrong in a few months.  You have to understand that most people now feel 9/11 was a coverup and they have good reason to.  If you don't get that, then you have some homework to do, lad.

       1. My unit pic was in my hard drive and the maps that I had put stuff on. From when I had done presentations for history classes while I was a recruiter, but yes the inside pics are from the internet when people from the other day had said that there were no pictures of plane parts any where in the wreckage.

        <p>
         Our base was completely locked down immediately and we were on our rucksacks with our weapons waiting for more information and how we were going to mobilize and in what fashion. We had to watch everyone walked from D.C. back home. All mass transportation was shut down immediately.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In our barracks, yes, at that unit the barracks are also our work areas. the basement floor is where the arms room, supply, platoon offices, command offices, and training room. 1st and 2nd floor where for barracks rooms, and the 3rd floor was the off post rooms for soldiers who lived off base.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         yes we found small wreckage pieces scattered throughout.

       Does the opening in the building seem at all suspicious to you? It's just so perfectly round that it is hard to imagine a plane is what caused it.  Without any pictures of any identifiable wreckage I'm still skeptical. If the fuselage remained in tack which I'm imagining it would have to be for people to be found in their chairs where is all the pictures of the wreckage?

       The small breach in that area could be explained by the assumed re-enforcement, the hardening of the whole building, given it's a military compound.

       The

       Yeah, the flashed burned people were passengers on the plane. Here is where we start getting into crazier territory. The plane hit a section of the Pentagon that had just finished being renovated and reinforced, so most of the office personnel hadn't finished moving back into that section. If it had been fully moved back into casualties there would have been in the low thousand area easily. Most of the people we found in the section that weren't on the plane or in its path were found in one piece. A lot of the dead in the building was caused from the pressure of the shock wave. Since the building's windows are reinforced they didn't blow out so a lot pf pressure stayed in the building.

       That hole was made by the engineers and firefighters to be able to get in there from the opposite side. They had to get in there and reinforce the building behind the firefighters. In the back ground of this pic

       you can see the engineers putting " railroad ties" stacked around pillars to help support the building. They would use bobcats to clear debris into piles, and then we had to dig in the piles and sort the stuff.

       Yeah, that opening was made by engineers and firefighters on an inside ring to give access from the other side to get to the fire. The plane was torn to shreds, but we would find random pieces larger than others. Like the people in the chairs was seriously just the chairs and parts of the floor still together. It was just five chairs and the floor in the middle of this rubble. We would find things completely fucked up then in the middle of all this carnage was a girls pink back pack with her teddy bear inside it. The bag had mild charring and soaked from the water, but otherwise fine.

       That was in between the rings of the Pentagon. There are little "roads"  that gators can navigate through for service workers, and the firefighters and engineers had knocked holes in the rings for people to come from the other side.
