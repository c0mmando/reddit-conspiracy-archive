These are from sources that have been submitted thousands of times by other users without objection, but they become &quot;rehosted content&quot; when certain users post them as if by magic:</p>

<p>Why do people tolerate this blatant censorship? I&#39;ve honestly never had a problem on this sub until I explained how the election is being stolen right in front of our faces:</p>

<p>What these mods don&#39;t realize (or perhaps some of them do but they just don&#39;t realize that it won&#39;t end well for them in the end) is that they&#39;re acting as collaborators in a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the sovereignty of the free world.

    <div class="md"><p>Please. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> about nothing but censorship. They have banned almost all the leftist sites I regularly read so it&#39;s not just about conservative content. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.truth-out.org/">Truth-Out</a></p>

<p><a href="http://commondreams.org/">Common Dreams</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.truthdig.com/">Truth Dig</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/">Alternet</a></p>

<p>And on and on. </p>

<p>And almost everything I post, even from other sites, is removed. </p>

<p>The sub is more against Hillary than the Republican National Party. You might claim that&#39;s because they are pro-Bernie. But even Bernie doesn&#39;t demonize Hillary this way. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> doesn&#39;t think Bernie can win but wants to make sure Hillary can&#39;t either. So they are as right wing Republican establishment as they can be. </p>

And I frequently think they are just an arm of the plutocracy pretending to be left so they can take over leftist politics, just as they have mostly taken over the Democratic Party through the use of compliant moles.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting..but I don&#39;t think any of those sources are truly banned on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, they just don&#39;t want people flooding the submission queue with those sources. Thats understandbale..but  at least they&#39;ll still let you link to those sources in the comments. The big red flag is that I was also banned from commenting in r/politics for merely submitting &quot;rehosted content&quot;. It&#39;s one thing to temporarily ban or even permanently ban from submitting articles after a clear warning, but preventing someone from even commenting without even a single warning makes ill intent quite obvious.</p>

Aside from an the outright theft of the election, the larger conspiracy making the news these past few days involves Panama Papers, the IMF&#39;s role in intentionally creating crises, and high level intelligence whistleblowers exposing Obama&#39;s willful decision to give rise to ISIS. </p>

<p>This is all biblical scale stuff. There&#39;s no reason for the censorship unless you&#39;re in on it.</p>

<p>i agree whole heartedly but does anybody <em>actually</em> believe that reddit can really influence or change the outcome of an election? maybe I&#39;m just too cynical at this point but I&#39;ve known reddit has been gamed and censored for years.  r/politics isn&#39;t even a default sub anymore is it? i dont know what you expect from that echo chamber. </p>

<p>These people wouldn&#39;t be trying so hard to silence dissent if it weren&#39;t true. I&#39;ve noticed over a few years of consistently talking about the real issues that speaking the truth has a powerful effect. All of this exposure of high level corruption is unprecedented. And much of it has happened within the last week or so. No doubt minds are being blown, friend. The Stasi wannabe&#39;s are just desperately trying to hide this fact from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm.. you know, I think you may be on to something here. Apparently the mod who banned me from r/politics has spent 8 straight years doing little else besides hIjacking the political discourse on reddit. I honestly didn&#39;t figure why someone would volunteer so much of their free time to censoring political discourse other than being some unemployed basement dweller leftist type with nothing better to do. But thanks for opening my eyes :)</p>
