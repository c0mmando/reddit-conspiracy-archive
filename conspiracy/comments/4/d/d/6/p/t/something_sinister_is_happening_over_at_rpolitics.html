       At this defining moment in world history, certain mods are purging certain conservative users by tagging all their submissions as "rehosted content" and then banning them for repeatedly violating sub rules. These are from sources that have been submitted thousands of times by other users without objection, but they become "rehosted content" when certain users post them as if by magic:

       Why do people tolerate this blatant censorship? I've honestly never had a problem on this sub until I explained how the election is being stolen right in front of our faces:

       What disappoints me are the people I know that if Bernie doesn't get the nomination they will throw all their support to Hillary. That's so fucking hypocritical. Vote 3rd party or don't vote at all. I'd rather Trump than Hillary 1000 times over

       Trump isn't establishment he has his own money. And I still wouldn't vote for him. Im going to vote for bernie in the primary of my state, ive never done it before and still am hesitant to cast a vote. I'd still rather trump be president than ANOTHER Clinton any day.

       Thanks for the links I'll check it out! I'm not very familiar with all the great off the beaten path subs that dont engage in this censorship

       What these mods don't realize (or perhaps some of them do but they just don't realize that it won't end well for them in the end) is that they're acting as collaborators in a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the sovereignty of the free world. They will be held accountable one way or the other.

       I think there's plenty of good mods out there, but the one's still engaged in censorship at his late stage with the global criminal conspiracy fully exposed can't claim ignorance. They're reading all the well informed submissions before censoring them, so they're well aware of what they're doing. I don't see how it's not collaborating with the enemy.

       The sub is more against Hillary than the Republican National Party. You might claim that's because they are pro-Bernie. But even Bernie doesn't demonize Hillary this way.

       Alternet and Common Dreams are both self-righteous, urban leftist outrage rags, for the most part.  For genuine Communism, though, you'd probably want the Daily Kos or similar.

       Not in my opinion. Certainly not as left as I am. And I frequently think they are just an arm of the plutocracy pretending to be left so they can take over leftist politics, just as they have mostly taken over the Democratic Party through the use of compliant moles. You might argue they took over the Republicans too. But they always WERE the core of the republican party.

       Interesting..but I don't think any of those sources are truly banned on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , they just don't want people flooding the submission queue with those sources. Thats understandbale..but  at least they'll still let you link to those sources in the comments. The big red flag is that I was also banned from commenting in r/politics for merely submitting "rehosted content". It's one thing to temporarily ban or even permanently ban from submitting articles after a clear warning, but preventing someone from even commenting without even a single warning makes ill intent quite obvious.

       can be pro-Bernie til' the cows come home but it won't prevent Hillary from stealing the election. Aside from an the outright theft of the election, the larger conspiracy making the news these past few days involves Panama Papers, the IMF's role in intentionally creating crises, and high level intelligence whistleblowers exposing Obama's willful decision to give rise to ISIS.

       i agree whole heartedly but does anybody

       believe that reddit can really influence or change the outcome of an election? maybe I'm just too cynical at this point but I've known reddit has been gamed and censored for years.  r/politics isn't even a default sub anymore is it? i dont know what you expect from that echo chamber.

       These people wouldn't be trying so hard to silence dissent if it weren't true. I've noticed over a few years of consistently talking about the real issues that speaking the truth has a powerful effect. All of this exposure of high level corruption is unprecedented. And much of it has happened within the last week or so. No doubt minds are being blown, friend. The Stasi wannabe's are just desperately trying to hide this fact from you.

       Hmm.. you know, I think you may be on to something here. Apparently the mod who banned me from r/politics has spent 8 straight years doing little else besides hIjacking the political discourse on reddit. I honestly didn't figure why someone would volunteer so much of their free time to censoring political discourse other than being some unemployed basement dweller leftist type with nothing better to do. But thanks for opening my eyes :)

       Reminds me of that time I exposed a nuclear industry shill on r/energy who was saying that Fukushima was nothing to be concerned about. He responded by accusing me of being the shill, asking me repeatedly "who do you work for?!?"
