    <div class="md"><p>I assume you want to hear the anti-vax side of things, rather than the pro-vax side which you are likely to be more familiar with?</p>

<p>Some people believe that vaccines can cause harm. Indeed, a huge amount of money is awarded to patients who have been harmed by vaccines every year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court</a></p>

<p>A doctor who worked for the CDC (Dr. William Thompson) became a whistleblower recently, stating that the CDC obfuscated data which showed a link between a particular vaccine and the incidence of Autism among certain subgroups of those vaccinated. </p>

<p>There are many documented cases of big pharma companies covering up data which shows their products cause harm (e.g. prozac and teenagers <a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/ssri/suicide/">https://www.drugwatch.com/ssri/suicide/</a>), so it is not inconceivable that the same happens with some vaccines.</p>

<p>Some people argue that vaccinations are under-studied - particularly the interaction between various vaccines which are given in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>In my opinion, overall vaccines probably do more harm than good, but the way the system is set up means that companies have an incentive to hide data which shows products cause harm. Drug companies should be forced to publish all their data from every study they conduct. In addition, interactions between vaccines should be rigorously studied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so let me respond because Thattransgirl isn&#39;t doing a great job at presenting his/her point of view. </p>

<p>Let me first address your list of ingredients found in vaccines.
It&#39;s important to ask yourself if you really know what these ingredients are.
Are they harmful because studies have found them to be? Or do they just sound scientific and scary.</p>

<p>Chemicals, especially the ones you&#39;ve listed, often sound dangerous because they are used in manufacturing of products not associated with health. Things not made for consumption, or dangerous in large quantities. What we tend to forget is that our body ingests and processes a lot of toxic chemicals that are deadly in large quantities. We are constantly eating, breathing and exposing ourselves to things that are very toxic. Luckily, our bodies filter out these toxins, and as long as we aren&#39;t exposed to large quantities of them, we continue to survive. In the context of vaccines, the amount is incredibly negligible given the amount. </p>

<p>Let me reference a few of your examples specifically.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is actually produced by our bodies naturally and plays an essential role in our metabolism. Whether from an external source or produced by our bodies, it&#39;s converted into formate. Which we urinate or further break down into CO2 and exhaled.</p>

<p>Many of your references include aluminum this, or that... You would be surprised as to how much aluminum you consume in ordinary foods. Ever drink beer? Every eat fruit? Breathe air? Breastmilk contains 0.04 milligrams of aluminum per liter. There are considerable amounts of all the iterations of aluminum that you&#39;ve mentioned that we are exposed to it on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Sucrose is sugar. 
Potassium chloride is in bananas. </p>

<p>I could go on, but all of the chemicals you&#39;ve mentioned have been proven to be benign in small amounts... and the amount used in vaccines are so much smaller, that you would be better off worrying about the things you eat that have much higher doses of all of the ingredients you&#39;ve mentioned.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying that science has 100% certainty of anything, but wouldn&#39;t you prefer being informed?
From my perspective, the dangers of vaccines seem to be from misinformation and distrust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took the time to read the link you sent.
I&#39;m assuming the counter argument you&#39;re providing is that we are using vaccines more, and the cumulative effect of all those shots is more dangerous today because of the increased exposure to the chemicals (like mercury) in them. </p>

<p>To respond to the infant death increase in the article I would sugest reading <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-vaccine-idUSBRE90F1JE20130116">this article</a>
Correlation, does not mean causation. The article you referenced didn&#39;t really provide information on why the deaths occurred. The rise was due to mothers contracting influenza during the 09 epidemic . I realise that this argument is more about how people interpret information, and a general distrust of the medical field, so even if I quote studies by universities and medical colleges it becomes a &quot;they&#39;re lobbied by big pharma... etc&quot;.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to note that Thimerosal (Mercury) is no longer used in general vaccines for children (except sometimes for the flu shot, however parents can request a mercury free version). The NRDC pressed for it&#39;s removal in the late 1990&#39;s. 
...and just to respond to the claim that the total amount of mercury (150 mcgs) that someone would have been exposed to cumulatively, is still incredibly small, given that it isn&#39;t all at one time... and that eating fish exposes you to much much more. Even if you don&#39;t buy that arguement, the fact that vaccines don&#39;t contain it anymore makes it mute.</p>

It&#39;s not as cut and dried as the authorities (the CDC, WHO, etc) would have you believe.  There are a lot of compelling reasons for grave skepticism of vaccines.  You need to educate yourself.  The authorities are too often wrong.  Medicine as a field is highly political and very money-oriented.  </p>

<p>Robertson et al. (1992) wrote that in 1985 and 1986. 152 measles outbreaks in US school-age children occurred among persons who had previously received measles vaccine. “Every 2-3 years, there is an upsurge of measles irrespective of vaccination compliance”.</p>

<p>To cap it all: the largely unvaccinated Amish (they claim religious exemption) had not reported a single case of measles between 1970 and December 1987, for 18 years (Sutter et al. 1991). It is quite likely that a similar situation would have applied to outside communities without any vaccination and that measles vaccination had actually kept measles alive and kicking. According to Hedrich (1933), there is a variety of dynamics of measles occurrence, from 2-3 years to up to 18 years, as later also witnessed by the unvaccinated Amish.

    <div class="md"><p>I took the time to read the link you sent.
I&#39;m assuming the counter argument you&#39;re providing is that we are using vaccines more, and the cumulative effect of all those shots is more dangerous today because of the increased exposure to the chemicals (like mercury) in them. </p>

<p>To respond to the infant death increase in the article I would sugest reading <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-vaccine-idUSBRE90F1JE20130116">this article</a>
Correlation, does not mean causation. The article you referenced didn&#39;t really provide information on why the deaths occurred. The rise was due to mothers contracting influenza during the 09 epidemic . I realise that this argument is more about how people interpret information, and a general distrust of the medical field, so even if I quote studies by universities and medical colleges it becomes a &quot;they&#39;re lobbied by big pharma... etc&quot;.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to note that Thimerosal (Mercury) is no longer used in general vaccines for children (except sometimes for the flu shot, however parents can request a mercury free version). The NRDC pressed for it&#39;s removal in the late 1990&#39;s. 
...and just to respond to the claim that the total amount of mercury (150 mcgs) that someone would have been exposed to cumulatively, is still incredibly small, given that it isn&#39;t all at one time... and that eating fish exposes you to much much more. Even if you don&#39;t buy that arguement, the fact that vaccines don&#39;t contain it anymore makes it mute.</p>
