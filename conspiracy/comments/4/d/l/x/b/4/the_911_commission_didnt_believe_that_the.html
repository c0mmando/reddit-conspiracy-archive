<hr/>

<ul>
<li>9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says the Commission was<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070108233707/http://www.cbc.ca/sunday/911hamilton.html"> set up to fail, that people should keep asking questions about 9/11, and that the 9/11 debate should continue
</a></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 Commission chair said the Commission was <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/11972.html"><em>“set up to fail”</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>The Commission’s co-chairs <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html?ref=opinion">said that the CIA</a> (and likely the White House) <em>“obstructed our investigation”</em></p></li>
<li><p>9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that <a href="http://salon.com/ent/feature/2006/06/27/911_conspiracies/index4.html"><em>“There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn’t have access . . . .”</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/02/9-11panel.pentagon/index.html"><em>“We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting”</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/11/21/cleland/index.html?pn=1"><em>“It is a national scandal”</em></a> and <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/11/13/911_panel_to_get_access_to_withheld_data/"><em>“This investigation is now compromised”</em></a> and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/23/1546256"><em>“One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up”.</em></a>  When asked in 2009 if he thought there should be another 9/11 commission, Cleland responded: <a href="http://www.justice-integrity.org/faq/703-9-11-commission-s-forum-shows-how-dc-works"><em>“There should be about fifteen 9/11 commissions”</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) – who led the 9/11 staff’s inquiry – said <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/senior-counsel-to-the-911-commission-at-some-level-of-the-government-at-some-point-in-time-there-was-an-agreement-not-to-tell-the-truth.html"><em>“At some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened“.</em></a> He also said <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html"><em>“I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years…. This is not spin. This is not true.”</em></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some examples of obstruction of justice into the 9/11 investigation include:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>An FBI informant hosted and rented a room to two hijackers in 2000. Specifically, investigators for the Congressional Joint Inquiry <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/05/11/con05439.html">discovered that an FBI informant had hosted and even rented a room to two hijackers in 2000</a> and that, when the Inquiry sought to interview the informant, the FBI refused outright, and then hid him in an unknown location, and that a high-level FBI official stated these blocking maneuvers were undertaken under orders from the White House.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/08/politics/senator-accuses-bush-of-coverup.html"> As the New York Times notes:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused the White House on Tuesday of covering up evidence ….The accusation stems from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to allow investigators for a Congressional inquiry and the independent Sept. 11 commission to interview an informant, Abdussattar Shaikh, who had been the landlord in San Diego of two Sept. 11 hijackers.</p>

<p><strong>Torture and Interrogation</strong> </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2010/03/the-reason-for-this-cover-up-goes-right-to-the-white-house.html">The CIA also videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations,</a> and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html">9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who knew about those videotapes — and did not tell us about them — obstructed our investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/27/politics/main4897315.shtml?tag=topHome">The chief lawyer for Guantanamo litigation – Vijay Padmanabhan – said</a> that torture of 9/11 suspects was widespread.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html?hpid=topnews">Susan J. Crawford – the senior Pentagon official overseeing the military commissions at Guantánamo told</a> Bob Woodward:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We tortured Qahtani. His treatment met the legal definition of torture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, some of the main sources of information <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/11080450/CIA-tortured-al-Qaeda-suspects-close-to-the-point-of-death-by-drowning-them-in-water-filled-baths.html">were tortured right up to the point of death</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, the type of torture used by the U.S. on the Guantanamo suspects is of a special type. <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/04/senator-government-used-communist-torture-techniques-aimed-at-extracting-false-confessions.html">Senator Levin revealed that the the U.S. used Communist torture techniques specifically aimed at <strong>creating false confessions.</strong></a> (and see <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/66622.html?ref=fp1">this,</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/02detain.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;">this,</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/14/iraq.torture/index.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/15/ksm-was-questioned-about_n_203898.html">this</a>).</p>

<p>And <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090212035205/http://deepbackground.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/01/30/624314.aspx">according to NBC News</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured</p></li>
<li><p>At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being “tortured”</p></li>
<li><p>One of the Commission’s main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was <strong>NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, the Co-Chair of the congressional investigation into 9/11 (Bob Graham)  and 9/11 Commissioner and former Senator Bob Kerrey are calling for either a <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/03/911-commissioner-bob-kerrey-it-might-take-a-permanent-911-commission-to-end-the-remaining-mysteries-of-september-11.html">“Permanent 9/11 commission”</a> or a<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/03/911-commissioner-and-co-chair-of-congressional-inquiry-into-911-say-in-sworn-declarations-that-saudi-government-linked-to-911-attacks.html"> New 9/11 investigation to get to the bottom of it.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the torture of detainees in Guantanamo, it is important to note that during this same time period of putting together the 9/11 Commission Report, the Bush Administration was filling the news media with propaganda in order to shape the public perception and support for torture and the War on Terror.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here is the Pulitzer Prize winning article about it  - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse — an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet speaking about detainee treatment at Gitmo :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox and Friends 6/26/2005 </p>

<p>Command Sargent Major Steven Greer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What we have done to &quot;consistently ensure human treatment&quot; is amazing&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CNN 6/27/2005</p>

<p>Major General Donald. W. Shepperd</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gitmo &quot;bears no resemblance&quot; to how it is portrayed in the press. The guards are dedicated and doing &quot;an extremely tough job&quot; with dangerous detainees. </p>

<p>Here is the Wikipedia article for the program -</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>was an information operation of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) that was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke.[1] The goal of the operation is &quot;to spread the administrations&#39;s talking points on Iraq by briefing retired commanders for network and cable television appearances,&quot; where they have been presented as independent analysts;[2] Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Pentagon&#39;s intent is to keep the American people informed about the so-called War on Terrorism by providing prominent military analysts with factual information and frequent, direct access to key military officials.[3][4] The Times article suggests that the analysts had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest and were given special access as a reward for promoting the administration&#39;s point of view. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The C.I.A. leaked classified information to journalists, exaggerating the success of interrogation methods in an effort to gain public support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The report found that the C.I.A. provided classified information to journalists but that the agency did not push to prosecute or investigate many of the leaks. C.I.A. officials asked officers to “compile information on the success” of the program to be shared with the news media in order to shape public opinion. The C.I.A. also mischaracterized events and provided false or incomplete information to the news media in an effort to gain public support.</p>

<p>Everything critics had claimed about torture happening at Black Sites and Guantanamo, were later proven correct by the Senates investigation </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams, is this what you meant? K.</p>

<p>So why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?</p>

<p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html">In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled “Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,” which was intended to aid the “identification of WTC dust components.” Among the components, it reported, were “metal or metal oxides” (which could not be distinguished by the USGS’s methods). “The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,” the report said, “are Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles</a></p></li>

<p><strong>Testimonial Evidence</strong></p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=FT&amp;amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo">OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>
<li>Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed “everything from molten steel beams to human remains</li>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>
