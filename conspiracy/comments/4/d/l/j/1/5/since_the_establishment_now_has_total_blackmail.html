    <div class="md"><p>So a phone number associated with Ted Cruz is listed on the DC Madame&#39;s call list. This was before Cruz was married. All he has to do is say, &quot;I was wrong to call this service and have a pretty girl give me a backrub 15 years ago. I have lusted in my heart, but Jesus forgave me.&quot;</p>

<p>There, scandal solved.</p>

<p>You would have to beleive all the insiders like bush and the others all threw their support and assets and millions and calling and mailing lists to Cruz as a fake .</p>

<p>You would have to beleive mobilizing all the establishment infrastructure in Wisconsin was a fake.</p>

<p>You would have to beleive the voting machine fraud in Texas , Kansas, Oklahoma and Utah and Wisconsin was all done to be a feint just to make it harder for trump to win to make his win seem more real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>Because they intially wrongly believed that all their criticism and false tv coverage (which was designed to make Trump look BAD ) would keep him from winning.</p>

<p>So the amount of tv coverage was beleied to be a negative by the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny to observe how convoluted people can become to try and paint themselves as outside of the mainstream. Sadly, in the US, bigotry and racism will always be mainstream for the republicans. You can convince yourself otherwise but no one else will follow you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been far more bigotry and racism on the democrat side this year than the republicans.</p>

<p>In fact that has been true for many years.</p>

<p>The head of the republican party was a black man for the last decade.</p>

<p>The leading candidates for president in the republican nomination was Dr Ben Carson who is black until it became widely known he had tried to stab someone with a knife and attacked his mother with a hammer when he was young because people worried he might have a mental break in office.</p>

<p>But you keep thinking in the 50&#39;s.

    <div class="md"><p>You and everyone is under survelliance right now.</p>

<p>I am not crazy about it but to act like radical Muslim groups should somehow be specially excluded from that survelliance is ridiculous.</p>

<p>The police have the right to check on complaints of possible dangerous and illegal behaviours and plots everywherethatleads.  When you have Muslim imams openly stating their plans to groups of people it is legitimate to check on those people and stop the plots before they happen.</p>

<p>By the way radical Christians, Jews and mormon groups have also been survellied and shut down.</p>

<p>Perhaps you didn&#39;t notice when warren Jefferies was hauled off to jail for his mormon sex crimes against under age girls in Utah?</p>

<p>Spare me your disingenous protest. You don&#39;t care about it. You just are repeating anything you hear becuase if you had thought for one minute  about it you would realize what you say is ridiculous.</p>
