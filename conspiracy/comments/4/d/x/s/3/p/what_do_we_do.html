        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve gone down the rabbit hole and now it feels like everything I’ve ever been told is a lie.  To be straightforward, it is overwhelmingly depressive.  It’s become hard to relate to others without feeling like a complete nut.  It’s also difficult to determine which conspiracies are even true because now I’m reading about how governments/corporations create fake conspiracy theories to throw people off even more.  I never know what to believe anymore.  </p>

<p>So now we have to do all of our own research, but then when we do research half the sources/statistics are fake too.</p>

<p>I just feel hopeless at the moment and don’t know what the hell to do from here.  </p>

<p>Do we fight back?  Do we just join “them”?  Do we just hope that Jesus saves us?  </p>

<p>How has this knowledge affected what you chose to do for a living?</p>

<p>Do we prepare?  Do we just try to have as many good memories as possible and accept that we can’t really change anything?</p>

<p>Reminds me of a quote in Slaughterhouse Five.  </p>

<p>&quot;God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change,
courage to change the things we can,
and wisdom to know the difference.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing some additional thinking.  I realized that the reason people like us end up down the rabbit hole is because we are looking for truths.  Initially it feels as if all truths are &quot;bad&quot;, but it&#39;s not.  </p>

<p>Truths</p>

<pre><code>⁃ I can’t stop the big machine or help the cause if I am in a state of despair.  Knowing and choosing to do nothing is worse than never knowing in the first place.  

⁃ I should do things that make me happy.  Being miserable doesn’t help anyone.  

⁃ One day I will die and so will everyone else.  &quot;After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box.&quot;

⁃ Cut yourself off from the rat race and consumer mindset.  Learn to support yourself and be self sufficient.

 ⁃    Spread goodness

⁃ Simplify

⁃ There is no turning back.  

⁃ Relationships and memories matter the most

⁃ Stop indulging in short term pleasures.  instant gratification

⁃ Both good and evil exist in this world.  Nothing is ever black or white, it&#39;s usually gray.  

⁃ You can’t really survive in today’s world without money

⁃ Change in the masses seems to only occur when things first get worse.  People and situations don’t change unless they have to.  

⁃ If the world is this way, then maybe it had to be this way?  In other words, maybe these are the necessary steps in the progression of humanity?  We can’t simply go from hunter gatherers to perfect civilizations.  It reminds me of another quote in Slaughterhouse Five.  The protagonist asks the aliens why they let their world end if they already know how it ends.  Why don&#39;t they prevent it?  They simply say that that’s just how things worked out.  No matter what they did, the world would always end that way.  So they focus on the good moments instead of focusing on the bad.  
</code></pre>

<p>As bad as things may seem, we are still living in a golden age.  I think we’re all very aware that it won’t last much longer, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take advantage of it while it is here.  </p>

<pre><code>⁃ We have mostly clean air. We can go outside and go for a walk.  I can play golf.

⁃ we have the internet which is not regulated as of right now but probably won’t be for long.  It’s pretty amazing that I can connect with people and share ideas from a computer.  

⁃ We have tons of hobbies we can pursue.  Things like golf probably won’t be around forever.  

⁃ Music/media may be “controlled” but it’s still pretty good.  In addition, even if you hate mainstream music and media, you still have a decently large selection of independent entertainment to choose from.  

⁃ Airplanes allow us to travel virtually anywhere in the world.

<p>I couldn&#39;t agree more about cutting down on consumption.  It&#39;s a cycle of instant gratification.  You never feel truly satisfied.</p>

<p>It seems like you chose to give up many of the things most normal people do.  Do you mind sharing some other hobbies you&#39;ve picked up?  Also how have your relationships evolved with people you knew prior to making these changes in your life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said and I think it&#39;s very good advice.</p>

<p>I recently visited my mom after not having seen her for a long while.  On my way back home, she insisted I take with me all these old magazines she saved up for me for months.  I think to myself, &#39;the fucks this shit?&#39; but I wanted to be amenable to poor ole mom, so I took them.  I used to like popular science when I was like 12, now I&#39;m 41 and ever since they trashed 911 truthers I&#39;ve known it&#39;s all hypnotic establishment applesauce.  Well half of it is, the other half are metrosexual fashion ads for those dispicable type of faux-lumberjack hipsters that grow out groomed gaybeards, wear eyeliner and style their hair.  I want to set these magazines on fire.  But I&#39;ll end up recycling them.  My point in all this is that I&#39;m the end result of 15 yrs of 9/11 truth and conspiracy.  I refuse it all. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a refusenik.  As a refusenik you can be mad or you can feel empowered.  It usually starts as the former and becomes the latter as you renew your convictions of why you feel this way.</p>

<p>The most important thing about living a conspiracy-theory-oriented-refuseniking lifestyle is getting very straight about your beliefs and then finding others that share a similar opinion.  At this point, try to delete others who don&#39;t believe out of your life--you&#39;ll be happier.  Obviously you can&#39;t do that with family, so best to just avoid those conversations instead of always feeling like you need to battle them. Treat their opinion like they have been bodysnatched and are mentally ill.  Or that you&#39;ve been given special privilege to see the truth by an angel and they haven&#39;t.  Because that&#39;s actually close to the truth.</p>

<p>The thing I like the most about the previous comment is not giving money to the system.  This is your only remaining power really.  They&#39;ve taken your political agency with Bush v Gore; they&#39;re going to wage eternal war on your behalf (<em>thaaanks</em>), so all you have left is spending the pittance that remans after the ever-increasing costs of living are deducted from your paycheck.  </p>

<p>There are ways to reverse that though: </p>

<ul>
<li>Garden</li>
<li>Become vegetarian</li>
<li>Figure out an alternative energy strategy that works for you; or reduce it on the load end (all lights replaced with LEDs).  Off brand chinese LED light bulbs are as good or better than the ones from home depo and are 1/5 of the price.  Search amazon.  Seriously, don&#39;t spend 20 dollars on an LED lightbulb from a big box store--that&#39;s just Phillips or GE ripping you off. When you compare prices on amazon you&#39;ll realize I&#39;m right.</li>
<li>Upcycle trash into something unique and sell it at a farmers market or on etsy</li>
<li>Do favors or contract work for bitcoin, force others to pay you in bitcoin by offering them a 50% discount for bitcoin (raise your rate by 100% for cash)</li>
<li>Compost your organics, even cardboard</li>
<li>Buy everything on amazon and save money; also their UPS fleet is natural gas so it helps the environment more than your gas or diesel vehicle; also keep and compost the cardboard or lay it down as landscape fabric to kill weeds and cover it up with mulch.  Or burn it and use the ash in the garden to improve clay / acid soil.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a burn pile right now that is about 15&#39; in diameter and 8&#39; high.  Some will be chipped for landscaping, and the rest (which is a lot of blackberry and ivy) will be burned using no accelerants if I can help it.  It&#39;ll just become part of nature again.  We also have 3 earth machines, (composters) that are full of food waste, chicken manure etc.  I do vermiculture for worm castings, so that I can make compost tea and have excellent soil amendment.

We&#39;re in the process of learning how to find/pick morels and ramps, later in the fall it will be chanterelles.  I feel mushroom foraging is a lost skill that needs to be re-learned.  I&#39;m going to dry and process a lot of them for later use.  We already use compact fluorescent a lot.  We&#39;ve recently found out about this place, <a href="https://www.azurestandard.com/">https://www.azurestandard.com/</a> and they do bulk delivery.  They come highly recommended by multiple people if they are anywhere near you.  We&#39;re going to get an amazon prime account later, for sure.  Yeah, Popular Mechanics can go get fucked.  I doubt I&#39;ll be buying anything like that again, unless it&#39;s a seed catalog or something.</p>

<p>Not all of us here are from America; but we are involved in the same mess, because our governments are now effectively under American control.  If the psychopaths are going to collaborate internationally, it only makes sense for the rest of us to do so.  So you don&#39;t have 3% nationally; you have 3% <strong><em>globally</em></strong>, and that could well be bigger than the entire American national population itself.</p>

Our numbers have only risen and is only bound to grow more. Cheer up, you can still be happy in difficult circumstances - that is the true test of your resilience and character. The world was meant to be ruled by evil men, that&#39;s why people from long long time ago, were waiting for a messiah. Maybe you need to go on a spiritual journey, there is still so much you can learn. I hope what I said didnt boil down to rainbows and unicorns, if so, i&#39;m sorry, this is all I have.

    <div class="md"><p>The struggle will never end.  You&#39;ll have good days and bad days, but you are now part of the minority.  But you&#39;ve got to wake that dog up inside of you and you may even start catching a glimpse of what it really means to be alive.  Some people never find purpose in their lives, I don&#39;t think people who wake up to this shit fall in that category.  There are positives and negatives as there is with everything.  I would suggest finding people on here that you have verified that they are not full of shit and just follow their posts.  That may be the safest way.  Alex jones, Bernie sanders, these guys are full of shit.  Ron Paul is the only politician I&#39;ve ever seen where I haven&#39;t caught him in a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no more free land.  </p>

<p>If there are states offering land, it&#39;s in a suburban situation wherein you have to build a house on it and occupy there for 10 yrs.  It&#39;s part of an <em>urban</em> / local economy revitalization plan.  </p>

<p>No more BLM land.  Hasn&#39;t been for over 10 yrs.  In fact, when I looked into this (specifically &#39;patented mining claims&#39;, but also any tract of land), the BLM gave away land for pennies on the dollar to oil and gas interests, like 20k acres to an O&amp;G company in colorado, but that blm group (denver) actually got mad at me for inquiring about land and what happened to the programs they used to offer.  I finally got fed up and confronted a BLM person in colorado and she was a total fucking bitchhole of a person and she told me point blank that BLM works for industry and not us citizens.  SO you can chalk up the BLM as yet another corrupt gov agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t comment very frequently but I felt compelled to share my own opinion on this subject.</p>

<p>Like you, I have been an avid skeptic for most of my life, which I think mainly stems from curiosity. It&#39;s natural to want to know the truth about the world we live in, and it has becoming increasingly more difficult to openly voice your opinion about cover-ups or conspiracies in the public sphere. Most of my friends would tell you I am a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; however, I am only asking questions. If you continually ask questions in life you will find way more than you expect. You may go too far down the rabbit hole, and the really is no coming back from that.</p>

<p>However, I believe we are in the age of a great awakening, and more people are beginning to see behind the veil. Now, the question you posed, what do we do? You must find the absolute truths in life. Love, friendship, family, nature, relaxation, and ultimately peace. These things are free in life and yet unattainable to many. I am constantly trying to expose more of my peers to the truth about the world, but for many, they aren&#39;t interested in &quot;waking up&quot;. </p>

<p>Something humbling I always refer back to is Carl Sagen&#39;s Pale Blue Dot.

<p>This is something I have spent countless nights contemplating, I too rarely post but I identify so much with the things being said in here. I believe you must make peace with yourself, adopt a Stoic mentality, and realize that there isn&#39;t necessarily so much to <em>do</em> externally...focus within. Your mind, our world this universe...it is infinite. &#39;Where a man can live, he can live well&#39;-Marcus Aurelius&#39; Meditations will put your mind at ease if you read a few pages whenever you find yourself feeling squirrely about this &#39;reality&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.2.two.html">http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.2.two.html</a></p>

<p>&#39;Whatever this is that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Throw away thy books; no longer distract thyself: it is not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; it is blood and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See the breath also, what kind of a thing it is, air, and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again sucked in. The third then is the ruling part: consider thus: Thou art an old man; no longer let this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer either be dissatisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the future. &#39;</p>

<p>We fight back by continuing to inform others despite ridicule or censorship. We can&#39;t join them, they don&#39;t want us. If Jesus does come, he&#39;ll probably only save those who have been saving themselves.</p>

<p>I realize that nearly every action I do, simply existing, causes harm to millions of peoples lives daily. I have chosen to do jobs that I believe do the least harm. Activism and education are where I have found myself.</p>

<p>The simplest way to prepare is to create community that discusses real issues and attempts to be the change they wish to see in the world. We absolutely can change things, we are. We&#39;re actually approaching a critical mass to a catalyst for action, this is why things are so hectic now.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth I started the sub <a href="/r/buildingalternatives">/r/buildingalternatives</a>. I&#39;m hoping to create an online community as part of reddit, not that I&#39;m super attached to reddit, that helps people to begin to build the alternative. I believe a logical first step is to create your own clean food, clean water, clean energy, and healthy shelter, in any way, in any amount possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind: you have integrity and those who ridicule you <em>don&#39;t</em>.  The biggest problem in america is that people no longer have integrity of any sort.  Except for conspiracy theorists.  When you die, you will think to yourself: I did what I could.  I stood in the face of treasonous villains and I was <em>right to do so</em>.</p>

<p>What will they say to themselves when they die?  I can assure you, that for at least a moment, a feeling of dread will pass over them as they ask themselves, &quot;what if I was wrong about 9/11?&quot;</p>

<p>You see, if <em>you</em> ask yourself as you lay there dying if you were wrong about 9/11, then you&#39;ll think something like, &quot;damn, I may have wasted my time&quot; or &quot;maybe I accused the wrong people but it didn&#39;t matter anyway, they never got put on trial&quot; or &quot;Man I never got to the bottom of that cover up&quot;</p>

<p>However, as they die they&#39;ll think to themselves, &quot;I may have been played a part in particiapting in a world wide conspiracy to murder millions of innocent iraqis and others i don&#39;t know and destroy americans rights and bring about a luciferian world government&quot;.  It may be a blip, but there will be dread.</p>

<p>Then as they pass through the afterlife they will find themselves standing on the celestial scales in front of lady justice and the terrifying horror of the Truth will be exposed to them.  In that instant, they will be burnt by this truth to ash ,leaving nothing behind but the weight of the corruption of their soul, which will be heavier than a feather and down they&#39;ll go for punishment. </p>

<p>You have to be ready.  You have to own what you know and own why you feel and believe what you do.  After doing a sufficient amount of the research, you&#39;ll know the truth.  And with that knowledge act in integrity, which I know you all mostly do because you&#39;re here on this sub. </p>

Those in power that compromise their integrity in the pursuit of greater power are the source of the problem.

<p>They will say they cared more about their immediate survival more than the great issues they believe they have no control over. People are herded towards ignorance in modern society. It&#39;s not their fault for not knowing or not believing or not acting.

    <div class="md"><p>a}  Do get out of the cities.</p>

<p>This should be your first priority.  Do not live in any central business district, and preferably do not live in the sprawl.  The good news is that the majority will not do this until the very last minute, which means that you&#39;ve still got time to get a place in the country.  If you can, try and keep yourself <strong><em>at least</em></strong> two hours&#39; drive away from your nearest major city.</p>

<p>The reason why I advocate this, is because life inside any major city is bad enough as it is right now, and as time goes on, it is only going to get worse.  Cities have never been designed for long term sustainability, and the environment isn&#39;t exactly in great shape at the moment, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed.  That means that you&#39;ve got millions of miserable, mentally ill people with lots of repressed anger issues packed together in what are essentially giant concrete boxes with no plants, animals, or means of independently fending for themselves, and on top of that, you&#39;ve got lots of increasingly scared, paranoid, and militant police.  I&#39;m sure you can probably work out the rest from there.</p>

<p>b}  Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> attempt to become a full blown Survivalist.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve taken the proverbial red pill, woken up, and discovered that Twitter and Kim Kardashian now make you want to projectile vomit, when in the past, Kim probably would have induced bodily discharge of a somewhat different kind.  Congratulations.</p>

<p>However, here&#39;s the problem.  You are still a Millennial with a mobile phone.  You are corporate raised, and most likely corporate owned.  You are probably chronically physically unfit, still have a head full of Marxist brainwashing which causes you to view yourself as a perpetual helpless victim, (or worse, that you literally can not physically survive unless you are a cyborg plugged into a collectivist, transhumanist hive) and if you are like most, you have no real survival skills whatsoever.  We don&#39;t know how to obtain food other than by going to a supermarket for it.  Your idea of using a compass, probably involves buying a smartphone app first.</p>

<p>Using the above analogy, allow me to play the role of Captain Janeway, here.  The first step of your next journey is going to involve taking a long, hard, realistic look at just how truly divorced from our species and completely domesticated, you and the rest of us now are.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to sound like I have a superiority complex here, either; because I don&#39;t mean to.  You and I are in this together, as is everyone else in this sub; and I&#39;m not talking about the bullshit &quot;we&#39;ll only let you live if you think like us,&quot; attitude that the Marxist SJW demographic has, either.  You are just getting out now.  I have never really been in, however.  To use the Matrix analogy, you could compare me with Tank, in the sense that he was born unplugged.  So was I.  The system has never wanted me; I&#39;ve always been an outcast.  It happens.</p>

<p>Learn some of the minor elements of Survivalism.  The easy parts.  Firebuilding, knot tying, maybe how to put up a tent, etc.  Buy a few kilos of beans and rice and spices, and stick them under the bed.  If you really want to accessorise, get an LPG generator and keep a few cans of butane around for when there&#39;s a power failure.  That won&#39;t hurt.  Bonus points for joining your local archery club.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do the stupid stuff, though.  Don&#39;t try and impersonate Mick Dundee or Bear Grylls.  Don&#39;t watch any Survivalist &quot;reality&quot; TV shows and allow yourself to think that they have anything to do with actual reality.  You will only get yourself killed.  I think that is the point of the Survivalist reality shows.  It&#39;s to give people a radically false impression of just how hard it really is, (they make it look easy) so that when real people try it, it is nothing like what they expected from watching TV, and then they just get themselves killed.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t buy gold, either.  I think gold investment is extremely stupid, personally.  The people who claim that gold has intrinsic worth, do not know what the word <strong><em>intrinsic</em></strong> means.  Gold is a good electrical conductor, and it also doesn&#39;t tarnish or rust.  Those are literally about the only good points it has.  Aside from that, it is very soft, very heavy, (which means that it sucks as a transportation medium for wealth, which is supposed to be the entire point) and it is superficially pretty.  You can&#39;t eat it though, and it is an awful metal to try and make tools with.  The only real reasons why it is worth anything are its&#39; appearance and the tradition of our particular culture, and that is basically it.  </p>

<p>Gold is a purely emotional investment, not a rational one.  When the proverbial shit hits the fan, the main things you&#39;re going to want are to make sure that you have food and shelter, and to also make sure that nobody else takes everything you have in the potential chaos.  Gold will not help you achieve either of those objectives.  If any of the commonly projected survival scenarios occur, formal economic activity will almost entirely cease.  People are only going to care about weapons and food; and gold is neither.  If you want to spend money, do it now, not then.</p>

<p>Keep and use cash, but don&#39;t be flashy or draw attention to yourself about it.  The American government wants a cashless society so that they can try and create economic chokepoints and effectively tax everything, and so the DHS are deeply paranoid about anyone who considers cash important.  It is good to value cash, but being evangelical about it could potentially get you killed or worse.</p>

<p>If you want to get a gun, don&#39;t get an assault rifle or anything else that is going to make the authorities nervous.  Get something that you can justify as a hunting weapon, like a pump action shotgun or an old-fashioned single shot longarm; I don&#39;t think the cops care about those quite so much.  While I believe in the right to bear arms, I don&#39;t believe in the right to be an idiot in such a way that it gets other people killed; which means that you should only buy a firearm if you are prepared to learn how to use it responsibly.  You also should <strong><em>not</em></strong> buy a weapon with the specific intention of using it against the authorities, because that will certainly get you killed.</p>

<p>c}  Do not try to draw major attention to yourself in any way.</p>

<p>The American government in particular is exceptionally paranoid, these days.  I think it knows its&#39; days are numbered, but I&#39;m not referring to domestic unrest, either.  Civil war is the least of the government&#39;s concerns, because with the weapons it has now, it could mow down the civilian public as quickly as they stepped out of their homes, if it wanted to.  Don&#39;t try it.  Don&#39;t even think about it.  The government is in full blown &quot;wounded animal in tarpit,&quot; mode at the moment, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing news reports of trigger happy cops blowing civvies away on a daily basis in here.  It might not have full control overseas, but it is still entirely capable of redefining the phrase &quot;pain and suffering,&quot; for its&#39; domestic public if it puts its&#39; mind to it, and at this point it probably wouldn&#39;t need too much of an excuse to really take the gloves off, either.</p>

<p>The government&#39;s real problems are economic and international.  It can try and assert its&#39; precious &quot;full spectrum dominance,&quot; as much as it wants, but when the dollar is no longer the reserve currency, then the people in the Middle East will finally be able to revolt completely, and China is making plans and becoming ambitious now, as well.  Putin has had close to as much of Barry&#39;s shit as I think he is prepared to take, too; and I don&#39;t blame him.  There is blood in the water, the sharks are circling, and it is only a matter of time.  One way or another, the smart money says that Pax Americana has less than three decades left at this point, and that&#39;s being generous.</p>

<p>So keep your own head down.  Uncle Sam has been given an abundance of rope at this point, and in due time he will inevitably use it to hang himself.  The only thing any of the rest of us have to do is wait.  Foreign antagonism and the existing structural flaws will do the rest.  This plum is becoming very heavy on its&#39; branch, and eventually it will hit the ground.  I don&#39;t know what will come next; we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>

<p>Good luck with that idea.  I think you are right, but the psychopaths have done an exceptional job of making themselves a model for emulation, in case you haven&#39;t noticed.</p>
