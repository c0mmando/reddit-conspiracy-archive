    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people don&#39;t understand that Monsanto did not invent the methods of making GMOs. They didn&#39;t invent the bacteria/viruses used to transplant genes. Those existed on Earth before humans did. Do people think they just lied dormant? No, they did their thing, spewing DNA around everywhere as they get moved by wind or pollinators. </p>

<p>For this reason, literally everything is GMO (as in transgenic). While you could certainly claim a specific plant is bad, it&#39;d be very disingenuous to say any &quot;recently made&quot; GMO is certainly poison. Realize this and suddenly the concept of GMOs is a lot less scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The Difference Between Traditional Plant Breeding and GMO&#39;s</strong></p>

<p>For centuries, people have tried to improve the varieties of fruits and vegetables offered to farmers and consumers by making them better tasting, higher yielding, different looking, longer storing, or resistant to diseases, nematodes, and insects. We hear a lot about traditional plant breeding versus Genetic Engineering (GE)/Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). Let me explain.</p>

<p>Traditional plant breeding: One of my jobs in the late 1960s was to take a small piece of 200 grit sandpaper folded into a small pointed trough and collect the pollen (male flower part) from certain alfalfa plants. I then transferred this pollen to the pistil (female flower part) of another alfalfa plant. The resulting seed produced was then evaluated to see if it had nematode resistance, first in the greenhouse, then in field plots. The traditional breeding process can take 10 years or more to cross plants and select a good variety. In other plants, crosses are made using paintbrushes and tweezers to physically transfer pollen from one parent to another parent to try to combine desirable characteristics of each parent into the progeny (babies). Luther Burbank (1849-1926), the famous plant breeder/botanist, developed over 800 different varieties of fruits and vegetables using classical plant breeding methods.</p>

<p><strong>Genetic Engineering (GE) and GMO: In the 1980’s, scientists in a laboratory were able to introduce a reverse-orientation copy of an “antisense” gene in a tomato (sort of taking out a gene in the chromosome and putting it back in backwards).</strong> This slowed the ripening of the tomato which increased the shelf life dramatically. In 1994, the FLAVR SAVR tomato was released to the public. Calgene, the company marketing this tomato and tomato paste products, met with resistance from consumers and retailers in the United States and the United Kingdom and soon after the tomato was deemed ‘not profitable’ and the project stopped.</p>

<p>Today, several products have been commercialized using GE techniques including insect-resistant varieties of cotton and corn, herbicide-tolerant soybean, corn, canola, and alfalfa, and virus-resistant papaya and squash. <strong>Over 93 percent of the soybeans grown in the United States have been engineered to be herbicide tolerant (the herbicide being Glyphosate, also known as Roundup). Introducing new genes into plants can involve using the same kind of plant, a different plant, or a different organism, such as a microorganism. In classical breeding, thousands of genes are being rearranged, whereas GE involves the specific handling of single genes (using “chemical scissors”).</strong> The genes used in GE can come from any organism, and the genes in classical breeding must be very closely related. The current controversy is whether GMO foods should be labeled so that the consumer knows what they are buying (Proposition 37 in California).</p>

<p>What about Bt in sweet corn? Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) is a protein produced by common soil bacteria that has some insecticidal properties. It has been used as a pesticide spray for decades, including in organic farming. In the past 15 years or so, the gene for Bt has been engineered into corn and cotton seeds such that the plants produce the protein themselves.</p>

<p>What about virus resistant squash and papaya? In the case of virus resistant plants like squash and papaya, they were actually modified by using a part of the virus genetic information itself engineered in such a way as to shut off the replication of the virus. Squash and papaya are the only small acreage crops that are GE and are available on the commercial market.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 93 percent of the soybean acreage (2010), 10 percent of the squash acreage (2004), and 53 percent of the papaya acreage (2006) is genetically engineered.</p>

<p>For more information on this subject I refer readers to several good websites: <a href="http://ucbiotech.org">http://ucbiotech.org</a> and <a href="http://www.cera-gmc.org/?action=gm_crop_database">http://www.cera-gmc.org/?action=gm_crop_database</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure what you are agreeing or disagreeing with (or just completely ignoring) my post.</p>

<p>I am saying that literally 100% of every organism is genetically engineered in the sense that a modifying organism (that Monsanto would use to GMO something) has existed for thousands and thousands of years, creating numerous genetically modified organisms (transgenic) every day. </p>

<p>It is in this sense it becomes very silly to say &quot;GMO is bad!&quot;, though this argument does not necessarily respond to &quot;Modern manmade GMOs have some bad features&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Anyone who&#39;s familiar with genetic engineering wouldn&#39;t be surprised that the [bacteria] Agrobacterium inserted some DNA into some crops.&quot;</p>

<p>Agrobacterium is ubiquitous in soils all around the world — and infects more than 140 plants species. So it doesn&#39;t take much imagination to see how the bacteria&#39;s DNA could eventually find its way into our food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know why I like sweet potatoes?</p>

<p>Nature made them, not Monsanto.</p>

<p>And it took thousands of years for that potato to be selectively bred by humans to get the way it is. The agrobacterium infected the sweet potato&#39;s DNA in an unknown way with its own genes. Name another food crop where this has happened naturally.</p>

<p>On the contrary, biotech takes a gene from one species (non-plant based usually), injects it into agrobacterium, then they have the agrobacterium infect a plant with the gene to get it into the plant&#39;s DNA. They use antibiotic markers to detect the result. But get this, they have to infect a shitty strain plant which takes easy to the agrobacterium, and then they cross breed that shitty strain with an elite hybrid strain to produce the final GE crop.</p>

<p>Most of the high yields and desirable traits come from the hybrid strain, not the GE strain or trait. The &quot;increased yield&quot; people claim GMOs are capable of usually comes in the form of <em>reduced yield loss</em>, which basically means it prevents bugs and diseases from destroying some of the crop, so you get a harvest that is near its fullest potential. If a GE and hybrid grew side by side without any pest problems, I think the yields would be about the same! So it&#39;s important to understand high yields and yield potential <em>genetics</em> come from the elite hybrid.</p>

<p>For you to claim all of our food is GMO is just false. Not even <a href="/r/GMOMyths">/r/GMOMyths</a> would say that because their own hero Kevin Folta would laugh them out of the room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques (i.e., a genetically engineered organism). GMOs are the source of medicines and genetically modified foods and are widely used in scientific research and to produce other goods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The guy above you said it best with a single sentence:</p>

<p><em>The genes used in GE can come from any organism, and the genes in classical breeding must be very closely related.</em></p>

<p>There are (a lot) of these argobacterium things around, do you think they only were around sweet potatoes? There are other things that similarly transgenically modify e.g. certain viruses and what not.</p>

<p>Another example for a specific plant: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101104083102.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101104083102.htm</a></p>

<p>Anyway, the fact that you recognize that all sweet potatoes are transgenic absolutely destroys any &quot;All GMOS are bad&quot; argument. You&#39;d have to take on each one specifically, wouldn&#39;t you agree?  Unless perhaps you&#39;re going with a naturalism philosophy, which doesn&#39;t really hold up considering how many &#39;natural&#39; things are harmful (e.g. naturalism fallacy). </p>

<p>To summarize yet again:</p>

<p>Argobacterium and similar organisms has existed in nature before we knew what DNA was</p>

I bet that trait in Corn would be useful.&quot;)</p>

<p>Despite claims that transgenics only are created by humans, evidence (e.g. my two links) such as ancient genetic modifications done to sweet potatoes by bacteria show that this happens in the field without human intervention</p>

<p><strong>None of these points have anything to do with cross-breeding.</strong></p>
