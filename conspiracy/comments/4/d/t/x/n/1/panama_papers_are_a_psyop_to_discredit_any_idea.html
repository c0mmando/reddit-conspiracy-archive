        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Exalting commercial corruption and tax evasion as a modern mythology fulfills a strategy of flooding the public&#39;s collective psychology with anger towards &#39;a system&#39; versus &quot;a few people at the top&quot;.  It has the effect of dispersing people&#39;s collective ire.  Of course, they will respond to this: &quot;you&#39;re trying to hard to cling to this idea that there&#39;s a few people doing all these things&quot;.</p>

<p>When in fact, it&#39;s both.  It&#39;s a small group of highly influential people strategizing in secret (bilderberg group and CFR and FPRI, UN, etc) making policy and then implementing those policies that then enable all the wrongdoing by big businesses.  </p>

<p>Basically, they create a socialism for corporations as a form of cryptofascism--fascism because they seek monopoly through unfair use of force to crush opposition.  What do I mean by that?  Bailouts.  Huge loans to bail out malfunctioning corporations--Savings and Loan crisis. Tax breaks.  Legal loopholes that allow them to shirk taxes.  No bid contracts.  Preferred contracts.  Lobbying.  AND.  Keeping minimum wage low.  Media mind control to make the middle hate the poor, coining the meme &#39;entitlements&#39;--making it a bad word, instead of &#39;something you have a right to access&#39;.  </p>

<p>There are many ways that corporations &#39;cheat&#39; at competition.  While at the same time, demonizing the struggling public for the audacity of getting assistance from the government, which accounts to a miniscule fraction of the assistance corporations receive--and a miniscule fraction of a miniscule fraction of the revenue they bring in from perpetual war or mafia protection of their precious one drug to rule them all (afghanistan pills).  It&#39;s basically a huge hypocrisy.  They lionize capitalism and never once actually participate in capitalism.  They are the biggest socialists around.</p>

<p>They are trying to bring in fascism thorugh all their tricks.  </p>

<p>The Panama Papers are their latest trick.  They are appropriating the &quot;Empire of the City&quot; conspiracy theory (City of London, DC, and Vatican) by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/panama-papers-reveal-london-centre-spiders-173713142.html">holding up City of London as &#39;the center of the spider&#39;s web&#39;</a>, but that&#39;s a trojan horse because their cognitive subtext is that it&#39;s thousands of companies doing wrong, not the small few cryptofascist policymakers like Kissinger, Yellen, Bernake, Clinton, PMs, US politicians, the Pope, the Queen etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup money is a lie. And from it more lies...ads that promise miracles, medicine that promise health, food the pretends to be real, tv and movies that distort our reality, politicians that promise hope, colleges that promise a future.

    <div class="md"><p>As far as &quot;London being the center of a spider web&quot; goes, are you saying that they could blame the UK government for this? Why would they do that? If this is indeed a psyop, which it certainly is, then wouldn&#39;t they protect the nation&#39;s most valuable ally? Our parent nation in fact? I mean, personally I think even Putin and Salman and all these African dictators are in on the scam too, their actors too; they just are playing &quot;bad cop.&quot; </p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s all misdirection.  I mean what do they think americans will do?  Want to have nuclear war against the UK now?  That&#39;s silly.  They are letting UK take the fall now, but next time we&#39;ll take the fall for their psyop.</p>
