    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not christian because i don&#39;t see why a god would create an imperfect species and send them to hell for his/her mistake. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to address the part about reptiles, but this is a major misunderstanding of Christian theology and the account of creation.</p>

<p>According to scripture, God did not create an imperfect species. Quite the contrary. </p>

<p>What he did was to create a perfect man and woman in his image, then give them the freedom of will and choice. Without these there can be no love, which is what ties the entire thing together in Christianity. </p>

<p>With choice comes the possibility of sin. That choice was made, and so perfection was ruined. </p>

<p>According to Christian theology, God doesn&#39;t send people to hell for being flawed. People are separated from God by original sin and by their own, but there&#39;s an option to mend that rift. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s where choice comes into play again: people are sent to hell because they choose to reject that option. They willingly go rather than being sent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the stories in the bible have been here before the bible was written and some were taken from the &quot;egyptian book of the dead&quot;. What are your thoughts &quot;christians&quot; and non-christians? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s worth remembering that the Hebrews were made up of nomadic tribes that wouldn&#39;t have had much in the way of monuments, temples, and other ways to preserve their writings. They relied mostly on oral traditions and scattered writings. Even once they were organized and led by Moses they had a tabernacle rather than a temple. That doesn&#39;t do much in the way of preservation. </p>

<p>So it is logical that these cultures who built in stone would result in us finding the earliest known dated writings while even cultures that predated them would leave us nothing, and it&#39;s logical to assume we have no idea who originated these tales. But if we are to believe the Torah and Bible, it was them. After all, they go all the way back to day one. </p>

<p>Anyway, you asked for thoughts so there&#39;s mine. I&#39;m not a religious person but I do find Christian theology in particular to be the best organized and most interesting. It&#39;s very well done as far as continuity goes once you start looking at it from the languages of origin and in cultural context. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But to combat that he really didn&#39;t give us freewill...&quot;satan&quot; kinda did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, according to scripture the creator gave free will, the ability to choose. He&#39;s the one who created them with the ability to choose and the one who placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (which I personally think highly likely to be allegorical, but we&#39;re discussing what&#39;s written, not my opinion). </p>

<p>Satan was merely the one tempting them after his own choice to fall from grace. He didn&#39;t give them any kind of choice, he merely argued for one of the options available.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He persuaded eve to eat the fruit and god didn&#39;t try to do anything to stop satan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because in doing so he would remove the free will of humanity. It wouldn&#39;t be them making the choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...unless he knew satan would do that and wanted him to...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re kinda in the &quot;pot criticizing the potter&quot; realm now, which gets really grey really fast. If there&#39;s really an omni-everything deity then it&#39;s impossible for us to understand his motives. </p>

<p>Basically the common theological explanation is that everything happens to show the glory of God. Without Satan corrupting mankind there could be no example of the ultimate love through Christ, which is where we end up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>meaning he would be omnipotent, but contrary to that after they ate the fruit he ask adam and eve where they are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He knew where they were, this is simply an example of the first opportunity for Man to confess and seek redemption. It&#39;s much like when we ask a child who broke the window while we know already they threw a ball through it. It&#39;s a chance for contrition. </p>

<p>But of course there was none. Adam and Eve chose to play the blame game, building on their sin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If he was omnipotent he would&#39;ve already know that and then in genesis he says REPLENISH the earth to adam...replenish means to refill meaning before adam there where already people or things there, but that contradicts adam being the first man on earth. (Sorry for my grammar and spelling english isn&#39;t my first language.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s from the KJV bible. It&#39;s not at all an accurate translation for today&#39;s English, which is why translations shouldn&#39;t go off already translated versions. It should come straight from the original language. </p>

<p>The original language actually means to <em>fill</em> the earth. </p>

<p>That being said, there is certainly evidence both scriptural and scientific that Adam and Eve weren&#39;t alone. There very well may have been other human like beings that were suddenly at an evolutionary disadvantage since they didn&#39;t gain the knowledge Adam and Eve did. This could be the reason why they are also told to &quot;subdue&quot;the earth, and where Cain and Abel got their wives. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all incredibly interesting in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say I&#39;m not religious, but I have my faith. I feel like religion is something you do, but faith is who you are. Religion is for others, faith is for yourself.</p>

<p>I bow to God because I love what he is and what he&#39;s done in my life, not because I fear damnation. There is too much in my life to attribute to luck and circumstance in my opinion, and he just fits where nothing else does.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still fear that as well. </p>

<p>But I fear nothing even more. If there is nothing then nothing matters and we&#39;re wasting our miniscule amount of time on what? Little pieces of paper and metal? Laws that force us to act as something other than what we truly are? It&#39;s pointless without God. </p>

<p>With him there is purpose: love and service to others gives purpose, and following his commands gives a reason to pursue that purpose. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim Christianity because it&#39;s moved so far from its own teachings as to be unrecognizable. But I claim and follow the teachings of Christ to the best of my ability (though I fail daily). I practice love and service and try to represent the best I can the person that Jesus was to please the God that Jesus is. The church does something else. They serve themselves only. </p>

<p>So, I suggest that Rule 12 applies.</p>
