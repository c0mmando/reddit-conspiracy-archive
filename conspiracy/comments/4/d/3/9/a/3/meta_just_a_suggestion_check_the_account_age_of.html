<p>They go on to propose that, &quot;the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups&quot;, where <strong>they suggest, among other tactics, &quot;Government agents (<em>and their allies</em>) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.&quot;</strong> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as &quot;extremist groups.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, politics and propaganda. FUD is generally <strong>a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Divide and rule (or divide and conquer, from Latin dīvide et īmpera) in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, <strong>causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tilting at windmills is an English idiom which means <strong>attacking imaginary enemies.</strong> The word &quot;tilt&quot;, in this context, comes from jousting.</p>

<p>The phrase is sometimes used to describe <strong>confrontations where adversaries are incorrectly perceived, or courses of action that are based on misinterpreted or misapplied heroic, romantic, or idealistic justifications. It may also connote an importune, unfounded, and vain effort against confabulated adversaries for a vain goal.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cass Sunstein, the Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration, wrote in 2008 that the government should hire 3rd parties to discredit conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084585">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084585</a></p>

<p>Page 22:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How  might  this  tactic  work?  Recall  that  extremist  networks  and  groups,  including  the  groups  that  purvey  conspiracy theories,  typically  suffer  from  a  kind  of  crippled  epistemology. Hearing  only  conspiratorial  accounts  of  government  behavior,  their   members   become   ever   more   prone   to   believe   and   generate   such   accounts.  Informational and reputational cascades, group polarization, and selection effects suggest that the generation of ever-more-extreme views within these groups can be dampened or reversed  by  the  introduction  of  cognitive  diversity.    We  suggest  a  role  for  government efforts,  and  agents,  in  introducing  such  diversity.   <strong>Government  agents  (and  their  allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.</strong> In  one  variant,  government  agents  would  openly  proclaim,  or  at  least  make  no effort  to  conceal,  their  institutional  affiliations.    A  recent  newspaper  story  recounts  that  Arabic-speaking   Muslim   officials   from   the  State   Department   have   participated   in  dialogues at radical Islamist chat rooms and websites in order to ventilate arguments not usually heard among the groups that cluster around those sites, with some success.</p>

<p><strong>In another  variant,  government  officials  would  participate  anonymously  or  even  with  false identities.</strong>   Each  approach  has  distinct  costs  and  benefits;  the second  is  riskier  but potentially  brings  higher  returns. In  the  former  case, where  government  officials participate openly as such, hard-core members of the relevant networks, communities and conspiracy-minded organizations may entirely discount what the officials say, right from the beginning.  The risk with tactics of anonymous participation, conversely, is that if the tactic becomes known, any true member of the relevant groups who raises doubts may be 
suspected  of  government  connections.    Despite  these difficulties,  the  two  forms  of cognitive  infiltration  offer  different  risk-reward  mixes  and are  both  potentially  useful instruments. </p>

<p><strong>There  is  a  similar  tradeoff  along  another  dimension: whether  the  infiltration should  occur  in  the  real  world,  through  physical  penetration  of  conspiracist  groups  by undercover agents, or instead should occur strictly in cyberspace.</strong> The latter is safer, but potentially  less  productive.  The  former  will  sometimes  be  indispensable,  where  the  groups  that  purvey  conspiracy theories  (and  perhaps  themselves  formulate  conspiracies) formulate  their  views  through  real-space  informational  networks  rather  than  virtual networks.  Infiltration of any kind poses well-known risks: <strong>perhaps agents will be asked to  perform  criminal  acts  to  prove  their  bona fides,  or  (less  plausibly)  will  themselves become  persuaded  by  the  conspiratorial  views  they  are  supposed  to  be  undermining</strong>; perhaps agents will be unmasked and harmed by the infiltrated group.</p>
