       That's a cool website but he doesn't go in depth in a lot of pictures. There's a memorial of 9/11 as a cube and he doesn't state it means total control like Mark Passio has explained. Just that it looks like apple's store. Any other websites you know of like this that go more in depth to their meanings?

      <p>
       Insomuch, I stopped watching TV all together. 
At this point, I don't care about that shit because my own life is far more important than any TV show. Except game of thrones. I've been getting into that and I like it pretty well.

      <p>
       Anyway, they leave signs of their plans in media. Here recently a big trend is civil war, resistance, dystopian futures like in 1984.
      </p>
      <p>
       What  amazes me is that when you get a nation of people who have no idea how their consciousness works; what they can do with it, and what it even means to have consciousness itself, they can be deceived into creating a false reality through their thought forms, and energy put into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's why there's such a hype for a negative and bleak future, is because TPTB want that for us, they want us to want it. 
We have a choice. Break away from this bullshit. 
These people are fucking cowards. If you confronted any of them in the streets when they didn't have guards around them they'd cower like a child.

       They're sweating bullets now. It's hilarious.

       If you want to go in deeper, look up Archetypes. The conscious vs the unconscious, hero vs villain, the king vs the pauper, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder what that makes us here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a good list of 52 Archetypes, and if you read this list you start noticing how all this plays out in the collective consciousness, but also in your own life and with those who you have around you.....sometimes you wear these masks as well:

       Yeah, I am asking you why you though to include the jab at one of the Wachowski's changing their gender. Is there an issue or conspiracy there?

       No.  I was merely trying to be silly regarding the fact that they used to be called the wachowski brothers but we can't say that anymore.  You are being too sensitive when you read mocking when no negativity was ever intended.  Please show me what i said that was mean or mocking.   People are too freaking pc these days.

       Yes, yes, yes.  I see a stuffed animal being torn apart in front of a child, I think of MK-Ultra programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watched the old Metropolis Movie where the scientist shines a very bright light at Maria's face, a method of torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most music videos.  Especially if you watch them with the music off (it's sort of terrifying honestly).
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch Summertime Sadness by Lana Del Ray.  Starts off in a white dress (innocence). Sings about dancing in the pale moonlight, wanting to say goodbye to someone (her old self). Then you see someone representing her in a red dress (the colour of sacrifice).
I've only watched the music video once, and it is only a personal interpretation based of the knowledge I'm gained.

       this is Alijandro(sp?) By Lady Gaga.  Although the whole video has symbolism, if you skip in to where there's a screen in the back ground you will notice a riot and people in uniforms.  Talk about subliminal programming.

       record cover.  The pillars, the black and white checker board, space...  Crazy.  I was it in real life and I showed my boyfriend.  His reply?  "Sick cover!". My thoughts 'Well, that's real life.'

       .  The title doesn't make sense, but I wrote it and put all the information together when I was just starting to see the plans and agenda's and secret messages put into the medium's well so heavily rely on today.  It's crazy because that's only the visual side of the effect it's having.  After that you have to start realizing the effect different frequencies can have not your brain function as well.

       There was a YouTube video a while back talking about how the golden gate bridge is supposedly going to be a false flag target, pointing out how it's being put in plain sight in music videos, film posters etc in the same way that the twin towers were prior to 9/11. I didn't really pay that much attention to it if I'm honest as I was just watching the video to pass the time, but I have been noticing it more. I'm also noticing a lot of the "one eye illuminati" salute in music videos and live performances, that one eye covered up thing, or the finger triangle over one eye.

       You think that 9/11 was 25 years in the making? Sure, maybe some things leading up to in were in action then (we could even say it goes back to the coup of `63). However, planning on taking out WTC in 1976?

       It's one of those odd things that always stuck with me. Why in the 76 version of King Kong did he climb the WTC &amp; not the Empire State Building?

       The WTC didn't exist when the original film was made. By 1976 the WTC replaced the Empire State Building as the most impressive building in NYC.

       This is just one example and there have been quite a few more nuanced scenes.  The following transcript will give you an idea.  Chloé Sevigny plays Alex,  a doctor who lost her son to an abduction.  She is making a house call to see a woman who chose not to vaccinate against the measles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex: You're very brave, Max. We're almost done here. Mrs. Ellison: Do you think that this could be strep? I looked on WebMD and they said... Stay off the Internet. It'll only make your head spin. Can you breathe in for me, Max? (inhales, coughs) He sounds terrible, doesn't he? (Max coughing) Hang in there. We're gonna get you all better. Don't worry. I'm just gonna talk to your mom for a minute, okay? Your son has the measles. Oh, the measles? Thank God. I thought it was something serious. The measles are serious, Mrs. Ellison. And completely unnecessary. If you had followed my advice and had Max vaccinated, then we wouldn't be... We did what we thought was right. Okay, all that stuff out there how vaccines can lead to autism, how can they actually kill people... Measles kill people. Children. Millions in the developing world, until pretty recently. But you don't live in the developing world, Mrs. Ellison. You live on the West Side of Los Angeles. And believe me, there are plenty of real threats right outside these doors for you to be worried about. Look, our children are at risk from so much in this world. We can never protect them from all of it. But when there's something we can do to make them just a little bit safer, we do it. So what's the treatment? There isn't one. Tylenol to keep his fever down, lots of liquids. And rest. Something you won't be getting in the next couple weeks, I'm afraid. Call me if his fever spikes again. Okay. (radio starts playing "Body and Soul") (radio shuts off)

       Yeah,  it was blatant as hell.  They touched on vaccines again briefly in the next episode and it was a little better hidden than what I posted above.   I couldn't believe how obvious and/or how poorly written it was.

       I finally saw Deadpool for the first time this weekend.

      <p>
       Right after it, I watched Ant Man at home on cable.

      <p>
       Nothing popped conspiracy related in either, but the writers contradicting themselves on physics "broke" Ant Man for me.

       That's a cool website but he doesn't go in depth in a lot of pictures. There's a memorial of 9/11 as a cube and he doesn't state it means total control like Mark Passio has explained. Just that it looks like apple's store. Any other websites you know of like this that go more in depth to their meanings?
