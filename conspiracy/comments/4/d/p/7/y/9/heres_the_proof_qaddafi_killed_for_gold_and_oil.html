    <div class="md"><p>It means that if your central bank is not indebted to and therefore  under the control of the Bank for International Settlements. the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  they feel they cannot keep you under their strict control. The goal is to have money creation be a world wide monopoly of the central bank system. Under the umbrella of the IMF, the World Bank and the BIS. They create almost all of the money in the world and yet that isn&#39;t nearly enough. They will lie, cheat, steal and  kill as many as necessary to get total power over the total world. </p>

<p>There are no limits as to how far they will go to get that power.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us all, only sociopaths and psychopaths ever seek that kind of power over others.</p>

<p>Look up the origins of the BIS for much more of interest.</p>

It is an ideal. There will always be obstacles, but so long as the majority of nations fall under this umbrella, they can sit back and rake it in while selectively pulling strings as they please.

<p><a href="http://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm">http://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm</a></p>

<p>My unverifiable  opinion about that is that the troubles between our nations are mainly like the dichotomy between the left leaning  and right wing politics in America  which  are mainly  used to promote various political goals for the banks  that are unattainable without the interplay between them. </p>

<p>Left, Right, Left Right, they march us towards a one world totalitarian government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do they like murdering people or do they see it just as part of doing business.  An unpleasant part, but something that just has to be done?</p>

<p>If I was a leader of a country and the USA had it&#39;s sights on my country, Id probably just do what they wanted rather than risk the lives of millions of my people.  Im not sure if that makes me a coward or just a realist.  I think I would try to negotiate for as good of a deal as possible.</p>

<p>Id say: &quot;look, youre going to spend about a trillion dollars invading and destroying my country. How about I let you have the oil at a reduced price and you employ my people in the industry.  That way, we all win.&quot;</p>

<p>I think they just like murdering people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is important, because it shows so much about Clinton, why these wars are waged and who is at the helm.</p>

<p>Blumenthal was a Clinton whitehouse guy who was pretty well known to be a shifty dude and thus &quot;had been barred from a State Department job by aides to President Obama&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the Libya intelligence that Mr. Blumenthal passed on to Mrs. Clinton appears to have come from a group of business associates he was advising as they sought to win contracts from the Libyan transitional government. The venture, which was ultimately unsuccessful, involved other Clinton friends, a private military contractor and one former C.I.A. spy seeking to get in on the ground floor of the new Libyan economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The projects — creating floating hospitals to treat Libya’s war wounded and temporary housing for displaced people, and building schools — would have required State Department permits...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guy is looking to be a war profiteer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton at least 25 memos about Libya in 2011 and 2012, many describing elaborate intrigues among various foreign governments and rebel factions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clinton circulated them, frequently forwarding them to Jake Sullivan, her well-regarded deputy chief of staff, and requesting that he distribute them to other State Department officials. Mr. Sullivan often sent the memos to senior officials in Libya, including the ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi.</p>

<p>In many cases, Mr. Sullivan would paste the text from the memos into an email and tell the other State Department officials that they had come from an anonymous “contact” of Mrs. Clinton.</p>

<p>In an August 2012 memo, Mr. Blumenthal described the new president of Libya, Mohamed Magariaf, as someone who would “seek a discrete relationship with Israel” and had “many common friends and associates with the leaders of Israel.”</p>

<p>“If true, this is encouraging,” Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. Sullivan. “Should consider passing to Israelis.”</p>

<p>The emails suggest that Mr. Blumenthal’s direct line to Mrs. Clinton circumvented the elaborate procedures established by the federal government to ensure that high-level officials are provided with vetted assessments of available intelligence.</p>

<p>From Blumenthal&#39;s email transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 2, 2011 <strong>sources with access to advisors to Saif al-Islam Qaddafi</strong> stated in strictest confidence that while the freezing of Libya&#39;s foreign bank accounts presents Muammar Qaddafi with serious challenges, his ability to equip and maintain his armed forces and intelligence services remains intact. According to sensitive information available to this these individuals,  </p>

<p>Qaddafi&#39;s government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver. During late March, 2011 these stocks were moved to SABHA (south west in the direction of the Libyan border with Niger and Chad); taken from the vaults of the Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About Saif al islam Qaddafi (Son of Momar Qaddafi)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 28, 2015, Saif al-Islam was sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes by the &quot;self-declared government&quot; in Tripoli, Libya (he is being held in Zintan, not where the trial was held).</p>

<p>Saif al-Islam has been hosted at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle by the British royal family.[77] He claims that former Prime Minister Tony Blair is a personal friend; Blair took an interest in advising Libya on oil revenues and finance.[78] In 2009, he spent a weekend at Waddesdon Manor, home of financier Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, where he was the guest of Lord Mandelson and Nathaniel Philip Rothschild. He later stayed at the Rothschild holiday home in Corfu. Nathaniel Rothschild was a guest at Saif&#39;s 37th birthday celebration in Montenegro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting connections.  It would be hard to determine where Blumenthal&#39;s supposed leak came from, but this also stands out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, Muammar Gaddafi&#39;s son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, received a PhD from the Department of Philosophy at the LSE with a dissertation entitled &quot;The Role of Civil Society in the Democratization of Global Governance Institutions: From &#39;Soft Power&#39; to Collective Decision-Making?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the acknowledgements, Gaddafi thanks &quot;a number of individuals at Monitor Group with whom I worked to design and conduct the NGO Survey which provides empirical data for this thesis.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_Deloitte">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_Deloitte</a></p>

<p>Employees of the now defunct Monitor Group include:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Richard Dearlove - Head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (1999 - 2004)</p>

<p>David Wehner - CFO of Facebook</p>

<p>Ian Smith - Former Chief Executive Officer, Reed Elsevier</p>

<p>Tagg Romney - son of Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts and 2012 US Republican presidential candidate</p>

<p>Andrew Heyward - Senior Advisor to Marketspace LLC; former President of CBS News</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a global intelligence and analytics clearly selling trend analytics services to the highest bidders</p>

<p>Interestingly, there are some important names missing from the wikipedia list (which on it&#39;s surface would appear comprehensive):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The individuals who were engaged in the Monitor project included Francis Fukuyama, author of The End of History; Richard Perle, a prominent neocon who advised President George W Bush in the buildup to the Iraq invasion; and American academics such as Benjamin Barber, Joseph Nye and Robert Putnam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/04/monitor-group-us-libya-gaddafi">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/04/monitor-group-us-libya-gaddafi</a></p>

<p>Fukuyama and Perle?  You&#39;re just missing Feith and Wolfowitz and you&#39;ve got the core Straussian PNACers.</p>

<p>So Monitor is in there doing their due diligence on Libya&#39;s gold and factions.  These are the guys who want to balkanize the middle east and north africa into &quot;semi-autonomous zones&quot; to ensure no larger union can negotiate trade with the east.  I don&#39;t wonder which direction Blumenthal&#39;s &quot;intelligence&quot; was coming from.  You have some shady cats with access to Qaddafi junior, and now they&#39;ve sentenced him to death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so do you think its possible that the idea to invade north africa in the first place started with qaddafi junior&#39;s thesis?  essentially using his research for this thesis as a cover to size up resources?  or do you think that qaddafi jr was in on it in the beginning and he was backstabbed in the worst possible way?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was a rich kid that made the mistake of making &quot;friends&quot; with very powerful people who were just waiting to take his father out.  And I guarantee that His family controlled a vast wealth of art and antiquities that is now secretly and illegally under the control of these people.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s been known for a long time that these guys wanted to take out Qaddafi.  They tried to pin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103">Lockerbie</a> on Qaddafi and when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUZSS-REaKY">Clark blew the whistle on balkanization agenda after 9/11</a>, Qaddafi did everything he could to work with the US without giving up his vision of a unified africa.</p>

<p>I think that Qaddafi Jr working with Monitor to get a PHD from LSE was an attempt to bridge a gap, but he was probably unwilling to go full MI5/ CIA, so they took him down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this explains why france was committed to the war effort, but it does NOT explain why the initial coalition of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, UK and US all decided to contribute to the war effort.  </p>

<p>I assume it was because they didnt want qaddafi to start a new bank free from western control.  thats a nice assumption, but if this is the first the state department had heard of it, the dates are odd.  </p>

<p>the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 was passed on march 17th, 2011. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1973</a></p>

<p>this letter is dated april 1st, 2011.  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12659">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12659</a></p>

<p>so that means that the UN passed the resolution a month before anyone in the US state department knew about the plan to start a new bank (assuming the above letter is the first anyone had heard of it).</p>

<p>i guess what im trying to get at is, this all DOES explain why france was so gung-ho about bombing libya in the beginning, it DOES NOT explain why the other nations wanted to interfere in libya to begin with.  they say it was because they wanted to protect civilians, but that doesnt seem right to me because there were worse atrocities being done other places in the world.  </p>

<p>so, in the beginning, what was the original reason for going into libya?</p>
