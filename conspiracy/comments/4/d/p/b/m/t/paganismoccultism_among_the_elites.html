<p>What is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/opinion/sunday/life-among-the-ruins.html">this</a> about?
We&#39;re reconstructing a temple entrance dedicated to Baal (a.k.a. Bel/Moloch/Ba&#39;al-Zebub/Satan) in two of the most iconic squares in the world? Really? I mean there are many other examples of monuments that ISIS destroyed that you can use to portray unity between different peoples of the world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_of_Al-l%C4%81t">This</a> one for example. At least that one symbolizes love. But no, just because the temple where <em>children</em> used to be sacrificed, through fire, to a pagan god, whom we now think of as the literal Devil, has vague ties to all faiths somehow, we use it as a symbol of unity.  He has the body of a man and the head and horns of a bull. He is literally referenced to as the Golden Calf. The Golden Calf which caused the Israelites to reject God&#39;s ways and make Moses break his commandments. They are described in the bible as making burnt-offerings. <a href="http://one-evil.org/content/entities_gods_moloch.html">He is said to &#39;eat&#39; children and consume them within the fire in his belly.</a> So basically not the best symbol of hope and unity.</p>

<p>I did some digging and there are way too many weird details about this story. First I found the <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/conspiracy-theories/2016/04/april-19-23-2016-the-feast-of-moloch-and-blood-sacrifice-day-2474580.html">&#39;Moloch Feast&#39;</a>. Which I&#39;m pretty sure isn&#39;t completely real, at least not historically. But it sent me down a weird path. The bit about May 1st having very real occult/pagan meaning is spot on. There are multiple pre-christian religions who celebrated this particular day, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane">Beltane</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night">Walpurgis Night</a>. Funnily enough they all involve fire sacrifice in some shape or form. And the article does fairly point out that there seem to be way too many explosive (including guns) attacks on citizens during this period. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-strange-seasonality-of-violence-why-april-is-the-beginning-of-the-killing-season/2016/04/03/4e05d092-f6c0-11e5-9804-537defcc3cf6_story.html">Even the mainstream media seems on board with this.</a></p>

<p>There are just some weird coincidences here. The Waco compound which was set ablaze in an FBI raid was also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Carmel_Center">Mount Carmel</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah#Challenge_to_Baal">The same Mount Carmel where Elijah summoned worshippers of Baal</a> to test and basically prove Baal to be a false god, after Baal failed to light the sacrifice on fire. That feels an awful lot like setting things straight, or is it me? Also that the deity rumored to be worshipped at the Bohemian Grove is Moloch. They light a fire at belly height and everything.</p>

<p>And I came across all this maybe days after seeing a weird reference in one of the Hillary Clinton dump e-mails, which I forgot about until doing this digging. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">This quote:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...&quot;With fingers crossed, the old rabbit&#39;s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How weird is that? Why would you even know enough about Moloch to be even joking about him? Down to the sacrificing part. Now I don&#39;t know if Hillary herself wrote this but certainly one of her close peers would have.</p>

<p>I have no idea what to make of this.
The whole &#39;lets put a tribute to the devil (or at least some degenerate child eating pagan god) right in our own most iconic squares&#39; thing. And they&#39;re planning to do this in other major cities as well. Also there&#39;s a weird Phoenican/Semite/Israelite connection there. There are some who believe Yahweh/Jehovah is actually a synonym for Baal, and that (some parts of) the Jewish people haven&#39;t ever really renounced the Golden Calf of old.</p>

<p>I never considered these things to even be remotely true, but to me, this seems like a weird laundry list of coincidences at least. Worthy of doublechecking some things personally. It ties the whole Isreali connection/Pedophile rings/Occult worship together among the Elites, so perfectly. I thought I sort of outgrew this storyline as I got older, as it&#39;s always the first thing you find on conspiracy theories. Still I believe there is a LOT of disinformation there as alot of these theories are upheld by religious cooks, but nonetheless there&#39;s a grain of truth there I feel. Why else make these, basically, portals to a temple where children used to be burned ritualistically, in arguably the most important places in the world. Also why in the hell would someone make a joke about an extremely obscure pagan deity, especially in the exact right context. I mean I won&#39;t draw any conclusions from my findings here today but they at least warrant a closer inspection of the religious/pagan/occult side of history, which I have largely ignored, if I&#39;m honest.</p>

<p>What do you guys make of this?
Anyone can help me make this any clearer or send me in a direction I can look into next?
I&#39;m really curious to hear from someone who has done some actual research into all this.</p>

<p>PS: I&#39;m super tired after all this digging and, frankly, in a slight state of shock because of the realization. Sorry if this post is a bit of a mess, I hope you get the gist.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">35</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a> 2016-04-07</p>
    <div class="md"><p>If I may offer my suggestion.  They are alchemists, gnostics.  A secret religion enjoyed by many in the american ruling class and within certain secret societies.  Namely, the freemasons.  Freemasonry is about having a &#39;cover story&#39;, which changes based upon the predominant religion of the area in which it has a presence.  In America, Christianity.  In Egypt, Islam.  In Russia, mixed bag, probably Russian Orthodox Christianity.  In Asia Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.  Many many freemasons are in the police and in the intelligence community and nasa.  Also, many mormons, many of whom are in freemasonry now that masons have changed their position on mormons from what it was in the 19th century.</p>

<p>In their temples, they perform various rites and rituals that start out as &#39;dares&#39;, &#39;lessons&#39;, &#39;metaphors&#39;; but at higher levels become &#39;investment in the cult&#39; in the form of &#39;having performed blackmailable things&#39; such as crimes or shameful acts; some say ritual magic.  I&#39;m not a freemason, I wouldn&#39;t know, but based on the countless testimonies of exmasons and things said within morals and dogma and other writings by famous mason Albert Pike, it would not surprise me in the least.  </p>

<p>What is absolutely clear to me from the descriptions of the &#39;chamber of contemplation&#39; I think it&#39;s called, is that they are alchemists and cultists of an ancient snake religion of sex-and-death (worship of act of sex and death-rebirth).  Basically an ISIS like cult.  In this chamber, there are &#39;momento mori&#39; like human skulls and bone fragments and VITRIOL which is a latin inscription that is directly a reference to rosicrucian alchemy.  There is a masonic painting &#39;et in arcadia ego&#39;.  Another momento mori.  There are references and motifs to the acacia (shittim wood) which are a very strong biblical reference to the two arks in the bible, but a third significance is alchemical in that acacia is a unique genus of plant containing the super-psychedelic compount DMT, which is something no-doubt the alchemists were trying to extract, preserve or recreate in acocunts of mystery elixirs <em>soma</em>, <em>haoma</em>, <em>kykeon</em>, <em>ambrosia</em>, <em>manna</em>, <em>the lapis philosophorum</em>, <em>the quintessence</em>, <em>the philosophers stone</em> etc</p>

<p>I&#39;m skipping ahead.  Let me just finish the thought.  Rosicrucianism was the first framework of ecclectic esotericism bridging the gap from the ancient to the medieval from the time of the mystery schools: it roped in kabbalism, astrotheology, sacred geometry, numerology, platonic metaphysics, divination(tarot), symbology, meditative contemplation, and transpersonal psychology (before it was called that) into one thing called alchemy.  It used symbols to create correlations of stars to aspects of being, symbols used in metaphor to describe transformative tropes and lessons or to store / transmit knowledge (ie: psycho-mythologies), and described a process for the alchemist to transform himself iteratively through a process of breaking down his psychology and rebuilding it as a mirror to the physical process of the practicum of protochemistry experiments.</p>

<p>Fast forward.  Helena Blavatsky then rebooted rosicrucianism and called it theosophy.  Aleister crowley rebooted theosophy and called it thelema and started his own brand of mentalism and sex magick being involved in OTO and AA, taking alchemy into a more dominant and aggressive modality, more left-hand-path, more summoning and controlling demons, etc.  </p>

<p>It seems that this has become a fork in the road between the wizard gnostics who really aim for a spiritual world ascension, and those who simply want to dominate and capitalize in the material world and make the world bend to their will (dark magicians).  Both are gnostics, some are white and some are black.  Just like the freemason checkerboard suggests.  It&#39;s why you see checkerboards in film ALL THE TIME.  Now that you know about it, you&#39;ll see it everywhere and it will kind of piss you off.</p>

<p>Crowley influenced Jack Parsons, who was the founder of the JPL lab, which became integrated with NASA.  Parsons was a brilliant scientists, but also a demologist. He was nerding out on rockets by day, and worshiping satan by night.  He was a different duck.</p>

<p>He became friends with L Ron Hubbard. Hubbard stole his ideas and his girlfriend and vanished I think to florida, and started a weird sex magick cult on his yacht, which later became Scientology.  LRon Hubbard was a creep and a dick for doing that to Parsons.  I dont&#39; agree with worshipping satan, but I still felt bad for how it played out for him.  Sympathy for the devil I suppose.</p>

<p>Parsons wasn&#39;t the only satanist in the high eschelon of our government.  There was also Werner Von Braun and about 8000 other Wafen SS brought into the US government via operation Paperclip.  These SS were Nazi special forces (like marines) who had a special occult-based ideology of death-worship.  </p>

<p>The SS had formed from thule socieity which had been influenced by HP blavatsky, Crowley and Vril, which is a science fiction book from the late 1800s talking about a society of supermen who lived in the hollow earth and could use a fluid called vril that could create or destroy (I&#39;m serious.  no really, they actually believed this).  SS were basically a thanateros cult (sex/death), a reboot of the brotherhood of the snake or the order of the phoenix.  Essentially worshippers of isis/astarte or shiva.  The goddess of sex, death, renewal, rebirth (death/rebirth is the phoenix trope).  The snake goddess is the oldest religion and it was universal.  I believe ISIS was the reboot of the snake goddess.  </p>

<p>At any rate, these SS people were installed in NASA and no doubt spawned new people, their children, people they knew with the same ideologies into our government at the high levels.</p>

<p>Prescott Bush was basically an SS, so was Ford.  They did dealings with the Nazis.  Even the Catholic Pope at the time supported Hitler.  None of this is ever talked about but it&#39;s true.  Ford is credited with having written anti-semitic protocols of the elders of zion because he published it in the paper he owned and it was credited to &#39;anonymous&#39; so either he wrote it, or he promoted it an protected the &#39;whisltleblower&#39;, although it&#39;s now largely considered a hoax document and antisemitic propaganda.</p>

<p>Bush went in front of Senate for the crime of violating the &#39;trading with the enemy&#39; act, but he got off because as he was being dragged into accusaiton he started a bunch of veterans programs like the slimer he was.  And of course that bought him the social credit to get off with a handslap.  Then, through a series of unfortunate events, his sperm ultimately created 9/11 and the ridiculous political theater and fraud we live every day since then.</p>

<p>Of course there were others in military-intelligence that have had a <em>very controversial</em> past, namely the founder of the Temple of Set, Michael Aquino who is a general and satanist.  Stubblebine and some others are also in this weird little mind-control MKULTRA clique.  </p>

<p>Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles were essentially knights of malta (jesuit) cryptofascists who were definitely involved in the killing of JFK, JFK had fired Dulles for proposing a false flag plan operation northwoods to blame an attack on a us ship on cuba which JFK said &#39;no&#39; to.  This, among many other things, got JFK shot.  And then that basterd Allen Dulles was given the job of running the Warren Report on JFK&#39;s assassination.  As someone else had said, this is like putting Colonel Sanders in charge of investigating who ate the last chicken leg, or something.</p>

<p>I touched on the jesuits / knights of malta...which is another rabbit hole to go down.  This is long so I&#39;ll just summarize and you&#39;ll have to take my word for it and do your own research.  But Jesuits are not who you think they are.  They are a saturnian cult of nazi SS.  They are <em>the original</em> SS.  In fact, there is evidence they created the whole Nazi party as a false flag to grab gold, arms, art, relics around the world and use the nazi party as the fall guy.  </p>

<p>Jesuits are behind the knights of malta, and they are behind the freemasons too.  I believe these are all cooperating secret societies.. Jesuits and Opus Dei on the pope side.  MI6 and CIA on the side of monarchs (city of london, dc-president), Freemasons are their communication network.</p>

<p>Of these guys, ALL are cryptofascists using the capitalism / socialism conflict as a ploy to bring about fascism.  When capitalism fails &quot;too big to fail&quot;  &quot;bailouts&quot;  &quot;Savings and Loans crisis&quot;, they don&#39;t mind socialism, but boy when poor people want socialism...it&#39;s damn communism!  Deep down, the fascist knows that a hybrid of socialism/capitalism is their worst enemy so they divide and conquer and hold up the opposite as the enemy of the other.</p>

<p>Of these cryptofascists, some are gnostics, some are pedophiles and are into the whole phoenix thanateros trip. Certainly Hillary is.  Have you seen her lapel pin?  And her NWO inklings?  She wants to burn the world down and start anew with her cronie friends. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think all these freemasons are into the alchemy unless they are high level... I think they get further into the cult of it and in order to ascend up their hierarchy they have to commit to these gnostic ideologies in various ways.</p>

<p>I hope this has been educational.  I think it&#39;s mostly true (intended to be..perhaps I&#39;ve made mistakes though)</p>

<hr/>

<p>My sources for these are too numerous to name but I can point you in the right directions.  One is a documentary on jack parsons.  Another is Jay Weidner&#39;s work.  A third is Mae Brussell&#39;s archive on youtube, especially these particular podcasts of hers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Order of knights of malta, Dulles</li>
<li>Nazis in Nasa</li>
<li>Jonestown 3 part series (it will blow your f_cking mind)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mae Brussell uncovered stuff we&#39;re still trying to make sense of some 30 yrs later.  She was a brilliant researcher.  And she didn&#39;t have the internet</p>

<p>EDIT: I may be very wrong about that 8000 figure.  It was at the least 1400-1500 scientists, but this is like the holocaust numbers: we really don&#39;t know who&#39;s figure is correct.  I&#39;ve heard 8000, I&#39;ve heard 3000 and 1500.  It could be 1500 scientists and 6500 &#39;other&#39; non-scientist from the ss as staff / employees.  It&#39;s really uncertain.  So let&#39;s say what we know, the 1500</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have to take issue with the quote from your post, above. Theosophy is not a &quot;reboot&quot; of Rosicrucianism, and Thelema is not a &quot;reboot&quot; of Theosophy. These are three completely different Western mystical paths. By confounding them, you show that you don&#39;t understand them. Rosicrucianism was wholly Christian. All its symbolism, its philosophy, its prayers, are Christian (I&#39;m not talking about its supposed later evolution in the Golden Dawn, but about actual Rosicrucianism). Theosophy, on the other hand, draws heavily from Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. It cannot be called Christian. Thelema is Aleister Crowley&#39;s own personal revelation, as set forth in his <em>Liber AL vel Legis</em> (commonly called his <em>Book of the Law</em>). Crowley&#39;s symbolism and references are a mixture of Christian, Jewish, Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Celtic, with some Buddhism and Hinduism thrown in for good measure. These are only his major influences.</p>

<p>To write about Rosicrucianism, Theosophy and Thelema as if they are one and the same, and a progression from one to the other, is incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re entirely correct on that.  It was my understanding the theosophy did incorporate rosicrucianism.  Thelema, you&#39;re probably right on.  I dont&#39; know much about it or care to.  I just know Crowley studied Blavatsky, Alchemy and all the esoteric traditions.  Rsicrucianism was not &#39;entirely christian&#39;.  It wasn&#39;t christian, it was gnostic--follow the rose.  The rose knows (same as tudor rose, lutheran rose, babylonian rose)  You have that incorrect.  It did incorporate christian tradition, but at the core, it was alchemy which is all those things I mentioned (gnosticism)</p>

<p>I suppose I should have said influenced instead of reboot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post.  I would say, though, that you should consider (perhaps you have?) that some of this stuff is either in part or in whole just a front for big money and Intelligence, meant to throw us off the trail.  An example being Theosophy: forget about Blavatsky, study who Henry Steel Alcott was, his life and history, and who he was really working for.  They like to focus on Blavatsky but Alcott is the one with the interesting (and obvious) story.  He was backed by big money from the beginning and his ties to the military and Intelligence were extensive and lasted his entire life.  Same with L. Ron Hubbard: high-ranking Intelligence agent.  Same with Crowley.  Even Pike, the famous Mason, was among the highest ranking generals in the Confederacy.  Just a few examples.</p>

<p>Also you didn&#39;t mention the Order of the Golden Fleece, probably the most prestigious aristocratic order/secret society in all of Europe and perhaps even the entire world.  It&#39;s a major player in world affairs (IMO).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the question: do they actually believe in this stuff or do they just throw it out there as another layer of deception and disinfo for those who look beyond the surface of things?  Either way I think it&#39;s interesting that a lot of the people we refer to as being &quot;occultists&quot; or being into mystery religions and all of that stuff are <em>also</em> linked directly to the military and specifically to intelligence, and also are linked to bankers and big money industrialists.  And this isn&#39;t just the members of these societies, this is the <em>founders</em> of these societies in many cases.  So at the very top of these groups we have Intelligence and bankers mixing with esotericism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s definitely a top down thing.
But if they don&#39;t believe it, they are going through MASSIVE amounts of effort then to make it seem like they do. Why would they do that? Like the Bohemian Grove for example, they&#39;re doing those kinds of activities just to throw us off their scent? So they would rather make us believe that they&#39;re part of a cult practicing pedophilia and human sacrifice among other things, than just have us believe they&#39;re commiting something like tax-fraud or any other economic or political transgression? Why?</p>

<p>Well.  Few possibilities.  One would be that probably 95% of people will immediately shut down or just start laughing once they hear the words &quot;cult pedophilia&quot; or &quot;human sacrifice&quot; or &quot;pagan ritual&quot; or &quot;occult elite&quot;.  To many those are <em>waaaay</em> &quot;out there&quot; conspiracies and they won&#39;t ever even entertain the thought.  They&#39;ll also marginalize anyone who does.  So for example, I go to my friend and start talking to him about the Cremation of Care ceremony at the Grove, he looks at me like I have four heads and laughs at me, and now anything else I say to him will also be dismissed as equally crazy - for better or worse.</p>

<p>Another angle: we all are looking for occult/esoteric conspiracies, trying to find hidden meaning in symbols and numerology, trying to see the links between alchemy and hermeticism and freemasonry and DC, when the simple reality staring us in the face is that we&#39;re being fucked over by those in power <em>right here in the real world</em>.  They&#39;re stealing from us directly, manipulating currencies, starting false wars, creating a police state, using intelligence agencies to co-opt the media and spread propaganda and lies, poisoning our food, dumbing down children, flooding the streets with drugs, creating false flags and hoaxes, etc., etc.  All of these things are <strong>provably</strong> happening, but if we sit there focusing on the esoteric/pagan rituals we ignore some or all of the obvious.  And again those outside of these conspiracy discussion forums will dismiss all of those easily provable conspiracies when they hear us talking about the esoteric ones.</p>

<p>Of course the other possibility is that they actually do believe in this stuff or that it really does give them powers of some kind.  I don&#39;t discount that angle either to be sure.  My concept of &quot;magick&quot; includes the modern idea of &quot;money&quot;, includes TV <em>programming</em>, includes social engineering, includes mind control, all of that stuff.  I just wonder if having us dive down deep, dark rabbit holes is the goal of some of this because if we&#39;re doing that, we aren&#39;t taking <strong>action</strong> up here on the ground level, in 3-d reality, where we all are truly and completely being fucked over by the very few.</p>

<p>Sorry this is a very old post I&#39;m responding to.</p>

<p>Is it so difficult to imagine that people who would do all that above would not also transcend moral boundaries into the sexual and murderous?  I don&#39;t think it is.</p>

<p>In responding to both you and the OP, I think the occultism is NOT a ploy to take people&#39;s eyes off their various criminal frauds.  I think they can be both a criminal mafia dealing in banal frauds as well as esoteric high weirdness.  </p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t matter whether they engage in it or not, they are gaslighting the public either way by putting it out there to shut down inquiry.</p>

<p>I personally believe it&#39;s used both as mockery and as a means of communication.  In other words, the things they do are as much a ritual as they are a communication to other gangs (like a gang sign, like &#39;yes we did it&#39;) so for example if a bunch of miners are trapped in a hole, and there are 33 of them; or if 33 people die or 77 people die in a firefight...this kind of thing, those curious numbers...they say mostly that the story is partially fabricated.  they didn&#39;t shoot exactly 33 people.  cmon.  But they did kill some folks...  Think about that</p>

<p>spycraft and occultism have always been linked; spies speak in numbers and symbols and ciphers and metaphors to keep their purpose concealed</p>

<p>They can and probably do, at least to some extent.  In fact I think at a certain level the two become blurred regardless of intent - for example, the whole idea of &quot;money&quot; and what it actually is is esoteric and magical.  Same goes for language itself, and the people who manipulate these things can very accurately be said to dabble in the occult.  But what I&#39;m saying is that a lot of this stuff is a smokescreen placed there deliberately to throw us off the trail of the actual, literal, provable crimes.  And it has the added benefit of making other sane people think anyone talking about these things are lunatics and shutting off completely.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether they do all these esoteric things or not because we <strong>know</strong> that they&#39;re robbing us blind, poisoning us, lying to us, manipulating us, etc.  Aleister Crowley: proven government agent.  Michael Aquino: high ranking intelligence officer with a specialty in psy-ops.  Henry Steel Alcott of Theosophy: colonel in military intelligence.  And on and on - these guys are all agents.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too much of a stretch to say that a lot of their esoteric theories and writings and movements were manufactured for psychological/propaganda reasons.</p>

<p>As far as the #s go, I agree.  In my opinion numerology markers are used by these guys as signals to other branches of intelligence, sort of like a &quot;you guys can stand down, this one is us&quot; type of thing.  Also probably as a way of bragging.  Also as a way of declaring to those with eyes to see that they&#39;re there - it isn&#39;t any fun to play God when no one knows you exist.  But look for how many 46&#39;s and 47&#39;s you see in a lot of these events and histories, those are two of the biggest ones that not a lot of people who study numerology mention.  1946 was when the CIA was established and 1947 is its official &quot;first year&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They actually believe it.  But they also believe in science.  Which means they are performing a psychological alchemy on themselves (self+group) in participating in the rituals.  </p>

<p>They are treating life itself as a psychedelic experience, which means to transcend boundaries that others normally obey, thinking that if you obey those boundaries then you have bought into the game and therefore deserve your fate.  A normal person would call this boundary defiance &#39;psychopathy&#39; though--to not hold oneself accountable or applicable to societal norms.  If you choose never to hurt anyone but yourself, then maybe you&#39;re not a psychopath so I&#39;m not talking about them.  If you&#39;re a gnostic wizard and you do magic by yourself to make the world or yoruself better, then : good.</p>

<p>The others however...They have a secret religion of the elite that rewards them for breaking rules in ways that injure the public. Essentially, when you boil it all down they are either pirates, wizard-witches, or perverts.   Pirates defy boundaries in administration, accounting and finance; witches defy social convention boundaries and engage in taboo of the body; and perverts defy boundaries of the mind and of others (pedos).  </p>

<p>So they are either thieves, poisoners or molesters or all three  a poisonous pedopirate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not some kooky thing.  When I was in NYC I saw alchemical symbols and demonic sigils painted on the ground to appear as construction markings (orange paint, in construction zones).  I am not a religious person, or a christian. I&#39;m a buddhist and judging from how harshly I speak a shitty one at that.  I don&#39;t live in abject fear of these people in fact the opposite.  I find them <em>fascinating</em> but I dont&#39; admire them...I think some of them are assholes who rape kids so I&#39;m interested in justice for those kids</p>

<p>People who don&#39;t know what these symbols are would totally miss them.  I also saw people lined up to visit the 9/11 memorial, but it was designed to make them spiral around the memorial in a circle. </p>

<p>The memorial is a black square pond.  The WTC was a work of Islamic architecture.  Connect the dots.  They were forcing christians into an islamic symbolic ritual of walking around the kaaba.  This was very obvious to me, but woosh, everyone missed it.  WHy?  Because they refuse to know their history, symbols and they dont&#39; see the writing on the wall.  They refuse you when you say WTC was designed by a japanese architect that was inspired by islamic religious motifs and architectural styles... making the WTC 2 minarets of kaaba for example</p>

<p>Now they have a giant metal oculus  (ONE EYE) that opens on 9/11.  How more obvious can one be?</p>

<p>When I was in nyc, I found a flyer for joining the freemasons and it was compass and square but inside was not a &quot;G&quot; but a skull and crossbones.  Like <a href="http://www.masonicexchange.com/assets/images/tshirt-design-detail.jpg">this</a></p>

<p>My point in all these disjointed facts is that there are symbols all around you.</p>

<p>Now unless the elite are playing some kind of LARP (live action role playing game) through symbols planted at strategic places, within music, within architecture going back centuries, within art going back millenia, then they are up to something else!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I totally agree. I didn&#39;t mean to say every information on material like this is provided by cooks, not at all. It&#39;s just that my old world view has trouble letting go of me, and I <em>still</em> get those kinds of reactions to certain subjects. Now I know that&#39;s a mechanism not put there by myself and continue researching anyway, because like you, I have a strong sense of curiosity towards these matters.</p>

<p>Also the theory about the 9/11 monument is very interesting. Would you know the name of the architect by any chance?</p>

<p>It&#39;s why they call magic a &#39;trick&#39;.  You paid for magic, but you got a trick and that trick was the alchemy of turning your attention into gold.  That&#39;s also why show biz is so alchemically themed--they understand this well.  It&#39;s mayhem mockery mindcontrol money magic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very kind feedback. Thank you.  Seriously do yourself a favor and listen to Mae Brussell and Michael Parenti on youtube.  They are <em>very good researchers</em>.  There&#39;s a lot of people in the conspiracy field / occult or new age fields, making money giving lectures.  Often times it feels like they are pulling your leg.  Like Jones, or Bill Cooper or Michael Tsarion, or Jay Weidner.  I listen to them to &#39;glean&#39; the truth..its more like divination.  You end up with something mostly true.  With Weidner you end up with half truths and half mistakes. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a conscious disinformationalist just a mistake laden new agist person</p>

<p>If you want to stick only to provable facts, listen to Brussell.  She was very careful to make things that sounded like accusations (King Alfred plan) but she always had a caveat of doubt and said things like &#39;it would appear&#39; &#39;it would seem&#39;, she was good about letting her listeners know that something was not 100% proven.  A truly astounding historian.  Also the same with Parenti but maybe even more so since he&#39;s a university professor of history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christian posts are the most censored and the most reviled on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and elsewhere. The Bible was banned in public schools worldwide in the 1960s. &quot;Progress&quot; is defined as anything that leads the masses further from Christian values. Do you think this is all coincidence? Now that you realize that the elites are Satanists, which side do you choose? The elites and the god they worship advocate human sacrifice and all manner of evils perpetrated on the peasants, but God&#39;s only son, Jesus Christ, gave his life on the cross as full payment for our sins, was buried three days and then resurrected. Matthew 7:13-20 &quot;Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#39;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.&quot;</p>

I believe the bible and the story within it are internalizations of the outside world, as a means for the human brain to make sense of the seeming indiscriminate chaos that surrounds it. Totally respect religious freedom though. I stand with anyone who advocates peace, love and rejection of immoral behavior</p>

<p>If you randomly start posting about some ridiculous theory you can up with that&#39;s entirely based on speculation without any sort of evidence, then yes, you&#39;re going to get ridiculed and people will tell you to crawl back to your hole.

Witches are monstrous entities that are the result of a magical girl who let her soul gem (soul container) become completely corrupted. <em>The biggest, baddest enemy is Walpurgis Nacht whose arrival basically brings in the apocalypse.</em></p>

<p><strong>On April 19th</strong> (and close days)</p>

<p>There is almost a 4 year trend with a large amounts of deaths/injuries happening in the US. Though I looked at other days, April 16~20 and there are LOTS of deaths in that timeframe every year.</p>

<p>April 19th, 1985 – Two hundred ATF and FBI agents lay siege to the compound of the neo-Nazi survivalist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord in Arkansas. The CSA surrenders two days later.</p>

<p>April 19th, 1989 – A gun turret explodes on the USS Iowa, killing 47 sailors.</p>

<p>April 19, 1993 – Waco Massacre: An FBI assault lead to the burning down of the compound of a sect named Branch Davidians, killing 76 men, women and children.</p>

<p>April 19, 1995 – Oklahoma City bombing – 168 people killed.</p>

<p>April 20, 1999 – Columbine High School massacre – 13 people murdered, 21 injured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching the intro, this was the first thing said by anybody in the ceremony to kick off the games:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be not afeared.. Be not afeared. The Isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears and sometimes voices. And if I then had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again and then, in dreaming, the clouds, me thoughts, would open and show riches ready to drop upon me. That when I waked, I cried to dream again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All while impersonating a London elite standing on top of a beautiful peaceful rural area, which right after this speech gets dismantled by zombie-like workers whilst the guys in the suits stand to the side shaking hands. I have to admit that&#39;s kinda weird</p>

<p>EDIT: The narrator just announced that the segment was called &#39;Pandemonium&#39;, a word invented by a poet called John Martin in a book called Paradise Lost. There it is described as being the capital of Hell. After looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pand%C3%A6monium_%28Paradise_Lost%29">wiki-page</a> it features illustrations of the capital, and they show a river of fire and a circles of flame in the sky. <a href="http://imgur.com/nxJB5w6">Guess what they had at the ceremony</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a loaded question. And one we could spend countless hours debating. I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in anything per se. Belief doesn&#39;t form a huge part of my life. </p>

<p>I&#39;m rather scientific in nature and tend to rely on that to broaden my worldview. Yes, I am aware of its limitations and that there are some things that I&#39;m going to bust have to accept at face value, out of blind faith, if you will, if certain information comes from certain sources. </p>

<p>It simply isn&#39;t possible to know the entire body of knowledge that we humans have acquired. I neither have the time, patience or interest to study it all. But I accept the words of those in their respective fields as long as they are peer reviewed, verified and make sense. </p>

<p>I cannot disregard everything I don&#39;t fully understand but I know that if I was to look into these things, everything would add up. And I know this because I&#39;ve verified in areas I am interested in. </p>

<p>Science isn&#39;t a big bad immobile beast feeding us lies. Its me, you and all the little people. Working on little things. Making little steps. And showing others what they&#39;ve found. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in magic, I&#39;ve never seen a single piece of evidence for it. And the evidence that the elite are entangled in this Satan worshiping, human sacrificing cult is patently absurd. Do they collude? Certainly. You can&#39;t get into power in this world without playing the game and having the financial resources to do so. Are they imbezilling, lining their own pockets, shafting the tax payer? A lot of them are. Passing legislation that benefits the corporation&#39;s and wealthy? Absolutely. </p>

<p>Worshipping Satan and leaving symbological clues everywhere? This isn&#39;t a Dan Brown novel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point. I just don&#39;t think this is a big elite thing. It just seems absurd that they would all be practicing such a strange religion. Maybe some of them are. I think we put too much onus on our leaders when it comes to being organised.</p>

<p>Just an edit: the temple of Baal was one of great architectural achievement of the time. It has some of the largest base stones ever excavated. It is an impression work of both aft and architecture for its time. It is a great loss. Maybe, just maybe, this is an honour to that loss? How many paintings of Collosus or the library of Alexandria is there? We do our best to preserve our past and learn from it. There&#39;s no pseudo-christian religious fervour behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether it&#39;s an elite thing is very much debatable indeed, but I&#39;ve never heard of a steel mill pedophilia scandal. It always tends to be higher ranking officials of whatever institution, be it religion, government or otherwise.</p>

<p>To the edit, very true, also it was at one point a christian church which was converted into a mosque, which does make it a symbol of sorts.
My counter arguement would be that there must have been other monuments in that region that have seen multi-religious purposes that have been destroyed in the act of war. Why this particular one, and why in these iconic places. Trafalgar square has largely been untouched since 1844, but now we place a monument there remembering a pagan god basically. Ok, I can vaguely see the sentiment there but why not literally anywhere else? Why must it be so <a href="http://emmaus-group.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ArchLondon-1080x675.jpg">center stage?</a> And what&#39;s more, they plan on doing <em>1,000</em> more in cities all over the globe. What&#39;s next? One in front of the Eiffel tower? The whole idea just strikes me as outlandish to be honest, even ignoring the religious aspects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True about institutionalised paedophilia. I&#39;ll concede your point there. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because it was such an important and highly respected monument. And it was destroyed by ISIS. The very entity that the entire world is United against. Nobody but ISIS wants ISIS. By taking this high ranking monument that they destroyed and replicating it across the world sends a powerful message: we will not let you take away all that humanity has spent thousands of years working for. We will not stand for this. For each monument, church, school, mosque, painting, statue, whatever, you destroy we will build a thousand more. You won&#39;t stop us and we will prevail.</p>

<p>Edit: to further that point we&#39;re fighting an ideological war. If we can show potential recruits of ISIS that there&#39;s nothing they can do to stop us spreading and embracing all forms of culture and art they might realise that they can never win. That they&#39;re on the wrong side. That they keep fighting and yet we prosper ever more. That is how we defeat militant radical Islam. That is how we defeat any militant and radical idea. Show them our way is better and they can&#39;t stop us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, it&#39;s laden with satanic and occult references.
If you like that kind of stuff you should watch Spectre, except it&#39;s more about NWO and all that. There&#39;s a scene where wealthy elites have a secret meeting on wether to implement a global communication tapping program. They have a UN style vote with the representatives of the different countries voting yes or no, with only South-Africa voting no. But because there has to be a unanimous decision for the motion to pass it&#39;s denied. Then, in the following scene, one of the higher ups in that particular organization (Spectre) says:&quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll come to see the light(the &#39;light&#39; reference used multiple times in the film)&quot;. Jump a few scenes ahead, there&#39;s a TV showing South-Africa has been hit by a vicious terrorist attack.</p>

<p>The thing is with these kinds of films, I can never discern if they&#39;re made as a taunt of sorts, flaunting a vision of the world in clear view or just some director being into conspiracy theories. I always assume the latter just because I can never get any evidence of the former.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit#Child_sacrifice">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanit#Child_sacrifice</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The origins of Tanit are to be found in the pantheon of Ugarit, especially in the Ugaritic goddess Anat (Hvidberg-Hansen 1982), a consumer of blood and flesh. There is significant, albeit disputed, evidence, both archaeological and within ancient written sources, pointing towards child sacrifice forming part of the worship of Tanit and Baal Hammon.[8]</p>

<p>Some archaeologists theorised that infant sacrifices have occurred. Lawrence E. Stager, who directed the excavations of the Carthage Tophet in the 1970s, believes that infant sacrifice was practiced there. Paolo Xella of the National Research Council in Rome summarized the textual, epigraphical, and archaeological evidence for Carthaginian infant sacrifice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good post and certainly the topic of occultism within the control structure is a very important component - maybe even the most important, worthy of any discussion. Problems arise primarily because we simply do not understand the systems that they are using, or how their motivations are shaping them. We tend to overly focus on external aspects of these ideas and draw conclusions based on trying prove our own conclusions. Another problem is that we are all steeped in orthodox Christian values which are shaped and promoted by the exact people we claim to be fighting. These values have dumbed us down to these deeper aspects of reality. </p>

<p>I think if you want to make any real headway in this area you have to do some pretty difficult things that might even change your entire world view (yet again). I don&#39;t see how anyone can throw around ideas like magic or demons or satan with the simplistic superstitious view that abounds in society - whether that&#39;s mainstream christianity or mainstream culture in general. More specifically, if you&#39;re coming at it with a god vs. the devil, dualistic approach, I can promise you, you are wrong. It is so important to understand that <strong>dualism is a trap</strong>. On a simple level it&#39;s what keeps us tied into the matrix. We spend our lives trying to pursue happiness and control evil that we become blinded to the deeper reality of suffering we are causing. That&#39;s how the game works and the people in control know how to exploit it on a perception level. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to be receptive to the idea that you may not be &#39;right&#39; just because you see something you call &#39;evil&#39;. You might want to consider that just doing these arcane magical rituals involving human sacrifice is repulsive enough to make your reactions entirely predictable. Suffering is a state of mind which keeps you in a state of fear. Fear makes you predictable. </p>

<p>With that in mind we might be able to look at the subject matter more objectively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally spot on I&#39;d say, dualism is a very easy trap to fall into.
While I was slightly shocked to say the least, fear I think was never an issue, I think for most of the conspiracy folk it&#39;s not much of an issue anymore, except maybe the doomsayers and such. My personal belief of morality is everything is gray except for the extremes, with a bell curve model. So most of your days will be filled with shades of gray (pun intended) while acts of pure good or pure evil being <em>almost</em> non existent. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t know how to call this model of thought, or if it has a name, but continuing forward in the trend of dualism, I&#39;d call it polyism or something. I don&#39;t feel like I am on either end of the moral spectrum, I feel more like an observer or true centrist (of course no-one ever is.) I like to explore every available avenue of thought, not cherrypick.</p>

<p>However, if there are cults who connect people who are into the destruction of other life for the sole benifit of personal gain, individually or as a group, that I <em>do</em> condemn. </p>

<p>It could be the occult stuff is just a misdirection. There are many who take a look at the occult that fall into cults. This is something I have experienced personally. Christianity isn&#39;t going to save you from that, you can fall into a fire and brimstone cult just like everyone else.</p>

What I&#39;m trying (poorly) to say is that religion has tremendous influence on world events throughout history and it still does. There are people who do put more meaning into religion than (in my opinion) it deserves, and there just might truly be a satanic movement in the world still. And yes that might include some higher ups in the world. </p>

<p>And did you honestly not think the whole thing about the monuments is a bit odd to say the least? I mean c&#39;mon, that monument specifically, to take center stage in 2 of the worlds most iconic places? Surely they&#39;ve done the research about the temple as I have. They mustve encountered this deity to be connected to it, along with it&#39;s rituals. That doesnt seem odd to you to use as a symbol of unity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Satanism that we hear about on TV is a veneer.  The real satanism is actually an elite cryptoreligion called dark gnosticism, and it starts with a big &quot;G&quot; inside a compass and square. These dark gnostics are the ones involved in the pedophilia, in the mass surveillance movements, in the oppression and media-mind-control and false flagging; in perpetual war.  Dick Cheney is their patron saint and Rummsfeld is his profit and Bush was the unholy ghost.</p>

<p>I think their network is much larger than anyone could imagine.  Freemasonry after all is very big and worldwide, and has many branched off organizations and &#39;levels&#39;. Then there&#39;s the roscicrucian-like modern mystery schools and the OTO and people claiming to be illuminati.</p>

<p>I think at the end of the day, they have a cryptofascist (Nazilike) ideology, I think they are part of that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ceafm/the_empire_of_the_citys_knobelisks_have_origins/?ref=search_posts">old universal religion of thanateros, the serpent, sun and moon</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The weird thing is you&#39;d definitely think that the worlds elites with their education and access to information would know better then to worship a fake God let alone a dark one. I mean any person with basic knowledge of Christianity knows satan is the evil one. So why would someone knowingly worship an evil God without some sort of merit or benefit from it? The same goes for the people mentioned in the bible (I&#39;m not religious). I mean if hypothetically you saw God preform miracles which would personally affirm my own faith, why would you worship a golden calf? Unless there was some sort of benefit to it? I guess my own take of it is we are not being told the whole story, and I might be grasping at straws here but it does sound like dark or blood magic or at least ritualistic sacrifice has some sort of substance to it. I mean scientifically speaking we haven&#39;t really experimented with killing/ the life and death process due to ethics. </p>

Either way I think it&#39;s interesting that a lot of the people we refer to as being &quot;occultists&quot; or being into mystery religions and all of that stuff are <em>also</em> linked directly to the military and specifically to intelligence, and also are linked to bankers and big money industrialists.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not some kooky thing.  When I was in NYC I saw alchemical symbols and demonic sigils painted on the ground to appear as construction markings (orange paint, in construction zones).  I am not a religious person, or a christian. I&#39;m a buddhist and judging from how harshly I speak a shitty one at that.  I don&#39;t live in abject fear of these people in fact the opposite.  I find them <em>fascinating</em> but I dont&#39; admire them...I think some of them are assholes who rape kids so I&#39;m interested in justice for those kids</p>

<p>People who don&#39;t know what these symbols are would totally miss them.  I also saw people lined up to visit the 9/11 memorial, but it was designed to make them spiral around the memorial in a circle. </p>

<p>The memorial is a black square pond.  The WTC was a work of Islamic architecture.  Connect the dots.  They were forcing christians into an islamic symbolic ritual of walking around the kaaba.  This was very obvious to me, but woosh, everyone missed it.  WHy?  Because they refuse to know their history, symbols and they dont&#39; see the writing on the wall.  They refuse you when you say WTC was designed by a japanese architect that was inspired by islamic religious motifs and architectural styles... making the WTC 2 minarets of kaaba for example</p>

<p>Now they have a giant metal oculus  (ONE EYE) that opens on 9/11.  How more obvious can one be?</p>

<p>When I was in nyc, I found a flyer for joining the freemasons and it was compass and square but inside was not a &quot;G&quot; but a skull and crossbones.  Like <a href="http://www.masonicexchange.com/assets/images/tshirt-design-detail.jpg">this</a></p>

<p>My point in all these disjointed facts is that there are symbols all around you.</p>

<p>Now unless the elite are playing some kind of LARP (live action role playing game) through symbols planted at strategic places, within music, within architecture going back centuries, within art going back millenia, then they are up to something else!</p>
