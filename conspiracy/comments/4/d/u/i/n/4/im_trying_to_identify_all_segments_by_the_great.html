       I've hear of it but haven't watched it.  Now I will for sure!  Thank you.  And I've read JFK and the Unspeakable twice.  Yeah it's excellent.  And it's part of a series.  Douglass is writing on MLK/Malcolm X now.

       Oh, I should also mention that Evidence is about 10 hours long.  The first couple of hours are about JFK, it goes on into RFK, MLK MK Ultra... etc...  I still haven't seen it all.  It's an emotional roller-coaster.

       It's not something you can step away from.  Since it isn't narrated, you have to watch and listen at the same time to get the full effect.  I'm often one to start a video, but mostly listen instead of sit at the computer.  You can't do that with Evidence.  It's a gem.  I dug up the person who made it, that is an interesting story as well.

       Douglass also has at least a few readings of portions of the book on youtube.  I'd heard about the new book.  I think somewhere in his videos he said once that JFK and the Unspeakble was originally going to be a book that included all three murders, JFK, MLK and Malcolm X, but as he wrote the topic was too broad.  He's such an amazing author.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS, you really do want to see Evidence of Revision.  It was a labor of love, and is an amazing piece of work.  I'm saddened more people don't know about it.

       He is.  He's a bit too repetitive in JFK and the Unspeakable, but it's great.  I'm really looking forward to his MLK/Malcolm X book.  Malcolm X in particular is another government assassination that deserves much more attention.  I like this article of his a lot:

       I really need to study Malcolm X.

       In one of his readings, Douglass reads the portion about JFK trying to save himself and his fellow soldiers in VN, the part about his swimming at night, and the currents taking him far from land... it was a masterpiece of writing.  The portion about JFKs daughter saying the poem... oh my god.

       Yeah I need to read this book.  Thanks for the tip about a free download.  I wonder why the Israel angle is ignored even by very thorough books like "JFK and the Unspeakable."  Is it beyond unspeakable?

       Not familiar with his stuff about JFK, but Corbett's videos about OKC are phenomenal. One of the best alt-media channels out there.

       You can use his podcast page under the
       <em>
        Contacts
       </em>
       and send him a message. It may take him a few days to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy his work a great deal. Seems like a solid fellow!

       Yeah he doesn't seem like some kinda fake lefty controlled opposition.  He's probably the real deal.

       He did an AMA and just presented himself  as sincere.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's always well prepared without coming off like he's just regurgitating
       <em>
        spin
       </em>
       . When he's uncertain if he's gotten all of the best information, he requests his audience chime in with links.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't talk over others, yell or
       <em>
        spaz
       </em>
       out...LOL! He's easy to listen to over the course of some very long pod-casts as he's just prepared, very confident in his material.

       Yeah. I asked him about his concerns for food safety, in light of Fukushima and he answered quite honestly. It was a good AMA for everyone involved, I thought!
