       I'm sorry my friend but this, to be blunt, is mental diarrhea. You are espousing something that can't be understood either mathematically or verbally or in combination. There is virtue in trying to explain reality, usually we use a "reductive" form connecting one truth to another, your writing is "expansive" meaning too damn many of your connecting lines and whipsawing with tenuous connections between your disparate subjects. Nowhere do you connect to the title line and show in the least way how every conspiracy has a basis in a parallel world. Many agree that there can be infinite parallel worlds but I don't get how you think we can see across them, the boundaries. How about just posting one of these paragraphs in r/science and see what responses you get. I think they will reject this gobble as fevered imaginings. You need to winnow this down and convince us of at least one of these connections

       I avoided your autism because we are either discussing transdimensional observation OR we are discussing autism? I choose to address the former. I read you link, and though I don't seem sensitive, I've had an entire lifetime of being a square peg pounded into a round hole. It is by reducing an argument to its simplest form, then building connections, that are capable of being communicated, to that argument so we might see the light of truth.

       They have a drug and blood test for Lyme disease. Let's get that done and move on from there. When you feel better, it's ok to think about peering into other dimensions. Some of the worlds most important thinkers probably had autism to some degree. It's a matter of getting those mental connections working on something together within some kind of framework. Goals are good. Make the goal of getting rid of Lyme disease you singular focus. If the test says you don't have it, you have to accept that, and move on.

       Have you ever put together a puzzle? Just talk less around her. Nurturing people hear and try to fix things. If you keep delivering too many things for her to try to fix, she will suffer. Ask her to help you get your blood test and be quiet around her, this is certainly something she can do and she will feel better because it is something she can fix. As I said before, if the test is negative you have to let go and shut up about it, and don't invent another malady.

       Know what was created in 1947?  A certain three letter agency that's been meddling in world affairs ever since.  Just an interesting data point, 1946 (actual year one of the CIA) and 1947 ("official" year one of the CIA) were very interesting years in world history.

       Im just saying that the revelation of your former life seems like an all or nothing sorta thing.   Not a "hmmm MAYBE i am one of the greatest minds of the 20th century" situation.  Otherwise it seems like youre just on an ego trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since you want to carry on the convo let me ask:  At what point are you certain?   Do you have memories that you can share that can be verified?  Do you see visions?  Do you slip into a different accent?  What makes you even consider the possibility of being the reborn soul of the one and only Carl Sagan.  Why not his cousin?  Or neigbor?

       Mapping r3-&gt;r2 means removing the 3rd dimension, which means you can't actually represent a 3d system in 2d, you have to lose information (there is no way to make a 1 to 1 3d-&gt;2d transformation)

       Orthogonality.. might want to read up on it, things can still be essentially perpendicular in 4 dimensions.

       Anyway you make basically no argument here. Imagine if I said 
"911 was a hoax. If matrix A has only the trivial solution for Ax=0, then the column vectors are linearly independent. Autistic people are gifted in some weird way. Stuff about data." That's basically what you did. Random conspiracy concept+a bunch of unrelated linear algebra+a weird conjecture about autistic people.

       Mental health isn't some binary thing where you either are or aren't crazy. If you're not just trolling, you should speak with a psychiatrist or something. As you just replied to me, its a call for help, and they could help you far better than some internet stranger.

       Everything is a spectrum. Recursion reduces arrays and matrices to elements. It reduces matter to strings in string theory. Similar to general colour from many shades of colours in colours. Matter made of strings. And my family doesn't believe in psychology.

       How old are you? If you're old enough to make your own decisions legally, go talk to a psychiatrist anyway, and tell your family to fuck off if they disagree. Otherwise, idk about how everything works in India for laws, so I can't tell you what your options are.

       Just when a new discovery came to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was something in a capacity, sublime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that would help generations to come, in their wit, desire, wisdom and might.
      </p>
      <p>
       That capacity is empathy, my friends, and I say with some zeal and some zest.
      </p>
      <p>
       That it would help you better understand the mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, when combined with skepticism and science, it would help you get better insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explaining boring concepts to unenthusiastic kids, possibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explaining social issues to ignorant people, particularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or trying to understand how a beloved feels, but with a margin for error maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       To lighten the mood, I would like to ask, "I am the Doctor, and would you like a jelly baby?"
      </p>
      <p>
       But would you ignore this basic human capacity?
      </p>
      <p>
       For something as existentially meaningless as statistics, as you may see.
      </p>
      <p>
       We create our own meaning in our lives, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while you check the links in my possibly-erroneous article,
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like you to appreciate the beauty of science,
      </p>
      <p>
       And mathematics and art too, my friends, like a chronicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       And focus on the method, not the result.
      </p>
      <p>
       For both science and art were monumental,
      </p>
      <p>
       To the progress of something called the human civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I dedicate this poem to my beloved, with love.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this is an ode to science, maths, literature, art and skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, note this, fellow enthusiasts, here I come.
      </p>
      <p>
       To save this world from possible self-destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will try as hard as I can, but you mustn't have any prior expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For it is hard to find something as ideal as a permanent solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last part is probably too narcissistic or naive, I guess. Saving the world from its eventual self-destruction is a collective enterprise and needs a lot of people. And, possibly unrelated to whatever I have said earlier or possibly not, it is my opinion that the purpose of this meaningless world is to appreciate the beauty of things and make others appreciate that beauty too.
