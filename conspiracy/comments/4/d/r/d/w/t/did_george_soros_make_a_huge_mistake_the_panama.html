        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It appears that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) is controlling the release of the Panama documents in order to hurt their enemies while letting others know that they have their names and will release them should they need to.</p>

<p>So why did the ICIJ, which is funded by George Soros, include a particular Russian bank&#39;s name, which seems to implicate Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign Chief? I thought Soros was an open supporter of Clinton.</p>

<p>Was this a mistake on the ICIJs part? Perhaps they didn&#39;t know about the link prior to releasing the documents? Or is this just part of the plan?</p>

<p>John Podesta is the campaign chief and his company &quot;The Podesta Group&quot; is linked to one of the Russian banks listed in the leak. </p>

<p>What do you guys think about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know if George Soros is a &quot;good&quot; guy or not. The fact remains that this Consortium is only in existence because of large donations from Soros and the like.

<p>The documents were made available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung beginning in early 2015 by an anonymous source, an unremunerated whistleblower using the pseudonym &quot;John Doe&quot;.[3] The information documented actions going back to the 1970s and eventually totaled 2.6 terabytes of data. Given the scale of the leak, the newspaper enlisted the help of the U.S.-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which is funded by the US government[4], distributed documents for investigation and analysis to some 400 journalists at 107 media organizations in 76 countries.[5] The first news reports based on the papers, and 149 of the documents themselves, were published on April 3, 2016.

<p>I would imagine they are structured in the way that they are due to the large amount of work and reporting that went into them.

<p>Are you implying that the Snowden docs would not have been released had it not been for Omidyar starting First Look? GG had released the first articles about the leaks while he was still at the Guardian. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of Americans in the leak has been suggested to be due to &quot;the ease by which shell companies can be created in the United States [and] that major international banks based in America tend to have offshore accounts in the Caymans, and this leak was from Panama&quot;.</p>

<p>The BBC reported that &quot;many&quot; have questioned why there are not more Americans implicated and suggested that Americans might be using US states, such as Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming where laws ease the creation of shell companies, or other countries such as Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Singapore where English is spoken, a similar legal system and a stable government exists. Recent US laws like the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and others may make tax evasion more difficult for US citizens and more American names could be revealed with further examination.[164]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is for the most part basically what has happened. Before this leak, I had never even heard of Panama being used as a tax shelter. I have always heard of the Cayman Islands and Switzerland. </p>

<p>My sister works for a law firm in FL and they specialize in tax shelters. It&#39;s fairly easy for American to do in one shape or another.</p>
