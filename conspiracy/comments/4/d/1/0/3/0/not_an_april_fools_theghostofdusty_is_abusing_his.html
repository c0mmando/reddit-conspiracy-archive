       You are correct, but it appears it was a multi-faceted psyop.  Lots of fake accounts, from Flytape to Dusty to yellowsnow to 1800gofuckyourself to others, got new leases of deniability &amp; protection.  The corruption is rampant.

       No crap.  Him and Flytape are two of a kind.  There is something really fishy about their behavior.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised to find out it is the same person.

       Yeah right.  Did the user in question make the logo for your "nolibswatch" subreddit?

      <p>
       Is he an old pal of yours?
      </p>
      <p>
       So now that you are a mod here, you can go ahead and ban him... but you won't because you are part of the same weird power hungry and controlling circlejerk that Flytape and he are part of.

       Just substitute the name flytape with the name ghost of dusty in the following comment I made on the April Fools post.  Actually I am going to try and use the strike through feature for the first time.  Wish me luck.

        Not because of the way it will possibly effect you, but because he isn't worth the attention, or time. If that happens,
        <del>
         move on.
        </del>
        Put him on blast like you are doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't give him that power you are giving him. Or the impression that he has any. Because it couldn't be further from the truth.

       <p>
        I can see the slug trails from here in his pants already if you are correct. Do you want to be the source of his orgasmic bliss? Let him jack himself off

        Do you know the amount of under the table work he had to do to get his mod spot?
       </p>
       <p>
        If you do, then you also understand he had two choices, to spit, or swallow.  Hence the reason why he has cyber short man's syndrome.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can't respect a person like that, at least I cant.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't give anyone at reddit or anywhere for that matter that power over you. It's reddit. A bunch of cyber nobody's.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only reason they pull shit like that here is because of short comings IRL. And if they tried it IRL, they would probably get a hot one to the eye. Or at the least going home with a hair line fracture.

       Dusty should be banned from

       It's about banning dusty as a moderator for violating the trust of the user base he poorly moderates.

       I can't answer for them.  The only thing I can do is say what I have to say, and not give a shit what the dumb has to say.

       The day I start worrying about votes, some one banning me here, or caring about what someone says about me here for that matter, is the day I become an ex-redditor.

       If SovereignMan is trustworthy then why is he removing threads &amp; comments about yesterday's fiasco?

      <p>
       For that matter, where are all the other mods?

      <p>
       Ambiguously_Ironic presented a display of apparent integrity in yesterday's fiasco thread.  But now that it was revealed to have been a psyop, where's Ambiguously_Ironic?  Was that "April Fool's" integrity?

       I put smokinbluebear &amp; Orangutan into the "trustworthy" category normally.

       But ALL of the mods have, by their silence, become complicit in a de-facto operation to strengthen the fake power-abuser accounts of Flytape &amp; Dusty.

      <p>
       Even if there were any innocent moderators, their silence has made them complicit.

       Top mod is basically a reddit placeholder.  IIRC he used to mod a lot more but the modding-100+ subs thing has fallen off a little bit as there was some controversy about it a while back.  He is no longer top mod of some of the huge subs hes used to 'mod'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old second mod demodded all the other lower mods some years ago when things were seeming real shady, and illuminatedwax appeared after another 6 month hiatus to restore the mods within like a day...and to remove the offending mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there isn't really any way to 'get shit together', as the only people who will ever be allowed to mod are already in on whatever it is thats fucking this place up (assuming there is some entity/organization attempting to direct conversation here) or are useful idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe there isn't anything nefarious going on and the mods just like flytape so much that they don't care about the nonstop yearslong history of complaints about his shitty modding.

          Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, politics and

           propaganda
          </strong>

          and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.

       What's more likely: JTRIG agents infiltrating an internet forum to discredit someone for

       I think you need to provide more than 2 links to start calling for Mod heads to roll.  I like the idea of having discussions about Mod actions because sometimes they are inappropriate and need to be discussed more openly...and civilly too.

       BTW I think GhostofDusty nuked a comment of mine and I don't get too many nuked despite my poor attitude.

       So you call for a Mod to be canned, don't provide much evidence, then claim you're just getting the 'ball rolling' and I should begin digging around to find evidence myself and stop being an armchair QB.

      <p>
       Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Your thread says a mod 'is Abusing his Mederation Powers to Silence those who Disagree with Him!!!'. I open the thread and read what you present as proof of your statement. I see very little and some other anecdotal statements agreeing with little evidence.

       I take issue with the group of people who are always attacking the mod team without any real evidence. Mostly because I end up dedicating a portion of my time investigating these matters only to find that the OP is usually responsible for their content being removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been in this sub for a long while and these are the typical answers :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         OP is an asshole and breaking rules/ Takes moderation actions as a personal attack without acknowledging their initial offense
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         OP is trolling the sub in order to pander to the crowd
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         OP is intentionally attacking a mod in order to create a "power vacuum" in the mod team
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So please excuse me for doubting your accusations. But I'm not going to waste my time on this one.

       I'm sorry a few moderators dedicated their time and resources creating something no one liked?
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize this, right? Would you have tried to create a podcast for a bunch of strangers on the internet? Yeah, they failed miserably and it was ridiculed by many.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think their intent was noble. I don't they they intentionally made the video to be ridiculed or to make the rest of us look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they just wanted it to be a surprise so they kept it to themselves. That resulted in making some poor decisions that more seasoned mods might have been able to avoid. Hell, we could possibly even have an official podcast right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's just too many Negative Nancys in here. That little project could have grown in to an awesome collaboration resulting in a quality podcast that could have delivered information to millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we have people using it as evidence of mod power abuse.

       That was one of the biggest complaints as I recall though,  that no collaboration or even any notice was given to anyone before it was done.  Had there have been a stickied post about it beforehand,  asking for ideas or help,  or allowed other users who wanted to contribute,  it would have gotten an entirely different response.

       As I recall,  FlyTape did go on a major power trip and banned several long time users of the sub for calling him out on his shenanigans.  I'm also pretty sure he got removed from his mod position for this abuse of his power as a mod.  This is definitely a perfect example of mod abuse actually.

      <p>
       Was it a power trip or was it a majority of users attacking a mod for something they found offensive? Maybe, there was an over reaction by the community that resulted in a cult of individuals dedicated to attacking that mod?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you imagine being a mod here? It's gotta be awful! Every time you try to do your job you have to have enough forethought to avoid some catastrophic drama circle jerk.

       I was there dude. The majority of people who were banned were breaking rules and being dicks.

       But like in every drama circle jerk there's assholes who bait mods into action and take snapshots of their handy work. Then they post their bullshit as evidence of mod corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they create self posts where the lot of them manufacture consent and post their prized snapshots. Then they furiously masturbate over their "successful" posts.

       I think you need to go back and revisit that thread and the reasons why people got banned.  If they were legitimate bans,  then why was FT removed from his mod position?  Please,  I think you might want to go back and review the thread.  There was no reasons for the bans, none.

       This is the internet.  This is reddit.  This forum discusses conspiracies.  The opinions shared here are highly controversial.  Defending rule 10 is hypocritical and goes against the spirit of the 1st amendment.

       Lol. You don't need rule 10 to remove insults from SRD/SRS trolls.

       Rule 10 can be arbitrarily applied to silence dissidents.  Me saying this could literally be a violation of rule 10.

       Well I've never seen it happen so I think that your concerns are unwarranted. I regularly checked the mod-log at github before I was a mod here too.

       The only bullshittery that I've ever seen here was from two ex-mods in separate incidents. donbueno and solidwhetstone.

       His story is that his brother was interested in conspiracy theories and government corruption and that is what influenced him to volunteer to mod here. He made
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
       (since taken over and vandalized by the conspiratard goons) and tried to bring the communities together. He modded me and Flytape and Canadian_POG and someone else I can't recall right now. After I was modded the hate-focued users there freaked right out and started screaming bloody murder so he de-modded me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically he wasn't especially concerned with this sub, more interested in meta-drama and playing diplomat.

       Yeah right.  Did the user in question make the logo for your "nolibswatch" subreddit?

       So now that you are a mod here, you can go ahead and ban him... but you won't because you are part of the same weird power hungry and controlling circlejerk that Flytape and he are part of.

       You are correct, but it appears it was a multi-faceted psyop.  Lots of fake accounts, from Flytape to Dusty to yellowsnow to 1800gofuckyourself to others, got new leases of deniability &amp; protection.  The corruption is rampant.

       If SovereignMan is trustworthy then why is he removing threads &amp; comments about yesterday's fiasco?
      </p>
      <p>
       For that matter, where are all the other mods?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ambiguously_Ironic presented a display of apparent integrity in yesterday's fiasco thread.  But now that it was revealed to have been a psyop, where's Ambiguously_Ironic?  Was that "April Fool's" integrity?
      </p>
      <p>
       I put smokinbluebear &amp; Orangutan into the "trustworthy" category normally.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ALL of the mods have, by their silence, become complicit in a de-facto operation to strengthen the fake power-abuser accounts of Flytape &amp; Dusty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there were any innocent moderators, their silence has made them complicit.
