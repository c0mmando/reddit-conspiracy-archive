Saying something along the lones: &quot;So what are we going to do about this, if its clear truth isnt being told, facts are not disclosed etc. Some tyranny is playing the populace with information and not letting the people jnow the truth because it is damaging. To the few of the higher ups, or maybe to the larger part of the governance. </p>

<p>I got a reply that is has in fact been disproven all these &quot; theories&#39;, offical documents, reports etc. None of which I have known to be the whole truth. Seems to me since the media is controlled, and owned by a handfull of corps, its not that hard to silence informarion in a nation where propaganda is legal, and applied on constant basis. </p>

<p>What I got was some stock standard official story, &#39;numbers&#39; of offical statements etc and downvotes. </p>

<p>Do thermonuclear demolition devices go &quot;boom boom boom boom boom?&quot; There&#39;s a ton of disinfo out there about 9/11, explicitly created to discredit any and all investigation into the matter. </p>

<p>I could care less if the government was nuking me vs burning, drowning, poisoning, or using conventional explosives. I fail to see the difference. The key point is the willingness to kill American citizens for their own goals, which appears completely undeniable. </p>

<p>Arguing over the exact how of the attack is less significant, imo, than discerning who the who of the attack. It is a big conspiracy, even for those who aren&#39;t in on it. So many hypnominions.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also engaging in a form of rhetoric where you dismiss something people say by grouping it with something well beyond what the original person said. Nobody referenced alien lizards, and I&#39;d imagine almost nobody believes alien lizards had anything to do with 9/11. It&#39;s a discrediting technique.

<p>If what Dr. Wood is saying were nonsense, why waste the time engaged in character assassination, name calling, and debunking?</p>

<p>Because it would leave no time left to discuss evidence – that is, the evidence Dr. Wood presents.</p>

<p>See how easy a cover-up works! ;-) ♥</p>

<p>Dr. Judy Wood earned a Ph.D. Degree from Virginia Tech and is a former professor of mechanical engineering. She has research expertise in experimental stress analysis, structural mechanics, deformation analysis, materials characterization and materials engineering science. Her research has involved testing materials, including complex-material systems, in the area of photomechanics, or the use of optical and image-analysis methods to determine physical properties of materials and measure how materials respond to forces placed on them. Her area of expertise involves interferometry.</p>

<p>She taught graduate and undergraduate engineering classes and has authored or co-authored over 60 peer-reviewed papers in her areas of expertise. In the time since 9/11/01, she has applied her expertise in materials science, image analysis and interferometry, to a forensic study of over 40,000 images, hundreds of video clips and a large volume of witness testimony pertaining to the destruction of the WTC complex. Dr. Wood has conducted a comprehensive forensic investigation of what physically happened to the World Trade Center site on 9/11. And, based on her analysis of the evidence she gathered, in 2007, she filed a federal qui tam case for science fraud against the contractors who contributed to the official NIST report about the destruction of the WTC. This case was filed in the US Supreme Court in Dec 2009. To this day, Dr. Wood&#39;s investigation is the only comprehensive forensic investigation in the public domain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Richard Gage is NOT a qualified forensic scientist. Dr. Judy Wood IS a qualified forensic scientist. AE911Truth is calling for a new investigation. This implies an admission that they are NOT qualified to conduct such an investigation of what happened. Otherwise, why are they calling for a new investigation instead of conducting one themselves -- unless the intention is to knowingly distract its members and others away from the new investigation that has already been conducted?  AE911Truth wants a new investigation?  They already have one. It&#39;s contained in a book called &quot;WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?&quot;  Why is AE911Truth suppressing it? AE911Truth cannot lobby Congress. They are a 501( c )3 and are prohibited from lobbying Congress. Why didn&#39;t AE911Truth submit their so-called &quot;thermite evidence&quot; to  NIST? - Oh, that&#39;s right. It&#39;s a federal crime to defraud the government. Why hasn&#39;t AE911Truth filed a Federal qui tam case?  Because they haven&#39;t blown the whistle on anything and they have no evidence and it is past the statute of limitation. So, why didn&#39;t they support Dr. Wood&#39;s Federal qui tam case that was filed instead of banning members who mentioned it? * -- I guess they really didn&#39;t want such a case to go forward. So they want &quot;respect and compassion for all people&quot; except for those named &quot;Dr. Judy Wood.&quot; </p>

<p>AE911truth first opened their website about 3.5 weeks AFTER Dr. Wood submitted her Request for Corrections (RFC) to NIST. She was the first to submit an RFC that blew the whistle on the contractors for the NIST report. Can you say &quot;damage control&quot; ? Then she filed a federal qui tam case that could have blown this whole case wide open, including putting people under oath - if there were enough supporters. Guess what? It became a policy in AE911Truth to ban those who discussed the work of Dr. Wood in an honest manor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is irrational to completely rule out nuclear devices. Most of us, upon hearing the term &quot;nuclear detonation&quot; imagine mushroom clouds and and waves of force flattening blocks of structures.</p>

<p>Yet there are many factors to consider when thinking about a nuclear device: a much smaller size, fusion vs. fusion, using radiative isotopes which have been developed but never made public exhibiting different behaviors, and, as Dimitri brings up, having this device deep below the building.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Dimitri is correct, but I do know that there are a lot of very strange events reported that day that do not make sense with conventional explosives, or thermite alone (whether nano-thermite, or thermate). Just off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>The molten metal which remained at ground zero for months</li>
<li>the witnessing by firefighters of their boots melting</li>
<li>the witnessing of the huge 50 ton hydraulic press <em>in the basement</em> of one of the towers being vaporized.</li>
<li>the reports of radios, cell phones, and other electronic devices belonging to people who were very close to the towers <em>no longer working</em> after these initial explosions (hallmark effect of an EMP)</li>
<li>the evidence of all of the cars parked around WTC I and II, that had very unusual scorching anomalies: from one side windows, tires, and metal melted or were black, while the other side did not show these effects as severely.</li>
<li>the presence of the several inches of fine ash over all of these cars and ground.</li>
<li>the fact that the entire buildings aside from a few steel girders, were essentially pulverized into dust. Thermite, or regular explosives would have shown some steel desks, or other office equipment, human bodies (not referring to the bodies they were searching for that were lost <em>after</em> the sub-basement explosions, but <em>before</em> the buildings came down.</li>
<li>the countless deaths of first responders due to specific and rare forms of cancer, not attributed to things like asbestos fibres.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can&#39;t remember everything, and regretfully, whenever I studied anything on 9/11 over the past 8 years, I never took notes or did any kind of write-up. And there are several people who believe in the nuclear device possibility but do not believe Dmitry&#39;s version. </p>

<p>Lastly, what could be a better idea than to use an explosive material (a nuclear fusion device using an exotic radioactive material), never before seen in public to: (i) befuddle those who would never believe nuclear explosives would be used, yet had never seen the effects of a very unusual nuclear device, and; (ii) a way to eliminate virtually <em>all</em> evidence that might be found in the debris?</p>

<p><del>By the way, I believe Building 7 was razed using conventional explosives and thermite/thermate. But it had largely been removed of all furniture or equipment before 9/11. Even Giuliani&#39;s control center had minimal equipment.</del></p>

<p>Edit: retracted above.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Following are links which should be part of your cache of information. I&#39;m not trying to prove anything, only trying to prevent people from saying &quot;that couldn&#39;t have happened!&quot; outright. </p>

<p>As the literary Sherlock Holmes would say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.<br/>
—Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having just assembled these links, I think the most comprehensive are videos at the bottom (the three part series)...This video dispels the incredulity of using nuclear explosives better than most other sources. [But the other videos and articles are also of value as well.]</p>

<hr/>

<p>First link is to a page on wikispooks (much like reddit undelete, it contains Wikipedia pages that were deleted). This discusses nuclear demolition.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Nuclear_Demolition">https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Nuclear_Demolition</a></p>

<p>A link from a few years ago when the rumour was that Putin was going to release evidence that 9/11 was a black-op. Three respected US journalists met with Russian officials, quit their jobs with large news outlets, and formed a new company. Within 2 weeks they were all dead (this was I believe late 2013-early 2014). But this article touches upon what was expected to be released.</p>

<p>Ok, while looking for information, I came across this 3 part video series. It doesn&#39;t have extremely high production values, but the narrator/creator is sharp, and very thorough, and I did not catch any cheats (leaps in logic). My only criticism is that he could have used a 3rd party editor to trim this a bit. However, even the information not directly relevant to nuclear explosives being used is relevant, such as the history of thermite and the evolution of building demolition. There is a lot of great information in it, and it&#39;s very watchable if you have 135 minutes to watch it (it&#39;s 3 videos, each about 45 minutes). But I <em>highly</em> recommend watching this as it is meticulously researched. I&#39;m taking a risk in linking them because I&#39;m only in the middle of part II, yet I&#39;m confident he won&#39;t go off the rails into reptilians or other nutty stuff.</p>

<p>Both of those statements are false.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of &quot;nukes&quot; used on 9/11. None.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a much more difficult time accepting theories involving &quot;energy beams&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, when people stopped paying attention to Judith Woods&#39; &quot;energy beams&quot; disinformation, they switched to &quot;nukes&quot; because at least nuclear technology actually exists. Both both &quot;theories&quot; are wrong and have zero evidence to support them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thermite was actually found in the debris.</p>

<p>So, we have a theory that explains what happens, and have actual physical evidence backing up that theory.</p>

<p>Then, we have thousands of pages of science fiction disinformation, constantly spammed around the internet, with no evidence behind it, about &quot;energy beams&quot; and &quot;mini-nukes.&quot;</p>

<p>I think any reasonable person can figure out exactly what the deal is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thermite is used in every demolition! I&#39;m not debating that thermite (or nano-thermite or thermate) was not used...It was used. But in demolishing a building you need to cut structural steel supports (using thermite), and then use explosives to provide the force to bring down the structure now that it&#39;s in its crippled state (but this happens almost simultaneously... First thermite cuts the steel bearing supports, then explosives cause the collapse, all timed very precisely.)</p>

<p>Thermite does liquify metal! The primary benefit of thermite is it&#39;s exothermic reaction that generates a significant amount of heat!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I miss your point. I simply said I didn&#39;t believe in wood&#39;s theories. Perhaps because I have never heard of &quot;directed energy beams&quot;... But, if I was to exhibit integrity, I should really say, &quot;Who knows? There could be merit in her theories&quot;. But the reality is that since I have no foundational understanding in fucking &quot;directed energy beams&quot;, I&#39;m not going to even bother. I&#39;d have to accept <em>everything</em> at face value.</p>

<p>But nuclear devices are at least grounded in reality. They exist and have been around since 1945. We use the power they generate to create stream to rotate turbines and provide electricity to millions. It&#39;s the most incredible source of energy we know of. It has come with dangers, yes, but, there has been 55 years of research since 1945, and I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t know 1/7 of what military intelligence knows about creating different types, with different radioactive matter that produces a shorter thermal explosion, and minimal radioactive fallout....I man <em>we don&#39;t know</em>.</p>

<p>So why dismiss something outright when you not only have unexplained data (scorched cars, ash, molten metal at ground zero not cooled until December, 2001), and further know nothing about  current advances in nuclear energy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your first clue (and how/why did you arrive at the conclusion) that Dimitri Khalezov was/is disinformation?</p>

<p>He may be, but you need X-Men mutant powers to know things that aren&#39;t obvious. </p>

<p>Yes, he tells a story that strays from the demolition theories that had been presented up until that point (prior to 2011)...But that is no basis to label him as an agent of disinformation. In fact incorrectly labeling him as a disinformation agent only further inhibits us from discovering the truth.</p>

<p>I realize that a line needz to be drawn somewhere, but nuclear explosives—and the little that you or I know about them (especially whatever the military has been doing with them in the past 30 years)—makes them a viable candidate. </p>

<p>On the other hand, saying a team of contracted aliens took down the twin towers with vibration cannons is a theory we can safely ignore... But this?</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean Dmitry&#39;s entire explanation is worthy of consideration, just the possibility that nuclear explosives were involved. There is no conclusive reason to dismiss them, and further, there is evidence surrounding the twin towers after they fell that cannot be explained using conventional demolition methods: these are contained in first hand reports, film crews shooting footage around the buildings that afternoon showing very unusual damage to cars, and other such information.</p>

<p>Closing your eyes to this possibility borders on superstition. I wholeheartedly agree that it&#39;s immensely difficult to understand and repulsive to us given what we as layman have been told about nuclear weapons. But why not research it thoroughly first? </p>

<p>In a comment below, I have several links to articles and videos (all are unrelated to Dimitri) that make a compelling case...one worthy at least of consideration.</p>

I can understand how eyewitnesses would mistake UA175 for a military plane though. I had no idea that UA ever had a dark grey paint scheme on their airplanes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, there&#39;s no such thing as evidence otherwise bush administration would be in jail.  They&#39;ve destroyed any actual evidence and what remains is a mythology and artifacts that support it, and a majority of functionally retarded citizens that believe this mythology.  Nothing will be done.  EVER.  Just like jfk. Your job is to never forget that they covered it up,  and therefore they were treasonous and corrupt at the highest levels of government.  This gives you every right never trust your government or any of its mountains of lies ever again.</p>

<p>I noticed that. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6ZtXt6W90">president</a> has a conflicting video out there too. Funnily enough it exposes him as being a key advisor in the disposal of the evidence. </p>

<p>Do thermonuclear demolition devices go &quot;boom boom boom boom boom?&quot; There&#39;s a ton of disinfo out there about 9/11, explicitly created to discredit any and all investigation into the matter. </p>

<p>I could care less if the government was nuking me vs burning, drowning, poisoning, or using conventional explosives. I fail to see the difference. The key point is the willingness to kill American citizens for their own goals, which appears completely undeniable. </p>

<p>Arguing over the exact how of the attack is less significant, imo, than discerning who the who of the attack. It is a big conspiracy, even for those who aren&#39;t in on it. So many hypnominions.</p>
