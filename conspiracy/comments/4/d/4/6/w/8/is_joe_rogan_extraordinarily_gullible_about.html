    <div class="md"><p>Joe is liberation by his own admission (as of 2015). He has also stated he loves police, love drugs, he&#39;s a diverse guy. Stop obsessing about it, just like you he has his own diverse opinions. </p>

<p>But unlike you if you actually watch a lot of his podcast you will see he is open minded just as much as he is resistant to ideas. But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve watched a few 12 minute videos showing him speaking out of context. </p>

<p>You guys are reaching pretty bad here. Because his ideas on 9/11 don&#39;t fit yours and he is in the UFC = illuminati. Do you not know he is trained in MMA and a comedian so..wow maybe he could be a host. He likes talking that&#39;s why he&#39;s on the UFC, on stage, and on his podcast. Stfu.</p>

<p>You call Joe a disinfo agent when you are. Telling people that substances that can free their minds and alter their consciousness will harm them. You&#39;re a fucking shill.</p>

<p>Are you unaware of the patents on cannabis?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need anything external to free your mind. It is already free, yet you fail to see that. You think I am shilling by telling you that?</p>
