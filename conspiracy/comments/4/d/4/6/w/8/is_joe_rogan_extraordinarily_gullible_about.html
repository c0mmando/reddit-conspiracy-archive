       Joe Rogan pretends to be your best bud then deliberately misleads you on key points -- 9/11 is another big one. He's a pied piper for young men who like to think of themselves as skeptics.

       The whole UFC is a bit of a weird phenomena. I get the martial arts element and respect that, but for such a junior organisation, it just jumped into bed with marketing so quickly. Perfect recruiting medium for cannon fodder.

       Joe is liberation by his own admission (as of 2015). He has also stated he loves police, love drugs, he's a diverse guy. Stop obsessing about it, just like you he has his own diverse opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But unlike you if you actually watch a lot of his podcast you will see he is open minded just as much as he is resistant to ideas. But I'm sure you've watched a few 12 minute videos showing him speaking out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys are reaching pretty bad here. Because his ideas on 9/11 don't fit yours and he is in the UFC = illuminati. Do you not know he is trained in MMA and a comedian so..wow maybe he could be a host. He likes talking that's why he's on the UFC, on stage, and on his podcast. Stfu.

       No. Joe Rogan is 'them'. He is a well paid celebrity with a long career in entertainment. He is NOT looking to bite the hand that feeds/owns him.
      </p>

       He does what he is told, and avoids anything that will end in his loss of position, income, or life.... like they all do.

       You are injesting perhaps the most genetically modified plant there is, as well as not only altering brain chemistry with DMT, but also taking a spiritual 'short cut' if you will, by attempting to bypass the development and processes in place for what an artificial Dmt attempts to emulate from the naturally available one, that can and does happen without external inputs, when the time and soul development stage is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not think those behind the promotion of these substances know this, then perhaps one day you will.

      <p>
       Also regarding pot- You avoid gmos foods and non organic foods, right? Then why in the world would you smoke them?!  If you do eat gmos and pesticided foods, then I don't expect any of this to matter to you anyway.

       you really do not understand what you are putting into your body. Where do you think those constantly 'evolving'all new 'strains' come from, nature? How OBVIOUS can it be when cross breeding and genetic modification are the hallmarks of cannabis cultivation and trait expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you unaware of the patents on cannabis?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need anything external to free your mind. It is already free, yet you fail to see that. You think I am shilling by telling you that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go read my posting history before calling me a shill. I would jump at the chance to be paid for the type of positions I hold.

       Not superior at all,we are a the same. There is nothing g false e in what I am telling you, just a lack of prerequisite knowledge and experience to grasp the truth of it. It is not the fault of the calculus student that he does not understand quantum entanglement, rather it is the lack of further study, experience, and understanding.

       You are injesting perhaps the most genetically modified plant there is, as well as not only altering brain chemistry with DMT, but also taking a spiritual 'short cut' if you will, by attempting to bypass the development and processes in place for what an artificial Dmt attempts to emulate from the naturally available one, that can and does happen without external inputs, when the time and soul development stage is right.

       If you do not think those behind the promotion of these substances know this, then perhaps one day you will.

       Also regarding pot- You avoid gmos foods and non organic foods, right? Then why in the world would you smoke them?!  If you do eat gmos and pesticided foods, then I don't expect any of this to matter to you anyway.
