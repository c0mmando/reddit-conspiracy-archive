        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I subscribe to the idea that not releasing all the information publicly all at once is an operation, not a leak. I&#39;ve been feeling wrong about this &#39;leak&#39; at the core since I heard about it. And all the others like it. It&#39;s an intentional limited hang out.</p>

<p>As for what this &#39;leak&#39; is meant to distract us from. It could be anything, I don&#39;t think that matters as much at what it&#39;s supposed to do.</p>

<p>First some perspective. Unless someone uses these documents to make a &#39;hit-list&#39; to hold these people accountable, and some how effectively enforce laws or ethics upon them, it doesn&#39;t really matter. We knew all this already. All we some have are names now. So what? They&#39;ll only be brought to justice if the state makes it so.</p>

<p>This leak is meant to splinter the greater conspiracy theory community. Anyone who has recently &#39;opened their eyes&#39; may fall victim to this misdirection. It&#39;s an election year for the US so there are many new people who have been doing some political-soul-searching and have decided to open their eyes for the first time, or maybe just squint.</p>

<p>If the people seek vengeance on their own, via violence in the places mentioned in the leaks, they are doing Americas work for them. All the countries in this &#39;leak&#39; are regions the US is not strategically allied with. With the obvious exception of Panama. Panama may be the primary target for these leaks to backlash on. The information is meant to destabilize any and all potential enemies.</p>

<p>This is a good move to distract from something much larger.</p>

<p><strong>Governments always go grand. The &#39;Panama Papers&#39; are the grandest &#39;leak&#39; in history. Real truth only comes as the smallest morsels.</strong></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more important to focus on the things absent from the leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thing is ridiculous. Propaganda 101. Orchestrated by global elites, censored/redacted/filtered, and fed to the media in chunks. Completely controlled release of information? You got it.</p>

<p>A leak implies only <em>some</em> of the water got in or out...the rest was withheld or maintained.</p>

<p>Propaganda is meant to change your mind about something.</p>

<p>Media will lap it up and craft their stories and sell it to the public.</p>

<p>Another name for global elites? Illuminati. New World Order. Rockefeller and Ford top the list, and they top the list of funders for the Center for Public Integrity who was given this leak to disperse throughout the media.</p>

<p>Well said.  </p>

<p>One of our fine moderators, however, &quot;TheGhostOfDusty&quot; (a.k.a. Flytape, a.k.a. JamesColesPardon, etc.) is calling you a shill over at <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a>:</p>

<p>Title of his post (not linked here):</p>

<p><em>&quot;The sudden resurgence of the long unused term &quot;limited hangout&quot; seems like a JTRIG-style FUD campaign to undermine the credibility and morale of whistle-blowers and investigative journalists.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Because, as we all know, there&#39;s no such thing as a Limited Hangout and there&#39;s no such thing as a fake whistleblower.  Even though these (or <em>this</em>) fine moderator(s) just perped a fake post operation two days ago.</p>

<p>The definition of a Limited Hangout is &quot;the things absent from the leaks&quot; are not revealed in the &quot;Big Leak.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Governments always go grand.  The &#39;Panama Papers&#39; are the grandest &#39;leak&#39; in history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish you had put this in bold font.  Isn&#39;t it amazing how this subreddit lacks (or even <em>refuses</em>) skepticism?  Of all places.</p>

<p>A little curious though, in what context is this person calling me a shill? Link?</p>

<p>Anyone who uses multiple accounts for the same site, mod or not, is probably being shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of people implicated from the u.s. is simple.  There are three states which offer the same services that the company in panama does.  (Do your homework).  That&#39;s why.  And countless others outside the u.s. other than Panama.  It&#39;s a big leakl, yes.  But tiny in terms of the big picture.  This is no conspiracy.  It&#39;s a glimpse into what people with a shitload of money do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure a lot of you are like me and read the news daily and see what I see.  The saturation of this news is unreal, far past the terror attacks or any other big news story lately.  Yes I get that it&#39;s a big story.  But the level of saturation so quickly points to psyop.  The fact that no American or israeli names are on the list confirms it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to make a leap - this is going to be used as argument against crypto currency.</p>
