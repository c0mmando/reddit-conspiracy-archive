        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever visited the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and seen 18 of the top 25 stories dedicated to one subject before. Many of the users who posted links here,  are not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars, some of them, this is their very first post or comment here. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a 4 hour sub, <a href="/r/panamapapers">/r/panamapapers</a> that has over 10k subscribers in 4 hours. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also dominating in the controlled default subs like;  /w/worldnews, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>,  <a href="/r/worldpolitics">/r/worldpolitics</a> to name a few. </p>

<p>These subs are notorious for their censorship of story&#39;s damaging to the ruling class,  so why is this story being allowed to go to the top of these subs? </p>

<p>Someone really wants as many eyes as possible to see this story,  and there&#39;s definitely a concerted effort here on Reddit,  Twitter,  and now even Facebook to ensure the story and the &quot;leaks&quot; spread to as many people&#39;s eyes as possible. </p>

<p>Who benefits from this, and why such a push  of the story down our throats? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a very informative article,  thanks for sharing that.  My question is though,  what&#39;s the end game here?  It seems like a huge amount of effort is being thrown behind this, for what?  Just exposing some crooked politicians and oligarchs who aren&#39;t aligned with the West?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no idea. probably something along the usual lines. TPTB knew that the information was going to be leaked eventually. they knew that people are currently clamoring for exposure of corruption, and that trying to cover the leak completely would lead to civil unrest. selectively leaking certain names (putin, gunnlaugsson xi jinping, Assad, read: enemies of globalists) as a red herring to distract and satiate the public</p>

<p>In the years I have been coming here, out of all the different shit that has happened around the world, I have never seen anything like this. It feels like overkill, just a little too much trying too hard.</p>

<p>That&#39;s EXACTLY how I feel also.  Even during the Boston Marathon Bombings,  Paris attacks,  San Bernardino, there has never been this type of saturation on a single sorry here,  ever. </p>

<p>Why are they trying to push this so hard though?  What is their end game,  and what is this leading up to I wonder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of two things. One: it is more world news then secret news, but because of a western media blackout a lot of redditors think to post the story here as it pertains to the global conspiracy of the elite, and are using it to garner some quick karma.</p>

<p>Two: The scramble from the elite was to push a certain narrative first to get more people riled up (IE: PUTIN IS BAD!), flood alt news sites with this half truth for a couple days, post it everywhere until the people who would get upset become numb because they&#39;ve  read the same story 16 times, then release the second half of the story including names of American and Israeli companies and individuals once it has essentially become &quot;old news&quot;.</p>

<p>Do i agree with how we are manipulated? No way, but you do have to find a certain beauty in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was aware that the ICIJ was behind this AND that the ICIJ has in the past been very influential, but the coordinated reporting here takes this to another agenda. One thing i noticed is that everyone is saying the same phrase &quot;the wealthy and the powerful&quot;, I&#39;m not sure why or how it works, i.e. who came up with that as the slogan for this story and how they get everybody to read from the same lines.. Whoever they are they are very powerful.</p>

<p>I was not aware until reading the Craig Murray article that the funders of ICIJ are the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Family Fund, Open Society Foundation (Soros) etc.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that in my opinion the agenda of the ICIJ is to remove national sovereignty. They were set up to investigate tax havens as a way to mobilise the political left bloc against the national sovereignty and independence of these various islands and small nations around the world, at least on taxation. Common Internationalist Globalists set standards on tax are surely to come out of this.</p>

<p>One omission which really concerns me is the word criminal. This word is not being used. Most of the people who are using these offshore money laundering facilities are criminals. The media are trying to imply being rich and being powerful is a crime and reprints money laundering. In fact the two are very far apart.</p>

<p>I know a lot about money laundering and i know for a fact the television media couldn&#39;t give a rats ass about it as a subject. If the UK media were interested they would scrutinise the people buying our football clubs a lot more than they ever do, for example.</p>

<p>I just feel that if our media want to get upset about something they should get upset at real criminals, not wage war on the concept of wealth.</p>
