       I know this sounds like a very simplistic question and you can probably answer this question in a 300 page essay but I've been musing for a long time on whether enough people will wake up and smell the coffee before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that does give me hope is the campaigns run by both Sanders + Ron Paul. Do I agree with both candidates on everything? No. But one thing that they both have in common is exposing the corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a commonly held notion that the older people are the ones that are more likely to vote and so when they die and the current crop of millenials become the main voting faction, do you guys think we will ever have an anti-establishment figure in the house?
      </p>
      <p>
       What gives me hope and optimism is that people are starting to realise that the President of the USA can only do so much. The crazy evangelicals are having their power reduced and the people who will become the main voting faction will realise that it all starts and ends with Congress/Senate. I mean even on Reddit, in the GrassRoots subreddit, they are trying to get people in Congress/Senate with no corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, how sad it is when I don't even value the person's policies but I first consider whether or not they are establishment or anti-establishment figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what I am proposing sounds insane and the NWO have a very tight grip on the throats of America but with Ron Paul's campaign and now Bernie's (who I dislike regarding in his solutions but at least he identifies the same problems that I do), I'm starting to think a bit more positively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologise for the Political stuff but I don't really think I could talk about such a topic elsewhere without it being deleted.

       Most people on this sub are but I want to live in a free SOCIETY where I can do what ever I want without fear.

       At the moment, I can think freely but I can't do anything to stop the Government spying on me, nor can I do anything to stop the illegal wars occurring and the drone bombings in Yemen and Pakistan/Afghanistan.

       That's true. Internal happiness is the greatest gift.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think even if we are selfish and just aim to have internal happiness, we can get so much more from a state that wants to do the best for its citizens rather than doing whatever the deep pockets of the Rothschilds dictate us to do.

       No but they help keep things more regulated and less crazy until the inevitable uprising by the people. I kinda like it that way honestly. Less power around the board more organized so when people of power aren't do their job, we as a people don't have to

       This decentralized thing where everybody can point the finger at the next Joe just seems like it gets abused so much in the world. Oh we can't save those people because their government doesn't want us to? Fuck that noise, people should have to abide by government rules no matter how big they get and the government should protect and serve the people it services. If they want power, we have to force our super heroes to be heroes and not villains.

       Not until Wormwood passes again; it is named that for a reason. But then neither will they ever actually get full control, though they will make it seem like they have done so via deception and illusion. And it will carry our generation with it, even the ones hiding deep underground; because, for us, in spite of all our high mindedness, liberty regained will only be a mouthful of ashes in the face of all we will have lost to the destroyer.

       Good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose something like have the ability to do what I wish to do within the realms of the law (following the Constitution) and having a clean and corrupt free society with people in power who are beholden to no-one but the people (IE: they have not been influenced by any donors).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bit flimsy answer though.

       If that is your definition, then no. The best you can do is live remotely in the wilderness and search within. True freedom, is such. It's not about physical freedom, but mental freedom and self awareness/purpose.

       Yes I think it is appropriate to distinguish which type of freedom we are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       In here, I am more talking about physical freedom - Can we get rid of the NWO?
      </p>
      <p>
       But the other freedom, mental freedom, can be attained by anyone who wishes to have it.

       I don't think so. I use the my Redwood Tree analogy quite a bit. You can chop a Red Wood tree down, sure, but with the miles of roots beneath the ground, that tree will eventually regrow. As above, so below. But, that is my belief of this "experience". It's not really the point, imo. It's more of a spiritual/philosophical approach, but, none-the-less, it's true.

       I'm trying hard to disagree with you but ultimately (and sadly), I think you're right. I think the NWO is just too powerful at the moment. I fear that the only way we can defeat them is through a violent revolution and with our rights being stripped away, even that looks less and less likely.

       I just come at it from a historical perspective. The elites have always been ruling. They are not going anywhere. Wish we could have a utopia, but I'm not sure that is the point of all this. Like I said, it's more spiritual. I'm in the woods, and ponder life. I see the stars and the wildlife. I look inwards, to me that is freedom. I'm so far away from "civilization" that TPTB don't really matter to me. Life matters. I guess that was kind of my point? If you want freedom, move away from it all. It's not 100%, but it's the start to
       <em>
        your journey
       </em>
       . Peace and love, friend.

       Stop worrying about everyone else. Do you know Jesus Christ? Have you accepted him as your Lord and savior?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no freedom without Jesus Christ. I pray and hope that someday you and many others understand this if you do not already.

       May the heavenly Father bless you and lead you to the truth and peace.

       He will and can. No need to thank me. If I can plant a seed that God can use to draw someone. Thats reward enough for me.

       IF you seek the truth and you are hungry, get you a copy of the "King James Version".  And read it diligently all the way through like it was the newest science fiction drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is merely a book....yes.................but what is inside....is the WORD of God. And that knowledge leads to salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The red pill............the magic sunglasses.........
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ made a promise........And in the KJV you see it THREE times...........word for word..........digital like accuracy (because HE is the truth)
      </p>
      <p>
       Mathew 24:35 "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark 13:31 "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
      </p>
      <p>
       Luke 21:33 "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
      </p>
      <p>
       That points to there being ONE Bible that never changes. You could make the KJV a PDF file and put it on a thumb drive. But those things are merely containers..........you can destroy the containers and what happens? If its digital data and you dont have a back up its gone forever. But even if a Bible was destroyed. That does not destroy God or the truth. See what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard many people call the King James the "final authority" in this world. Its like an equalizer. So if someone appears and says "God told me to do this or that"......you have the WORD that may conflict with them. It keeps all of us equal and under Christ. And something I have found when studying those other Bible versions........they often connect dots and add things that can cause confusion and drama. The KJV itself does not cause drama, people do that with their opinion.  The Bible tells you to NOT speak evil of no man and give offense to none.
