<p>..</p>

<p>If you look @ the voting records, Hillary either:</p>

<p>A) votes in line with McConnell</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>B) skips the vote (god forbid she take a stance on a controversial issue)</p>

<p>Even in cases where she does something good (like co-sponsor the Fair Pay Act of 2009) you find out that the other co-sponsor was fucking Bernie.</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s record is anti LGBT, pro Iraq, and a lot of skipped votes on important issues.</p>

<p>Bernie&#39;s record is pro LGBT, anti Iraq, and consistently votes for the right thing, like rebuilding infrastructure, protecting the environment, and helping our students and veterans.</p>

<p>He also voted against &quot;The Wall.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. A puppet that has been controlled for 24 years as a member of congress. </p>

<p>He was planted and instructed to pretended to care about the interests of the American people. In order to do that, he had to vote against his marionettists&#39; interests for so long.</p>

<p>Now on this 25th year of service to the federal government, they are ready to use this tool to push the fiction that is Global Warming upon our youth. He is also being instructed to call the masses to hold the global elite, along with US allies such as Saudi Arabia, accountable for their actions against humanity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been the longest con ever. And everyone is falling for it! Don&#39;t you sheep know that the elite are playing you? They want you to believe that a guy this genuine exists and that voting still matters. Never mind the fools who protest in Arizona over vote suppression or the ones that spent their day protesting CNN -- It&#39;s all sham to keep people engaged in this faux democracy.</p>

<p>Wake up sheeple! Stop caring about the government and realize it&#39;s fake! Stop voting! Send the right message that we will not be ruled by a system that should not exist! Maybe we&#39;ll still pay all the taxes and follow their laws - and maybe the political process will continue without us, but the point is that we can send a message by not doing anything! <sup>/s</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how anyone can call Bernie a puppet. Every step of his career has been against what would be considered career politician. He&#39;s always stood up for what he thinks is right. He&#39;s probably the poorest member of Congress. He is owned by no one. Hillary on the other hand. I don&#39;t understand how Bernie is getting pulled into this. </p>

<p>You argue socialism, but don&#39;t seem to grasp what that means. You guys are clearly fine with a lot of socialism. Where do you draw the line? Is it cops,  firefighters, roads and schools(grade and high school)? </p>
