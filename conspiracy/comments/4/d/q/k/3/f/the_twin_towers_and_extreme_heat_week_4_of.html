    <div class="md"><p>Did you mean to say <em>Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams?</em> </p>

<p><strong>So why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?</strong></p>

<p>NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.</p>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html">In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled “Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,” which was intended to aid the “identification of WTC dust components.” Among the components, it reported, were “metal or metal oxides” (which could not be distinguished by the USGS’s methods). “The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,” the report said, “are Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles</a></p></li>

<p>The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400ºF to more than 2,800ºF</p>

<p><strong>Testimonial Evidence</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Firefighters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQyIN6OTMyY">New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?2062-Recovery-worker-reflects-on-months-spent-at-Ground-Zero&amp;amp;p=2948">Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_G21B2qiQM">New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”</a></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Professionals:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmHqES_lto&amp;amp;t=40s">Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060909104247/http://www.seau.org/SEAUNews-2001-10.pdf">Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/Publications/Special/Welch.htm">In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130730103131/http://911encyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/Publication:20121014014812">Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”</a></li>
<li>Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060818074723/http:/pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nydailynews/87451160.html?did=87451160&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=FT&amp;amp;date=Nov+1,+2001&amp;amp;author=GREG+GITTRICH+DAILY+NEWS+STAFF+WRITER&amp;amp;pub=New+York+Daily+News&amp;amp;desc=FIRE+MAY+SMOLDER+FOR+MONTHS">Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo">OSHA respond to the underground fires and potential steam explosions</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2002/09/09/handheld-app-eased-recovery-tasks.aspx">Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2002/k911.html">Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”</a></li>
<li>Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed “everything from molten steel beams to human remains</li>

<hr/>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.</p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible</p>
