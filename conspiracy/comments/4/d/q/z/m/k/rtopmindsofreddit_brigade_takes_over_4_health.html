       r/topmindsofreddit is a pro-brigading sub. They downvote my comments, putting me at a -100 karma, which then prevents me from spreading my ideas and wisdom more efficiently. They have UTTERLY DESTROYED all the hard work I have put into reddit, and therefore my fanbase suffers as a result. Any subreddit that seeks to laugh at ideas is a pro-bullying subreddit, and therefore should be taken down like how fatpeoplehate was taken down. They are probably reading this post this very second, with intent to find my comment in this thread, go through my post history, and then encourage even more downvoting of my answers. Given that a lot of reddit mods are NSA shills, I am probably on a government watchlist by now, only because I dare challenge the leftist cultural narrative of transgenderism being natural and not the result of a systemic feminist estrogen poisoning campaign (my existence, as an ex-trans, seems to BLOW THEIR MINDS), and how reptilians are actually real (and how I'm not a schizophrenic or paranoid, like how so many of them are insistent upon me being).

       Well--after that one post by that one admin after the whole PlanetSide2 500 word essay debacle, I was under the impression that it was removed as an official violation of rules.
       <br/>
       I appealed to get off shadowban after that admin's post, and the friendly admin who unbanned me essentially said to 'not vote brigade again--or else.' Well I actually did vote brigade (though it was only an eensy bit, and I do play PS2 and visit the sub on my own. Look at me making excuses :D ), but I was under the impression that it was essentially fine to now. And now that I know there are people
       <em>
        hired
       </em>
       to vote brigade, hoo boy?
       <br/>
       I don't know, It's just...
       <br/>
       They'll continue like they always have: weaponize it when they can against the dissenters / certain unapproved opinion holders, go easy on the enforcers etc.

       Apple, google, Verizon, Microsoft, Samsung, all the other titans rely on wi fi being harmless. If info comes out that they've been dosing us with radiation which can cause disruptions to microDNA and may be causing depression through loss of melatonin's protective effects, they stand to lose trillions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing the scope of the roll out of those microwave towers around te place makes me think a grid of microwave radiation could really be holding us back from our true potential.

       5htp is converted to serotonin which is converted to melatonin which is converted to dmt. Some nice fluoride in your water and you can really keep the population asleep.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A cloudbuster (or cloud buster) is a pseudoscientific device designed by Austrian psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, which Reich said
        <strong>
         could produce rain by manipulating
        </strong>
        what he called "orgone energy" present in
        <strong>
         the atmosphere
        </strong>
        .
       </p>

      <p>
       Sound familiar? The City of Los Angeles has about 10 rainmaking devices aka cloud seeding devices:

      <p>
       Looks pretty similar to Reich's don't they!
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of cloudbusters and orgone energy...I'm seeing some major parallels to Cloud Strife, his Buster Sword, the Lifestream, and energy corporation Shinra from the game Final Fantasy VII. Damn interesting.

       Looks like great homework you've done.  I hope you passed it on to admins. If they act on it great, if not then simply move on. Little point playing with children on the net. If Reddit lets this go on then they lose participants to alternatives.  It's unfortunate this happens but this is life.

       If they are inactive for 2 monthes you can request to take over the sub. It pretty much always works.

       Well spotted, it ran deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I posted about trolls/shills/bot that tried to make repugnant behaviours socially acceptable my post was deleted due to rule 12. They appear on facebook posts by certain pages to inflame people and "break consensus". For instance while on the topic that people were agreeing on the importance of love comments would appear from "posters" that said stuff like "Love does not pay the bills" "Good luck with that when you are broke and starving".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that sort of thing goes on on pornography websites and sex related topics. Comments that advocate and brigade certain behaviours if one has been in 4chan for example you would likely know what I refereed to. In addition some of the content may be contrived by masquerading as "amateur" or "home made" material. Its not very easy for someone to recognise that whilst sexually aroused and to scrutinise the pornographic content. Prostitutes could be hired to perform a "cheating wife with such and such as hubby watches" "amateur" video.
