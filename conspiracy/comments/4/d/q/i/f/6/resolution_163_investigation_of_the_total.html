<p><a href="http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab108469.pdf"><strong>Resolution 16-3 - Investigation of the Total Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7(PDF <sup>PG36</sup> )</strong></a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Daniel Barnum, FAIA and Fifty Members of the Institute Intent To adopt a 
Position Statement in support of a new investigation into the total collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 on September 11, 2001.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, according to the AIA Public Policies and Position Statements, 
architects are professionally o
bligated to use their knowledge, skill, and 
experience to engage in civic life</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7), a 47-story, steel-framed high
-rise building, suffered a total colapse at 5:20 PM on the afternoon of September 11, 2001;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the cause of the collapse of WTC 7 has become the subject of 
vigorous public debate, such that establishing the true cause of the collapse 
of WTC 7 is of great civic importance</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, prior to and since September 11, 2001, no steel framed high
-rise building has ever suffered a total collapse, except buildings demolished 
through the procedure known as controlled demolition</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the collapse of WTC 7 exemplified many of the signature 
features of controlled demolition, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sudden onset</strong>: The roofline of WTC 7 went from being stationary 
to being in free fall in approximately one half-second.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapidity</strong>: The roofline of WTC 7 fell to the ground in less than 
seven seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free fall</strong>: For 2.25 seconds, or a third of its descent
, WTC 7 fell at the rate of gravity over a distance of eight stories, meaning that the lower structure of the building provided no resistance whatsoever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry</strong>: WTC 7 fell directly downward through what had been 
the path of greatest resistance, with the debris deposited mostly 
inside the building’s footprint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explosions</strong> and window breakage: Video shows vertical sequences 
of explosions and window breakage running up the north face of 
WTC 7 as it began to collapse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dismemberment</strong>: The steel frame of WTC 7 was almost entirely 
dismembered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Totality</strong>: The entire structure of WTC 7 collapsed to the ground, 
leaving no sections of the building standing; </p></li>
</ul>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, first responders and bystanders reported explosions and other 
phenomena suggestive of controlled demolition immediately prior to and 
during the collapse of WTC 7, as exemplified in the following account by a 
first-year NYU medical student identified as “Darryl” on 1010 Wins Radio: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“[W]e heard this sound that sounded like a clap of thunder. Turned around. 
We were shocked to see that the building was, uh.... Well, it looked like 
there was a shockwave ripping through the building and the windows all 
busted out. It was horrifying. And then about a second later the bottom floor 
caved out and the building fo
llowed after that”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, a CNN video captured both the sound of an explosion coming 
from WTC 7 and the following statements prior to the onset of the collapse:
Unidentified voice: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“You hear that?”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Voice of emergency worker #1: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Keep your eye on that building. It’ll be coming down soon.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Voice of emergency worker #2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Building is about to blow up, move it 
back.... We are walking back, there’s a building about to blow up. Flame 
and debris coming down”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, numerous experts in controlled demolition and structural 
engineering have attested that the collapse of WTC 7 could have only been 
caused by controlled demolition, as exemplified in the following statement 
made by Dutch demolition expert Danny Jowenko after viewing video of the 
collapse</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is controlled demolition.... It&#39;s been imploded. It&#39;s a hired job, 
done by a team of experts” - Danny Jowenko</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, in spite of the fact that WTC 7 had only few, small, and 
scattered fires and modest structural damage, the NYC Office of 
Emergency Management and the New York Fire Department predicted the 
collapse of WTC 7 with extraordinary confidence and precision, deciding to 
establish a safety zone around WTC 7 early in the afternoon and waiting 
several hours in anticipation of the building’s collapse</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, local authorities were so certain of WTC 7’s eventual collapse 
that anticipation of the collapse was widely reported in the media, as exemplified by MSNBC’s Ashleigh Banfield, who reported, </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“I’ve heard several reports from several different officers now that that is the building that is gonna go down next. In fact, one officer told me they’re just waiting for that to come down at this point”</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and by the BBC, who erroneously began reporting the collapse 23 minutes before it actually occurred</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, in spite of the fact that local authorities predicted the collapse of 
WTC 7 with extraordinary confidence and precision, investigators for the 
Building Performance Study, conducted by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Society of Civil Engineers 
(ASCE), were “stunned” by the collapse of WTC 7 and concluded in May 
2002</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building 
to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the 
premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only 
a low probability of occurrence”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and  </p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, three and a half years after the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) began its investigation into the World Trade Center 
disaster, NIST’s lead investigator, Dr. Shyam Sunder, stated that NIST had 
some <em>“preliminary hypotheses,”</em> but conceded, <em>“[T]ruthfully, I don’t really 
know. We’ve had trouble getting a handle on building No. 7”</em></p>

<p>and </p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, NIST finally concluded in its 2008 report that the collapse of 
WTC 7 was caused by <em>“normal office fires,”</em> thus abandoning earlier 
hypotheses that diesel fuel fires or structural damage caused the collapse</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, according to NIST, the fires that it alleges triggered the total 
collapse of WTC 7 burned at temperatures </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in design practice for establishing structural fire resistance ratings”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, NIST neglected to examine steel from WTC 7 with a <em>“Swiss 
cheese appearance”</em> that had been attacked by molten iron,as 
documented in Appendix C of the FEMA/ASCE Building Performance Study and instead falsely alleged that no identifiable steel was recovered from 
WTC 7</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, in its draft report for public comment, NIST falsely denied that 
WTC 7 entered free fall, and then acknowledged the occurrence of free fall 
in its final report, but falsely alleged that the occurrence of free fall was 
consistent with its computer model, which, in fact, does not show a period of 
free fall, nor does it come close to replicating the observed collapse</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, NIST’s computer model omitted critical structural features of 
WTC 7, which, in the opinion of independent engineers, had they been 
included, the computer model would have shown that NIST’s alleged 
collapse initiation mechanism had zero probability of occurring</p>

<p>and  </p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, NIST has refused to release key portions of its modeling data 
to engineers studying the collapse of WTC 7, claiming that to do so </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“might jeopardize public safety”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, thousands of members of the architecture and engineering 
professions, including the 97 sponsors of this resolution, believe there is 
sufficient evidence contradicting NIST’s explanation of the collapse of WTC 
7 to warrant a new investigation</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</strong> that the AIA Board of Directors 
shall commence the process to adopt a Position Statement, to be published 
in the AIA Directory of Public Policies and Position Statements, stating both:</p>

<ul>
<li>The AIA’s belief that incidents involving the catastrophic failure of buildings and other structures must be investigated using the highest standards of science
based investigation and analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>and</p>

<ul>
<li>The AIA’s support for a new investigation into the total collapse of WTC 7</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Use your brain thoughts.  The observation there is that:  1)  There is no visible damage on the walls from where the engines (on the wings) would have hit,  2) There is no visible damage from where the wings themselves would have hit, however minor the damage may have been due to the lighter material of the wings impacting the far stronger material of the wall,  <strong>3)  There is literally no wing debris alongside the impact hole</strong>, as there should have been if the wings were sheared off by the wall upon impact, as they must have been since they obviously did not punch through the wall like the supposed WTC plane impacts did. </p>

<p>Just like the Shankesville crash site, literally no plane debris seen during live coverage, totally unlike any other footage of legit plane crashes into fields, deserts, mountains, etc.  For both instances, plane debris is only seen in still photos after the fact, easily manufactured or staged photographs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m doing neither.  Repeatedly told you to watch the readily available videos.  </p>

<p>Just watch the videos.  What are you afraid of? </p>

<p>My point was, I have never seen evidence of convincing and identifiable &quot;plane wreckage&quot; in either:  live news footage on the scenes, photos, or, other video, from the day-of or released after.  When I say &quot;plane wreckage&quot;, and I think this is where you find most argument with my words, I mean:  fuselage, passenger seats, bodies, engines, etc.  There is literally nothing at Shanksville that resembles a plane.  At both sites there is minimal debris, scraps, nothing clearly identifiable as a plane.  Until some Pentagon photos released after the fact, which are still questionable in their own right. </p>

<p>My first comment was worded poorly because I was  mainly describing the Pentagon crash and why it looked funny, but then referenced Shanksville.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even understand your own argument. If you claim that there is no debris at the site initially you have to then explain how it got into the photos that you claim were staged. These just aren&#39;t your crazy words, these are physical objects that have to be moved to the site to stage photos. That takes people to load the debris,  drive to the site unload the debris, arrange the debris...etc... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>.....which is exactly what happens in a controlled demolition. The interior support beams must be weakened first to prevent the possibility of the building falling anywhere other than inward or straight down. If all explosives are triggered at once, there exists the great risk of a faulty charge in the middle causing the exterior beams to fall faster than the interior ones. The building facade would  then fall outward if it can&#39;t collapse into the space created by the inner beams that were destroyed first.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that so many people just accept the fairy tale. Put the WTC7 collapse side-by-side with all other controlled high-rise demolitions, then side-by-side with all previous steel skyscraper fires. To accept that it was a fire-induced collapse, when those in charge of releasing the report can&#39;t even comprehend how it occurred, then you&#39;re....well.....I&#39;m guessing a lot of people in your life are playing you all the time without a shred of your awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It came down in free fall speed suddenly = proof it was demoed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For 2.25 seconds it was in absolute freefall.</p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NIST&#39;s  investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster, that resulted in the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_finalreports.cfm">NCSTAR</a> report, is inadmissible in a court of law in the United States, because it fails the <em>Daubert</em> standard, this determines the standard for admitting expert testimony in federal courts, <strong>The Federal Rules of Evidence and the Admissibility of Expert Opinion Testimony in an Adversarial Evidentiary Proceeding</strong></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/281a">The National Institute of Standards and Technology, on its own initiative but only after consultation with local authorities, may initiate and conduct investigations to determine the causes of structural failures in structures which are used or occupied by the general public. No part of any report resulting from such investigation, or from an investigation under the National Construction Safety Team Act [15 U.S.C. 7301 et seq.], shall be admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in such report.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under the standards established by the United States Supreme Court in <strong>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed 2d 469 (1993)</strong> and its progeny, expert testimony offered to support the official theory and hypotheses concerning the cause of the destruction of World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2 and 7 (the WTC) on September 11, 2001 <strong>would probably be excluded from admission into evidence by an impartial judge in a civil or criminal proceeding</strong></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_Standard">The Daubert standard provides a rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of expert witnesses&#39; testimony during United States federal legal proceedings. Pursuant to this standard, a party may raise a Daubert motion, which is a special case of motion in limine raised before or during trial to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The Daubert trilogy refers to the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the Daubert standard</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Under Daubert and FRE 702, when carrying out evidentiary gate-keeping duties under the Federal Rules of Evidence, <strong>judges must at a minimum inquire into:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion or theory is susceptible to testing and has been subjected to such testing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>NIST fail - their theory is unproven and untested, there own testing, in particular, the material and fire tests conducted by NIST, <strong>did not support its initial findings</strong> They did not look for evidence of explosives, contrary to NFPA guidelines.</p>

<p>More importantly, any actual relevant sections of the official report <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been subjected to peer-review and publication</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The NIST report is not peer reviewed, it was and still is, self published and thus has zero credibility. In academia, peer review is used to determine an academic paper&#39;s suitability for publication.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>3</strong> <strong>Whether there is a known or potential rate of error associated with the methodology used and whether there are standards controlling the techniques’ operation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>rate of error is 100%.</strong> That is, the previous rate of success in collapsing two 110-story steel skyscrapers such as WTC 1 and 2, by a fire ignited by jet fuel (even taking into account aircraft impact damage) and one 47 story steel skyscraper such as WTC 7 (which had no aircraft impact damage) <strong>is 0%.</strong> The official explanation of the destruction of these three buildings on September 11, 2001 assumes unprecedented processes and events in all three cases.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>Whether the opinion/theory has been scrutinized and generally accepted by the scientific community.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no general acceptance of the United States Government conspiracy theory in the scientific community. The official theory has been rejected by many qualified experts who have reviewed and scrutinized the NIST reports and the data that NIST has made available.</p>

<p>*There are additional factors considered by courts, but all four main Daubert factors are applicable to all cases generally (where the Federal Rules of Evidence apply or where the state courts have adopted the Daubert or similar test)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NIST&#39;s specific objectives were:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed;</li>
<li>Determine why the injuries and fatalities were so high or low depending on location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior, evacuation, and emergency response;</li>
<li>Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, </li>
<li>Identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  an agency of the U.S. Department of <strong>Commerce</strong> failed on every single one of these objectives</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The official NIST report on the collapse of WTC 7 is a scientific absurdity</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>An Unprecedented Occurrence</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> First time in the known universe, a steel-frame high-rise building was brought down by fire, literally an unprecedented occurrence of physical phenomena</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Visual Evidence of Implosion</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0GW6QXKyp0">The way it collapsed</a>, straight down, in virtual free fall, <strong>(actual free-fall for 2.25 seconds)</strong> making the destruction of this building appear to be an example of the type of controlled demolition known as “implosion,” in which explosives and/or incendiaries are used to slice the building’s steel support columns in such a way as to cause the building to collapse into its own footprint</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They simply blew up columns, and the rest caved in afterwards. . . . This is controlled demolition&quot; - Danny Jowenko, building demolition expert and the owner of a controlled demolition company.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testimonies about Explosions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Besides the obviousness from the very appearance of the collapse of Building 7 that it was a product of controlled demotion, there were vast amounts of testimonies about explosions in this building.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was up in the emergency management center on the twenty-third floor [of WTC 7], and when all the power went out in the building, another gentleman and I walked down to the eighth floor where there was an explosion and we were trapped on the eighth floor with smoke, thick smoke, all around us, for about an hour and a half. But the New York Fire Department . . . just came and got us out.” - Michael Hess, New York City’s corporation counsel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Barry Jennings of the New York City Housing Authority, corroborates Hess&#39;s version of events in a interview given on the day</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was real close to Building 7 when it fell down. . . . That didn’t sound like just a building falling down to me . . . . There’s a lot of eyewitness testimony down there of hearing explosions. . . . [A]ll of a sudden. . . I looked up, and . . . [t]he thing started pealing in on itself. . . . I started running . . . and the whole time you’re hearing ‘boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.&#39;” - NYPD officer Craig Bartme</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Physical Evidence</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Swiss-Cheese Steel -  three professors from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) had issued a report about a piece of steel from Building 7 that was described in a New York Times story by James Glanz and Eric Lipton as...</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation.” 13 Part of the mystery was the fact that the steel was “extremely thin,” indicating that the steel had “melted away,” even though “no fire in any of the buildings was believed to be hot enough to melt steel outright.” Another part of the mystery was that atoms in the steel seemed to have combined with sulfur “to form compounds that melt at lower temperatures,” but as to the source of the sulfur, “no one knows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thinning and the holes even suggested that the steel had vaporized, an impossibility in a normal office fire.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NIST’s Falsification and Fabrication of Evidence</strong></p>

<p>NIST’s WTC 7 report repeatedly committed scientific fraud in the technical sense, as defined by the National Science Foundation.Besides omitting and otherwise falsifying evidence, NIST also committed the type of scientific fraud called fabrication, which means simply “making up results”</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Falsification</strong> - NIST “omitting data.”  While claiming that it “<em>found no evidence of a . . . controlled demolition event</em>”  NIST simply omitted an enormous amount of evidence for that conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omitting Testimonial Evidence</strong> - NIST failed to mention any of the testimonial evidence for explosions.  NIST also failed to mention any of the reports of explosions just as the building started to come down. Even though vast amounts of video evidence corroborates this testimonial evidence</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omitting Physical Evidence</strong>
NIST’s report on this building also omitted various types of physical evidence.
One of these was the piece of Swiss-cheese steel reported by the three WPI professors in a paper that was, as mentioned earlier, included as an appendix to the 2002 FEMA report.
Another was the melted iron, the RJ Lee Group, a scientific research organization,  proved this, the RJ Lee Group said in its final (2004) report, </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>spherical iron particles (the iron had) melted during the WTC Event, producing spherical metallic particles</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Melted Molybdenum</strong> - Another study was carried out by scientists at the US Geological Survey. Besides also finding the spherical iron particles, these scientists found that something had melted molybdenum, which has an extremely high melting point: 4,753°F (2,623°C).  Although these USGS scientists failed to mention this discovery in the published version of their report, a group of scientists led by Steven Jones, having obtained the USGS team’s data through a FOIA request, reported evidence that this team had devoted serious study to “a molybdenum-rich spherule.”  NIST, however, failed to mention this discovery by the US Geological Survey, although it is another federal agency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nanothermite</strong> - A peer-reviewed report by University of Copenhagen chemist Niels Harrit and several co-authors, including physicist Steven Jones and chemist Kevin Ryan, showed that the WTC dust contained unreacted nanothermite. Unlike ordinary thermite, which is an incendiary, nanothermite is a high explosive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Girder Shear Studs and Omission of Stiffener Plates</strong>
NIST claims that a steel girder connecting columns 44 and 79  broke loose. Having lost its support, column 79 failed, starting a chain reaction in which all the other columns failed. Leaving aside the impossibility of this scenario, NIST’s claims that it was not connected to the floor slab with sheer studs. NIST wrote: “<em>In WTC 7, no studs were installed on the girders</em>.”  In another passage, NIST said: “<em>Floor beams  had shear studs, but the girders that supported the floor beams did not have shear studs</em>.” 
Shear studs were used to anchor the beams and girders, including the girder in question and it is irrefutable that the stiffeners were omitted and that their inclusion in any analysis would render the NIST collapse initiation claim thoroughly impossible</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Raging 12 th Floor Fire at 5:00</strong>
Although in its 2004 Interim Report on WTC 7 , NIST said that by 4:45 PM, “<em>the fire on Floor 12 was burned out</em>”  it claimed in its 2008 report that at 5:00, just 21 minutes before the building collapsed, the fire on this floor was still going strong.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NIST admit that their theory is not consistent with physical principles, which means they are not based on the laws of physics.</strong></p>

<p>Building 7 came down at around the same rate as a free-falling object, it was in free-fall for 2.25 seconds. But in NIST’s Draft for Public Comment, issued in August 2008, it denied this, saying that the time it took for the upper floors — the only floors that are visible on the videos – to come down <em>“was approximately 40 percent longer than the computed free fall time and was consistent with physical principles</em>” 
As this statement implies, any assertion that the building did come down in free fall would not be consistent with physical principles — meaning the laws of physics. Explaining why not, during a “WTC 7 Technical Briefing” on August 26, 2008, Shyam Sunder said....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>free fall time would be [the fall time of] an object that has no structural components below it. . . The time that it took . . . for those 17 floors to disappear [was roughly 40 percent longer than free fall]. And that is not at all unusual, because there was structural resistance that was provided in this particular case. And you had a sequence of structural failures that had to take place. Everything was not instantaneous</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in NIST’s final report, which came out in November 2008, it admitted free fall and free fall can only be achieved if there is zero resistance to motion. NIST no longer claim that its analysis was consistent with the laws of physics</p>

<p><strong>How Researchers Have Accounted for the Evidence Regarding the Structural Behavior of WTC 7</strong></p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>NIST: FIRE-INDUCED FAILURE</strong></th>
<th><strong>INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS: CONTROLLED DEMOLITION</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sudden Symmetrical FreeFall</strong></td>
<td>Attempt to deny the occurrence of free fall. Then acknowledge it but obscure its significance and provide no explanation</td>
<td>Acknowledge and interpret as evidence that explosives were used to remove all of the columns simultaneously</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Structural Dismemberment into a Compact Debris Pile</strong></td>
<td>Terminate computer model shortly after collapse initiation and provide no explanation for observed phenomena</td>
<td>Acknowledge and interpret as evidence that explosives dismembered the structure and deposited it into a compact debris pile</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Eyewitness Accounts of Explosions</strong></td>
<td>Deny the existence of audio recordings and eyewitness accounts of explosions</td>
<td>Acknowledge and interpret as evidence of explosives</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Foreknowledge of Destruction</strong></td>
<td>Provide a hypothesis that is incompatible with the high degree of confidence and precision with which the destruction of WTC 7 was anticipated</td>
<td>Acknowledge and interpret as evidence of foreknowledge that WTC 7 was going to be brought down</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<hr/>

<p>In conclusion, the hypothesis of controlled demolition readily, simply, and completely explains all of the evidence regarding the structural behavior of WTC 7 during its destruction. </p>

<p>It also explains the high degree of confidence and precision with which WTC 7’s destruction was anticipated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why?</p>

<p>Maybe we take a step back and cast a wider net on 9/11?  </p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no &quot;war on terror&quot;.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in Iraq.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in… (insert any country classified as part of the &quot;axis of evil&quot; or defined as being &#39;with the terrorists&#39;)</p>

<p>Without 9/11 thousands of U.S. troops would not have been sent to their deaths.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan would not have been sentenced to their deaths.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no inaction on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no civilian contractors in Iraq and the scandal that has followed them would have been averted.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no false military reporting (Pat Tillman, Jessica Lynch), and no crack down on the freedom of the press (banning photographing the returning coffins).</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Patriot Act.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no NSA warrantless wiretapping program.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Camp Delta and no Camp X-ray at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Military Commissions Act and no coordinated program of extraordinary rendition, indefinite detention and torture of those defined as “enemy combatants”.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in secrecy and complete militarization of intelligence under the newly created office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would not be thousands of dead and dying emergency workers who are suffering crippling and fatal respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in military and security spending that goes arm in arm with huge cutbacks in other key social programs (such as levees in New Orleans).</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would have been no total abandonment of fiscal restraint, which has contributed to plunging the nation into an abyss of debt and looks likely to tip the world into a deep recession if not a complete depression.</p>

<p>And on and on and on.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, without 9/11 there would be no &quot;post 9/11 society/mentality&quot;.  </p>

<p><em>At the end of the day 9/11 Truth is the peace movement.</em> </p>

<p>In reference to part A, here is where you forgot to actually respond to my comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please explain how the fact that it neither makes my day brighter, nor darker to learn of your pathetic obsession with begging people to believe the official story/your false sense of importance is &quot;helping.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reference to part B, here is how you can actually help me! Please use peer reviewed, published sources to refute this peer reviewed published paper and account for the VOCs measured at Ground Zero! </p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And please don&#39;t forget to incorporate the PM like the rest of you silly faithers tend to do! </p>

<p>No worries, I&#39;ll be sure to repost this info when I catch you begging the next person to believe the official story. I&#39;ll show them how the official story combustion can&#39;t account for the measurable data (and neither can you) and we&#39;ll let them decide for themselves! How fun!</p>

<p>Yes, it is direct evidence of pre weakening of the structure, this is common in controlled demolitions, i am surprised you debunkers still try use this one because you are pointing out an obvious flaw with the official story and by proxy supporting the controlled demolition theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t, this is my argument.</p>

<p>WTC7 was there, it was then part of a controlled demolition, just like all other steel framed buildings that have shown all the signs of controlled demolition,
the collapse of WTC 7 exemplified many of the signature features of controlled demolition, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sudden onset</strong>: The roofline of WTC 7 went from being stationary 
to being in free fall in approximately one half-second.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapidity</strong>: The roofline of WTC 7 fell to the ground in less than 
seven seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free fall</strong>: For 2.25 seconds, or a third of its descent
, WTC 7 fell at the rate of gravity over a distance of eight stories, meaning that the lower structure of the building provided no resistance whatsoever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry</strong>: WTC 7 fell directly downward through what had been 
the path of greatest resistance, with the debris deposited mostly 
inside the building’s footprint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explosions</strong> and window breakage: Video shows vertical sequences 
of explosions and window breakage running up the north face of 
WTC 7 as it began to collapse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dismemberment</strong>: The steel frame of WTC 7 was almost entirely 
dismembered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Totality</strong>: The entire structure of WTC 7 collapsed to the ground, 
leaving no sections of the building standing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>all the evidence confirms controlled demolition, none confirm <em>&quot;fire&quot;</em></p>

<p>In conclusion, the hypothesis of controlled demolition readily, simply, and completely explains all of the evidence regarding the structural behavior of WTC 7 during its destruction. </p>

<p>It also explains the high degree of confidence and precision with which WTC 7’s destruction was anticipated.</p>
