Enforce insider trading rules, especially the Congress (our sickness starts at the head of the snake). Obliterate the campaign finance as it exists. Break up the media (5 companies) monopoly. Cut defense by 5/8 or more. Eliminate TSA, Homeland Security and every cancer organization that used 911 as an excuse to exist, reverse the Patriot Act and Citizens United. Prosecute the &quot;big boys&quot; as they are now piratical, vulture, criminal, fascistic organization. Analyze <strong>WHO</strong> they are and act accordingly. Severely limit tax havens, off shoring, and most &quot;public/private&quot; associations and NGO&#39;s. This will be a start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s successful terror in action. Terror equals fright inducing that state of being &quot;scared&quot;. This is not the proper condition of a citizen of a normal nation. It is so in a police state. There has to be a way of punching the controllers in the mouth. I say the way is truth, disclosure, prosecution, getting a pair of balls. Us the god damn NSA machine to catch the fuckers deserving of being caught. We already paid for it. Loose the NSA on Goldman Sachs and the Fed for starters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all of that, but there is no direct course of action to get any, let alone all, of it rolling. Correct me if I am wrong here, what are the steps to get this done? It seems to me that the very things you describe are entrenched to the point where &#39;the system&#39; not only supports but is dependant on them. Think of all the jobs people would moan about losing. Again I am on board with everything you say but I have another perspective...</p>

<p>The system of control/economy relies on dollars as its main control mechanism. Need dollars to solve any problems you might have. Food, shelter, transport, etc... all derivatives of dollars. To enact change I submit that we the people must take direct action against the thieves&#39; eCONomy via a general boycott.</p>

<p>First we must understand: why are all those systems you describe in place? Politicians. Why did politicians institute such things? Bribes. Who bribed them? Corupto-corps. Why do the corupto-corps have enough dollars to bribe them? We the people of the USA spend over 11 TRILLION dollars every year on consumer spending. We are literally financing the corruption in exchange for comfortable lifestyles.</p>

<p>By engaging in a general boycott we the people can simultaneously remove dollars/power from the coffers of the corps corrupting our politicians AND use those dollars to deploy infrastructure in our own lives/communities that will reduce our reliance on future dollars, thus giving the corps even less power over us. Imagine installing a garden this year and in the future, for only labor, you get dollar-free food AND Monsanto-like corps get nada.</p>

<p>Think back to SOPA and GoDaddy. Reddit organized a boycott and GoDaddy stopped supporting SOPA within 48 hours. Even though they were likely lying... Money Talks, Bullshit Walks.</p>

<p>Boycotts are superior to strikes in that no one puts anything at risk. You can get in trouble for not buying stuff. Of course keep paying taxes and mortgages, you would do no good in jail. All the Jones&#39; stuff can be nixed. The more mandated spending (healthcare) the more people wise up to the scams. Another way to think of it is: Employers MUST pay employees. Employees need NOT purchase stuff.</p>

<p>Also remember that fractional reserve banking works for the people on the way down. For every dollar you keep out of the system, it will destroy at least 10 more dollars in conjured funny money. Even a few percent of American&#39;s engaging in a general boycott would be enough to send massive ripples into the eCONomy.</p>

<p>At this point you&#39;d have massive corps going out of business, which would only hasten the process. Maybe the Tea Party and Occupy people finally realize they are on the same team AND that the MSM is lying about &#39;recoveries&#39; and &#39;green shoots&#39;. Rough times for sure, but the band-aid must be removed for us to heal. Eventually I would also expect violence, but if this must occur we the people should be wise enough to do it on our terms, force TPTB to fire the first shot. Keep our moral high ground.</p>

<p>At the end of the rough patch the work begins. Rebuilding, reconnecting, and at this point I don&#39;t think the institutions you mention would even be around anymore...</p>

<p>tl-dr; General boycott to force TPTB&#39;s hand, spend only on things that reduce your reliance on future dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry broken model, boycotts. This is not Cesar Chavez and San Joaquin Valley grapes. There is NO SHORTAGE of consumers. They can just as easily off shore the buyers as they off shored our jobs. Nope. It&#39;s going to take hard, strong legal prosecution of the devils, all the sons of bitches.

    <div class="md"><p>I am constantly landing on news information about how the elite are playing the economy in a way that damages the economy but enriches them with power and wealth. This has been going on for months and sometimes I run into a graph that shows the problem that exists with average pay. It hasn&#39;t gone up in decades although the rich keep getting richer. One of the graphs averaged itself out to depict what the middle class would be making on average if the elite didn&#39;t loot the economy, and it came up to $98,000 a year on average. </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t have all the evidence in front of me but we all know something is seriously fucked up at the top by now. It&#39;s like a cancer eating away at the whole body. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh great. Gonna check this out. My solution is a philosophical one which people might not be quite ready to hear yet but in the meantime, we need to start by using people power so we can have a hand in politics. Nothing will change until the people put their foot down. We have many tools such as communication that we can use to maintain awareness of the problem. Its all about us, not only the politicians. Its a combo effect that can have amazing impacts on this country but we would need to conciously move into this state of being as a people. </p>
