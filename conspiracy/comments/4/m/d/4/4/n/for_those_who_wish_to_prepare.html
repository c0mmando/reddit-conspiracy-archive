        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You really want to know how to change shit? It is quite simple, would take about two months of prep. Guerilla garden. Plant shit everywhere. No, not drugs: food. Plant everyone a food garden, reclaim every piece of grass infested soil next to roads. Eventually we will be digging up the roads for more food producing space, but leave those alone for now. Get to know every one of your neighbours within like 2+Km. Like, every one. If they are old or infirmed, grab some mates and dig up their front and back lawn and ask them what they like to eat then plant it for them. In your getting to know your neighbours you will run into many people who know more about growing food than you do, listen to them. Start having meals with your neighbours, &#39;cos soon that will be a regular thing. </p>

<p>Keep planting, everywhere you can, and just sit tight. In about 2-3 months, your local neighbourhood will start to look different. And one day soon, you be able to have a meal together, en masse in the street. All grown around you. Celebrate that night properly. Then ...? Well, then will be the first day of the new world, in your local at least. You eat that first meal together, and over that meal discuss the most pressing concerns you all have and how to prioritise them. Then? No one goes to work the next day. Or ever again.</p>

<p>I know, I now, but like 80% of people will just carry on as if stoned right? Of course they will. Do you know what the term &#39;critical mass&#39; means? For human-type populations, that particular numeric is somewhere in the tenth percentile, meaning that society as we know it would stop like a fucking traffic jam in Fresno when merely 10% of the population decides not to pull whatever lever of society they&#39;ve been put in charge of. </p>

<p>Grow food. Talk to your neighbours. Stop making their system function. Build a comfortable local gallows and go to town on every member of government and the high and supreme courts of your own locale. Start chatting locally about what you want your children&#39;s&#39; futures to resemble rather than what now non-existent team you follow or product that you used to consume.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this: general boycott and focus all that &#39;extra&#39; time and money into building your infrastructure (as OP points out via gardens, or whatever else you might be continually spending money on).</p>

<p>A general boycott won&#39;t land you in hot water. No laws against NOT purchasing 11 TRILLION dollars every year as the USA does. There are laws against not paying taxes, so keep paying them. You won&#39;t help by being in jail. There is no reason to quit your job. Think of it this way: your employer HAS to pay you, but you do NOT have to buy their shit.</p>

<p>Think back to SOPA and GoDaddy, reddit got a boycott agasint them and in 48 hours they changed their lieing tune. Money talks, bullshit walks.</p>

<p>How would one &#39;terrorize&#39; the elite? Hit them the only place they would be hurt... their bottom line. Look how fucked the eCONomy is already. The lies out of BLS today are ridiculuos. 4.7% unemployment and ~100MM not participating in labor force? Malls emptying as retail implodes. Zero and Negative interest rates. Saudi arabia trying to raise money as they are broke, Japan... japan lol. I could go on all day.</p>

<p>So, the eCONomy (aka central system of control via money) is breaking down. It will fall and it will be shitty times. The elites probably would rather have this falling down done on their terms, so they come out on top again. These folks are NOT stupid. They are highly educated and have no empathy.</p>

<p>OTOH we the people could just as easily pull the rug out from under the whole thing, on OUR TERMS, and smash the eCONomy. Even 3-4% pf the population of the USA on a general boycott would rock an already faltering system. Remember, fractional reserve banking works against &#39;them&#39; on the way down. For every dollar you don&#39;t feed in the machine, it hemmorages at least 10 dollars of conjured funny money.</p>

<p>In the end I&#39;d expect violence, but we the people should force the elites to pull that trigger. Then, from our moral high-ground... win.</p>

<p>This is all the easy stuff. The real hard part is going to be picking up the pieces afterwards. Something OP seems to attempt to address. Again, transition to future on our terms not theirs.</p>

<p>tl-dr; general boycott anything that does not reduce your relaince on future dollars.</p>

<p>Someone locks you in a cage. They give you food and water, a shitter, basically the basics. Maybe even internet... They also give you a hacksaw and unlimited blades. You can cut your way through the bars, but this will take you aproximately 1 year of hard labor. Alternativly you can simply live (and eventually die) in the cage. What do you do?</p>

<p>I submit that you are a paid shill or completely ignorant of what you are doing. Your posting history is about every 5 minutes and you are constantly dodging questions and saying things like: &#39;there is no hope so give up&#39;. Essentially, you seem to be trying to demoralize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought you were the paid shill.....one of the rules broken in the sub....dont call anyone a shill...but okay. Actually I do have hope because we are all souls and there is a good vs evil war going, so that eventually truth, the light, the good will win....but I doubt we see that in out lifetimes......</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here, for example, you answer that you would break out of the thought experiment cage, but you just said you tried to live off the land and it was back breaking (implying you quit b/c it was too hard).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe don&#39;t assume? It makes an ass out of u and me......</p>

<p>I own land and have lived on it and worked it solo. It&#39;s easier with others. I still have the acreage with a cabin but got offered a good paying gig so I can save up for a few years and move back there permanently eventually.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing....maybe ask someone for more info instead of assuming</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then you go totally metaphysical with something that has no actual bearing on the topic at hand: what can one do to &#39;prepare&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is already metaphysical, everything ties together......there&#39;s no getting away from it. SO what if I went into it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please don&#39;t take offence if you are not a shill. Ignorance simple means lack of knowledge. If this is the case, I&#39;d suggest less posting/talking and more reading/listening.</p>

<p>Most def not the case......no offense but maybe don&#39;t judge the book by its cover. I&#39;m all for and pro off grid and a prepper</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hydroponics and organic gardens will help somewhat  but if everyone did grow food they can sell their crops for profit to pay off those taxes you say. Hard work  yes but so us living paycheck by paycheck. It will be very hard to get it starting but once you have a grow cycle it might get better depending in factors like seasons, money, labor, etc. I suggest in indoor hydroponics since you will not depend in the sun but you will have to pay for electricity unless you can produce energy yourself. Its not impossible just doing it in a suburban place is not somewhere ment to grow but life will find a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indoor hydroponics is an alternative to outdoor farming which lets you farm at home. It is also how people are able to grow marijuana in their closets but it can be used to grow crops and it grows faster than soil. The benefits of indoor farming is that its more efficient than outddor and they do it in japan heres the <a href="http://weburbanist.com/2015/01/11/worlds-largest-indoor-farm-is-100-times-more-productive/">proof.</a>. What  you are talking about is space and total independence like hardcore off the grid. You cannot go cold turkey you have to transition slowly to it. You cannot simply say hey fuck you society and gonna go live in the woods and rely on the woods for resources. Not everyone has that luxury especially if you live in city. So that is why you choose growing indoors since it does not require much to know. You also cannot be able to do it by yourself, while it is possible it is going to be very, very hard because you need a team or a collective a community basically to supply a sufficient enough food to live off and be off the grid. This is what OP was talking about if everyone works together then it can be done. It can be done can only be done with giving it time  to get there and how much is put in by the community to slowly transition towards being more independent of relying on supermarkets for food. However you do not necessarily have to choose this way to live if you  do not want to but I willing to give it a chance and try something new even with the  possibility of it not working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just reading &quot;The Demographic Cliff&quot; by Harry Dent and he made a point that&#39;s germane to this thread. He said that, in the 19th Century, farmers didn&#39;t add to the economy because they were largely self-sufficient. In other words, they weren&#39;t &quot;on the grid,&quot; so to speak.</p>

<p>This explains why countries wanted to discourage agrarian populations and get people packed into cities (where they&#39;re more dependent on The System).</p>

<p>Over the course of the 20th Century, we saw this process in play: the shrinking of the agrarian populations and the urbanization of countries. [This is happening in China now.]</p>

<p>The problem?</p>

<p>While agrarian populations have lots of children (historically to help with farm work) urban populations [who have less room and less resources] generally have fewer children.</p>

<p>The sociological ramifications are that, as society urbanizes, we see population drops. Which adversely affects the economy.</p>

<p>Like Japan, where they now sell more adult diapers than baby diapers.</p>

<p>Or in the West, where the younger generation is going to have problems paying for the entitlements of the larger Baby Boom generation. The drain this puts on society can&#39;t be overstated.</p>

<p>So the Original Poster on this thread is right: The most passive-aggresive, guerilla tactic to take down the system is to get off the grid and plant your own food. Become as energy independent as you can, as well--in terms of solar, wind, etc.</p>

<p>The Powers That Be would crumble if enough people did this. (Which explains their hostility toward the Prepper movement. It&#39;s a direct threat to their power.)</p>
