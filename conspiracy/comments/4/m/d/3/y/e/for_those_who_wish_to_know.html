        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s start with 911. It was planned before the towers were built. September 11 is the true birth date of Jesus Christ. America (the corporation) has had 8 bankruptcies since the turn of the century and is entirely foreign owned. The elite worship ancient gods and demons, conduct ritual human sacrifice, and operate a global ring of paedophilia and human slavery. Humans have been cloned for quite some time now and all of Hollywood and the music industry is one huge system of mockery and deception, more paedophilia and demon worship. The music industry is entirely a creation of the military industrial complex and television is literal mind control on several levels. Our food and water are purposely poisoned, particularly in ways that weaken and inhibit our own natural abilities. We are free ranged slaves for a select few and we see nothing more than the shadows on the cave walls. The earth is flat. God is very much real. Politics is more of a charade than Hollywood. It is all theatre, none of it is real. Your figureheads are selected, not elected, and the whole thing is just a pantomime. Everything is an inversion, Orwell or Satan, you pick. Bill hicks never died, and he plays Alex Jones now. Michelle Obama is a man. Paul McCartney was one of the earliest public examples of a clone, but the shit they do with clones is mind-blowingly fucked up. The one thing that keeps most of them silent is the fear of what the public would do to them if they found out. You have to be inducted into Hollywood through sacrifice, generally of a close family member. You have to get &#39;gravy, baby&#39; to get into the music industry - basically filmed being gangbanged, a few of the tapes have even made it into the public domain on liveleak and similar places. GB Senior was one of the G-men who killed Kennedy. Man has never been to the moon or even beyond the firmament above us. The sun is not millions of miles away, but more like 300 or so, the sun and the moon are the same size and literally function as a clock. We fuck up our calendars specifically to make it seem random. Moonlight is different from sunlight, and is cold. The phases of the moon are not the result of reflected sunlight whatsoever, but are functions of the massive timepiece above our heads, and it all functions for us. This is a test, a polarity experiment. The only thing that really matters in this life are your interactions with others. By doing so, you are putting parts of God back together. This is all God, all of it. Every last atom and substrate is a part of the fractured essence of The Divine. We are encouraged though ego to only see the separation, but the connection is where the sublime resides, and where we realise our true potential as part of that Grand Divinity. Magick occurs in the reattainment of our place in the cosmos as an aspect of God through recognition and reciprocation; not merely being, but being together. We truly make reality.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#39;d like more info on straight outta the gate, since you throw so much at us, is: Sept 11 the birth of JC? Never heard that anywhere, ever. You got ANYTHING to share on that besides the single sentence? What makes you say this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. I&#39;ve seen these before. And maybe 9/11 means something to the Jesuits and maybe they were a critical part of the false flag attack. I can buy all that. But why does that have to dovetail back to it being the date of Christ&#39;s birth?</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s a key date in the history of the Knights Templar, or some super duper secret thing the Jesuits know that we don&#39;t. Why do you say it&#39;s the birth of Jesus Christ? And, if it was, why would they then pull off a huge satanic mass murder ritual on his birthday? Because the Jesuits are secret satanists? Finding that hard to buy. </p>

<p>I appreciate your response, but find the connection specious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason they chose September 11th was because there was an anti-globalist movement that used that date as its name. Simply by having the attack on that date, that movement was completely sidelined.

    <div class="md"><p>That was the reason for the date. That&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t on the 10th or the 12th. You obviously don&#39;t remember massive news these protests were at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t. But I do remember George H.W. Bush using the term &quot;The New World Order&quot; for the first time exactly 10 years to the day earlier, on September 11, 1991. </p>

<p>And once you start digging -- REALLY digging -- into that date, you realize there were a ton more occult and numerological reasons for that date being chosen. Your guess may be a tiny tiny part it, but rest assured it was tiny. </p>
