        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am looking at the total delegate counts, as well as the delegate count from the primary in Puerto Rico today, and have seen evidence of election fraud in PR as well (self post from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> if i remember correctly), all of which points to the conclusion of the biggest farce in American political history.  PR count can be found here: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/election/primaries/states/pr/Dem">http://edition.cnn.com/election/primaries/states/pr/Dem</a> </p>

<p>and the total count here: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dem+primary+delegates&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS694US694&amp;oq=dem+pri&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l3j69i57j0.1135j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#eob=m.09c7w0/D/6/short/m.09c7w0/">https://www.google.com/search?q=dem+primary+delegates&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS694US694&amp;oq=dem+pri&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l3j69i57j0.1135j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#eob=m.09c7w0/D/6/short/m.09c7w0/</a></p>

<p>I can&#39;t be the only one to see these numbers and that Hillary was down the EXACT amount of delegates she fraudulantly won in Puerto Rico today.  This could all be coincidental, but based on the indisputable fact that almost every primary that Clinton has won, has been won with an exit poll margin of error far above the acceptable average of 4% (used by the UN to determine fair elections in 3RD WORLD COUNTRIES), and it looks like the mask has been taken off of the greatest sham in Human history, modern American Democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what are we to do?  If revolution just incites martial law, and remaining passive only digs our graves deeper, what else is there?  I mean if we could somehow get a large enough portion of the military on our side, we would be in great shape.  I know for a fact that there are a fair amount of disillusioned soldiers out there that hate what the government has become.  It&#39;s just the matter of organizing such a thing...seems almost impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on the military is that they are signed up and don&#39;t want to hang out with Chelsea for the next 20 years. Those that are out and see through the delusion are squarely on the side of the people once they step away from the US and them mentality that the military creates. The ones that I am worried about are the ones that hold onto the US vs them mentality and the fear of the other. The ones that think it is OK to become mercenaries, as long as their families are fed. Those are the privateers of our era, and to them money is God. The military members that didn&#39;t catch the kill it all mentality, are not the psychopaths in charge, and I am sure our veterans know the difference. 
In short, evolution, not revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news last night was reporting that 13 more super delegates declared their support for Hillary and it was those 13 that pushed her over the top last night.  Here&#39;s the kicker though... the people who keep the running tally of delegates can&#39;t/won&#39;t release the names of the delegates so that the public can verify the accounting.  They said some of the super delegates request anonymity.  So, basically, the media says Hillary is over the top based on 13 SD&#39;s and you just have to trust them on that one because there is no way for them to actually show you the numbers.  They declared Hillary the winner the night before California because they couldn&#39;t afford to see her lose California.  Now voter turn-out will likely be suppressed since people will see that they are essentially voting for nothing so why bother show up?  Because of this even if Hillary loses now she will be able to say &quot;Well after the media made the announcement that we had the numbers and I am the nominee a lot of voters didn&#39;t turn out.&quot;  This was extremely calculated of the media to make this announcement on the eve of a huge primary instead of just waiting for the primaries today to play out.  Making this announcement absolutely influenced how people will be showing up today.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s disgraceful. We are headed towards the biggest fall from grace since the Roman Empire. The American people are slowly starting to realize that everything they&#39;ve been told to believe about this Great country is a lie (I LOVE this country and every American in it, but I despise our crippled, corrupt, shit covered government. We have gone from the light at the end of the tunnel, the most rightous and helpful nations in the world, to a country that rapes, pilages, and burns the world and it&#39;s people. It hurts, I feel significantly less pride being an American these days, it&#39;s shameful that we have come to where we are. I&#39;m not saying I, nor any of us here have the right answer, but the blind faith and deep conviction so many have for these bastards is sickening.</p>
