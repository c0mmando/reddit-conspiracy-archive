<p>That&#39;s not even a conspiracy theory that is 100% documented fact and it&#39;s something I learned in high school in the early 2000s. The U.S. funded and aided Al Qaeda against the Russians in the late 70s and early 80s. Osama bin Laden was a CIA asset and it isn&#39;t something our government once tried to keep secret, you can google that and find it in sources that are &quot;more reliable,&quot; in your eyes. You&#39;re literally living under a rock and arguing about something that you don&#39;t have ammunition for. Like a casual football fan arguing schemes and concepts with someone who&#39;s invested 20 years into the sports. It&#39;s comical. Typical American, always arguing about things they&#39;re not informed on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then you were taught wrong, because OSL was never a CIA asset, nor was al-Qaeda funded or aided by America. It didn&#39;t even exist until the late eighties so saying that it was funded by the United States in the late 70s is just a plain lie. </p>

<p>The ones which were funded and aided (though not directly, and through ISI [Pakistani intelligence]) were various Mujahideen forces such as those of Ahmad Massoud. You are conflating all actors in Afghanistan with al-Qaeda, which mainly came to be in madrassas in the Pakistani border area with funding by wealthy Saudis (including one which would later join them - Osama bin Laden).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mujahideen in Afghanistan
After leaving college in 1979, bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the mujahideen resistance in the Soviet war in Afghanistan.[85] He later told a journalist: &quot;I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.&quot;[86] Under CIA&#39;s Operation Cyclone from 1979 to 1989, the United States and Saudi Arabia provided $40 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to almost 100,000 mujahideen and &quot;Afghan Arabs&quot; from forty Muslim countries through Pakistan&#39;s ISI.[87] Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI.[88]</p>

<p>By 1984, bin Laden and Azzam established Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneled money, arms and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden&#39;s inherited family fortune[89] paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet puppet regime, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan; he would also participate in some combat activity, such as the Battle of Jaji. It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs.[11]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well none of these are any proof, just low-tier conspiracy stuff. Such as this. I mean come on, is that really &quot;proof&quot;? Every single faction in the Syrian Civil War including ISIL at that has a social relations/PR department to introduce themselves to more potential recruits and to verify their claims of taking this-and-that city. </p>

<p>As for the main part of the post which centers on the fact that &quot;&#39;Wikileak document shows actions against to degrade Asad in 2006&quot;, you have to remember that during the Iraq war it was <em>Assad himself</em> who was harboring al-Qaeda and other militants/insurgents in Syria. Basically anyone who was fought against the US forces in Iraq. It&#39;s understandable why he did this - nobody wants such a huge military presence next to them, but you also have to also understand the context on why the US wanted to &quot;degrade Assad&quot;.</p>

<p>And the US armed forces weren&#39;t really fighting ISIL per se. For two years we heard about how they supposedly were fighting ISIL with pretty much zero results. Then Russia stepped in and within 2 months had ISIL against the ropes. What were the US armed forces doing all those 2 years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretend fighting. And just to expand on my previous comments, because I know you&#39;re not OP, but our CIA has infiltrated the Muslim groups with their own and convinced them that they need to kill.</p>

<p>I view it like this:</p>

<p>CIA &lt;-------&gt; Al Qaeda/ISIS &quot;Leader&quot; &lt;-------&gt; Jihadists</p>

<p>US Gov &lt;-------&gt; General &lt;-------&gt; Army/Navy/Air Force etc</p>

<p>We&#39;re the terrorists to them, they&#39;re the terrorists to us. Except, our CIA is the other side, fabricating the nonsense to keep the American and European publics scared so as to give away their rights instead of having them taken. If they take our rights, there will be backlash, if we willingly ask to have our rights taken for our safety, less backlash.......

The US was never fighting ISIL with boots on the ground, and the Coalition bombings were extremely effective against ISIL (for example during the liberation of Kobane). The fact that Russia made a lot of noise and fanfare compared to the West, does not mean that we &quot;did not do anything&quot; or had &quot;zero results&quot;.

They don&#39;t need to know who their masters are, only the guy at the top needs to know he&#39;s being provided by the CIA.  Propaganda is the most effective weapon in any conflict, that&#39;s why we fight more with spies than with armies.  ARmies are there for show and to &#39;hold the area&#39; sometimes people get sacrificed so they can come back, get robot limbs put on and then everyone waves the flag and calls them a hero--their robot limbs help them win races and everyone cheers and wants more sons and daughters to go over to wherever and get blown up by whomever, because this helps our economy and our great nation be exceptional.  queue flag and land of brave song</p>

<p>you;re all fools if you believe it but especially this possiblelion guy who by study of his name suggests he&#39;s a britspy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of videos out there, but a lot of it comes from ISIS propaganda sources like Amaq agency and is deleted from sites like youtube, so you have to go to more obscure video sites.</p>

<p>There&#39;s that Vice documentary where they sent one of their journalists in and was shown around by an Islamic State press officer (who was later killed at Tabqa airbase). That was made before the US began air strikes in August 2014.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a site called jihadology which has a lot of videos from various jihadist groups including ISIS. A lot of it is combat propaganda videos but I imagine you&#39;ll find other stuff if you look far back enough.</p>

<p>Your statement that we haven&#39;t seen &quot;a single minutes footage of life from within ISIS&quot; is simply not true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mujahideen in Afghanistan
After leaving college in 1979, bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the mujahideen resistance in the Soviet war in Afghanistan.[85] He later told a journalist: &quot;I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.&quot;[86] Under CIA&#39;s Operation Cyclone from 1979 to 1989, the United States and Saudi Arabia provided $40 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to almost 100,000 mujahideen and &quot;Afghan Arabs&quot; from forty Muslim countries through Pakistan&#39;s ISI.[87] Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI.[88]</p>

<p>By 1984, bin Laden and Azzam established Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneled money, arms and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden&#39;s inherited family fortune[89] paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet puppet regime, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan; he would also participate in some combat activity, such as the Battle of Jaji. It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs.[11]</p>
