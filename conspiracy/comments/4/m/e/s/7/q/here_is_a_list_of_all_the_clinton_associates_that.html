    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fucking crazy if you think that&#39;ll ever happen. Who do you think is paying for him to run exactly? It&#39;s all bullshit. And no, it wouldn&#39;t &quot;easily&quot; pay for a system that supports freeloading. Tax money doesn&#39;t mean shit when you&#39;re trillions of dollars in debt. And no, social welfare policy isn&#39;t going to fix America, education and massively reduced outsourcing will. We need to work, not look for ways to squeeze more out of nothing. Quit thinking that any one person can fix this country. We&#39;re for the people by the people, or, founded on that at the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They got word of a former white house intern coming forward with allegations, but only knew she had the initial &quot;M&quot;. So they murdered Mary Mahoney thinking she was the one. (Bill was very busy with the interns. It was basically like a pre-HIV Magic Johnson sex party in the oval office.)</p>

<p>Anyways, after Lewinsky came out of left field when they thought they had it under wraps it would have been too suspicious. They can&#39;t just snap their fingers and kill anyone, there has to be a perfect storm of opportunity. Here is a snip from the Mahoney story.</p>

<p>&quot;In the pre-trial publicity surrounding Paula Jones lawsuit Mike Isikoff had dropped hints that a &quot;former White House staffer&quot; with the initial &quot;M&quot; was about to go public with her story of sexual harassment at 1600 Pennsylvania. Just days later, gunmen entered the Starbuck&#39;s while the crew was cleaning up after closing.</p>

<p>Mary&#39;s two associates, Aaron Goodrich, 18 and Emory Evans, 25, were taken to a room and shot. Mary herself had five bullets in her, from at least two different guns, most likely with silencers. A total of ten shots were fired; none of them heard by neighbors in the densely populated Georgetown section.</p>

<p>Mary was shot in the chest, her face, and in the back of the head. Someone wanted her very dead. Or to send a message.</p>

<p>Even though more than $4000 remained in the store, the police have categorized the triple murder as a robbery, even as they acknowledge the &quot;execution style&quot; killings.&quot;</p>
