    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, however the large swatch of our citizenry that still supports any politicians still do not know they have better tools available and will therefore be extremely reactionary. To be destructive is the easiest response, to being abused for a lifetime and the one most will follow. I agree with what you are saying, just expressing doubt as to whether the people will be willing to take the high path and do the right thing. The blue stripe patches on the cops is an example. I happen to believe there are many of them just waiting to speak truth to power, but groupthink and hate for other are still dominant.</p>

<p>Your thoughts are confusing here.  The title implies you don&#39;t want mayhem, but your comment above seems to advocate it.</p>

<p>Normalization may come with Trump(peacefully),a Sanders and Clinton will definitely trigger &quot;Crisis stage&quot; , based alone  on what they&#39;ve campaigned so far. </p>

<p>If Trump manages to assume control and if normalization is his end goal, he might be able to bring it , by stopping the hemorrhaging. </p>

<p>Normalization process would put a dent into the &quot;Globalist&quot; agenda, so it&#39;s obvious they might wanna do something about it.</p>

<p>Bernie has spent a lifetime advocating for humanist ideals.  He&#39;s not  the divisive figure Trump is.  Hillary&#39;s a non-starter - everyone thinks she&#39;s bought already.  Trump is the guy whose narrative will lead to civil war.  None of the others will do that.</p>

<p>Where i&#39;m from this means Foosball so i haven&#39;t the slightest clue what you&#39;re trying to ask. Hah! </p>

<p>While the majority of modern, comparatively-radical leaning intellectual types tend to have a strong inclination toward pacifism, they get mired in an unmistakable irony when trying to reconcile this with the sole solution to the hierarchic violence on which western society is based. Only sending it back up the hierarchy can affect anything resembling change, and even if total class-war erupted on every street-corner, tearing down the entire thing then organizing and implementing even the most marginal improvements is a feat that closer resembles a pipe-dream than a plan of action.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean jiu jitsu (particularly the Brazilian variant) - the martial art.  It&#39;s the &quot;slack&quot; martial art.  Slack, generally speaking, is the best strategy to deal with conflict.  It doesn&#39;t mean to avoid conflict.  It means to exist within a conflict situation by being fluid and getting the other guy to do the work for you.  It&#39;s a maximization of result for minimal effort kinda strategy.  Slack is Good Design.</p>

<p>As to how one handles hierarchy it&#39;s simple - effect Slack.  Hierarchy aka the Hero Narrative, is a brittle design.  It doesn&#39;t model reality well.  The Hero nodes in a hierarchy are imperfect.  They can be bought, coerced, wrong, have limited domain knowledge, have limited scale of effort.  If you want to break a hierarchy you just give the Hero nodes more work to do.  This is what I mean by Slack.  Hierarchies can&#39;t scale their model to handle large sets because the deluge of actors finds gaps in the model.  Hierarchical models are Bad Design.  Anywhere you see them they end up failing (eg. SQL schemas, object hierarchies).  They&#39;re great to rough out a design  but suck to actually keep a functional, evolving design.  They just don&#39;t work.   If you want to break them you just have to increase the burden on the Hero nodes.  It&#39;s a Hero Narrative fail.</p>

<p>The most common way for Hierarchies to evolve themselves as a response to their critics is to encourage conformity.  With conformity they can remove the outliers.  Of course this is only a temporary fix.  It too is ultimately failing.  Conformity is the Monoculture Narrative, and this is also Bad Design, and ultimately will fail.  When you&#39;re in a monoculture it&#39;s like falling down an ever narrowing hole.  Monocultures erode themselves from within.  In addition, being mono, they provide a smaller exploitation challenge.</p>

<p>The people in power suck at design, and that&#39;s why and how they will fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am no fan of pacifism. Fighting does not have to mean going to war. As far as freedom goes, one man&#39;s freedom fighter is another man&#39;s terrorist. I have no doubt those that would take up arms would fall into that later category. We haven&#39;t seen anything like it in our time but there were times in this countries not to distant past that the government violently and ruthlessly put down those that tried to change things through violence. There are other ways to change the system that don&#39;t include a gun in hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all things are possible.  i see a threat of civil war because war, like all sustained conflict, requires a very strongly polarized duality (Note: Saturn is the &quot;god&quot; of war for this reason).  both sides have to get &quot;wound up&quot;.   the only candidate who has this kinda polarization is the Trump card.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought Mars was the Force associated with war, although to some Saturn is very important. All things are possible and you have to love the name is trump (trump card). </p>

<p>The reason to me that we are more likely to see large parts of the population banding together and fighting other organized groups is that the majority of the cities and counties are somewhat mixed through race and political belief. I think the south may be an exception. I think this would hinder the massing of 1000s of armed citizen to initially start a civil war. </p>

<p>What I could easily see is several militias/line gunman committing acts of violence and rebellion. If these acts went unchallenged by the government that could grow to something larger. I think it is important to know the government has plans on file to deal with every type of ranging from Russian invasion to Alien invasion and without a doubt citizen uprisings. I would imagine in a crisis anyone on the wrong side of them would be either imprisoned/killed/everything they owned taken away. </p>

<p>It is an interesting time to be an American. I have not seen this level of political chaos before and I must say it makes me a little nervous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could be right.  John Titor said to look at the map of election results historically to discern who&#39;s on which side.  I think there&#39;s some merit to this overly broad heuristic.</p>

<p>As to the gov&#39;s role.  I can only address the surface and try to infer stuff from that.  The gov has loads of continuity of gov plans.  It&#39;s built a machine to address the militia/civil war thing.  So I would expect the gov to act like a machine.  If trigger events happen it will respond.  This does not bode well for anyone.  Such a conflict between the state and the citizens will not go well and will lead to decades of problems, some of which may be impossible to heal.  Such a conflict would inevitably fracture the country into several pieces.  That&#39;s just how human psychology works.  </p>

<p>Fighting isn&#39;t the answer, imo.  It&#39;s played out.  Alternate approaches which don&#39;t destroy have to be tried first.  Freeman Fly and Frater X have an idea they term the &quot;Friendship Agenda&quot;.  I think this is exactly the way to start.</p>
