<p>Think about the implications. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of Trump and participate in that subreddit, you&#39;re being trolled. Guaranteed. This is the same guy who passionately and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/db6e0/about_ron_paul/">zealously smeared Ron Paul for the past 8 years.</a></p>

<p>Exactly. When you pass into the top 1% of earners in this country your interests conglomerate. Trump and Clinton are probably friendly outside of the media circus behind closed doors. They&#39;re both crooked and they know it. </p>

<p>Trump says nice things about the guy, before he could have known any of his BS, and it&#39;s equal to Bill flying on the plane 20+ times as well as 30+ allegations of sexual assault?</p>

<p>Such types of comments are beyond reason. They don&#39;t make any sense. They are spins. And when mods of r/conspiracy are engaging in such ridiculous spins, it contaminates the sub.</p>

I don&#39;t consider that a favor. In addition, he only goes half-way. He acknowledges 9/11 is a lie, but doesn&#39;t tell the important part about Israel and others in our own government being responsible. Know why? Because he wants to pin it on Saudi Arabia. That is the next target, the 28 pages have been for Saudi Arabia this whole time, since 9/11. They were using it as a get-into-war free card for whenever they wanted. And Trump is, willingly or unwillingly playing right into the plan. I would guess willingly. He played a large role in the 9/11 scam.</p>

<p>Forgive me for taking Ron Paul&#39;s word over yours. Bernie wasn&#39;t a candidate when this came out. He had no particular reason to go after him, except being upset with his actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump was propped up by the corporate media while Sanders was blackballed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not disputing that a socialist was blackballed by the &quot;corporate&quot; media. On the other hand, &quot;Trump was propped up&quot;, you mean the 24 reporters the WaPo has working on a smear campaign against Trump or the one that the NYTs did?</p>

<p>You mean how CNN adds shit like this: (he does) to things he says to make him look like he lied, when he hadn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Or the Michelee Fields shit Cooper tried to pull?</p>

<p>Or how he said he isn&#39;t for a &quot;federal&quot; minimum wage, but would leave it up to the states and all MSM says he was back-pedalling (he wasn&#39;t)?</p>

<p>Is that the propping up you describe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders agreed to modify the measure in a way that requires audits of the Fed during the financial crisis but not of the bank&#39;s monetary policy. I agree that his version of the bill was lacking teeth compared to Paul&#39;s but I assume he did it as some kind of compromise as he knew the corporatist Democrats/Republicans would never vote yes for Paul&#39;s version of the bill.</p>

<p>And why do you think the corporate media has interest in blackballing a socialist candidate? Because he is in legitimate opposition to corporate power.</p>

<p>As for Trump, the media has spend so much time talking about Trump, while completely ignoring Sanders. Sanders would of easily won the Democratic election if his campaign wasn&#39;t purely internet based. </p>

<p>I do agree though that the oligarchy prefers Hillary for president compared to Trump. Now, if Trump were to actually block the TPP, make the US protectionist by enforcing tariffs and quotas on imports and reduces access to cheap labor through illegal immigration I would be impressed. But I&#39;m not buying it yet. Fool me once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, for the last several elections I would have been saying the same, but not this time. </p>

<p>Trump has brought up all the BS games that they are playing:</p>

<p>Destabilizing nations,</p>

<p>Arming ISIS;</p>

<p>Using ISIS for globalist ends;</p>

<p>creating refugees and trying to flood the US;</p>

<p>9/11 as an inside job;</p>

<p>man-made Climate Change hoax.</p>

<p>Things that we have been discussing on this sub. No other candidate has come close to dropping the truth that Trump has.</p>

<p>While i agree that jcm seems to be a cocky little shit, and I believe goes by teh_donald now, it doesn&#39;t change that Trump has brought up issues and forced them onto the MSM.</p>

<p>He is the only candidate talking about putting our energy back to use, Clinton and Bernie want to force us off coal and oil while flooding us with ever more people who hate our guts.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You just pulled that out of your ass. The people of the US are perfectly within their right to NOT maintain their demographic composition. See I can also make random value statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not some random thing out of my ass – it&#39;s the very basis of nationalism, conservatism, and identitarianism. The US is simply <em>not</em> a &quot;proposition nation&quot;, you ignorant dummy. There is a reason why we used to only let in &quot;free white persons of good character&quot;.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t find many people willing to serve a nation that doesn&#39;t wish to preserve the identity of the citizens who founded, built, and maintained it. Would you object to Whites migrating to Nigeria en masse, completely diluting and destroying the authentic identity of the Nigerians? Do you object to the manner in which Israelis demographically dispossessed the Palestinians? Do you object to how the Chinese demographically cleansed the Tibetan people?</p>

<p>Well guess what – if you allow it, the exact same thing will happen to the US (and the entire Western world as well).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because that matters fuck all to me. What matters to me is the preservation of humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you want the unique cultures and identities of the world to be gradually phased out and replaced with a highly-atomized, low-trust, &quot;global&quot; society where we have no shared values, everyone is mixed race, and consumerism is king. That&#39;s a nice little Marxist utopian fantasy you have there, but it&#39;s not pragmatic/feasible and won&#39;t stand a chance against much stronger ideologies like Islam and Zionism.</p>

<p>Do you really think that after every Western nation loses its identity and sovereignty, that protectionist/nationalist nations like Russia, China, and Israel will want to follow down the same road!? Of course not. Your utopia is ugly and will never happen – time for you to grow up and stop living in fantasy land.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system has been bought and paid for by the business owners that pretty much hold our society together. In a politician&#39;s eyes, a bribe has a greater return than fighting for the approval of the peasantry. He is not wrong. Most bribes are more than most of us make in a year and that usually entails a promise of even greater returns. If he agrees to represent his owner&#39;s interests than he is usually guaranteed a cushy position in the company or he continues as a representative. We can futilely fight against a system that is exponentially increasing in power every year and we can complain about it, but that won&#39;t get us anywhere. No one is listening and no one in charge cares. Those that try to fight in the open are ignored and marginalized. </p>

<p>The only real solution in this case is to wait. A system this encompassing will inevitably collapse under it&#39;s own wait as it spends itself into oblivion fighting enemies that don&#39;t exist in order to maintain an illusion of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thats a powerful statement and i fully agree with everything you &#39;ve said. What bothers me is the &quot;waiting&quot;, because i think there comes a time when we all are &quot;lined up&quot; so to say. Registered, all movements saved, every internet post analyzed. We are already there tbh.</p>

<p>Knock Knock.</p>

<p>The longer we wait, the more this becomes reality IMO, but i have no short time solution anyway, so i&#39;ll wait with you. </p>

<p>Fight the power, eat the rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then play the roll of a sheep. Bide your time until they let down their guard. Basically, play lip service until the time to strike is right. Right now, they expect insurrection. Coming at them from the front is suicide. Wait for the enemy to expose their weaknesses and they will have done most of the work for you. Take a step back and watch what will happen to those that resist. With the might of our military unleashed, they won&#39;t even see who kills them. The days of fighting infantry against infantry are pure fantasy.</p>
