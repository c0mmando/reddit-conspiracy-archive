    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></p>

<p>Here we go, me attempting to tiptoe around the hot potato! I have had my fair share of warnings...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> All the major Reddit subs are being censored extensively. It happens from behind the scene, a block box contraptions by design, to control the flow of information on Reddit. If your post contains articles or reveal crimes about the following subjects: The US Military, US Intelligence Community, T.B.T.F. Financial Institutions, Mega Corporations, US Politics, US Economic Data, Economic Inequality, Social Unrest, the Corporate Owned Mass Media or certain well connected individuals you will become a targeted of their censorship. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> Their favorite methods: 1) Algorithms that automatically detect specific wordings 2) Banning of certain independent media outlets. 3) Subtle vote rigging. 4) Manual removal of posts (last resort). 5) Intimidation. 6) Banning of accounts. 7) Allowing trolling by Shills &amp; Pundits. It is a very smooth and professional operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> A core of loyal followers and employees. If they don&#39;t want you to see what is going on, you won&#39;t s see it. By design, we can&#39;t fully observe the process, nor can we tell the entities apart. We can make patient observations. We can take notes. Patterns emerges. We are not allowed to talk about our observations or criticize &quot;them&quot;, that would be a violation of rule #2 #5 #10. Catch <del>17</del> 22!</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Reddit has been censoring users and independent media sources for years, with an increasing zeal, they are censoring them because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. They punch holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, polarization and lies. <em>The recipe for destroying the corporate propaganda is straight forward: Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity.</em> Reddit is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publication Inc</a> a de facto Corporate Owned Mass Media outlet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5) (As an Example)</em></strong> There is a lot of racist postings on the front page of r/conspiracy, thinly disguised as &quot;conspiracy anti-Israel posts&quot;. They constantly make up 10-20% of the front page volume if you don&#39;t repeatedly remove them. There is a lot of wedge issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. On top of that you can add irrelevant trivia and celebrity gossip, all designed to distract and entertain. What you have left is maybe 5% of relevant content. This is how &quot;they&quot; are dumbing down the conspiracy forum and Reddit in general, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots padding each other on the back. People kind of know, everything looks more and more like CNN and BBC, while the intelligentsia is fleeing the forum.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I admire the Moderators who had the integrity to quit today, they did the right thing, they distanced them self from totalitarianism.  </p>

<p>Once it&#39;s discovered who their old banned account was, the reality is always that you did everything in your power to get banned, had second and third chances given to you in appeals, and still couldn&#39;t stop acting like an angsty pre-teen long enough make good on your end of the appeal agreement.</p>

<p>Who is surprised? This is just evidence of it. At least the moderators who are quitting sounds like they are going to knock that shit off:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ways in which we will differ from <a href="/r/HillaryClinton">/r/HillaryClinton</a> include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Less banning</p></li>
<li><p>Less censorship</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like a combination of both. From what I can gather, the top moderator was censoring nearly all comments in the subreddit. Several moderators started complaining about it, the top moderator demodded them. Because of that, the 23 mods have posted a resignation notice on <a href="/r/enoughsandersspam">/r/enoughsandersspam</a>, although some of them are still listed as mods on the main subreddit.

<p>It&#39;s the most politically corrupt subreddit I&#39;ve seen. In fact almost all the major city subs I follow censor real news, and anything that isn&#39;t censored is filled with shills pushing false narratives orchestrating downvote brigades against any opposition. </p>
