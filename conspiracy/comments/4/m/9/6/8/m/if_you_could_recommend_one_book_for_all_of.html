<p>The breadth and depth of critical thinking in this work is unreal. The Five Regimes, the 3 Classes, the Allegory of the Cave and just the constant questioning of everything by Socrates was really something to read. It was the 2nd book I read that put me on this path (the first being an introductory work by an independent author who recommended reading The Republic, amongst many other works that I am still treading through). Your skills for educational debate and sound reasoning will grow when you finish that book.</p>

<p>Thereupon many statesmen and philosophers came to Alexander with their congratulations, and he expected that Diogenes of Sinope also, who was tarrying in Corinth, would do likewise. But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many people coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, <strong>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Diogenes, &quot;stand a little out of my sun</strong>.&quot;[7] It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, &quot;But truly, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.&quot;[8]</p>

<p>Because it shows an undercurrent of nazi-sympathizing cryptofascism that pervaded the US / Western intelligence community from the importation of 1800 ish nazi ss scientists into our milititary research intelligence programs via project paperclip to operation artichoke and the mind control experiments of mkultra.  Allen Dulles was the head of OSS which became CIA.  It shows how the Dulles brothers used a shell corporation united fruit company to move nazi money around and fund blackops projects; a practice that&#39;s still used by todays neocon fascist knights of malta doubleagents in the CIA to sell drugs, launder money, maintain pedo networks and exfiltrate human sex slaves around the planet through international freemasons.  (actually not sure if this freemason connection in this particular book, or if it jsut hints at it--I could be thinking of &quot;Essential Mae Brussell: Fascism in America&quot;)  Dulles was a real bastard, but it&#39;s not just him--he started a whole league of bushlings that looked up to him and exalt him as some kind of hero-spy-pirate of the aristocratic elite.</p>

I found the most revealing aspect of this book (I think the CIA being involved in the JFK assassination at this point is widely accepted as probable) to be Truman&#39;s op ed in the New York Times, citing his regret in ever forming the CIA to begin with.</p>

<p>Thoreau argues that individuals should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that they have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice.</p>

<p>It also offers a brief view of how little work Americans used to have to do in order to be able to live a decent life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are only 2 issues I&#39;ve found with her: One is that she claims to have known all about 9/11 prior and didn&#39;t alert the public, and two, that in her speech I viewed, she chuckles and smiles in a bizarre way throughout her presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G43zl4fzDQg">here</a>.  Come to think of it, my SO and I also wondered how it is that she was always chosen to deliver various messages to heads of state.  There must be hundreds of CIA assets, if not thousands, (and they work on a need to know basis), so why was it always her?  Anyway, I have a few doubts about her, but want to believe what she says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; analysis of Carol Quigley&#39;s Tragedy and Hope, an inside view of the Rhodes/ Milner Roundtables which had huge influence on Western foreign policy through the 20th century.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_and_Hope">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_and_Hope</a></p>

<p>To go a step further on your western foreign policy, read Zbigniew Brzezinski&#39;s Grand Chessboard, which outlines the great game foreign policy of the later part of the 20th century and into the 21st.</p>

<p>And Brzezinski cites Antony C Sutton as an overlooked academic who argued that US economic/ political interests played a key role in the growth of the Nazi and Soviet empires.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or impressive evidence of Western participation in the early phase of Soviet economic growth, see Antony C. Sutton&#39;s Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1917–1930, which argues that &#39;Soviet economic development for 1917–1930 was essentially dependent on Western technological aid&#39; (p.283), and that &#39;at least 95 per cent of the industrial structure received this assistance.&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why not read Hoover Institution scholar Antony C Sutton&#39;s treatise on The Skull and Bones Society, which Sutton claimed (in 1985) was a chapter of a Germanic death cult which aspires to control global finance, wars and education in pursuit of a new world order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  You&#39;ll be disappointed about his views on 9/11 too I think.  The question is how &quot;controlled&quot; are they really?  It&#39;s possible (IMO even probable) that both are basically just agents acting as gatekeepers for people who are starting to question some of the mainstream narratives.  It doesn&#39;t negate the value of their work entirely but it does cast them in a very different light.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it seems so much of academia and the media are involved in propaganda and intelligence projects, from the lowliest of the low to the highest levels.</p>

Our present culture went from horse and buggy to walking on the moon in less than a century, it is not far fetched to suggest that a civilization that existed 600 million years ago went there as well, it&#39;s a logical first step to space travel.</p>

How did they get there? They were certainly there before the lava flowed across the land. The evidence is out there but you have to read the book.</p>

<p>This book was passed around my fire team about five years ago and it provided for some interesting discussions. It also helped me look at the geopolitical landscape a bit differently.

<p>It reflects a bit on 9/11, the petro-dollar, spy craft, and takes place during this time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seconded! As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is the book that defines the conspiracy fiction genre. This book changed my life.</p>

<p>As I understand it, this book was first conceived when the authors, both Playboy editors at the time, asked themselves:</p>

<p><em>What if ALL of the &#39;letters to the editor&#39; Playboy receives, from the most mundane to the most &#39;whacked out&#39; were true at once?</em></p>

<p>The book, written in the style of James-Joyce-on-an-acid-trip, covers literally THOUSANDS of conspiracy theories; features ufos, yellow submarines (and the madmen who captain them), nazi zombies, several apocolypses, sexual tarot, the TRUE history of Atlantis, and too many fnords to count!</p>

<p>Selected quotes: </p>

<p>&quot;..never trust anyone with the initials H.C.&quot; ~Hagbard Celine</p>

<p>&quot;Think for Yourself, Schmuck!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If they ever hang you, you&#39;ll be arguing about whether the rope really exists until the last minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only the madman is absolutely sure.&quot;</p>

<p>AND... for those of you who prefer &quot;truth&quot; to &quot;fiction&quot;... I would also highly recommend &quot;Cosmic Trigger: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot;, also by Robert Anton Wilson (RAW). Cosmic Trigger explores many of the same themes as Illuminatus, but from a decidedly more rational standpoint.</p>

<p>A perfect encapsulation of what a tireless mind can accomplish in an otherwise dull world.  Rather than blaming the world for his own inadequacies, Pessoa seized control of himself and his ego to become one of the greatest writers in the 20th century.  The history surrounding him is also infinitely interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything that people have suggested here, the Bush Family, War being a racket, the CIA... None of it would have been able to occur (the benefits derived in the pursuits of war, etc) without the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>It happened in Europe through the Rothschild Family, but in this country (with the help of the Rothschilds) it happened in 1913.</p>

<p>My suggestion for a complete wake-up would be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/0912986212">The Creature From Jekyll Island</a></p>

<p>To my knowledge, no other book covers the span of history, across 2,000 years of money and banking from Diocletian to the Rothschilds to Alan Greenspan and ties it all into the new world order. </p>

<p>You learn how the plotters of the Fed, through bribery and manipulation of the public and Government (who are to blame in part due to corruption, part stupidity, and part not learning from history) were already affiliated with the conspiratorial British &quot;one world&quot; Round Table Group. This group was the predecessor of the Council on Foreign Relations (essentially the deep state). </p>

<p>It&#39;s astounding how they both deceived and bribed Congress to get this unconstitutional act pushed through creating the Insiders’ fundamental tool - a central bank with the ability to inflate money...which in turn compelled our country to enter into wars ever since.  The Fed— directly or indirectly—has given rise to the UN, NATO, OSS (now the CIA), the drug war, nuclear power as weapons, the Bilderberg Group, and the destruction of our currency. </p>

<p>After its creation, the Fed and the government/banking/intelligence elite behind it, eventually expanded internationally through The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in order to create worldwide inflation, pay enormous sums of perpetual interest on never paid-up loans to Insider banks, and socialize the Third World, all courtesy of us unsuspecting taxpayers.</p>

<p>Further, every financial debacle can be traced to the Fed. The book was published in 1994, so it details events only through the Savings and Loan scandal... But it&#39;s easy to understand how things work under the Fed: a corrupt cabal was created between the banksters and the government to control money, policy, currency, and ultimately...power. Thus,  Oklahoma City, 9/11, and everything after that dominate this sub on a daily basis... all have their roots in the federal reserve. </p>

<p>It truly is the enabler of all the evil/ corrupt &quot;rackets&quot; and nefarious individuals mentioned in this post.</p>

<p>Read it. Nothing will look the same again. There are free copies online if you know how to Google... Or ask me and I can loan you my epub. (<sup>_-)☆</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are We Rome by Cullen Murphy</p>

<p>Technically not MY recommendation, since I haven&#39;t read it yet, but it was recommended to me and is next on my list. Speaking of which, today&#39;s a good day to start a new book.</p>

<p>A summary:  The rise and fall of ancient Rome has been on American minds from the beginning of our republic.Today we focus less on the Roman Republic than on the empire that took its place. Depending on who’s doing the talking, the history of Rome serves as either a triumphal call to action or a dire warning of imminent collapse. In Are We Rome? the esteemed editor and author Cullen Murphy reveals a wide array of similarities between the two empires: the blinkered, insular culture of our capitals; the debilitating effect of bribery in public life; the paradoxical issue of borders; and the weakening of the body politic through various forms of privatization. Murphy persuasively argues that we most resemble Rome in the burgeoning corruption of our government and in our arrogant ignorance of the world outside -- two things that must be changed if we are to avoid Rome’s fate.</p>
