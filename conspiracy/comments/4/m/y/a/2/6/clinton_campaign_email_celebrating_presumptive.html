<p>Ya. Like the BBC reporting WTC7 fell half an hour before it actually fell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s standing in front of a green screen, with old video playing behind her. This is common on news programs, especially when they don&#39;t have a nice view out their studio windows. BBC&#39;s NYC bureau was (and still is) located at 1120 Avenue of the Americas on the 5th Floor, which would make this perspective of Building 7 impossible. </p>

<p>They screwed up by using outdated B-Roll of WTC 7 still standing, but there isn&#39;t really a conspiracy here. The Daily Show does the same thing when they go &quot;live&quot; to their &quot;Middle East Conflict Correspondent&quot; reporting from Tahrir Square, but they&#39;re not really actually there. (In those cases, they&#39;re usually in the same studio)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you miss the point.  How did they know WTC7 was going to fall, before it fell? That was live TV aired half an hour before the actual collapse.</p>

<p>They reported it fell but in reality it wouldn&#39;t fall for like another 23 minutes.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like Silverstein saying they decided to &quot;pull it&quot; means he had some say in the First Responders pulling out.   That&#39;s absurd. WTC7 didn&#39;t crumble in its own footprint from office fires and minor structural damage. That defies logic, physics and common sense.</p>

<p>Thousands of highly decorated and experienced structural engineers and architects agree that 1+1 doesn&#39;t = 3.</p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t matter what <em>you</em> think .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC 7 fell at 5:20 PM local NYC time. The BBC video is from their 11 PM nightly news program, and the youtube video is taken from the Europe feed. London is 5 hours ahead, so when the video was filmed it was 6:00 pm in New York, and 11:00 pm in London. WTC 7 had fallen about 30 minutes BEFORE the BBC feed, but they didn&#39;t have any video of it, just the news, so they stupidly used B-Roll from earlier in the day. </p>

<p>Why do you think this video was filmed before 5:20 PM EST? This is taken from their nightly 11:00 pm broadcast, which is 6:00 pm U.S. time.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep doing your googling. It&#39;s well known it was aired before wtc7 actually fell. The most common excuse is &quot;they were notified it was going to fall&quot; and just aired the story early...</p>

<p>I mean damn. If you&#39;re going to attempt to downplay something at least know what you&#39;re talking about..</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>InstanceID gives the date last saved for the PSD, but not the date it was saved in another format (or exported, actually) through &quot;save for web and devices&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have Photoshop, try it for yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a PSD, save it, close it.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait a few minutes, open it again, paste something in, select &quot;save for web and devices&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload it <a href="http://regex.info/exif.cgi">here</a> to get the InstanceID (or use ExifTool), and paste that into <a href="https://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen">the site you linked</a> (format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx).</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the datetime to the moment you last saved the PSD and the moment you created the jpg. You&#39;ll see that it matches the former, not the latter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing this tells us is that their designer is a bit lazy and didn&#39;t save a copy of the updated PSD before exporting it.</p>
