    <div class="md"><p>If you can&#39;t beat em&#39; join em&#39;. </p>

<p>Nothing is more frustrating to me as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; than the apathy of the American public. </p>

<p>I often wonder what it will take for the masses to awake from their slumber and feel that red,white and blue dick in their asses. I really think that as long as the water is running, as long as the drive-thrus are still cranking out that food-cancer, and people still have cable television and wi-fi, nothing will change. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;ve become a pessimist. </p>

<p>Anyways, I digress, even if the elite choose to remove these luxuries incrementally they will be able to get away with it. I know I paint a bleak picture, but barring some sort of major financial collapse, which I don&#39;t see in the cards, the pitchforks will not come out like they would in Europe. I think Americans simply lack the fortitude to rise up against the upper classes. Maybe its something we were capable of in the 30&#39;s, but not anymore, the pussification of Americans is unbelievable. </p>

<p>You can talk about anything, except class warfare. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why the media has spent the last 6 months ignoring or insulting Bernie Sanders. </p>

<p>Honestly, the only thing that gives me hope these days, is that young people realize they are being fucked and they mobilized around an anti-establishment candidate like Sanders. I think that the DNC really screwed themselves over by so transparently putting their finger on the scale for Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>It was pretty clear to young people who aren&#39;t even &quot;conspiracy-minded&quot; that Bernie was getting fucked over by the establishment Democrats. I saw articles make it to the front page of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> calling out the Democratic establishment like I have never seen before. </p>

<p>Hopefully the tide is turning, we won&#39;t know for sure until the Boomers die off. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do raise a good point and a good question. What do people deserve? Do people deserve an oppressive government if they don&#39;t do anything about it? If you are robbed at gunpoint or someone steals things from your home while you are away did you deserve that? You would have let the person rob you, or you would have had a house that allowed a person to break in and steal some stuff. Plus that is all if it happens to you, should you care if its someone else that gets robbed? </p>

<p>All of this comes down to what you define as right and what is wrong. Once you define what is right and wrong for yourself does that also apply to others? Is what is right and good and true the same for all people?</p>

<p>Does not caring and not standing up for people who aren&#39;t standing up for themselves compromise what is right? None of these comments and questions really answer what people really deserve but it does point more towards what we as individuals must consider for ourselves. We all have our own lines we draw in the sand and we all have our own versions of what is right, what is deserved, what is wrong, and what we will allow. The people are just a collection of these individuals. I don&#39;t know what the people deserve, but I do have some idea of what I think is right and I also don&#39;t think it is a good idea to compromise what is right.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in my particular case, I know for a fact that dotgov experiments, that were lied about until the Rockefeller Commission, and had all the documents shredded by a now exec dir of a nsa linked surveillance CO had a direct and definite negative impact on my life and on many, many others. The people that are affected by some of our dotgov crap are the ones suffering.  I will leave it at project paperclip, Edgewood arsenal and the wonderful science they were engaging in. You are no dummy. They perfected the dark arts and unleashed them. Good thing we have plenty more innocents lining up for that better life, or dotgov might just dissolve. That would really be a shame. Or, maybe not. BTW family links to many events and places in ww2 so my family history is probably a factor. I refused to join dotgov, or any part of the MIC, and still do. Until the rot is removed the liberty tree can&#39;t grow. The fuck them ,we are special mentality is a symptom. Make your paper but know who you work for. Coersion and subversion seem to be how dotgov gets shit done. Not in my name, and not with my help. At least not with my consent.

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, the distress went away. Turns out when scientist use actual magick for profit there are unintended consequences. I am not able to walk you through my process, but will say that we have completely and utterly disfinctional government and governing for a reason. You are another really smart and well read sort. Mae Brussel has stuff on paperclip. And the various mk___ programs. And from what I am reading digging deeper they were doing a lot of the same things they did here in konzentration camps, and learning hospitals In Germany before they got brought here. For science or something.  Interestingly when I used my googlefoo to see what comes up on certain key words I was given on paper some thirty yrs ago I found interesting and distressing things. I just tried it again, but when googling paramilitary mind control about a month ago this is what.cameup as my second listing right below the ad  <a href="https://ritualabuse.us/">https://ritualabuse.us/</a> 
I don&#39;t mean to burst your bubble, but at this point it is safe to say that the things they were testing worked. Apparently very well. Just not for those in the families of the test subjects.</p>

<p>Have you tried to kill these fascists yet? If not, then you are just as much of a &quot;slave&quot; as I am.</p>

<p>I guess all mods have their own triggers, but one of mine is people coming here suggesting that violence and specifically, killing people (be it Hillary, Trump, Jews, Muslims, blacks, whites whoever) is a legitimate or viable solution to their grievances. Cut that shit out, or I will excise you from this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, even IF the people were able to get organized enough and attempt to take back power from the Oligarchs, the Oligarchs are fully prepared to quell the people and make an example out of those who rebelled to make sure the complicit ones don&#39;t do the same. What do you think the militarized police are for? Same for the &quot;anti terrorism laws.&quot; They worked for so long to get to where they are now. They won&#39;t give up what they stole regardless of how much we protest. &quot;It&#39;s a giant club and you&#39;re not in it.&quot;</p>
