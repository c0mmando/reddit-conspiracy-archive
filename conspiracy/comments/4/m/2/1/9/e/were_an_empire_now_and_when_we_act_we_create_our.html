        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a quote that I&#39;m sure many of you are familiar with already, it&#39;s attributed to Karl Rove who was Senior Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff during the George W. Bush administration. </p>

<p>I always find myself coming back to this quote, I&#39;m baffled as to how people weren&#39;t (still aren&#39;t) highly alarmed by such a flagrant display of totalitarian disregard of public opinion coming from someone so close to the president. It&#39;s so ominously worded and I feel perfectly captures the re-occurring theme of problem-reaction-solution in this increasingly dystopian world of ours.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to watch any more news broadcasts, or documentaries, or read any more books or articles to know that state deception, conspiracy and rampant disregard for human life isn&#39;t rare. It&#39;s normal. Fuck studying the actions of these psychopaths. They only continue to exist because people participate in their inherently corrupt systems and allow them continue existing through submission of our time and attention. I know it&#39;s hard not to get caught up in the banter surrounding the political circus that comes around like clockwork every few years in an attempt to make people believe they care about (or even have a say) in the mechanisms of government. That&#39;s not how things work though.</p>

<p>History teaches us again and again that the law is just as often as not used as an instrument of oppression, social control and plunder. The headlines are replete with stories of corruption scandal and wickedness, all of which carry little to no repercussions for those involved so long as they are well connected. The law is plenty flexible for those who have the muscle to bend it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to study Karl Rove and his cohort&#39;s actions any longer to understand all of this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what a better world will look like, but I know it will never be achieved by participating in the current systems which are setup to frustrate, rob, and undermine any attempts at change that does not benefit the current ruling class.</p>

<p>You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. </p>

<p>Find every loophole, leverage black or grey markets, and thrive in EVERY aspect of life my friends!</p>

<p>Quote in context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The aide said that guys like me were &quot;in what we call the reality-based community,&quot; which he defined as people who &quot;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.&quot; I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. &quot;That&#39;s not the way the world really works anymore,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&#39;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#39;re studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we&#39;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#39;s how things will sort out. We&#39;re history&#39;s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot;</p>

<p>You think?</p>

<p>This is &quot;Coincidence Theory&quot; folks.  It says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep calm, try to understand the world around you.  Things keep happening, don&#39;t ask why.  Your friends say it&#39;s a false flag event by freemasons, I tell him to fetch his tinfoil hat.  There&#39;s no reason for why things happen.  They just do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By calling it &#39;Reality based&#39;, you&#39;ve framed it as inherently truthful.  This whole concept has contributed to the large numbers of people in america who still do not question 9/11 because they&#39;ve bought karl Rove&#39;s &quot;coincidence theory&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the quote as a confirmation of the new world order, his participation and cocreation of it; and an additional confirmation of freemasons and affiliates running a secret society that acts as &#39;the wizard of oz&#39;, creating false realities and casting wide illusions in the form of false flaggotry, all the while leading people to the conclusion that a society of the spectacle is self-actualizing.</p>

<p>In other words, he confirmed in this one quote, everything I believed to be true, cementing my view and restoring my sanity.  So I&#39;m grateful for it.  No matter how repugnant it appears on the surface--its&#39; at least honest in some perverted way.</p>
