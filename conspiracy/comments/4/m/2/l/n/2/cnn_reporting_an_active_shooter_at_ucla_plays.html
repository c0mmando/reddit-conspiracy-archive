<p>I don&#39;t think it was planned or anything like that but the pro-$hillary media is going to jump on this like a gift from god and then they are going to club Bernie over the head with his record on guns, which is extremely reasonable but they could care less since the end goal is president $hillary.

<p>However,  if you research the Professor you will find that he is indeed a Ucla Teacher of  many years and has published a number of books. <a href="http://www.mae.ucla.edu/william-klug/">www.mae.ucla.edu/william-klug/</a><br/>
Interestingly though, I could not find a review on ratemyprofessor.com (except for Rip posted today) and the UCLA registrar system was down, so I could not view the spring 2016 list of classes.
I&#39;d like to hear some empirical/logic oriented points being discussed and not just coincidences, especially if being cited as &quot;evidence.&quot; I live in La and am Pro-gun, so this is of particular interest to me and I&#39;d like to get as close to the truth as possible.</p>

<p>Ah, ok. I tend to avoid the label, myself and labeling others, because you and I may have different ideas about what is liberal etc.. Identifying as one will result in one of two things; blanket acceptance from your peers or blanket write off from those who identify themselves differently that you. Either way there is not usually in depth discussion of a topic if either person involved identifies themselves as Liberal Conservitave etc... We just revert back to what we believe the other thinks.

    <div class="md"><p>Same shit, different day. &quot;OH, I don&#39;t like this person running, so let&#39;s tell everyone they will ban guns!&quot; yeah, we have heard it all before. Twice with Obama.  Some folks cry wolf.</p>

<p>And I know how executive orders work :)  Congress may overturn an Executive order by a two-thirds vote. The United States Supreme Court can declare that an Executive order is unconstitutional and unenforceable. Additionally, a subsequent president can reverse an Executive order.</p>

<p>So even if she rushes in like people swore on bibles that Obama was gonna do and bans all guns it would be short lived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously a complete gun ban would not be tolerated, but that&#39;s not what I worry about. It&#39;s the small, incremental actions that creep closer and closer to a complete gun ban. </p>

<p>And while I agree with you a lot of people said that about Obama, Hilary has been WAY more vocal in her career about being anti-gun. It&#39;s pretty much the only opinion that she has been consistent with. </p>

<p>If trump gets elected I hope he does a great job, same as I hope for with hillary.</p>

<p>But we all know how it works - start wars, trash economy, renew awb, etc and if you are named bush and a republican you get cheered and saluted and people are proud to call you their president.</p>

<p>Have a president that expands where you can carry guns, gets the economy going again, doesn&#39;t lie us into wars, and he is the most evil thing ever and real americans should hate him and cheer for america to fall so they can say &#39;see, told you we weren&#39;t dumb and wrong&#39;</p>

<p>Some people value party over country. And some people only know how to spread irrational fear.</p>

<p>They&#39;re breaking down walls of privacy guaranteed by HIPAA so that they can create a mental-health checklist instead of a state-level list that is made by calling hospitals and such, now they will go to the NSA and this list will be adjacent to the no-fly list, and they will all be connected in the future, I&#39;m sure. Gun ownership already can get you no-knock swat raids, even if there is no proof of a crime. I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t want to be no-knock swatted for practicing ownership of something that is not illegal. I don&#39;t want my privacy infiltrated when I am innocent. These are the types of things that are going on.</p>

<p>edit: Whether or not you agree with gun-ownership, this is a very important issue. It shows how blatantly our government is willing to violate the constitution, and if they&#39;re willing to do that, think of what else they&#39;re willing to do. </p>
