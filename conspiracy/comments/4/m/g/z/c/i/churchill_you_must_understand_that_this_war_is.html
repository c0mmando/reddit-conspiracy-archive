    <div class="md"><p>If you look at actual history, it&#39;s only a few years later many of the greatest general were dead. </p>

<p>Stalin killed many that were a threat. That was detrimental come the start of the next war. </p>

<p>They went from absolute power, to very little in a couple of decades? That seems far fetched. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were they really dead within a few years? Haig was alive and kicking for the British (and probably was the greatest of WW1). Then again Britain was certainly not controlled by its Generals. </p>

<p>As for Hitler and Stalin, to me it doesn&#39;t seem far fetched at all that the generals fell so far from power. Stalin had the great purge (where he killed thousands upon thousands of generals). </p>

<p>As for Hitler, well for a few years after taking power the army may have been able to take over. But they warned against remilitarising the Rhineland, taking the sudatenland and attacking Poland. Who wanted this? Hitler, he appeared to be better than his generals so their influence declined. After the fall of France Hitler created many Marshals, devaluing the title and thus increasing his own power. As for Rommel well he was implicated in an assassination attempt on Hitler so that explains why he was forced to commit suicide, he didn&#39;t have him killed for no reason</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To contrast perceptions of “absolute evil” and “absolute good”.</p>

<p>Atrocity propaganda is how we won the war. And we&#39;re only really beginning with it now! We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will escalate it until nobody will accept even a good word from the Germans, until all the sympathy they may still have abroad will have been destroyed and they themselves will be so confused that they will no longer know what they are doing. Once that has been achieved, once they begin to run down their own country and their own people, not reluctantly but with eagerness to please the victors, only then will our victory be complete. It will never be final. Reeducation needs careful tending, like an English lawn. Even one moment of negligence and the weeds crop up again–those indestructible weeds of historical truth.
<strong>– Sefton Delmer</strong>, British chief of `black propaganda’, 1945, in a conversation with German professor of international law Dr. Friedrich Grimm</p>
