       Churchill refused to even consider a compromise that would have made war unnecessary. Even after war was declared, there was a long period when some accord could have been made with Germany, but Churchill
       <em>
        wanted war
       </em>
       and wouldn't have it any other way.

       The Willy Nicky telegrams do show us that they weren't really in control, now instead of jumping to Jesuits etc look at the actual history. The German and Russian Generals had huge amounts of influence and if I'm honest they scared the Tsar and Kaiser into war

       If you look at actual history, it's only a few years later many of the greatest general were dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalin killed many that were a threat. That was detrimental come the start of the next war.
      </p>
      <p>
       When things got ugly hitlers were killed too like rommell
      </p>
      <p>
       They went from absolute power, to very little in a couple of decades? That seems far fetched.

       Were they really dead within a few years? Haig was alive and kicking for the British (and probably was the greatest of WW1). Then again Britain was certainly not controlled by its Generals.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Hitler and Stalin, to me it doesn't seem far fetched at all that the generals fell so far from power. Stalin had the great purge (where he killed thousands upon thousands of generals).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Hitler, well for a few years after taking power the army may have been able to take over. But they warned against remilitarising the Rhineland, taking the sudatenland and attacking Poland. Who wanted this? Hitler, he appeared to be better than his generals so their influence declined. After the fall of France Hitler created many Marshals, devaluing the title and thus increasing his own power. As for Rommel well he was implicated in an assassination attempt on Hitler so that explains why he was forced to commit suicide, he didn't have him killed for no reason

       The English didn't like a strong united Germany because it would have made them 2nd class in nearly every category...  I somehow suspect that this rings true to this day.  Now that Germany is the economic powerhouse of the EU, the UK seems to want out...  I wonder if another catastrophe about to happen to middle Europe again that resets the scale in the English's favor?

       To contrast perceptions of “absolute evil” and “absolute good”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atrocity propaganda is how we won the war. And we're only really beginning with it now! We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will escalate it until nobody will accept even a good word from the Germans, until all the sympathy they may still have abroad will have been destroyed and they themselves will be so confused that they will no longer know what they are doing. Once that has been achieved, once they begin to run down their own country and their own people, not reluctantly but with eagerness to please the victors, only then will our victory be complete. It will never be final. Reeducation needs careful tending, like an English lawn. Even one moment of negligence and the weeds crop up again–those indestructible weeds of historical truth.
       <strong>
        – Sefton Delmer
