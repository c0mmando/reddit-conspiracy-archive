       As pointed out by another mod, the thread was removed due to the doxx contained in the body of the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       As has been covered here by other users, sarah_connor  used an alt account and suggested she was turning herself in to the FBI after a prolonged series of personal struggles, the sum of which culminated in some kind of poor decision making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mod team has not heard from Sarah in the time period after the message was sent, outside of confirming the story that was posted by the alt account; and we have been quite taken aback by how this series of events has unfolded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the potential of sarah's account being accessed by law enforcement in the coming days, we are taking steps in an attempt to have her account removed from the mod list.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that being said, Sarah was a long time member of this community, who spent a considerable amount of time thwarting infiltration and ensuring that moderators were held to a strict code of compliance with regards to the fundamental principle of free flowing information which has facilitated the continued success of this subreddit. For that alone, this community owes sarah a huge thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the privacy of those involved, we will, hopefully, be able to provide updates on the situation as more information is made available  to us.

       It wasn't that.  I don't really want to mention what it did say, as I don't want to be inaccurate.  I didn't say anything since I don't know them, and wasn't sure if someone was trolling or what.  But it wasn't posted under u/sarahconner.  But it was
       <em>
        signed

       u/sarahconner.

       The person expressed extreme alcohol abuse and sexual addiction but insisted it was not a pederast issue, twice. Hope to hell that is true and can be verified, as he said he has children.
