       The original number of the beast was 616.

       So really, if the Satanists wanted to use the real, old number, 6/16/16 Would have been a better choice....

       Let's take for a moment that even if the real number is 616, 666 still has meaning and power that they gave to it. They use it everywhere so even if the number 616, 666 can still be used as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, I'm aware of 616 as well
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I kinda don't want to argue but I felt I should mention that the Bible is based precept upon precept. In order for this particular theory to work, everything else leading up to that point in Revelations had to happen. There is only one race on the planet that went through 400 years of slavery spoken of in the Bible and that started in the 1600's. There is nothing else recorded before about it...
      </p>
      <p>
       So 616 = Roman Ruler = Not possible.

       They lose. They already know they lose, because they do have an understanding outside time. Since they are so angry about that, the only thing left for them is to take as many souls with them as they can. But they don't get mine.

       I think a lot of us more enlightened realize this. If the most powerful people in the world seem surrounded by the idea, it's only logical that they believe the same thing from the other perspective, which would mean that the suffering of the world is not without reason but on purpose.

       Ive come to realize that this is exactly the case. The hardship and negetive energy that has been in control does not seem like its just the way it turned out. I feel there are spiritual reasons for this as well. A few reasons but one being giving the people a catalyst for spiritual growth and learning. I dont feel like this is the last stop of consciousness and my and others being. But more that this is a stage or a cucoon so to speak that allows our souls and beings to learn and grow and mature.

       If you're an atheist then why are you worried about the devil or hell?  If you get killed you won't go to hell because it doesn't exist.  If you are worried about freemasons staging another fascist coup illusion like 9/11 or massacre at bologna (italy's 9/11) or london bombing 7/7 or paris bombing 11/11, stay at home and you can't be bombed in a large public event.

       Bible was written by man, not sure what your point is. The Creator (through prayer) told me you're full of shit and I should not believe in heretics, such as your self. Who is in the right, and who is usurping? You follow man, I follow the Creator ;)

       The video depicts ritual dances concerning Baal Worship. In the Bible Baal is referred to as the Devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Bible Jesus makes references to the Synagogue of Satan. Last month after Prince died, across the world they were unveiling the Arch of Baal in London.

       As for fully summarizing this particular video, I'm not so sure and I doubt I could summarize the full video of the dance either as it is far too crazy.

       Exactly, the Anti-christ will be a man exalted above all for the wrong reasons. Not only this, but the Hebrews had not gone through transgression yet. It was until the 1600's did the Hebrews go through the 400 year tribulation that was promised to them if they ever fell in Deuteronomy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Genesis 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them;
        <strong>
         and they shall afflict them four hundred years
        </strong>
        ;
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       This had not happened yet.

       Feel like you've definitely had a lot to offer in this sub, and I thank you for that. But you're off-base here.

       Best wishes to you. I hope you continue to pursue truth. You'll end up where many of us in this thread already are, I think.

       That said. I'm not nearly convinced anything big will be happening tomorrow, beyond whatever regular weird shit happens. I mean, no 9/11, 7/7, OKC, etc.

       I'm not saying that, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mockery is easy. And yet....like Proverbs says, "Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you."
      </p>
      <p>
       And, frankly, I don't think anything too big will happen tomorrow. For one thing, part of the success satan and the satanists have had is due to the fact they've been able to convince the mass of humanity he/they don't exist(s). So pulling something big on a date that's arguably (though not to me) 666, would not be in their favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I doubt satan will be sitting on any kind of throne in Jerusalem. Though you may have a hangover. I'd kick the sauce, if i were you. And I say that in a humanist sense, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best to you.

         Gerald Massey, English writer and author of the book, Egypt the Light of the World, wrote,

        "The dignity is so ancient that the insignia of the Pharaoh evidently belonged to the time when Egyptians wore nothing but the girdle of the Negro." (p 251)
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Sir Richard Francis Burton, a 19th century English explorer, writer and linguist in 1883 wrote to Gerald Massey,
        </strong>
        "You are quite right about the "AFRICAN" origin of the Egyptians. I have 100 human skulls to prove it."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Scientist, R. T. Prittchett, states in his book The Natural History of Man,
        </strong>
        "In their complex and many of the complexions and in physical peculiarities the Egyptians were an "AFRICAN" race (p 124-125).

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
        </strong>
        who visited Egypt in the 5th century B.C.E., saw the Egyptians face to face and described them as black-skinned with woolly hair.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Anthropologist, Count Constatin de Volney (1727-1820)
        </strong>
        ,spoke about the race of the Egyptians that produced the Pharaohs. He later paid tribute to Herodotus' discovery when he said:
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The ancient Egyptians were true Negroes of the same type as all native born Africans. That being so, we can see how their blood mixed for several centuries with that of the Romans and Greeks, must have lost the intensity of it's original color, while retaining none the less the imprint of it's original mold.
        </strong>
        We can even state as a general principle that the face (referring to The Sphinx) is a kind of monument able, in many cases, to attest to or shed light on historical evidence on the origins of the people."
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the ancient Egyptians were black-skin prompted Volney to make the following statement:
        <strong>
         "What a subject for meditation, just think that the race of black men today our slaves and the object of our scorn, is the very race to which we owe our arts, science and even the use of our speech."

       Yes but other events have happened on certain dates pertaining to different ideas in the past. All I'm saying is that the date does have the ability to be presented like events in the past. I am not a future teller but simply noticing past patterns.

       Part of their success is "convincing the world the devil doesn't exist," right?

       Unless, of course, they're getting arrogant and think they can just wave it in our face and no one will notice. They may be right on that front. But I'm not so sure. A lot of people I talk to are a lot less dubious about this "conspiracy" shit than they used to be.

       I'm guessing -- and these are little more than guesses, maybe a hair short of hypothesis -- 8/04 is a good date to target. It's Obama's birthday, flight 804 recently vanished 804 days after Malaysian flight 804. Kinda crazy, just a shot in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       September is more likely. Almost wouldn't put it past them to try 9/11 again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think it's gotta finish before the end of September, a year after the Blood Moon kicked things off. But, again, just slightly more than guesswork there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have one friend who I like but don't trust who has been kicking around 11/11 for years. Maybe that's the date they're shooting for. Right after the election. No matter whether Trump or Hillary gets elected -- or maybe too close to call? A near tie, with a 4-4 Supreme Court unable to steal for either side? -- right after election day doesn't seem a bad target either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have no idea. These people are smarter than I am. Maybe not one on one, but all of them combined plus their computers, it's probably no contest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I've got Jesus Christ guiding me. Maybe that evens the playing field. It's what I'm counting on.

       The elites, wrote that book you are reading. Are you that ignorant of history/religion? You are falling into
       <em>
        their trap
