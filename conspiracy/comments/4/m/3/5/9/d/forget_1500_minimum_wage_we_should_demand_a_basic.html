       In my opinion, universal income sounds great. But right after it goes into effect; I imagine a huge rollout of automation that removes the need for a huge amount of jobs. Fast food, taxis, shipping and supermarkets just as low hanging fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, I'd imagine that all of the companies that create these robots would end up buying eachother out until they become one huge corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then watch as that same universal income that could change us from a society of competition to cooperation instead turns into our leash.

       They can and will do that anyway with or without universal income.

       Besides, UI won't really come out of their profits. (Ok it may in the form of higher taxes/taxes that are actually enforced.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the government is going to start actually collecting taxes from these corporations, then they're probably also going to take a stronger stance on monopolies and regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, UI would mean people had a chance to live their own lives. They would start conducting economies between themselves. If they wanted to pursue a dream, they would be able to eat while doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism keeps us in its snare because we have to play the game or die. But UI takes us out of that rat race. People would have the freedom from the 9-5 to educate themselves, and those who wanted to take steps off the grid would have the means finally to do so.

       This is exactly why I believe it will never be allowed to happen in this country. The whole idea of working a forty hour week is to keep us occupied so we don't have time to educate ourselves or become passionate about issues. We need to stay preoccupied, tired, and disillusioned in order for those in power to carry out their plans of further enslaving us all.

       Which is exactly why one should quickly spend that money on resources for the eventual collapse. UBI or not, this system isn't self-sustaining. I'd rather be decent prepared for societal collapse than live fat and well beforehand.

       Automation is going to happen anyways. As it is, the system has incredibly effective leashes at its disposal. We're already at the mercy of people who value their own profits, realized through exploitation, the constant threat of exclusion from the labor market through various means and financial warfare. I really don't see how UBI would make that situation any worse.

       Haven't you seen the movie
       <em>

       Competition is the lifeblood of the market. Further, people have been brainwashed to believe that big bad "capitalism" is a zero-sum game, but it's not. Two people enter into a transaction willingly, with neither having any unfair inducement over the other to participate in said transaction...[and what eliminates most of the aforesaid unfair inducement
       <em>
        is competition!
       </em>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       And when they both enter into the transaction willingly, then from each party's respective position, they both come out better than before! That's real capitalism. Not the bullshit oligarchy/meritocracy crony capitalism that has infected our government (and the world) since pretty much the inception of the Fed and the passage of the Federal Income Tax over 100 years ago (but realistically not actually taking ahold of our economy until 40 years later).

       That whole 'voluntary transaction' thing always sounds like some kind of proto-capitalist utopia where people meet on a level playing field. When has that last been the case? Furthermore, there is no such thing as crony capitalism as opposed to good capitalism. In which reality are people who have accumulated sufficient capital not going to use that economic power to influence policy in their favor?

      <p>
       So... What's happening in your scenario? Let's look at the players.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Player #1—
       <strong>
        The wealthy Capitalist
       </strong>
       who is also a greedy asshole who wants to tilt the playing field more to his advantage (despite having already accumulated more capital than anyone else). Keep in mind that whatever is motivating him...His ambition or greed or whatever you care to call it—just on it's own—is not immoral or illegal. It's what he wants to engineer that's immoral, unethical, and likely illegal. However, his desire to change economic public policy in his favor is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       a tenet of "capitalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Player #2—
       <strong>
        The Government
       </strong>
       (hereinafter referred to as "the State") which has been entrusted by The People to serve in The People's best interest. In exchange for surrendering part of their freedom (they will be subject to laws) they expect the State to put The People's interests first. The men and women who comprise the State swear an oath to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does our capitalist accomplish this "influencing of economic policy"? Does he find other merchants and give them $10 million in exchange for their promise to only transact with him? Unmm...he could, but I doubt those merchants would agree unless it was in their interest...(and anyway that's just an exclusive contact and far from illegal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Does he come up with a brilliant scheme to pay his customers to only buy from him? Well maybe, but those consumer/customers might think the deal is worth it. And to be honest, it's not the best way to get an unfair advantage, right? In either of the above scenarios you have what's called an "arm's length" transaction...both parties enter into it if they believe they will benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way our wealthy capitalist could do what you suggest is by "changing the rules"... By bribing the government to distort capitalism through any number of ways. The State could enact a law that arbitrarily taxes or places a burdensome regulation on the Capitalist's competition. Or...maybe this capitalist sells a product the State needs, but the State, which owes a duty to the people, is obligated to call for an open bid before buying this item. The capitalist could say "don't call an open bid OR better yet,
       <em>
        pretend
       </em>
       to call one to keep appearances up, and buy from me!! It will be more expensive, but don't worry, I'll give you a kickback of half of my profits!"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the capitalist could bribe the State to allow the capitalist to lie about the quality of a product without charging him with fraud. The capitalist now can make hundreds of millions of dollars fucking over consumers like you and I.. Except now it's not capitalism that's benefiting him,
       <strong>
        its crime
       </strong>
       But because the government is not fulfilling its sworn oath to The People by enforcing anti-fraud laws, it looks like he's still a capitalist. The People don't know they are being duped (and the State and the capitalist control the media so the People never really find out!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you get it??
       <strong>
        Everything that could be done to unfairly enrich the capitalist must come by way of an action or an omission by the State.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, when you evaluate the crimes of that crook and the State, who's worse? A greedy guy who stole from you? Or a greedy group of people who made money facilitating the greedy guys crimes—a group you trusted and who swore an oath of duty to you???
      </p>
      <p>
       You really need to think about how the world works. Your myopic tendencies are destroying your critical thought process.

       At least with minimum wage you have to go to a job and "work".    But work is so hard that people just don't want to do it anymore.  And yet they think the economy will just continue to function and magical basic income money will flow down to them.

       Corporations do that already. Technological unemployment is going to be the cause of a universal income, not the effect.

       And I don't particularly think that should be a bad thing.

       This is exactly why a basic universal income is so much better than a $15/hr minimum wage. You could have a $100/hr minimum wage, but what use would it be if there aren't any jobs?

       It's always robots, it's never the little guy across the world, they just blame it on them.

      <p>
       Technology takes away jobs at a far higher percentage than other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone can build a machine to do the work of 100 men without breaking a sweat. I've even seen that restaurants will soon be using robots for most of their work. If they can build rocket ships, internet, drones and all the great inventions... It's only a matter of time before someone makes a burger flipping machine.

       Umm... various big fast food chains (i.e McDonalds) have had robots that can cook all the food and automate the restaurant pretty much entirely for YEARS at this point. They just haven't put them to use yet (there is political and economic concerns i.e fuck tons of people losing their jobs which is potentially a PR nightmare). Hell... if they had really wanted to they could have had an automated system 20 damn years ago lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was in college a DECADE ago myself and a few classmates designed an automated system for cooking burgers that could be used by fastfood places AS A SCHOOL PROJECT. I was responsible for programming the software that allowed people to order via touchscreen... the whole project was easy as shit. It's an incredibly INCREDIBLY simple matter to automate a McDonalds. All you need is one person on staff to handle maintenance and customer relations etc to be honest lol. If my small group of classmates was able to design and successfully implement a system like this on a bullshit budget of basically nothing then I'm sure a company with billions of dollars could do it pretty damn easily too.

       That's what makes it so confusing for me, if all the Jobs are automated, what the hell are we in school for? Job loss around the world will continue to grow, the CEO's of companies have already said they don't wish to increase the pay and would rather use robots.
      </p>

       Yea you're pretty much right. Mass automation seems to be pretty much inevitable eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will still be plenty of jobs that require an education but many MANY jobs including ones that currently require college will be lost (at least mostly) to automation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What will the outcome of all this be? Well... it's hard to say for sure but it could certainly be pretty horrible for a lot of people. In an ideal world, if handled properly on all levels it would actually be a fantastic thing but because sooooo many people are sooooo shitty it could easily end up being horrible. Depends on what happens I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had a basic income for all citizens then companies would have to compete heavily to get qualified people to actually come and work for them. This could be a fantastic thing however I don't see the elite class allowing this happen in a way that would allow people to live a decent life.

       Nah don't look at it that way. The point is that whether you went to college or didn't, the job market is competitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       College helps, absolutely, but out in the real world every kid fresh out of college is seen as someone who thinks they know everything, but in reality doesn't know much and hasn't done much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on your field, some or most employers will feel more confident employing a person with no degree and 4 years experience in the field than someone fresh out of college.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were sold this idea of college as if you just complete the tasks, then you are automatically upgraded to 100k salary lifestyle, which also only goes up in time. That isn't reality though.
      </p>
      <p>
       A college degree is like a trophy sitting in your trophy case. Nobody gives a fuck if you got that trophy sitting on the bench, they want to see someone go out on the field and wreck shit like a BOSS.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get what I'm saying? Finish school, do well, learn a lot.. BUT what is most important is to master your craft. That will make you valuable, that will keep you employed

       It's a good question to ask...But we are in an era where your question truly has the most serious ramifications. Last summer a computer beat the best Go player in the world...they didn't expect that for another 25-30 years. That's
       <strong>
        huge!!

       Everyone...including lawyers and bankers are at risk of losing jobs. At some point in the now relatively near future, the only jobs that will be available
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be the best in their class at interpretive dance! In other words, those who have a creative skill—something which computers really are not capable— these people will be the only ones who can earn a living. At least from our perspective in time at the moment.

       Those with low income spend all of it.  Another way to say this is that they create the most demand in the economy, per dollar of wage.  Having poor and unemployed people is what creates a death spiral in the economy.  Show me a country where their high minimum wage has created mass unemployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is that minimum wage is bad for the short term profit margins of businesses which profit from poverty, like with Walmart which both sells to and employs the poor.

       spot on with the robots. I work at an electronics manufacturer, and we build the kiosks that will be replacing cashiers at places like walmart and mcdonalds. they wanted 15 dollars per hour for tasks that could be performed by machines cheaper and easier, so this is what they get. not that I'm a fan of companies removing jobs for automation, but the demand for a pay raise basically drove it that way.

       Where does this money come from to pay for this UI? 
I'm curious, do we receive the magic money from the government and then pay huge taxes on it back to the government so that we can continue receive more magic money? 
If I receive my magic money and then have to give back a good portion of it to support the system that gives me something for nothing, wouldn't I be back to square one and still be broke as a joke? 
Yea sign me up, I've convinced myself, start making it rain magic money.

       part of the problem is, we have too many people... when we have 90 million people of working age/ability not working the value of labor goes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the number of labor jobs needed goes down, the value of labor goes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you add a million people to your population in a few decades the future value of labor goes down.

       They need to have skills worth what they are paid.  It has nothing to do with a "living wage".   A person pressing a button might be worth $8/hour, but why would that same job of pressing a button all of a sudden be worth $15/hour? The skills and job are the same.  They need to learn valuable skills and stop protesting for artificially inflating the worth of that skill-less job.

       That's not what UBI proponents are saying at all, people don't work crappy jobs because they choose to &amp; neither are people with "crappy" degrees the only ones who struggle to find a decent job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when you're saying that "People who went to college for a bullshit degree (any arts, English, ect...) dont deserve a living wage", are you seriously implying that we should live in a society where everyone working in the fields of culture &amp; language should essentially starve? Quite the dystopian vision.

       Yes, otherwise a UBI based economy would be unsustainable. People wouldn't be as interested in innovating and starting new businesses if they knew they'd still get the same income as the guy down the street that sits at home watching TV all day.

       We all get the same income to begin with, which is nothing. To make more than nothing would be the incentive. 
The problem I see is everyone wants to be the chief no one wants to be the Indian. They go to college for the same bachelor degree in business so that they don't have to get their hands dirty and when they get out in the real world they find there are not enough chief positions and don't have the skills or ambition to be an Indian. 
I found a trade, did a four apprenticeship, got paid while doing it and make a six figure salary being a Indian. I don't have college debt and there isn't a robot in the foreseeable future that can do my job because it is not assembly line work. 
If your skill set rises no higher than burger flipper that's your own damn fault. Hard work is hard, looking to find the loophole around that is bullshit. You reap what you sow.

       You were doing okay until you had to throw around that 'your own fault' line. You simply are in no position to recognize whatever favorable circumstances allowed you to succeed or the set of circumstances that led to someone getting the 'wrong' degree. Yes, hard work and using your brain all play their part, but there's plenty of smart hard workers out there who don't get to mention their figures in polite company.

       From what I've read about nations using basic income, yes. Not that I'm necessarily all for it, but it seems nice, especially considering the incredible amount of money that has passed from US citizens into the hands of the government in the last century.
      </p>

       The basic income seems to be between $1200-1700 equivalent range to go along with wages made at jobs.

       Hey man, I'm not the one who came up with the idea. Just explaining it lol. All I really know about guaranteed incomes is that there is a country or two in northern Europe that practices it and people seem to be pretty happy there. (Most of the happiest countries on the planet are in the small cluster in northern Europe including Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, etc)

       the reason it works in many areas like that is limited welfare in general. In the USA we have many leaches of all race creed and nationality, offering something like this would ensure more would arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       so many issues arise with such a plan... such as more people buying houses because less risk, however what happens when a couple buys a home on 2 basic incomes, and 1 dies or leaves. not to mention what it would do to the housing/rent economy. the other big issue i see is what happens when the government fails, or the UBI receivers out number the workers 10x... its bad enough only about 25-30% of people work in the USA already.

       No, because that would be capitalism of sorts. Go to school and get a degree in interpretive dance or art and then bitch about not getting a job in that field. And then whilst you do that you must also expect the government to pay for your accrued debt. Your

       No, actually people deserving to get rewarded for working hard doesn't have anything to do with capitalism. Reducing the challenges we are facing concerning the labor market to people getting degrees in interpretive dance seems misinformed at best.

       Look at all the things that are currently being discussed in terms of vaccination, they're trying to make it if you don't get them, publicly funded institutions and benefits will be with-held from you, the person who has been funding them.

       Money acquired via UBI is as much legally yours as the money granted to you via wages. That is, it's your's and it's worth anything as long as the state says it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for it being largely up to the individual how much and in what positions they want to work... what? Introducing the freedom to enter into actual voluntary labor agreements (instead of the kind of "voluntary" agreement where you "agree" to the contract so you don't have to be "homeless" and "starve") is actually one of the big arguments pro UBI. Last time I checked, the position someone works in kind of wasn't largely up to the person desiring said position.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your argument concerning vaccination and slippery slopes goes, you correctly recognize that there are already instruments in place to force people into submission. More and even blunter instruments could very easily be deployed under the current system.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone doesn't want to depend on UBI because they don't trust the state not to turn it against them by withholding it under some condition or another, nobody is forcing them to depend on it. UBI doesn't mean that people don't get to work a well payed job. As a matter of fact, the chances of finding such a job are going to be a lot better when not everyone depends on having one at all times under all conditions while automation shrinks the cake.

      <p>
       And how would that change under a UBI? If anything, having the security of a guaranteed minimum income would increase your freedom as an employee because it would mean that you would no longer have to labor under conditions you don't like simply because you are afraid of starving to death/losing your house.

Automations in trucking and transportation. The list goes on and on.

       Not really. Our society now could basically be run on automation (especially if people focused on living with what they needed, rather than trying to endlessly consume useless crap they don't need).
      </p>
      <p>
       Most jobs today are totally pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I am a teacher (which is supposedly one of the more "useful" jobs). But actually, as anyone who went to school knows, most of it is bullshit. Kids only really need to be in the classroom for a few hours a day to actually learn anything. Most of it spent doing pointless busywork and babysitting. Why? Because the kids need to be there 8 hours a day. Why? Because the parents are working 8 hours a day? Why?  Because rather than getting paid on their productive value, some parasite capitalist is hoarding the money and forcing them to work longer hours for less pay, keeping them busy and tired so they don't realize what a fucked system they are working in.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had a UBI, I would still teach. But I would do it for free. And I would tell my boss to go fuck himself if he asked me to do some pointless bullshit that is harmful to the students. And I would teach 2 hours a day, 2 days a week, and I would be a much better teacher because I would always be fresh and ready to go.
      </p>

       All your essentials rely on designers, developers, engineers &amp; maintenance/support staff. It's not as serious as trying to keep 300 million humans employed on a daily, while low-income and middle class families reliy heavily on medication &amp; deal with depression/disorders with no healthcare, no maternity leave, no paid vacation, and 2 days "off" per week (whatever that means) to live their actual life?

       We've been well beyond the point in technological advancements to provide free energy, and solve world hunger since Tesla's days. The reason it's kept under wraps is the tremendous power the oil &amp; banking cartel have on continuing to profiteer off of finite natural resource and an ambiguous "free market" system that has nothing to do with the word "free" and has everything to do with a few dozen/hundred people you can fit in a conference room.

       American people's backs have always been turned and manipulated. Preoccupied with entertainment, materialistic goods, and spread far apart in subrubian homes where no true community could form and discuss issues let alone start a movement. That's why we've been getting fucked constantly. They raise taxes, tuition, pharmaceuticals, treatment, and we stay quiet while the rest of the world blocks the entire capital's roadways. This whole thing has been engineered and structured this way. Hopefully people from the next generation are more embraced in what's going on in their society and less distracted.

       Are you joking? Capitalism is literally the most authoritarian system around today (it's the only system, really).
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism (which is properly defined as the private control over the means of production) means just that, that the economy is privately (i.e, non-democratically controlled).
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it that people talk about political freedom (the ability to vote for a government) and they completely ignore the fact that everyday they go to work, punch in at the clock, and enter a total dictatorship. And it's not "voluntary" either. The only people who aren't forced into selling their wage labor are people who were born rich and don't have to work for money (i.e the capitalists).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing to me that under capitalism, people have absolutely no say over their working lives, and yet they consider it a system of "freedom".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get something straight: without guaranteed access to the minimum necessities of life (housing, healthcare, food, education, clothing) there can be no freedom, economic, political, spiritual or otherwise.

       Everyone who desires a better lifestyle than the basic one afforded by UBI. So, a lot of people, actually. Maybe just not as much as the insane grind people are doing now. Which, with a diminishing number of jobs available, might be a very good thing. The problem we are going to face is not one of diminishing production. The problem is one of distribution. That already sucks a lot right now, but will become completely nonviable within a few years. Those fully automated factories are being built right now. Those self driving cars are being perfected as we speak. Deep learning AI isn't getting any worse.

       Yes, and as a sociologist specialized in work &amp; industry, I have a pretty decent idea how and why this can happen in a pretty insignificant number of cases. You can't base these policies on the behavior of cherry picked minorities, though. Last time I checked, well qualified  people will happily work more than they strictly have to in order to survive on a basic level.

       I think you are missing the point of the whole argument. The fact is that technology is becoming so advanced that machines are better at "busting their ass" than human beings. The question is, how do we distribute the goods/services produced by the robots without wage labor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here the most effective (and libertarian) solution seems to be the UBI. Again, people can still work (either for a wage, assuming they are able and qualified to find a wage job) or better yet, people will work for free doing things they care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a bit absurd to assume that if every person had their basic needs met that they would just sit around on their ass all day. If this happened tomorrow, people might do that for a few months (after all, the working class deserves a vacation), but once they've recovered from the abhorent conditions of wage slavery and realized that they are now free to do what they want, who knows what wonderful things people will get up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the things that will be invented when people are able to pursue their passions rather than simply create things for money, based on the dictates of "the market". Imagine the art, the literature, the music when ALL of humanity is able to have the time to access those things.

       Well here is the first problem with that. Your going to have to shut the border down completely. No immigration. Otherwise you get what Europe is getting right now. Millions of illiterate people coming to get a free ride off your system, and driving up the crime/rape rates through the roof.

       Second thing you need is a plan to keep your GDP in the positive at all times. Otherwise your get what Venezuela is getting right now. Total breakdown of society, and mass shortages of goods.

       oh shit. i never thought of it that way.   you have a great point!   that's way better!   ....unfortunately people think this is a solution and not causing more problems.   Most likely scenario, they will tax the middle class and give it to the lower class.

       The basic income should cover ALL healthcare expenses, all property taxes that pay for a minimum standard of societal participation (ad valorem up to 20k in car; taxes up to 150k in house or land; no coverage for boat unless you commute to work by boat or your house is a boat, up to 100k); and it should cover the costs of a passport, any government ID, any toll road expenses, any search and rescue SAR minimum yearly fee which is not much (25 dollars add-on with fishing and hunting permits)--why we have to pay for this is well beyond my comprehension; liability insurance on house and liability insurance on car--after all you need them both in order to participate in the economy even though we fucking have computers and could stay at home and work, they force us to take our lives (and others') in our hands every day we live simply by going to work in a car.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, we need to think about how WE support them and how THEY DONT support US.  We build their economy, not them.  They punish us for supporting their economy by allowing us to be sued for accidents.  THey were fucking
       <em>
        accidents
       </em>
       !  But the cost of healthcare and the expense of vehicles demands that they sue us.  So we have to have insurance.  See how they've found a way for everyone else to benefit when we make mistakes that are bound to happen because we're forced into building their economy?   That's not fair.  Also, they don't let you commute to work.  Employers treat it like it's a priviledge and not a RIGHT.
      </p>
      <p>
       SOmeone smart could class action lawsuit any company on the planet that doesn't allow voluntary telecommuting for positions that are capable of doing so, on the basis that the companies are not only placing their employees at risk of bodily harm every day given the statistics but they are risking the lives of others.  This risk potential creates stress and stress has a real quantifiable injury on humans.  This injury can be assessed and then used as the statement of injury for all plaintiffs which is the total number of employees of the defendant companies that are capable, but denied telecommuting rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       This injury would be assessed by a statistician who could use the aggregate of known traffic accident datasets and then use a heuristic measure based on the distance travelled to work, the danger of the routes they take and the total time spent in their car; using medical datasets for potential for thromboses of long-time seated persons; and the air quality control data for the areas along the route, espectially congested freeways and come up with an argument that employers are greatly causing stress and statistically quantifiable injury (as in 'epidemiological' argument) to employees and then multiply that number by an unreasonably high claim per claimant.

       I'm not sure what world you live on but I really don't think UBI should cover a car.  Think about what this means to the planet ... do we really want to subsidize that kind of consumption?

       It's not about making everyone rich.  The idea is that there won't be enough jobs in the future.  I don't buy it by the way.   People will always find a way to make money and hire people.  People will become cheaper than machines or people will maintain the machines.

       Well it's not been happening has it?  Where are all the jobs then?  How are people going to maintain the machines without mass depopulation?  One person can maintain many machines that can each do the work of many people.  And soon enough the machines will be designed in a way that other machines can easily swap out modular parts as they break.  You are not understanding the gravity of this situation.

       The religion of economics is built on assumptions only very casually related to reality. It's cute how, after 2008, people still praise that pseudo-science, especially as its "externalities" increasingly bite us in our collective ass... but hey, it's hard to give up decades of ideological indoctrination.

       Let's say UBI at $10,000 dollars. About 300,000,000 citizens here. That's 3 trillion dollars anually. Now look over at the poor people in Mexico looking at the US giving free shit. Mass immigration at an unprecedented rate. Soon that 3 trillion turns to 4 trillion.

       How is what you are describing anything different than how most people live today (except replace "government" with "corporations")?

       Almost every single person (except for the capitalist class) is forced to labor in conditions that are utterly authoritarian (how many people get to tell their boss "No" or have any meaningful input into the way the company they work for is managed?).

      <p>
       And the idea that wage labor is "voluntary" is a laughable fantasy. Theoretically it might be true, but in reality most people MUST sell their labor or else face homelessness and starvation.

       I can go work for a company (Regardless of if i want to) and if i disagree with the government i can make it known without (Generally) any repercussions.

       If the government gave me UBI and i attended a protest, they could cut my UBI because of dissent.

       While at least with "working" you are choosing your "slave master" as you would put it, rather then having no choice at all.

       I know it's hard to grasp. But if the government would stay out of everything—meaning not just wage/income guarantees but no corporate favors in the form of laws that prevent competition, provide tax breaks, reduce penalties for fraudulent conduct, no federal reserve, etc. and on and on... Then capitalism
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       work just as those who honestly praise it's benefits claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although what I'm suggesting is almost as much of a fantasy as what you are demanding because I don't know how we get the government (or a great majority of it) to resist the allure of bribes and kickbacks from banksters, nor how to convince the corporate elite to not expect to be given special treatment after 70-100 years....not to mention abolishing the federal reserve....
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding that you and I believe in different solutions, I still take comfort that if the government wasn't in bed with Wall Street (and of course still prosecuted criminal conduct to the fullest extent), nobody would be taking anything from anyone through force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know it's a libertarian trope, and I'm certainly for a safety net of some kind, but think about it....what right do you or anyone else have that ethically or morally allows you to demand someone else pay you a guaranteed wage of $X?? Is it your birthright?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand where that mentality comes from. Is that what you think government is? Your caretaker? And when you come up with these thoughts (like do many others do) do you ever consider that the more power you give to the government (such as the power to rob a huge group of people to pay to another) that they will only steal more themselves...or otherwise become more corrupt as a result??

       These are 2 different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       A basic income refers to social services. Minimum wage refers to labour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basic income is a theory going around lately that says the government should provide a basic income so that people don't need to go to welfare offices and stuff like that. Personally, it's not a very good plan because you need people to be responsible for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minimum wage laws just enforce the bare minimum that companies can pay their employees. With the high cost of living, current minimum wage rates aren't very good because they haven't gone up to keep up with inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Places like Walmart pay their employees minimum wage yet many of their staff still need income support like food stamps because the low rate of pay doesn't afford a basic living wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Walmart's execs make lots of money while US taxpayers have to subsidize Walmart's low income workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minimum wage should be high enough that people can afford food, rent, bills with a little extra left over.

       UBI is a concept that has a basis in both libertarian and communist schools of thought. If a ball is both round and red, is it limited to either one or the other property? The UBI system is libertarian because it has the potential to reduce government employees/systems that administer welfare, social security, claims, papers, cost of public servants, etc. Even if we get rid of governments/states, people can still voluntarily receive UBI from a set of willing money creators at the cost of inflation. A UBI does not require having a government/state which is a prerequisite for communist ideology.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In no way, shape, or form–in principle or in practice–does the act of enslaving the entirety of a nation to the whim of a government the reduction of its employees or systems. The number of titles within the government being reduced is of no concern, as the number of employees now includes every individual living within the borders of the nation, and the number of systems being reduced is of no concern, as the system of government itself now invades a greater percentage of the lives of the individuals which it ostensibly serves–but who, in reality, serve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the name “UBI” was proposed by a libertarian (self-proclaimed, in this case, as the act in no way reflects libertarian principles) is of no consequence, nor is the fame or fortune of the person himself. Libertarianism itself suffers from not being an ideology in the first place. It is merely an economic system masquerading as a political ideology, but that’s a wholly separate argument. Libertarianism, the economic system, is defined by a specific set of rules and behaviors. UBI does not qualify for any of those behaviors. UBI does not even quality for the set of rules and behaviors claimed by libertarianism to apply to non-economic aspects of politics, so to call UBI a “joint” libertarian venture is to know nothing of libertarianism’s real or imagined tenants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind the irrelevance of attempting to “join” commonalities among political ideologies. Even republicans (the foundation of American ideology, not the modern political party) and marxists agree on the concept of ‘people being alive’. They don’t agree on the concept of the right to life, nor even on the manner in which people live, but they agree that people–in some form, at some time–must be alive. Does that make “being alive” a joint republican/marxist endeavor? Of course not. All commonality–all commonality–between political ideologies, particularly opposing ones, is incidental.

       First point: libertarianism satisfies the act of reducing government scope through the reduction of welfare offices, public servants, the taxes stolen for said services, and the intrusion into the lives of the poor who have to jump through hoops as a result of being a welfare dependent. I invoke the lesser of two evils argument, where one would choose to live in a UBI for the purposes of having a weaker government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second point: Let's look at history. Economically, libertarianism was tied with social anarchism. You can trace the word to the French paper La Libertaire by Joseph Dejacque since the term anarchism was banned historically. It is a separate argument of how U.S. "libertarians" misappropriated this European term for their capitalist theories. Libertarianism is an incompatible theory to capitalism. One favors the free will of the individual, the other slavery of the individual. A better label for U.S. libertarian theory would be proprietarianism or landlordism. Rules and behaviors? Libertarianism is an abstract idea that has concrete implementations. One example is your U.S. theory which has a goal for the free will of the majority under the negative liberty of the "non-aggression principle", but fails to provide any guarantees that non-aggression implies the free will of a majority of individuals. Private property owners have power that enables them to negate the free will of non-property owners. Those without capital have no will. Thus your implementation of libertarianism hold only to a minority who own capital. Now in regards to UBI, it most certainly will give the majority of people more power and liberty. Thus UBI can be classified under libertarianism. Your claim that I know nothing of "libertarianism's real or imagined tenants" is ridiculous since through inference you never have read any anarchist texts.

       I stated that UBI can be classified under both libertarian or marxist texts since the outcome of such a system would be beneficial to both parties. Namely both ideologies  would have UBI as a goal.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        libertarianism satisfies the act of reducing government scope
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with libertarianism as an ideology is that it lacks a full two-thirds of what encompasses a system of belief. Economy, society, and government comprise the full range of ideological belief, but libertarianism is exclusively an economic school of thought. Economics alone does not a civilization make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarianism, economically, feels rather agreeable. A man is entitled to the sweat of his brow and the fruits of his labor. A man has no obligation–legal or moral–to strangers, nor to his neighbors save such behaviors that would make them reciprocate and do well by him. This is why libertarians eschew welfare for systems that would provide jobs to those on welfare so that they may provide for themselves. Libertarianism is most often characterized as being for a completely free market–ending all government subsidies and letting any business, no matter the size or category, fail if its practices lead to failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is where libertarianism ends. No regard for social behaviors has been made, and so when libertarians in the political scene are forced to speak of social issues, their only reply is to copy their economic doctrines, change applicable words, and paste them into place… with disastrous results. They have translated their wholly free market economy into a wholly free market for the purchase of product. Any product. Under libertarianism, any drug of any sort would be available to anyone with enough currency to procure it, and the price of the drug would be dictated, of course, by the free market. Heroin, ecstasy, marijuana, morphine, vicodin–all drugs–available without script or restriction of quantity. Any and all behaviors–sodomy, pederasty, pedophilia, bestiality–all acceptable. Private ownership of nuclear weaponry–as well as the raw materials to build and distribute such–legal. Libertarianism’s utter lack of regard for social protection makes it a nigh-genocidal ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governmentally, libertarianism fares slightly better, but even then its copy/pasting leads to a political body that cannot effectively govern in any respect. Libertarians are often said to want “small government”–which, were it true, is a noble cause–but libertarianism demands virtually private government, which is definitionally oxymoronic. To give an example of libertarianism’s lack of government, a typical criticism in this aspect is, “Who would build the roads?” The US Constitution stipulates that the government must “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” Government organization and implementation of national infrastructure falls under both defense and welfare. Regarding tranquility, libertarianism would remove all noise and behavioral ordinances, as that restricts freedom on a personal level (again, falling back to the absolute “free market” parody).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are aspects of libertarianism which are commendable. In the broadest sense, their desires for less centralized government control over the economy, providence, and society are commendable, as most of today’s governments are, by the reckoning of the Founders, entirely totalitarian. However, libertarianism fails to comprehend that there is a healthy scope of government–indeed that general well-being is a charge of government itself–and fails in the one thing in which it purports to believe: the freedom of the individual to pursue success, protected–not from failure–but from the syndicates, cabals, and individuals who would seek to take that from him.

       Your assertion is true only in the context of your relative morality which you didn't state yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word socialism is an umbrella term for many philosophies. It can refer to ideas such as state socialism, which I would agree with you that it is unwanted, or libertarian socialism, which would be desirous.

       Capitalism is immoral, because it entails a system of resource deprivation, social hierarchy, wage slavery, exploitation of employees, and environmental destruction.

       You have to define "What's yours is yours", because that is a tautology. An example: When the workers demand distribution of resources from the proprietarians, they own said resources. It would be immoral for the workers to give somebody else their resources, even if 51% of the population were proprietarians. So the workers must use self defense against the force that is now initiated by the proprietarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is an assumption. You state that resource users can only use self defense as force. But the act of holding private property is an offensive force since it is by definition resource deprivation which harms others. So others as just using your moral system to defend themselves because said resource user initiated force first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both governments and private corporations make voluntary action difficult. Thus we have libertarian theories as stated above that address this and provide guarantees for liberty.

       Let me guess where this is going: Socialism is theft, but when 62  people appropriate the value created collectively to such a degree that they own as much as half of humanity combined, that's cool. If you're convinced that it's actually possible for a guy to "earn" a thousand times as much as the average guy working in his organization... Well, what can I say. No point in arguing with fanatics.

       Actually we should lower the minimum wage and kick the immigrants out who hold those wages and then see the standard of living increase with the reduced population. Or we could go to a resource based economy and throw all immigration out the window and have a high resource to population ratio.

       Wouldn't do anything to solve the problems of extreme wealth &amp; income inequality, the subversion of politics by corporate money or even realistically offset the effects that automation is going to have from now on... but hey, sure.

       the military and big pharma, basically.

      <p>
       by lowering the military budget, there is enough cash to pay out to citizens instead of international arms dealers and banksters.

       also, you can lower health care fraud by pharmaceutical companies to save trillion$.

       UBI is really just another way of saying:  cut waste massively, and give a portion of the saving back to the people -- keep another portion to further pay down the debt.

       How many social programs could you end to cut into the costs of basic income?  For example, you could completely do away with food stamp programs if you're going to start giving everybody a chunk of money.

       That's the main idea, you get rid of most welfare programs, no more food stamps (that stigma for recipients also goes), no more unemployment benefits. No more of people trying to cheat the system and bureaucracy disappears since everyone is given the same.

       How about no minimum wage. Universal basic income is a horrible idea. How would anything be achieved with no competition. It's in your own best interest for there to be competition among workers and the market.

       Eventually we'll need to ramp up to basic income, but presently unless you're in Europe there is no chance of it. A minimum wage hike would be a good start for basic income in two ways, it would help those who need it and hopefully bump wages up across the board and set the trail for basic income, the other is it would push the companies that want to avoid it to move towards using robots or algorithms to replace the workers, which in turn would make basic income more important as the unemployed grow and our politicians are finally forced to face reality.

       I will say, At_Work_SND_Coffee does make a reasonable point. At some point in the future, a lot of what we call productivity can and will be done by robots whether there is a basic income or not. Now, does that mean we shouldn't grow and develop new ways to be productive? Of course not. However at some point our governing body really needs to do 2 things; decide what a relative standard of living is in this country, and then, make it illegal to have a full time job and not be able to reach this so-called standard of living. This standard needs to include food, shelter, healthcare, a basic education, and reasonable protection. This is the core of what people need to survive and how our government should be operating.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could easily happen through a basic income for all while including tax breaks/incentives to those who file and maintain their own income (job of some sort and the nature of filing also would require some immigration policy reform).
      </p>
      <p>
       This could also happen by the government assuming responsibility to pay for the very basic and essential needs of the people directly. A great example of this would mean no more power bill, water bill, or utilities of any kind. Basic (public) transportation is free, along with a basic ration of consumables (food, certain cosmetics, etc.). There would have to be "luxury items" that wouldn't be able to be purchased with this money, much like how EBT works.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as this ration of commodities is standard across the board for every single person, whether its in the form of money or access, this could be a reasonable way to spend our country's resources.

       I'll give you a great example about how robots could start putting people out of work relatively soon. Driving and transportation. What happens when taxis, buses, and trucks are all driving themselves? This could put a lot of people out of work pretty fast.

       Engineers within the industry have told me that we’re 20 years off for working self-driving vehicles. No joke. What we see now can’t handle anything but sun and clear weather. It’s not ready to be let out and it won’t be for several million more miles. We don’t have much to worry about there.

       Never mind that losing jobs is never the point. If a job ceases to exist, humans get different education and do a job that does. Only luddites fear the concept of “technological obsolescence” because only luddites believe in it. I mean true obsolescence.

       These are anarcho-capitalists and they are dumb in the same way Ayn Rand was. It might work for this time share camp but on a large scale it would be horrific. True anarchism has nothing to do with this and that's why i made the point to say "true anarchism."

       How? Anarchism opens the market and brings in enormous competition which significantly devalues prices of things in demand like healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism calls for nationalized healthcare and no competition, and when the top get naturally greedy prices sky rocket.

       I am fascinated with Liberstad. If it works, it could take over all of Norway.

       As to your first point, I'm simply not going to argue the "free market" idea with you. If you subscribe to the idea that there is an invisible hand that will guide in this situation, enjoy your corporate overlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, nationalized healthcare works. It's why canadiens pay half what people from the US do...single payer. It's also why people in the US buy drugs from india, canada and mexico.

      <p>
       Like I said before, this Liberstad place might work for these people, but on a large scale things like privatized police gets real sketchy real quick.

       Half my family are in the UK. They have the NHS back there. No-one wants to admit it but the NHS is crumbling. All the politicians are saying they need more money in it. Yet that is not the answer. Private Healthcare with a competitve market is, in my opinion, the answer.

       The numbers prove me right which is why you need to go to anecdotal evidence (half my family is in the UK). Are you just a regular dumb guy, or are you paid to shill against socialized medicine? I hope you are just regular dumb and grow out of your "infowars" stage.

       Depends on which anarchist theory you're talking about: Mutualism, anarcho-syndicalism, communalism, etc. Anarcho-capitalism isn't the only anarchist-labelled theory out there. I'd label it as corporate feudalism.

       and if that military budget is gonna stick unless heads roll then heads should roll. the US spends 600 billion a year on military, the next highest country is China at 150 billion. You could easily cut 200 billion off of it and still be the biggest military in the world.

       Well, you have to have a central power to buy and distribute those apartments, which would presumably be the gov't, hence the socialist comment. I would agree that some heads out there are roll-worthy, but a UBI, which is the distribution of money (intrinsically worthless), is more likely than the distribution of land (has intrinsic value).

       a universal basic income gives people a reason to not contribute anything to society. they can just sit at home and play video games.

      <p>
       now if you're going to give people a free place to live (i'm only talking about 3-400 sq ft,) then people are still going to need to work if they want entertainment and that means they are going to have a lot of left over money to help contribute to the economy by buying stuff.

       Sure, there are issues with UBI; I'm undecided on whether it would be a good idea or not. A government large enough to
       <em>
        give
       </em>
       people things is a terrible idea in the first place. But I would argue that giving something of no independent value is superior to giving something of real value that must be acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, a nation's currency is like a voucher tied to that nation's worth. It has no value outside the principality honoring that paper. Bestowing that upon citizens of said principality doesn't inherently decrease the potential worth of it, whereas granting those same people land, would.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to "contribute" to society in the current state, as a US citizen can draw welfare money or myriad other grants anyway. Those who wish to better themselves do, as it has always been.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand you are talking about a modest area given to each person, but that still requires the government to own all that land first. The acquisition of it would be far more costly than merely giving UBI to all citizens off the top.

       when machines start taking all the labor jobs within the next 50 years, communism will be a necessity. there wont be enough jobs for people.

       It's not that I disagree with each and every
       <em>
        ideal
       </em>
       involved with socialism, it's just that, in order to implement it, the government has to
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       the land, the means of production, and the venues by which goods are distributed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason that I entertain the notion of UBI is that the people are already out of control of the monetary supply, so the thought of distributing it to all at a baseline value does not seem as risky.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that whether UBI or a benign form of socialism is implemented in the near future, the current government we have will manage to fuck it up enough to make it continue to concentrate wealth and power upwards while eroding freedoms, just as they have done since the early 20th century. IMHO.

       The US spends 600 billion dollars on the military every year. that's fucking ridiculous, nobody is going to invade us. the next biggest military budget in the world is about 150 million. You could easily take 100 billion from that and house/feed every single American.

       then the intelligent kids who are born to poor stupid parents will be left behind. the main problem I have with a free market is that children's hand in life is directly related to their parents. it shouldn't be that way. everyone who comes into this world should be on a level playing field. effectively banning idiots from society would and giving everyone the best education they can get would be great for society and for equality.

       part of the reason why things are so corrupt nowadays is because so many morons are allowed to exist.

       If school weren't "free" the idea that education=intelligence wouldn't be so prevalent. A parent being unable to allocate funds for education/ your sense of altruism hardly justify the government stealing from everyone to pay for it.

       imagine being born to poor parents who are only educated enough to do simple labor. you're alot smarter than them but they can only afford to send you to worst school. at that school you meet stupid kids and you start acting stupid to fit in, because that's what kids like to do. you never reach your potential, you become a simple laborer just like your parents when you had the potential to atleast be a software designer or some shit like that but you never had access to the proper resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       how is that fair for the child? they didn't ask to be born in this world. they didn't ask to be born to the poor/stupid family.
      </p>
      <p>
       if a free market can't solve that simple problem well then a free market isn't the right answer for this society.

       Intelligent people will excel regardless of education. The career you cited is an excellent example. Of the software engineers I know (I didn't realize until just now I'm surrounded by these silly fucks) 1 has a degree in it. The rest learned it on their own in their spare time and applied at start ups when they were good enough. The free market can solve this, you're stuck in the mindset of "English, history, math etc..." that's not education. That's bullshit some government employee made up to allocate funding. The worst schools would still show a person's ability to retain knowledge, a driven person will make the best of whatever opportunity they're presented. Also stop trying to convince me I should be cool with people stealing from me, fuck kids. If you want to help them you do it.

       very small chance you lived in poverty growing up. if you did, you'd understand. instead you think everyone had it as good as you and people just need to work harder. sad thing is, you republicans don't understand there's not enough hard work for everyone.

       It's not that everyone gets paid the same. It's that everyone is given a basic amount of money every month (say $1000) regardless of what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means no more welfare programs (unemployment, housing etc)  I assume some for those that need other help, mentally ill or disabled, would remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a simple explanation but Switzerland are due to hold a referendum on it, other countries have trials planned.

       A basic income would be $1500 a year now if all mean's tested government benefits ended and the money redirected. That is stupid and not going anywhere in the US.
Meanwhile yet more studies show minimum wage increases do not lead to job losses.

       Basic income for the US is more about shifting to the jobs that will be lost when automation takes over. What are you going to do when there mostly isn't shit to do except for manual labor and the manual labor slots are being filled as soon as they are available? I remember the Motor T MOS when I was a Marine, the MOS was so crowded that you couldn't get promoted without being the best Marine (or best reviewed for the connected types) so they were forcing everyone out at the end of their contracts or service limits or to lat move to another MOS. Jobs are going to be the same way once automation becomes applicable to the majority of jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes it possible that you can work some shitty job for extra cash or have the time to grow or hunt your own food, basic income would give you enough to live and it would be on you to strive for more. Or at least that's how it's supposed to work.

       Welfare is not a bad concept, its just badly executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly: people are embarrassed to be on it. You saying they aren't is bullshit. My mom was on welfare, and she hated it. It took her a long time to get off if it. You know why?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Welfare does not reward you for getting off of it, it rewards you for staying on. It can be very difficult to safely leave welfare due to how it works.

       You're a cookie cutter republican who makes anything they don't understand look like the bogeyman. It's pathetic. Due some research and learn to have compassion.

         A basic income is not an Utopian thought. It would work fine within most "civic models" (capitalism, communism, socialism, liberalism). It would also counter a lot of problems related to exploitation. It wouldn't work in societies based on exploitation (slavery, indentured servitude, oligarchies and societies based to social Darwinism).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       I see no problem with a "basic income" system in a society, if it is possible and practical.

       actually UBI is directly communism with a nice different name. All that will happen is we will be more dependent on the government and the tragedy of the commons will occur, technological growth will stagnate and we will be a stifled species. The only way UBI would work is with a constant working AI program that is taking the place of human innovation. You sir know fuck all of what you are talking about

       Why don't you go look up communism on Wikipedia sometime. You'll learn that rule #1 about communism is it doesn't even have a government. That is, if there's a government, it's not possible to have communism. So all that stuff you're saying about dependency on the government somehow being related to communism is just total nonsense.

       None of those countries that we call communist were actually communist countries. They might've had communist ideologies, and they might've attempted to install communism in their countries, and for those reasons we call them communist. But they never successfully installed a communist system, so they were never actually communist states.
      </p>
      <p>
       No communist state has ever existed in the world. The closest any state has ever come to a communist state is a socialist state. States such as Soviet Russia and China that have historically represented themselves as communist are instead socialist states. At this point in history communism is just a hypothetical concept only.

       There is a massive thinking error is communism. Greed, desire for profit, comfort and security is the natural state of man. Socialism, Communism, Anarcho-Capitalism, all of it fails to address this critical point of the factors of an economy, the human factor.

       Do you have any examples of "real communism"? Ones that are not / were not communist in the same sense that Federal Express is federal?

       There's plenty of evidence mounting up concerning the long-term survival chances of our species on this planet under real Capitalism in practice. I'd say the alternatives are looking pretty good at this point.

       There is no real communism in practice. Historically, every attempt to instate a communistic system has failed and not resulted in communism. It doesn't make sense to blame communism just because some asshole tried to do it wrong and never succeeded.

       What is all this Communism paranoia?  Are the McCarthy Trials still going on??
How would this have anything to do with 'communism'  and why do you assume that is a bad thing?  Technically, this idea is closer to Socialism, but it all depends on the final form of such a policy, and is too soon to speculate.   Shouting 'communism' at something you don't really know about is not that different from yelling 'fag' at a bystander who is vaguely effeminate.  Shame shame shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       In recent news, the Canadian Government is already working towards a policy for guaranteed minimum basic income  (but it will probably be a weaker interpretation meant to replace older public services)
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyways,  the important part  would probably be having financial officers who don't sell you out from the inside.

       a universal basic income gives people a reason to not contribute anything to society. they can just sit at home and play video games.
      </p>
      <p>
       now if you're going to give people a free place to live (i'm only talking about 3-400 sq ft,) then people are still going to need to work if they want entertainment and that means they are going to have a lot of left over money to help contribute to the economy by buying stuff.

       Where does this money come from to pay for this UI? 
I'm curious, do we receive the magic money from the government and then pay huge taxes on it back to the government so that we can continue receive more magic money? 
If I receive my magic money and then have to give back a good portion of it to support the system that gives me something for nothing, wouldn't I be back to square one and still be broke as a joke? 
Yea sign me up, I've convinced myself, start making it rain magic money.
