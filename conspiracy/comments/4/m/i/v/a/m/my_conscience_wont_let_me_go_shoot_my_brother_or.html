    <div class="md"><p>He wasn&#39;t anti-white in that he wanted to kill white people. He was a separatist, which makes a lot of sense for someone who grew up under Jim Crow. Remember, this is a guy who won a gold medal for his country but couldn&#39;t have a celebratory dinner when he got back because the restaurant he wanted to go to was whites-only(his group was kicked out and run off by a racist mob).</p>

<p>From an interview in 1971:</p>

<p>“There are many white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right,” he said.  “If 10,000 snakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn’t want to bite me, I knew they were good… Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that that thousand get together and form a shield? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?”</p>

<p>Don&#39;t paint this guy as a racist because he was pragmatic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was both a racist and a pragmatist. Racism and pragmatism is one of the same.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t outright &quot;anti white&quot;, but he did see whites as his enemy, jews as the devil etc. He was a Muslim. He was a racism. He was a violent man, his IQ was 76 (16th percentile when tested by the US military in the early 1960&#39;s).</p>

<p>He said a lot of smart things tho, and I agree with the vast majority of his statements.</p>

<p>But to claim that he &quot;wasn&#39;t racist&quot; is dishonest. The man was a segregationist. They don&#39;t come more racist than that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying racism is bad. It&#39;s neither bad nor good. But he was a racist.</p>

<p>I also can&#39;t believe for a minute that Ali was unintelligent. Sure, he might have scored low on the army IQ test, but he clearly didn&#39;t give a fuck about the army.  </p>

<p>Yes, Islam can be a violent religion, but so can Christianity. The greatest atrocities in the Americas- chattel slavery(which was very different from the slavery that was practiced by most of the cultures throughout history), genocide, destruction of entire language groups and cultures - was done in the name of Christianity. Religion is the problem, no matter what flavor.</p>

<p>You&#39;re European, right? From somewhere that is dealing with this &quot;immigrant crisis&quot;? From your comment history, it seems like you&#39;re a Trump fanboy too, which I find baffling. </p>

<p>Why not? Did he do or say something that an unintelligent person wouldn&#39;t have done?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump fanboy. Trump has a lot of policies I don&#39;t agree with, and he has a flawed character. He&#39;s just a lot better than Sanders and Shillary, and I like pissing off regressive leftists.</p>

<p>The white man ended slavery. Muslims enslaved over 100 million africans. Western society has helped people like Cassius Clay way more than it&#39;s hurt them. Without western society he would be eating bugs in a clay hut in africa.</p>

<p>True. But what other culture did this? Right. None. Lots of cultures have had / still has slaves, whites were the only ones to fight for the abolishment of slavery.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the holocaust as it&#39;s described on normal media occoured.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think napalming farmers or droning children is okay. The Vietnam war is probably the worst war to ever have been started, and I don&#39;t understand how Obama got a Nobels peace price while dronebombing children and weddings.</p>

&quot;I have to respect any conscientious objector that stands his ground. I expand on that and include those that see the wrong in their assignments and resist on the spot. Cassius Clay is such a soul. He still shines.&quot;**</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;An analysis of Ted Nugent&#39;s Selective Service classification record doesn&#39;t prove or disprove either version of the story. He did indeed receive a high school student deferment (1-S) in 1967 and then (as he stated) a college student deferment (2-S) in 1968. However, he was reclassified as &quot;available for military service&quot; (1-A) in 1969 and then subsequently rejected as a result of a physical examination and given a 1-Y classification. (The 1-Y classification denoted persons &quot;qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency&quot; and was generally assigned to registrants who had exhibited medical conditions that were limiting but not disabling.) After the 1-Y classification was eliminated by the Selective Service at the end of 1971, Nugent was reclassified as 4-F (&quot;registrant not qualified for any military service&quot;).&quot;</p>
