    <div class="md"><p>It is said the Vedas manifested from divinity. Their answer, in a nutshell, says that we are all intrinsically servants by nature, yet we act and believe we are enjoyers, trying to play God. Because we have this tendency to exploit for selfish reasons, we are in the world of karma. Instead of doing things as a matter of service to others, we desire the results for our own enjoyment, thinking ourselves the center. Therefore, we are given the ability to play God. The only problem is, everyone here thinks they are the center, and that&#39;s why there is so much conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had always believed that our existence was essentially a game. That we were here simply to create our own experiences. I&#39;ve been introduced to the concept of service to others, through various dogmas, but I&#39;ve never heard it put the way that you&#39;ve just said it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One must serve others by serving the center. Just as one waters the root of the tree, not the individual leaves, we should serve the center. This does not imply that we ignore serving others to serve God. It means that when we are serving others, we are conscious of their interconnectedness to God. We water the tree of giving our consciousness to the proper place. When our consciousness is given to the center, this is called love. (You express love by showing your thoughtfulness...practical). When one is constantly giving one&#39;s consciousness to God by always seeing Him in everything, love develops. When love is fully manifested, the simulation, even though still there, doesn&#39;t affect you. Just like when you discover what you see is a mirage, the mirage is still there, but you stop walking towards it. You are so mad from this divine love that you forget yourself. You wouldn&#39;t even notice if you died. You would be so absorbed in God that you would even see him in death. You would see God in life and death, no difference. You transcend this cycle. Fearlessness. Ecstacy. That&#39;s where one&#39;s real life begins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard of this result before. Where you are so engulfed in love that the relative world looses its power in your life. It sounds wonderful. Sometimes I think that I would rather not ascend in this incarnation, but rather wait until the next one. There is so much beauty here. I know that there is even more beauty in Nirvana, but I&#39;m really enjoying my time in the third dimension, and am not quite yet ready to leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nirvana just means &quot;No forest.&quot; Which basically means you are not entangled in the dense forest of illusion. It&#39;s not like you teleport to a bright place in the sky. The spiritual world is everything you see here, but it maintains its freshness and everything is done out of love, rather than lust. Where do you think this world gets its form? It&#39;s a reflection of the real world. You can still live in this world and be in the world of love...you don&#39;t lose anything. You have what you have here unlimitedly...</p>

<p>That being said, the Vedas describe this process as a multi lifetime process. It is a gradual process to change our identity from master to servant! </p>

<p>Best thing you can do is chant Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare and be blissful!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But is not lust enjoyable? I mean we came from the world of the absolute, into the world of the relative, so that we could experience the negative things that don&#39;t exist in the world of the absolute, right? What happens when you find joy in the things that are part of the relative world? So for example, I love hunting. It makes me feel very connected to nature, and to wildlife. It teaches me patience, and stillness. But at the same time, hunting equals killing. So I imagine that it must not exist in the higher dimension. Am I incorrect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Bhagavad Gita is based on a battlefield...and it is said that Arjuna, Krishna&#39;s devotee, is eternally a servant of God as a warrior. That&#39;s the kind of relationship he has with God. He kills for God. At least in Vedic culture, killing animals was regulated for the warrior class to practice for battle. There are no bounds to serve God. If you have that warrior mentality, dedicate it to God as an offering of love.</p>

<p>That being said, killing certain animals, like cows, which are harmless and economically  useful, is considered a very big offense in Vedic spirituality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That being said, you should also meditate by chanting OM. This is a vibration that will clear potential disturbance from such an intense activity. You can offer your activities while mediating on OM. Of course, the Supreme is self-satisfied and doesn&#39;t need our offering. The offering is just a vehicle for us to give our consciousness to him in the form of love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That one is for those who are looking for a more personal interaction with divinity. OM and Hare, Krishna, and Rama are all names of the Supreme Person. And they&#39;re not just names, they mean very specific things that describe His/Her characteristics...Krishna means &quot;all-attractive&quot; Rama means &quot;the source of pleasure&quot; Hare means &quot;the female form of God&quot;...all the same person, but describing different aspects of His/Her personality. OM is the primordial vibration of His cosmic form...it&#39;s like the vibration that pervades the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i like reading Bhagavad Gita. It&#39;s a very nice presentation of spirituality without it being sectarian. If you want to grasp it more quickly, we can read together over the phone for a little (if you&#39;re in the US.) Reading esoteric metaphysics is much more fruitful in group settings. We need as much perspective as possible to capture the Absolute perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I love hunting. It makes me feel very connected to nature, and to wildlife</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you feel &quot;connected&quot; to something you end up killing , before you ever even experience the creature for what it is ?</p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re using a high powered rifle w/ a scope, hiding in some &quot;deer blind&quot; where you never even get close to the animal. Is that true?</p>

<p>Also, how can you feel &quot;connected&quot; to nature when you are taking away from it ? Unless you routinely give back to nature in some other way. IMO, that doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel connected to nature because you have to have an intimate understanding of nature to be a successful hunter. No, I don&#39;t hunt with a rifle. I do track and stalk hunting, with a traditional recurve bow. It requires you to be very close to the animal (30 yards is the maximum range that I feel comfortable shooting). I&#39;m not taking anything from nature. I hold all of nature in very high regard. Death is a part of nature. You are correct that it is not necessary for me to kill in order to provide for myself, but unless you are a strict vegan, then death is necessary for you to maintain your diet. When you buy your meat from a grocery store, you are removing yourself from the burden of that death. You don&#39;t have to see the animal when it&#39;s alive. You don&#39;t have to be the one to kill it. You don&#39;t bare the full weight of your choice to eat meat. Not to mention the fact that the lives these factory farmed animals live is terrible. Hell on earth, in my opinion. Atleast the animals that I kill had a chance to truly live before they died. My goal is to eventually be a vegan, but to still eat the meat of animals that I kill. To me, I believe that that choice honors wildlife.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not here, The Bible talks about an Alien invasion coming to destroy Edom. </p>

<p>He left the Hebrews in charge until his return but as the Book of Deuteronomy tells us, Jacob lost his way and the tribes became lost, therefore the world fell into the hands of the wicked, his brother Esau. </p>

<p>Esau worshiped Satan, the nature of man in his natural state. The evilness of man without the love of God is what you see before you. It&#39;s capitalism, usury, control and atomic bombs. It&#39;s the ego inside of us to think we can play God. The gospel was hijacked long ago by the pharisees most of these preachers and priest are nothing but from the Synagogue of Satan. They are there to mislead and preach the doctrine wrong on purpose in order to allow Satan to blossom. Notice how these same priest are found working hand in hand with people that worship Baal. If that doesn&#39;t tell you something, I don&#39;t know what will.</p>

<p>33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>

<p>34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>

<p>35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>

<p>36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>

<p>37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>

<p>38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</p>

<p>39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>

<p>40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>

<p>41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>

<p>42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</p>

<p>43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>

<p>44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>

<p>45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</p>

<p>46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Daniel 7:9-10 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and <strong>his wheels as burning fire.</strong></p>

<p>10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wheel is mentioned in another book Ezekiel </p>

<p><strong>Ezekiel 1:4-28 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</p>

<p>5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</p>

<p>6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</p>

<p>7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf&#39;s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</p>

<p>8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p>

<p>9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p>

<p>10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</p>

<p>11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</p>

<p>12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>

<p>13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</p>

<p>14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</p>

<p>16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</p>

<p>17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</p>

<p>18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</p>

<p>19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</p>

<p>20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>

<p>21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>

<p>22 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</p>

<p>23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</p>

<p>24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>

<p>25 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p>

<p>26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</p>

<p>27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>

<p>28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because when he comes, the people will be ready to free themselves. Reality will change, the people in power that control the weapons and bombs will have to yield to God. To not obey the prophecy would be backwards. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that everyone should be working to do the best they can to make the world a better place. But if you are talking about going against Edom in warfare, there is no point. Esau is a apex predator, God created him perfect in this aspect. This is said in the Bible.</p>

<p><strong>Genesis 25:27</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the boys grew: and <strong>Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field;</strong> and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Genesis 27:40</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking on Esau ruling by the sword (force) instead of following the natural order of what god commanded, thus embodying Satan (rebelling against God).</p>

<p>Out of all the people mentioned in the Bible, Edom (Esau) is the one nation God said he would come back to destroy completely from earth.</p>

<p><strong>Book Of Obadiah 1:10 KJV</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.</p>

<p>2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.</p>

<p>3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</p>

<p>4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?</p>

<p>6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!</p>

<p>7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.</p>

<p>8 Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</p>

<p>9 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.</p>

<p>10 <strong>For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are not understanding by now I will put it in more normal terms.</p>

<p>There are False White Jews (Esau)</p>

<p>There are Real LOST Black Jews (Jacob)</p>

<p>Jesus was a Black Jew from the Tribe of Judah but through white washing and further expansion of Edom, Jesus was depicted as white in the 1400&#39;s around the time Black Europe was being taken over. When he should have never been depicted at all because he followed the rules of the Old Testament. The Bible makes sure to leave traces of what color the Hebrews were though so it&#39;s not hard to understand. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/g7so-YJ5CB0?t=1m22s">This is the rant that Billionaire Donald Sterling gave on the subject.</a></p>

<p>This is why Jesus was crucified by the pharisees, he was a Black Hebrew speaking on the lies that the Greeks and Romans had been pushing before his time and why he stated this is revelations, </p>

<p><strong>Revelation 3:9King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is also why a lot of people do not acknowledge the book of revelations.</p>

<p>17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: </p>

<p>18Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation. feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.&#39;</p>
