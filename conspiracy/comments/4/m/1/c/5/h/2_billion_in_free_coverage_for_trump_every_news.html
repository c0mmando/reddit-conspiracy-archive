       Maybe there is something nice we could say about her.  And then there is everything else.  Many people find the criminality oozing out of her every pore a bit disconcerting.  But if you are saying that Trump isn't so great I am sure that is quite true and most of the press on him is negative.

       I'm not sure about the media being negative about trump. If they held him to the same standard as they're holding her to he'd be dead in the water. This is a jobs election cycle and a guy who went bankrupt 4 times doesn't scream 'jobs economy' to me.

       If anyone can complain about the press, it is Hillary and the other R candidates. They're getting little coverage and its usually focused on their negatives. Trump on the other hand is the political genius of our age...

       Repeating half truths incessantly, saying nearly everyone is your friend, and calling the others names like we took Hot Tub Time Machine back to 5th grade again is not political mastery. It is called appealing to the lowest common denominator. He is no genius, just a somewhat persuasive / skilled salesman &amp; self promoter with an incredibly large credit line who utilizes NLP techniques.

       I'm still not certain Trump is trustworthy. But we all know Hillary is not. As far as jobs go, Trump has 500+ companies under his belt...4 of which have filed bankruptcy. I'd say that's a damn good record.

       Trump is a man with many current investments. Look how psycho people are against him. Their is even a facebook page dedicated to killing him. Their are multi-million dollar PACs against him. There are riots in the streets and violence against anyone who supports him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was to release his tax records that would be enough info for people to attack him financially. I don't blame him considering how psycho people against him are. Individual income tax returns — including those of public figures — are private information, protected by law from unauthorized disclosure. Like all other citizens, U.S. presidents enjoy this protection of their privacy.  It is only tradition that a candidate release his tax info.

       What did Jerry Maguire say again? But really he claims to be rich and charitable and such a straight shooter it really shouldn't be such a big deal to release his tax returns. He's honest John after all. I mean honest Don. I got him confused with John Miller.

       You don't care, though. You've made up your mind that what the media tells you is true and don't care to do any research of your own. I'm not going to waste my time with someone like that, nor should anyone on this subreddit.

       It sounds more like I'm not blindly following Trump and that upsets you. I can say whatever I want man this is my thread you can start your own thread. This is not a pro Hilary thread this is a questioning the legitimacy and accuracy of propping up a reality TV star as a potential leader of the Free World thread.

       See, this is why we laugh at you. You're using the same canard that people who are paid to slander him use, most likely out of sheer ignorance and nothing malicious. You don't care to actually learn anything about what he is or has done.

       You have fun believing the lies that the fake Republican fake billionaire tells you. You have fun believing that he's going to have our neighbors build a wall for us and pay for it. The way I see it you got two Democrats running against each other for the presidential election

       I would have a hard time dealing with it too if the guy I was rooting for donated to his main political rival. But I'm not talking about how much I love Hillary I'm talking about how Donald Trump is being propped up by the media and he's not being held accountable for anything that he does.

       Everything you've said thus far. You're just repeating media lies without having done any research of your own. Not a single claim has been true. You're not even capable of visiting the government's website where candidate finances are located to see that Trump is, indeed, a self-made billionaire.
