<p>If he was to release his tax records that would be enough info for people to attack him financially. I don&#39;t blame him considering how psycho people against him are. Individual income tax returns — including those of public figures — are private information, protected by law from unauthorized disclosure. Like all other citizens, U.S. presidents enjoy this protection of their privacy.  It is only tradition that a candidate release his tax info. </p>
