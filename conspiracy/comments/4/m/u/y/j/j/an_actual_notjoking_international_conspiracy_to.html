        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a ridesharing company named GetMe. Its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getittechnologies.getit&amp;hl=en">apps</a> is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/get-me-something-or-somewhere/id979584772?mt=8">garbage</a>, their CEO is a <a href="https://www.getme.com/about.html">secret,</a> and they <a href="https://twitter.com/GetMe_CXO/status/727374196779552769">literally welcome competition</a>. The reason for that is their primary product isn&#39;t rides, it&#39;s laws. They&#39;re going around the country (and entering Canada) to serially push Uber and Lyft out of various cities by using the local news to make people think fingerprinting or insurance are required for public safety, then making Uber and Lyft unpopular there based on their stances on those issues so people will vote for legislation that breaks their business model.

<p>According to an article from last July, <a href="http://uberpeople.net/threads/rideshare-guy-article-real-reason-uber-is-leaving-fort-lauderdale.29429/">&quot;three things will trigger Uber and Lyft to leave a market; Fingerprinting, drug-tests, and commercial insurance.&quot;</a> Their model relies on getting lots of drivers signed up quickly, and fingerprinting is slow, drug testing is limiting, and commercial insurance is expensive. But GetMe uses these as its gimmick. GetMe.com literally says  &quot;Our Go-Getter Drivers are... fully vetted and background-checked for your safety and security... And all of our Go-Getter Drivers are covered by our industry-leading insurance coverage to give you that extra peace of mind.&quot; </p>

<p>They serve <a href="http://www.cbs8.com/story/31966694/get-me-llc-adds-over-30000-new-customers-and-drivers-combined-within-72-hours">Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Galveston and Las Vegas, and are planning on expanding into Corpus Christi, Atlanta, LA, Denver, Chicago, Portland, Nashville, Vancouver, and Toronto.</a> Except for Dallas where they started, Denver which is getting reports on fingerprint background checks being required in Atlanta and Austin in the local news, and Nashville which is getting hit pieces segueing into &quot;let&#39;s look at how Uber and Lyft do their background checks,&quot; every single one of these cities has been hit with either a bill involving either mandatory fingerprinting or expanded insurance coverage in the past few months.</p>

<p>In Vancouver and Toronto they&#39;re a little sneakier about requiring fingerprint background checks but they&#39;re required to be a taxi driver and they&#39;d be getting taxi licenses which involves fingerprinting.
And here are some articles! I know I mentioned local news and some of these are definitely not but I promise there were actual local news outlets for all of these that I found I am just lazy and it was 2 am when I compiled this and I should&#39;ve been asleep already.</p>

I couldn&#39;t find anything on specific legislation but the ending is hella suspect:</p>

<p>Also at one point they said they were looking into Phoenix. Well lookie here!
<a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2016/01/12/doug-ducey-criticizes-phoenix-uber-lyft-sky-harbor-airport-restrictions/78641148/">http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2016/01/12/doug-ducey-criticizes-phoenix-uber-lyft-sky-harbor-airport-restrictions/78641148/</a></p>

<p>Bonus for mentioning &quot;other transportation companies&quot; without mentioning any by name. Some politicians did that in the Austin and Chicago articles too.</p>

<p>Austin: “To threaten to leave, simply because we are trying to protect public safety, cannot be my deciding factor,” Kitchen said. “There are other transportation network companies, and they will be here.”</p>

<p>Chicago: “Uber and the other ride-sharing companies make a ton of money in the Chicago market. Will they leave to prove a point if finger printing is required? I don’t know,” Georges said. “But my sense is, if they do leave, some other company is going to come in and fill the void and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to operate with the proper protections in place and we’ll be successful.’ ”</p>

<p>But yeah there is a ton of really obvious stuff here and the only reason they&#39;re getting away with it is because it&#39;s confined to the local news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uber actually doesn&#39;t make any profit, in fact they&#39;re losing money every day. But that is offset by the massive amounts of VC investments and whatnot that keep them afloat.

Going from my apartment to downtown in my city is $15-$20 with a cab. $7-9 with uber. I haven&#39;t touched a cab since. That and the longest I&#39;ve had to wait for an uber is 10 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does a cab driver not? Every opening question I have for uber drivers is &quot;how do you like  it/how long have you been doing this?&quot; i&#39;ve only had one that said they didn&#39;t like it and then asked me if i wanted to take his number down in case i wanted to go to the airport he&#39;d do it for $40 (I didn&#39;t because uber has its own insurance and liability etc).</p>

<p>Edit: a majority do uber as a fairly lucrative side job. It&#39;s good for the driver because they drive however long/whenever they want to. The last driver I had said he was an engineer but he uses uber as a means of writing off his car and says it pays for his mortgage every month so he&#39;s pocketing a lot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works pretty great if you have a new/ish car and already put very few miles on it - to the point that it&#39;ll deteriorate over time before it&#39;s ever killed by machinery wearing out. If you&#39;re like me and put 90+ miles on your car every day as a matter of course - it&#39;s no question that&#39;s the <em>mileage</em> that will kill your vehicle.</p>

<p>In the first case, you&#39;re simply taking advantage of operational time the vehicle would otherwise never see. In the second, you&#39;re shaving precious time off the lifespan of a vehicle you&#39;re already for sure going to kill.</p>

<p>But other than that - Uber <em>does</em> take advantage of drivers being responsible for the maintenance of their vehicles, but it isn&#39;t much different than say, how a pizza delivery driver is treated. Except a delivery driver can pick up a late 90&#39;s Honda Accord for $500+ and drive it into the ground because no one cares if their pizza is delivered in a beater. Cab drivers aren&#39;t typically responsible for the maintenance of their vehicle, but it&#39;s kinda like stripper stage time - regardless of how much they make per shift, they owe the cab company $X for use of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Typically Uber/Lyft <em>just barely</em> skirt around the existing transport/cabbie laws in the states, allowing them to operate in a sort of legal loophole. They can&#39;t carry more than seven passengers, for example, because that requires a Commercial Driver&#39;s License. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting, thank you. The pizza driver deal does make sense, and I know that driving for Uber your car has to be a certain year or newer. I do know (in reference to cab driver bit) that Uber takes x amount out of each fare. I forget what it is, but the drivers make money depending on location. For my area I believe they get paid less for spending time in the car but get more for distance traveled whereas in some place like New York it&#39;s the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post! Everything I&#39;ve heard/seen from the news about UBER in the last year or so has been pretty negative. At the same time I have been seeing a lot of articles about how Google and Apple are trying to get into the automatic driving cars/taxi service in the near future. I figured they(mostly Google) are getting a head start on shutting down the completion so the market is prime when they are allowed to put their cars on the street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I&#39;m in Austin, and we had a pretty big election on this on May 7. I&#39;ve been following the local news&#39;s coverage of it after seeing a bunch of not-dumb people giving the same dumb talking points and wondering what was up with that. I&#39;ve found lots of fun things!</p>

<p>First, Uber and Lyft <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/austin-to-discuss-whether-uber-lyft-should-face-sa/nnxPg">&quot;threatened to leave&quot;</a> immediately after <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/business/austin-a-hub-for-tech-based-ridesharing-delivery-s/nnsM4/">GetMe started doing food deliveries in Austin</a>,  and again <a href="http://keyetv.com/news/local/get-me-launches-rides-in-austin-as-uber-lyft-threaten-to-leave">immediately before GetMe started doing ridesharing in Austin</a></p>

<p>Second, you can actually track the entire spending history of Uber and Lyft through <a href="http://goo.gl/RGajcy">off-handed mentions in non-opinion news articles</a>. </p>

<p>Third, you may have noticed that a lot of these articles were updated shortly after posting, and a lot of them have clearly had their headline changed, according to their URL. That&#39;s kind of a post by itself, but I invite you to go explore. Some of my favorite examples:
<a href="https://muckrack.com/link/z4izz/austin-voters-reject-prop-1">&quot;Election day voting light so far on Austin&#39;s Prop 1&quot; became &quot;Prop 1 goes down as activist proclaims: &#39;Austin made Uber an example&#39;&quot;</a>, and immediately after the May 7 election that upheld the fingerprinting regulation, <a href="http://fxtribune.com/local/city-recommends-austins-cabs-be-deregulated-h70783.html">&quot;City recommends Austin&#39;s cabs be deregulated&quot;</a> became <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/city-recommends-austins-cabs-be-deregulated/nrLLQ/">&quot;Adler open-minded, cab companies skeptical of deregulation pitch&quot;</a> with bonus quotes from the mayor reassuring us these events aren&#39;t related.</p>

<p>Fourth, the mayor sure <a href="http://www.kvue.com/news/local/austin-mayor-speaks-out-against-prop-1/152890938">makes</a> a lot of <a href="http://kxan.com/2016/02/11/city-council-to-vote-on-rideshare-ordinance-aisd-and-transportation-funding-options/">recommendations</a> in the news, huh?</p>

<p>Fifth, there are lots of fun non-stories, including <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/austin-has-failed-to-collect-administrative-fee-fr/nq7Qt/">Uber and Lyft are not behind on a fee</a>, <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/transportation/prop-1-ad-on-third-of-austin-cabbies-gives-only-a-/nrGDx/">Uber didn&#39;t exhaustively background check every taxi driver in Austin</a> and <a href="http://www.kvue.com/news/local/truth-test-austin-prop-1-ads-misdirecting/160451010">BEHOLD! NEWSWORTHY JUNK MAIL!</a> Believe it or not, in Austin that last one was actually a very serious point that very serious people took very seriously. People weren&#39;t throwing junk mail away and they were actually collecting it to post on social media and shit. It&#39;s really dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is awesome. Fuck Uber, they deserve to be held to a higher standard than whatever&#39;s convenient for them. They&#39;re allowed to disrupt an entire industry but when someone disrupts their business plan it&#39;s a conspiracy? They swallowed fingerprinting in Dallas, then pulled out of Austin to teach them a lesson. They had an agreement with Portland as to when they&#39;d roll out their service and then did it 6 months early without asking because they have millions of dollars devoted to a legal team that&#39;s just there to waste tax payer money fighting city halls. They&#39;re parasites, and I&#39;m glad they&#39;re getting their asses handed to them in China, too, where a chinese competitor (that Apple just handed $1 million dollars to) did the exact same thing as them except they&#39;re local so have more sway, and Uber&#39;s CEO had the gall to say he wishes the world weren&#39;t that way, where unfair business practices allow for market capture. This post really made my night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Checking their insurance records shows they are </p>

<pre><code>Get Me, LLC
1130 N. Westmoreland Rd
DeSoto, TX 75115
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/1130+N+Westmoreland+Rd,+DeSoto,+TX+75115,+USA/@32.6101773,-96.8769465,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x864e93d265c7ae7d:0x61909fe25d635b73!8m2!3d32.6101773!4d-96.8747578">Google Maps, nothing is there</a></p>

<p>So I checked the Texas Comptroller office and found their filing information:</p>

<p><a href="https://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&amp;amp;Search_Nm=Get%20Me%2C%20LLC%20&amp;amp;Button=search&amp;amp;Search_ID=32056443198">Get Me, LLC</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/7920+Belt+Line+Rd+%23310,+Dallas,+TX+75254,+USA/@32.9497586,-96.7725543,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x864c21c82f58365f:0x20b3ab20ef46fbc3!8m2!3d32.9497586!4d-96.7703656">Registered agent&#39;s office (Google Maps)</a></p>

<p>However, they&#39;re actually a Delaware LLC, just doing business in Texas. </p>

<p><a href="https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx">Search file number: 5590006</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Delaware LLC director and owner information is private. That&#39;s unusual for a &quot;normal&quot; business that&#39;s based in Texas. They had to do extra filing just to keep the director information secret.</p>

<p>The registered agent in Dallas office is nothing special. It&#39;s not even in the nice part of town, pretty weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uber is a Ponzy scheme of the most audacious type if you ask me. I&#39;d even go so far to say there&#39;s a Robin Hood element to it. Just wait until Uber collapses under the weight of itself and you&#39;ll have distributed 65+ Billion of VC capital, distributed to the population, which seldomly does any good other than propping up someones half-baked business idea. Thats my take on it...so I hope they will get lots more VC capital, burn through it paying drivers the subsidy that makes it work in the first place and go Pooooooff like an overinflated baloon...</p>
