       Donald Trump said Wednesday he has been thinking about setting up a commission, "perhaps headed by Rudy Giuliani" to examine the "problem" with undocumented Muslims coming into the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are obviously some very bad things going on, and we're going to figure out what's going on and we're going to be very, very careful," Trump told Fox News' "Fox and Friends" program during a discussion about his upcoming meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't elaborate on his call for a Giuliani-led commission to study terrorism. However, in December, when the GOP presumptive nominee called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims" coming into the United States, the former New York City mayor came out strongly against the idea, calling it an "absolute violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution."

        The case against former NY Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is in no way connected to allegations he "ran out of Commission hearings."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It concerns his

         foreknowledge
        </a>
        of the collapse of the WTC Towers, and the attempted murder of New York City employees
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRaKHq2dfCI">
         Barry Jennings
        </a>

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Both were ordered to proceed to the Office of Emergency Management on the 23rd floor of
        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pretz/911_file_after_both_air_strikes_new_york_mayor/">
         WTC Building 7
        </a>
        , which survived two attempts to bring it down concurrent with the ST collapse at 9:59 am, and the NT collapse at 10:28 am.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rudolph Giuliani is the only one with sufficient authority to have given such an order, so why did he want both men dead!
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Barry Jennings
         </strong>
         , "upon arriving at the OEM we noticed everybody was gone, coffee was on the desk and half eaten sandwiches,” he said he made telephone calls and was told to "leave the building right away."
        </p>
        <p>
         "When we reached the 6th floor there was an explosion, the landing gave way and we were left hanging, we had to climb back up to the 8th floor." Both men remained trapped for several hours, during which time both buildings came down.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Mr Jennings broke a window with a fire extinguisher, and after attracting the attention of a civilian he and Michael Hess were rescued.

       Excellent and informative comment!!
      </p>
      <p>
       From his own words, he knew the towers were going to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't warn a single fire chief or first responder and sent Jennings and Hess into the evacuated WTC 7.
 And then hightailed it to safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind he just so happened to run into his biographer as he was walking around the WTC complex that day.
