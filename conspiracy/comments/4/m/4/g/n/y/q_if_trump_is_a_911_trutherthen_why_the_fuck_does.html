<hr/>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Donald-Trump-Rudy-Giuliani-Muslims-Immigration/2016/05/11/id/728270/">http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Donald-Trump-Rudy-Giuliani-Muslims-Immigration/2016/05/11/id/728270/</a></p>

<p>Donald Trump said Wednesday he has been thinking about setting up a commission, &quot;perhaps headed by Rudy Giuliani&quot; to examine the &quot;problem&quot; with undocumented Muslims coming into the United States.</p>

<p>&quot;There are obviously some very bad things going on, and we&#39;re going to figure out what&#39;s going on and we&#39;re going to be very, very careful,&quot; Trump told Fox News&#39; &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; program during a discussion about his upcoming meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday.</p>

<p>Trump didn&#39;t elaborate on his call for a Giuliani-led commission to study terrorism. However, in December, when the GOP presumptive nominee called for a &quot;total and complete shutdown of Muslims&quot; coming into the United States, the former New York City mayor came out strongly against the idea, calling it an &quot;absolute violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The case against former NY Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is in no way connected to allegations he &quot;ran out of Commission hearings.&quot;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It concerns his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arVPrp5OzVs">foreknowledge</a> of the collapse of the WTC Towers, and the attempted murder of New York City employees <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRaKHq2dfCI">Barry Jennings</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZduP7HTM3cg">Michael Hess</a>.</p>

<p>Both were ordered to proceed to the Office of Emergency Management on the 23rd floor of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pretz/911_file_after_both_air_strikes_new_york_mayor/">WTC Building 7</a>, which survived two attempts to bring it down concurrent with the ST collapse at 9:59 am, and the NT collapse at 10:28 am.</p>

<p>Rudolph Giuliani is the only one with sufficient authority to have given such an order, so why did he want both men dead!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Barry Jennings</strong>, &quot;upon arriving at the OEM we noticed everybody was gone, coffee was on the desk and half eaten sandwiches,‚Äù he said he made telephone calls and was told to &quot;leave the building right away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When we reached the 6th floor there was an explosion, the landing gave way and we were left hanging, we had to climb back up to the 8th floor.&quot; Both men remained trapped for several hours, during which time both buildings came down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr Jennings broke a window with a fire extinguisher, and after attracting the attention of a civilian he and Michael Hess were rescued. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ris8OGSskCk">Alex Jones Video: The Mysterious Death of Barry Jennings.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent and informative comment!!</p>

<p>From his own words, he knew the towers were going to collapse.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t warn a single fire chief or first responder and sent Jennings and Hess into the evacuated WTC 7.
 And then hightailed it to safety.</p>

<p>Keep in mind he just so happened to run into his biographer as he was walking around the WTC complex that day.</p>
