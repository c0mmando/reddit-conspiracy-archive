    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to think that&#39;s her back up plan. She doesn&#39;t seem as gung-ho lately and has really calmed down. I honestly believe that the DNC is going to drop all its rules and introduce Biden and Sanders as their choices and have an election over the three days. Biden will win, the Obama administration has longer to let Wall Street try to save as much as they can and to initiate the mixing of crypto currency while hiding America&#39;s global loans for weapons and drugs program. Sanders is still pushing his beat but seems to be less prone to discuss his actual plans. I think he coming to the realization of the epic crisis we are in, and instead of collapsing and letting capitalism fix itself, they are just going to rewrite the market rules and math. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a plausible move. Either Biden or Sanders would win over Trump. But the establishment Dems will most likely only consider a Biden presidency with Sanders as VP. Since the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2008/04/vp-term-limits/">VP of the US</a> has no term limits, Biden can be either POTUS OR VP again.</p>

<p>If the Sanders camp is still threatening to split the vote with the prospect of a BIDEN nomination, they could still nominate Sanders and keep Biden on as VP for another eight years if they wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might have been my post; if not, I&#39;ve been theorizing this as well.  You summed it up nicely. I&#39;ve taken it a step further though. Half jokingly, I&#39;ve been saying that Bill will die sometime before November so that Hillary will get the sympathy votes or can exit gracefully.</p>

<p>Especially with all of the stuff being dug up recently about Bill&#39;s past that reflect badly on both Hillary and Bill, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this happened soon. People are emotional and reactionary and Trump attacking Bill after he&#39;s dead would be seen as extremely distasteful (even for someone as outspoken as him).</p>

<p>Plus, at this point, who would put it past Hillary/or the Elite to carry out a plan like this?</p>

<p>There&#39;s been some speculation that he&#39;s HIV positive. If half the stories about his sex life are accurate, the HIV thing is plausible.</p>

<p>Not sure if that&#39;s a story the Clinton campaign wants to come out right now though.</p>

<p>Reactionary means to go against the current times. Compassion &gt; law is a current thought. Back then you would get no simpathy for a fact like these against political weight.</p>

<p>If there were a huge bunch of reactionaries, Hillary would be dead already.</p>

<p>How are people &quot;reacting&quot; instead of following the elite chosen plan ?

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misinterpreted me--It is my view that the elite expects people to react in a certain way in response to an event where they become emotional and don&#39;t think logically. They use this emotional response to their advantage. An example would be the passage of the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act after September, 11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i see what you mean, imo you just framed it incorrectly.</p>

<p>Reactionary mean you stand by an older point of view (such as the founding fathers or atleast enligthened).</p>

<p>People are not going to react with the wisdom of old (to be reactionary mean you think you act with such a thing and that was never impulsive or misguided). </p>

<p>So i see what you mean but i think you used the wrong word. People will react as they are expected to be. Anyone reasoning with old reasoning will see the trap as it is. Nobody 100 years ago would fall for such an obvious, appealing-to-emotion, faulty plan.</p>

<p>Too good this generation is  conditioned differently..</p>

<p>A reactionary would call Hillary out on her grieving bullshit and compare it to the thousands in similar cases which got no sympathy by the law. (logic)
An indoctrined one will share her weight since its given that much weight and support her grief (emotional).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean reactionaries are prone to absolute logic, but that they employ it where they can. And this is an obvious call imo.</p>

<p>A reactionary voting Hillary would be an obvious paradox if not for malicious intents (ex. Ending this generation as soon as possible, which could be seen as desirable even by reaction standards due to predicted hopelessness).</p>

<p>To be reactionary means not to be guided by emotion to me. Feel free to disagree, i&#39;m always interested in other povs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep you&#39;re absolutely right, I did use the wrong word. And your analysis is pretty spot on. I misunderstood what reactionary meant--the definition of the word almost seems to not fit with what you&#39;d think, with the root word being &quot;reaction,&quot; suggesting an action or change in response to something.</p>

<p>I definitely hold somewhat of an &quot;originalist&quot; interpretation of the Constitution and believe that the founding fathers had the right ideas, which have gradually been corrupted since the mid 20th century (Truman-era) IMO, so I that would make me a bit of a reactionary myself.</p>

<p>Thanks for explaining!</p>

<p>Reform education,healthcare,and the Tax Code. 
Audit the government which is where Ron and Rand Paul come in.
Clean up the clutter in the tax code,and law code such as removing laws that have been repealed.. </p>

<p>You know the laws that were passed,and then another law was passed to repeal the law? Yes remove those laws from the books.</p>

<p>Limit one bill per law and outlaw late riders.  </p>

<p>Force congress to take term limits, and limit their income to the median income of their district. Ban insider trader &amp; end Congressional pensions.</p>
