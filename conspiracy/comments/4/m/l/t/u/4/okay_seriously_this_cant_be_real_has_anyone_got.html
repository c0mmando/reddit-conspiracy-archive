I remember it the first way, but somehow; it&#39;s the second. Nelson Mandela, died 2013; no, no way. I seem to remember as a kid in the 90&#39;s that Mandela died then. Some people have said it was the late 80&#39;s. Nice, he&#39;s still alive. The point of this is to see if anyone has info on it or can debunk it (memory is hard to debunk, and goes along with that whole free will thing). I swear to god it&#39;s the &quot;Berenstein Bears&quot; not the &quot;Berenstaine Bears.&quot;  Why are so many people having these memories? And why have little things been changed? In the bible I KNOW FOR A FACT it used to say &quot;the lion will lay down with the lamb&quot; at the beginning of Isaiah 11:6. No it&#39;s &quot;the wolf will lay down with the lamb.&quot; What&#39;s the difference? If you know your bible than you know there&#39;s a difference between the biblical wolf and the biblical lion. Why and how would the elite travel through time and change these millions of little phrases, ideas, and words? Because they can. At least, that&#39;s the theory. Edit: see CERN. </p>

Berenstein bears (I&#39;m part German, I know the fuckin&#39; difference - and was made proper by German Grand parents. stein (Steen) not stein (shtine), very different they told me.), Louis Anderson passed from a heart attack (but now is alive and well). Just a few. Something fucky happened and I think it was either 9/11 or possibly CERN. The end of the Mayan calendar 2012 was not a end of the world scenario, but a great &quot;unveiling&quot; of information. What do we see now? A great awakening... Something fucky is going on, and it&#39;s very occult/esoteric... The survivors of the Great Deluge tried to fuck with time and space, which led to the Great Deluge. CERN (imo) and TPTB (survivors) are meddling where they should not be meddling, and we will be the causalities of such behavior. Fuckers....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth is 100% free will. There are no other places like that in the universe. All other realities you can manifest/incarnate in aren&#39;t and though they have varying degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Because earth is 100% free will, DNA from indigenous earthlings is extremely valuable because of it&#39;s coding for creative capacity. This has meant higher dimensional entities have been engaged in power struggles to be in control of Earth. </p>

<p>Lemuria and Atlantis were two civilizations that existed on earth, but fell in time because of their oppressors. They had advanced tech and started to time travel back and forwards to change events to try to save their civilization. This created rifts in the time line and all kinds of strange artifacts in this matrix. </p>

<p>The reason why these higher dimensional beings could be in control of this reality is because in a period of celestial cycles, our solar system is in a more dense region of space where we feel separated from source. This separation causes us all to feel afraid and with our creative capacities manifest negative realities. These entities have set up substantial propaganda distributing institutions to reinforce their paradigm and indoctrinate us but as our solar system moves into a lighter region of space their techniques are beginning to falter.</p>

<p>By certain celestial time points, certain moves have to be made by all players involved, but as more conscious awareness comes in, more people are aware of their machinations and see them become increasingly more bizarre and slapstick. People still caught in the illusion of fear, will see it getting worse and worse, but more and more people will be having gestalt moment and transitioning to the new abundant reality that lies adjacent to this one but just out of phase. </p>

<p>i tend to think the internet is responsible for this &#39;awakening&#39;, not any kind of energy shift or whatever. then again, the internet was a darpa project, so this could be entirely planned - certainly it was foreseeable that the internet would help get people informed. i can&#39;t think this is all an accident.</p>

<p>one hypothesis could be that the elite are just running a script (i think this may have all happened before) and 2012 is on the schedule for the big wake up. if i&#39;m pessimistic, i think they want as many of us to know what&#39;s going on <em>right before</em> they unleash hell, for maximum impact but too late for us to do anything about it.</p>

<p>also:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;mirror mirror on the wall&#39; is now &#39;MAGIC mirror on the wall&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;if you build it, they will come&#39; is now &#39;if you build it, HE will come&#39;</li>
</ul>

<p>but i notice that all of these changes are in places where you can&#39;t see a live actor&#39;s mouth moving - darth vader&#39;s mouth is hidden by the mask, the mirror in snow white is cartoon animation, and in field of dreams it&#39;s just a voice on the wind. so ALL of these could have been dubbed later by the media companies - and we know these companies are not working for Team People.</p>

<p>why? to fuck with us. to make us question our memories and sanity. to waste our time and distract us.</p>

<p>i still don&#39;t have a good explanation for berenstain, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Lion and the Lamb has been misquoted a billion times. Go back (using archive.org if you like) to some older books (1800&#39;s) that discuss the bible/theology. It&#39;s always been wolf (If someone time traveled they would have changed writings in the 1800&#39;s as well I assume). </p>

<p>It is a very common saying, Woody Allen once started a quote with that and loads of people used to pay attention to him. The lion and the lamb are both representative of other things in the bible, the wolf not so much. </p>

<p>Jesus is seen as both and the phrase represents, to some, a settling down of things (he came as a lamb, will return as a lion, and in the end the two shall &#39;level&#39; out and there will be rest when the work is done).</p>

<p>Isaiah was using predator/prey, in later times (after nt was compiled and written so much about) people used older sayings and revamped them to more christian themed ones. The bible doesn&#39;t say &quot;god helps those who helps themselves&quot; and the whole idea of &quot;If a man doesn&#39;t work he won&#39;t eat&quot; is ripped from context and used by christians (and others) for their own political reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jimmy Church has been discussing this very topic on his radio show recently.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_7MpkZayuw&amp;amp;t=2h33m22s">Here&#39;s where he first brings it up</a>.</p>

<p>However the next night, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9S9xsQraJw&amp;amp;t=14m55s">he continues the discussion</a></p>

<p>Lots of good examples.</p>

<p>Some of the more notable ones:  </p>

<p>&quot;Mirror Mirror on the Wall?&quot; from Cinderella....nope it&#39;s actually &quot;Magic Mirror on the Wall&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a beautiful day in the neighborhood&quot; from the Mr. Rogers song....nope it&#39;s actually &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful day in this neighborhood&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>I saw &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; three times in the theater when I was in high school. &quot;It&#39;s always been &#39;No, I am your father.&quot;</p>

<p>Never remember Mandela dying in prison. NEVER. I do remember &quot;Mandela Day&quot; the song by Simple Minds, and then them singing it LIVE when he got out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been studying the Bible since my single digit years and it&#39;s NEVER been &quot;The Lion will lie down with the Lamb.&quot; NEVER. Why would it be? Both the Lion and the Lamb are symbols of Christ and his followers. The WOLF is NOT. </p>

<p>So cut the lies and misleading bullshit. Or get help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am on board with the Berenstein Bears, but I will say I am a HUGE Star Wars fan it has and always will be &quot;No, I am your father&quot; then he says &quot;Look inside yourself, you know it be true&quot;. I quoted that without looking it up. Everyone has always gotten it wrong because. &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; sounds way cooler!!</p>
