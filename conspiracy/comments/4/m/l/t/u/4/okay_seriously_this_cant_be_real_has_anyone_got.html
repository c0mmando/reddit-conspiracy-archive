       First of all, it's "Luke, I am your father" not "No, I am your father", yet, a lot of people remember it the second way. I remember it the first way, but somehow; it's the second. Nelson Mandela, died 2013; no, no way. I seem to remember as a kid in the 90's that Mandela died then. Some people have said it was the late 80's. Nice, he's still alive. The point of this is to see if anyone has info on it or can debunk it (memory is hard to debunk, and goes along with that whole free will thing). I swear to god it's the "Berenstein Bears" not the "Berenstaine Bears."  Why are so many people having these memories? And why have little things been changed? In the bible I KNOW FOR A FACT it used to say "the lion will lay down with the lamb" at the beginning of Isaiah 11:6. No it's "the wolf will lay down with the lamb." What's the difference? If you know your bible than you know there's a difference between the biblical wolf and the biblical lion. Why and how would the elite travel through time and change these millions of little phrases, ideas, and words? Because they can. At least, that's the theory. Edit: see CERN.

       I don't give a shit what any one from this universe says, but I remember universe E. Berenstein bears (I'm part German, I know the fuckin' difference - and was made proper by German Grand parents. stein (Steen) not stein (shtine), very different they told me.), Louis Anderson passed from a heart attack (but now is alive and well). Just a few. Something fucky happened and I think it was either 9/11 or possibly CERN. The end of the Mayan calendar 2012 was not a end of the world scenario, but a great "unveiling" of information. What do we see now? A great awakening... Something fucky is going on, and it's very occult/esoteric... The survivors of the Great Deluge tried to fuck with time and space, which led to the Great Deluge. CERN (imo) and TPTB (survivors) are meddling where they should not be meddling, and we will be the causalities of such behavior. Fuckers....

       Earth is 100% free will. There are no other places like that in the universe. All other realities you can manifest/incarnate in aren't and though they have varying degrees of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because earth is 100% free will, DNA from indigenous earthlings is extremely valuable because of it's coding for creative capacity. This has meant higher dimensional entities have been engaged in power struggles to be in control of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lemuria and Atlantis were two civilizations that existed on earth, but fell in time because of their oppressors. They had advanced tech and started to time travel back and forwards to change events to try to save their civilization. This created rifts in the time line and all kinds of strange artifacts in this matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why these higher dimensional beings could be in control of this reality is because in a period of celestial cycles, our solar system is in a more dense region of space where we feel separated from source. This separation causes us all to feel afraid and with our creative capacities manifest negative realities. These entities have set up substantial propaganda distributing institutions to reinforce their paradigm and indoctrinate us but as our solar system moves into a lighter region of space their techniques are beginning to falter.
      </p>
      <p>
       By certain celestial time points, certain moves have to be made by all players involved, but as more conscious awareness comes in, more people are aware of their machinations and see them become increasingly more bizarre and slapstick. People still caught in the illusion of fear, will see it getting worse and worse, but more and more people will be having gestalt moment and transitioning to the new abundant reality that lies adjacent to this one but just out of phase.

       They may be descended from survivors of the deluge but they are not of the "survivors culture" that I speak of. They are the ones who have actively sought to destroy the culture of the survivors.

       I think there are a few branches of survivors and prior to that a few warring groups. I don't think it was all lovey dovery pre-Deluge, but a balance of good and evil, as has always been. You cannot have light without the dark ;)

       day vs. night, sure. but i really don't see the good vs. evil thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       like if i give somebody a hug, i don't see how that necessitates somebody else punching somebody in the face. why can't we all just be nice?
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe if everybody was nice, then the definition of evil would shift. maybe minor slights (by our current standards) would be perceived as evil.

       Mate, you need to spend some time in nature. I have a pack of wolves I'm scouting, 2 of them are slowly turning on the alpha. Pretty fascinating when you witness it. It's nature. You cannot get rid of envy, greed, power, dominance, humans are no different. Spend time in nature and see. You will get a better understanding... You will come to a place of peace and understanding. Much can be learn from just being and seeing nature. Wish we could rise above, but that is not the point of this experience (imo).

       the point - raising consciousness, aligning with the higher Self, and such. in this model, wolves would be a lower consciousness, something we should strive to transcend.

       very cool you can observe wolves well enough to discern their social interactions. i wonder if alpha will become beta? or outcast altogether? stay tuned...

       i tend to think the internet is responsible for this 'awakening', not any kind of energy shift or whatever. then again, the internet was a darpa project, so this could be entirely planned - certainly it was foreseeable that the internet would help get people informed. i can't think this is all an accident.

       one hypothesis could be that the elite are just running a script (i think this may have all happened before) and 2012 is on the schedule for the big wake up. if i'm pessimistic, i think they want as many of us to know what's going on

       Just ask various people all the Mandela's that you are aware of so far and keep a tally, just don't let them know what you are doing. I've been doing it for about 6 months, were screwed, something is amiss and getting worse, did not see this angle coming, and also try to stick to 40+ or older crowd, I feel a lot of the younger ones may not even be aware of the terms they are asked.

       I'm not old enough to remember Nelson Mandela dying (the proposed first time, in prison). Aside from Gorbachev, are there any other historical things that have been perceived to have been changed by The Mandela Effect? Most of the stuff just seems to be related to pop culture.

       My first one was coming out of the bathroom at Barnes and Noble about 2 yrs. ago, looked at the display table, and folded upright was a Berenstain book, looked at my wife who was waiting for me and said "when did they change the name".

       Second one was the James Bond movie Moonraker, when the girl smiled at Jaws she had braces, I know for a fact she had them, was about 17 then when I seen the movie in the theater, and when that

       but i notice that all of these changes are in places where you can't see a live actor's mouth moving - darth vader's mouth is hidden by the mask, the mirror in snow white is cartoon animation, and in field of dreams it's just a voice on the wind. so ALL of these could have been dubbed later by the media companies - and we know these companies are not working for Team People.

       The Lion and the Lamb has been misquoted a billion times. Go back (using archive.org if you like) to some older books (1800's) that discuss the bible/theology. It's always been wolf (If someone time traveled they would have changed writings in the 1800's as well I assume).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a very common saying, Woody Allen once started a quote with that and loads of people used to pay attention to him. The lion and the lamb are both representative of other things in the bible, the wolf not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is seen as both and the phrase represents, to some, a settling down of things (he came as a lamb, will return as a lion, and in the end the two shall 'level' out and there will be rest when the work is done).
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah was using predator/prey, in later times (after nt was compiled and written so much about) people used older sayings and revamped them to more christian themed ones. The bible doesn't say "god helps those who helps themselves" and the whole idea of "If a man doesn't work he won't eat" is ripped from context and used by christians (and others) for their own political reasons.

       I saw "Empire Strikes Back" three times in the theater when I was in high school. "It's always been 'No, I am your father."

      <p>
       Never remember Mandela dying in prison. NEVER. I do remember "Mandela Day" the song by Simple Minds, and then them singing it LIVE when he got out.

       I've been studying the Bible since my single digit years and it's NEVER been "The Lion will lie down with the Lamb." NEVER. Why would it be? Both the Lion and the Lamb are symbols of Christ and his followers. The WOLF is NOT.

       I am on board with the Berenstein Bears, but I will say I am a HUGE Star Wars fan it has and always will be "No, I am your father" then he says "Look inside yourself, you know it be true". I quoted that without looking it up. Everyone has always gotten it wrong because. "Luke, I am your father" sounds way cooler!!
