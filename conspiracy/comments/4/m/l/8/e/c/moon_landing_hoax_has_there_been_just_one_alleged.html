It is really strange no man has back since 1972.. But if it were just the case of hoaxing it, wouldn&#39;t they continually invest until they could actually do it? </p>

<p>It&#39;s easier for me to imagine that there is a better, covered up reason, that we have not been back..? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is my theory? That they landed or not? I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have a theory either way! I just keep getting downvoted. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m asking for is evidence that they didn&#39;t, and someone mentioned the van Allen radiation belt, so I looked into it. And then I asked why that would stop them, and no one has an answer. It seems fully possible for humans to get through the VARB. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t know if it was staged or not, I&#39;m just getting down voted. So bizarre. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Take just the &quot;moon rocks&quot; scandal into account</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;moon rock hoax&quot; (note singular, not plural) is a single rock (out of the 140 that were given out during the 1970s) whose provenance was questionable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the Netherlands is one of the few countries where the location of both the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 gift rocks is known. Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand are others â€” though none has rocks from both missions on permanent public display and some have been kept in storage for decades.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam case appears to be not fraud but the result of poor vetting by the Rijksmuseum.</p>

<p>Spokeswoman Xandra van Gelder said the museum checked with NASA after receiving the rock in 1992 from the estate of the late Prime Minister Willem Drees. NASA told the museum, without seeing it, that it was &quot;possible&quot; it was a moon rock.</p>

<p>But it weighed a whopping 89 grams (3.1 ounces). In addition, its gold-colored cardboard plaque does not describe it as a moon rock.</p>

<p>The U.S. ambassador gave Drees the rock during an Oct. 9, 1969 visit by the Apollo 11 astronauts to the Netherlands. Drees&#39;s grandson, also named Willem, told the AP his grandfather had been out of office for more than a decade and was nearly deaf and blind in 1969, though his mind was still sharp.</p>

<p>&quot;My guess is that he did not hear well what was said,&quot; said the grandson. &quot;He may have formed his own idea about what it was.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2009-09-14-moon-rock_N.htm">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2009-09-14-moon-rock_N.htm</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of that one situation being held up as proof that all of the moon rocks were fakes, when it was most likely a misunderstanding. Funny how the additional context around that rock is never provided by Lucy or others who insist the moon landings were a hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm">All I can find is stuff like this</a> </p>

<p>All I can tell is that there are radiation belts between 1000 and 60 thousand km away. And that NASA fully understood the risks, and took precautions and a chance sending men through it. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love some evidence pointing otherwise, instead of downvotes.</p>

<p>Edit: After reading more, the astronauts went through the Van Allen Belt fairly quickly, within about an hour or so. The metal hull of the spaceship absorbed or deflected most of the radiation. If they spent much time in the radiation zone, or should they have gone through a solar flare, it would have been a much different story. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t see any real proof that this would have been the reason to fake the lunar landings. I&#39;ve been reading about this non stop since last night. I&#39;m genuinely curious but can&#39;t see any legitimate reason as to why it may have been faked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not both, right.  The fact that some still buy this Hollywood garbage boggles my mind.  I can see the shills, primarily because they have to.  But your average, everyday citizen?  Come on.   And not being able to pick up on the level of brainwashing so intense, they are incapable of even lightly discussing it.  It&#39;s so bad, they take it as personally offensive to them.  They saw it in TV, so it HAS TO BE REAL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon landing conspiracy is controlled opposition designed to pull the wool over people&#39;s eyes while far more malicious things are going on.  </p>

<p>The conspiracy gained serious traction following a Fox documentary in 2001 which was broadcast in order to identify the proportion of individuals in the United States who are unable to accurately identify the validity of information.  This is due to a number of factors (largely due to the implementation of &quot;dumbed down&quot; common core education programs) and is used in order to determine what percentage of the population is easy to manipulate due to their lack of basic critical analysis skills.  This is the same controlled media outlet that broadcast <em>Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction</em> for the very same reasons.</p>

<p>There is an overwhelming amount of third-party evidence for the moon landings, while the conspiracy theory relies on weak conjecture and even weaker evidence pieced together through Youtube videos as well as the general poor standard of education of its followers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the conspiracy that the moon landings were faked has gained interest lately is the desire to deny whites this achievement. The moon landings were a white triumph, not a human triumph. White Christian Americans did it, not Chinese, not Russians, not Indians, not Africans -- white males. The liberal left can&#39;t stand this. That want to take it away from whites.</p>

It is really strange no man has back since 1972.. But if it were just the case of hoaxing it, wouldn&#39;t they continually invest until they could actually do it? </p>

<p>It&#39;s easier for me to imagine that there is a better, covered up reason, that we have not been back..? </p>
