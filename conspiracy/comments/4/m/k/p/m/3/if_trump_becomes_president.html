Could Trump ever swing some type of deal that would entice wealthy Chinese to buy up a large portion of these unoccupied homes and move abroad to the United States? I don&#39;t really know the implications of such a deal, but I have a feeling that a portion of populace would not be happy about such a deal. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know...if this is a silly idea, can we at least have some decent discourse of what to expect if Trump is elected in November?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read about housing prices in certain area becoming inflated due to wealthy Chinese families buying up real estate in the United States for a couple of reasons (I&#39;m sure there are more)</p>

<li><p>Property laws are supposedly way different in China than they are in America- I&#39;m not exactly sure the differences but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s difficult for most Chinese to actually own their homes/land in China.

<p>So you have no argument, can’t even explain what you think bigotry is (and which it isn’t), and think where you live defines what you know. Somehow.</p>

<p>Bet you think that Japanese have an inherent knowledge of Nobunaga’s campaigns, huh.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your conversation is predicated on lies and unsubstantiated bullshit and when called out on this you spew insults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a supporter of Trump. However, I don&#39;t pretend to know his policies judging from his stump speeches, which essentially are just advertising... being vague, sounding powerful, etc.... The only thing I was referring to was his foreign policy speech, which I surprisingly really agreed with him on... for the most part. </p>

<p>The only person I definitely support is Gary Johnson. I voted for Sanders because I think he&#39;s a good person, I just disagree with his ideologies. With that in mind, anyone that goes off of the news snippits of Trump and jumps to huge conclusions about him is, IMO, dumb. It should be clear he is just using NLP, and advertising/persuasion techniques to get votes in the primary... That&#39;s the game and he played it pretty well. But to listen to his little speeches and actually think you can draw any honest conclusions is just shallow. He doesn&#39;t really say anything much... That&#39;s why I&#39;ve withheld judgement on Trump until I actually know the policies he wants to implement... As of right now, the only real specific policy I&#39;ve heard was his foreign policy speech, which I liked because it was essentially &quot;bring the troops home, no more nation building, stop being the worlds police, etc.&quot; I was very surprised to hear it because of the reputation Trump gets.</p>

<p>My big issue is with everyone calling him a bigot, etc. When he first started going around the media and I heard people saying he was racist and a bigot and whatnot, I thought he must have been. For example the Mexican quote that I heard everywhere made it seem like he said all mexicans are drug dealers and rapists. If I listened to the news and hopped on the bandwagon I would still think that... But I looked up the speech and watched it in whole and he is very clearly not being racist. He was speaking somewhat off the cuff and giving examples on why open borders are bad... which I don&#39;t necessarily agree with, but I understand the point he was trying to make.</p>

<p>Since then I always hear people taking little bits of something he said, or something that could be implied if taken out of context, or slightly twisted... I&#39;ve looked into it a few times and each time the people raving against Trump are totally exaggerating and acting pretty immature. So, I withhold my opinion on him until I actually know. For now, all I know is his foreign policy, which I like. </p>

That&#39;s why I&#39;ve withheld judgement on Trump until I actually know the policies he wants to implement... As of right now, the only real specific policy I&#39;ve heard was his foreign policy speech, which I liked because it was essentially &quot;bring the troops home, no more nation building, stop being the worlds police, etc.&quot; I was very surprised to hear it because of the reputation Trump gets.</p>

<p>My big issue is with everyone calling him a bigot, etc. When he first started going around the media and I heard people saying he was racist and a bigot and whatnot, I thought he must have been. For example the Mexican quote that I heard everywhere made it seem like he said all mexicans are drug dealers and rapists. If I listened to the news and hopped on the bandwagon I would still think that... But I looked up the speech and watched it in whole and he is very clearly not being racist. He was speaking somewhat off the cuff and giving examples on why open borders are bad... which I don&#39;t necessarily agree with, but I understand the point he was trying to make.</p>

<p>Since then I always hear people taking little bits of something he said, or something that could be implied if taken out of context, or slightly twisted... I&#39;ve looked into it a few times and each time the people raving against Trump are totally exaggerating and acting pretty immature. So, I withhold my opinion on him until I actually know. For now, all I know is his foreign policy, which I like. </p>
