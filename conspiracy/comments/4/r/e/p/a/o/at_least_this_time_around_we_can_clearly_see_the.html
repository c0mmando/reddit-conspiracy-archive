       Remember, about 8 years ago, hearing about some guy you'd never heard of running for president? ...Barack... Obama? who?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, most of us had no idea who he was at first... and when we finally took the time to see what he was all about, it was a breath of fresh air from the last guy we we're watching bumble his way through things. Obama seemed really intelligent and was saying all the things the people were looking for... it was basically a breeze getting him to be president... the whole damn world was behind him at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       We then watched Obama become the same controlled puppet of war, fear, and corruption like the rest since JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, looking at Hillary, it is a completely different story. It is a much harder sell. We all already know who she is and we know she has numerous scandals and cover-ups to continually work around. With the FBI taking care of one of the last big hurdles of Hillary's campaign, it has become blatantly obvious what is really happening...
      </p>
      <p>
       We are clearly seeing the 'The Powers That Be' pull their strings and work the system to allow their chosen puppet continue on with the shit-show that we all deal with everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least this time around, we can clearly see the corruption... and it will be very hard to continue to push further control over us over the next 4-8 years.

       is a list of people prosecuted under Espionage Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take note of JAMES HITSELBERGER.  There was zero accusation of any intention to leak documents, harm national security, or otherwise subversive acts that Comey falsely implied are the standard for such cases.  Furthermore, he was only accused of mishandling two documents compared to the thousands of classified emails of Clinton.  So the whole shtick about "mass mishandling" rather than one or two incidents is total bullshit too.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was merely accused of mishandling classified information at the 'secret' level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary mishandled SAP information, which is even above top secret - many, many times worse than Hitselberger and considered a grave threat to national security (hence even tighter controls than Top Secret).
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, Comey's excuses for no indictment are straight up lies.

Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The investigation did not reveal evidence that Nishimura intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel.

        The Clintons have a personal net worth in excess of 100 million.
       </li>
       <li>
        They run a foundation that pushes through ~$100 million per year.
       </li>
       <li>
        One of them is a former President.  The NSA use to report to this guy.  He knows plenty of people that can do cybersecurity right.

       These are not your friendly naive retired neighbors down the street living on a pension and asking the fourteen year old next door how to send emails.  They have serious cash, serious connections, and the things that they do are intentional.

       People with this kind of wealth, power, and access don't do oopsies.
      </p>

       In other words, the extreme lack of security on Clinton's server is a
       <em>
        feature

       , not a bug.  They are WAY beyond competent and wealthy enough to have avoided this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you step outside the Overton window that the mainstream media has painted for you, it is immediately obvious that the private server was a means of distributing national security information to foreign buyers under the cover of plausible deniability.

        Bill Johnson, who was the State Department’s political adviser to the special operations section of the U.S. Pacific Command, or PACOM, in 2010 and 2011, says secret plans to eliminate the leader of a Filipino Islamist separatist group and intercept Chinese-made weapons components being smuggled into Iraq were repeatedly foiled.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a dramatic solution, the Special Operations Command stopped giving advance warning to senior State Department officials about raids, Johnson says. Whatever the cause, the leaks stopped. In February 2012, Dr. Abu and two other senior militants were eventually killed in what was described as “a U.S.-backed airstrike.”

       Brilliant post and spot on. The Clinton Foundation is a prime example of this. My question is "Are the Clintons unique in selling state secrets to foreign buyers, or is this, too, a feature, not a bug of the executive branch?" Is this something one has to do to even get to those highly coveted positions of power?

       I never fell for the Obama bamboozle 8 years ago. He filled me with zero hope because I already was able to see through the charade that is politics. 8 years later, and the results have supported that fact. Welcome to the Summer/Fall of 2008 Part II, everyone.

       And that is precisely the way the real elite intended it to be. Making the corruption so obvious that even the sheeple starts waking up. It's a controlled awakening designed to make people embrace the NWO when Hillary and the rest of the corrupt old world order is flushed down the drain.

       Obama is the last President of the USA. This fall will be dramatic, and it'll mark the end of the OWO and the start of seven years of chaos, war, famine, natural disasters and economic turmoil. Then, in 2023, the globalists will introduce the NWO. Order out of chaos.

       Goddamn that's bleak! I can see what you're saying... but the war, famine, economic turmoil takes participation on our part... and I am generally more optimistic that the awakening going on won't be able to be controlled as they think/hope.

       No matter what they try... we will always have the true power in numbers. As we wake up and realize this power... I think we'll see a different outcome than your prediction (I hope!).

       All the heavy lifting needed to completely control the awakening has already occurred, a thousand times over. Even the brightest and most perceptive people in the truth movement are running full speed toward "evolution of consciousness" and the occult, the same Luciferianism the elites practice, sincerely believing these things are meant to be kept secret from us, as if getting deeper into them will actually help us. In truth, these powers and the spirit beings behind them have been pulling the strings the whole time, and the deeper we get into the mysteries, the more we will accept the NWO willingly - which is exactly what is happening now with no signs that anything will stop it. This is what the most highly attuned among us are doing and promoting, to this very day. Meanwhile, everyone else further down the ladder has been happy to obey the TV and the popular consensus like a thoughtless puppet - no doubt in my mind whatsoever that this is exactly what they will do again as Luciferianism and "evolving the consciousness" becomes the new normal. Power in numbers is a funny joke really. We do have the numbers, and all those numbers are in the enemy's ranks.

       Are you saying we're going to get a Hillary specifically so she can fuck us to death, and then we'll beg for Mc(G)lobal?  If so, you're probably right.

       Although I agree with everything you say I think this last part is grossly overestimating the intelligence and interest of the average person. We're all fucked, our children and their children will live in a world that we only know from dystopian sci-fi movies.

       I remember watching CNN announce Obama's election to congress. I remember watching it and wondering why the election of a young senator from Chicago was worthy of national news. Then he became president, and I wondered if it was already known that that would happen when he was elected to congress.
