       And while we shouldn't ignore the scandal entirely, when there is sufficient evidence to show legitimate misconduct or to suggest a coverup, we should  be mindful of contrived partisan distractions and how they can affect the 'signal to noise ratio' in a forum such as this, ergo the left-right paradigm:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This "left–right paradigm" concept theorizes that the two opposing political parties utilize their tremendous hold over mainstream media to dramatize political distractions and engage in covert warfare and operations, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Divisive issues are purposefully fed through the major media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden and ulterior (and sometimes global) agendas. By drawing attention to the differences between the two embedded political systems, ideologies, races and classes, the political groups obscure political clarity and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, which enables the ruling class to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances that actually works. The theory contends that the fresh interjection of a new political party or group (such as the expanding Libertarian or Green parties) into the political arena, would be the only way to provide a means to break the cyclical paradigm, currently established in the political system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The "false left–right paradigm" is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book "Tragedy and Hope"—
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers."
        </p>
        <p>
         "Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy."
        </p>

       Well, there has been absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation in all of this so there you go. It is the legal money laundering front for the Clinton's that has a web of connections that touch most officials in our government both Republican and Democrat.

      <p>

      <ol>
       <li>
        ) Why are we still under COG governance after 15 yrs---are we really to believe that johnny sand sandals is going to swim over the ocean and blow us up, or that mohammed the drive thru krispy kreme is really here to blow us up?   I think neither of those are true, so....stand down, m'fckas
       </li>
       <li>
        ) What can we do to nullify ALL LAWS in the country since they no longer apply for the one person surrounded by controversy for 4 decades
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Is Hillary Clinton a co-mason or Eastern Star?  Don't we have a right to know which secret societies to which she belongs?
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Playing devils advocate, did Clinton have a separate email to protect herself from a totally corrupt CIA and GOP that are colluding to destroy her presidency, and if so what is the evidence for it?
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Playing angels advocate, is Clinton being protected by CIA, and how do we find out?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Is Barry Barack Soetoro Hussein Obama a CIA agent.  An asset?  A mole?  A double agent?  Don't we have a right to know?   what's the FBI's stance?  What's Mossad's Stance?  What's MI6's stance?  What's the KBG's stance.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        ) With globalism being thrust and foisted upon the global everycitizen post 9/11, making borders irrelevant, doesn't the american public, as well as the global everycitizen (everyone on earth) have a right to know the above things?
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Why are we tolerating secrecy of any kind, now that we are in (G)lobal?
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Fuck reality.  Sorry that's not a question.

       Damn good questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to answer these it would go something like this
1. We will always have this level of surveillance if not more. It has nothing to do with terrorism (ever wonder why they have failed to stop attacks if they are watching everything), but to monitor public opinion and be able to react if things turn sour. Not in the sense of rounding up people but in a way to make people happy and passive. To keep people involved in the system. Rounding people up would be a sign that it is literally the end of the show. Now this could happen in the future but I think that it would be a long ways off. I have a side theory but it is pretty out there.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        We can do absolutely nothing unless we want to live apart from society either in jail or in some remote rural setting. They will simply not allow it
       </li>
       <li>
        Eastern Star
       </li>
       <li>
        I would guess the separate email was not wanting an official record of any conversations.
       </li>
       <li>
        I wouldn't say the CIA as a whole but by those in power which I am sure has some CIA involvement.
       </li>
       <li>
        He is just part of those in power
       </li>
       <li>
        Absolutely. My belief is that they who are in power and driving it feel the public is too stupid to understand what they are trying to do and could derail it. If you have a chance read the first chapter or maybe it is the forward to Edward Berney's Propaganda (it is short I promise) I think that sums up there thoughts of the public perfectly
       </li>
       <li>
        I think the majority are because it is too hard to accept that reality is very different then what they have been told. Others tolerate it because they can see through it and can put some pieces together. Then there are the people who it drives crazy. They get mad, frustrated and put their energy to things that just make us look crazier or don't help in any way.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       My question coming out of the whole thing is why would a secretary of state have knowledge or be emailing about SAPs?
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is really just out of morbid curiosity knowing her association with Laurance S. Rockefeller, Bigellow Industries, her interest in UFOs and the secret space program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see so much anger on this sub over everything. While I know this is not a popular stance I just let it go. To me it is like watching theater. It is fascinating. In the end I am powerless to change it. If a president or general can be killed trying to change it what difference would I possibly make. I would rather watch the show and see the moves being made so I can keep myself and loved ones out o there way.
