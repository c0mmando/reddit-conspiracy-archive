<p>They have spent $4.5Million so far.</p>

<p>Easy to manipulate, difficult to manipulate well. You need to bring certain posts to the top and control the narrative in the comments. Lot of good it will do to get a post praising Hillary to the top if the comments just shit on her. I mean look at comment posting on Pro Hillary(or Trump for that matter) videos on youtube. Trump supporters control those comment sections 10-1. Refer to my other response I made to you about this for further details.</p>

<p>Not really. Xenophobia is deeply unhealthy behavior.</p>

<p>Trump is a guy with ties to the mob presently facing a lawsuit for running a fraudulent university, with a long history of settling fraud suits.</p>

<p>He is deeply opposed to rule of law.</p>

<p>He is also deeply opposed to freedom of speech. He is pro-torture. He is in favor of foreign entanglements, as he has repeatedly said he wants to blow up ISIS and attack Syria.</p>

<p>And there were no &quot;illegals&quot; in the US when it was founded. Everyone here was a citizen, unless you were a Native American, in which case you were considered to belong to another country at the time.</p>

<p>The FBI didn&#39;t fail on the guy in Orlando at all. The guy in Orlando was not connected to any terrorist organizations. He was basically a shithead who claimed he was totally awesome and a big bad terrorist, but he wasn&#39;t actually in contact with any terrorist organization.</p>

<p>Do you know how many dickheads there are who claim to be badass criminals in the US?</p>

<p>Lots.</p>

<p>Most of them are mentally ill blowhards or wannabes. And he was no different.</p>

<p>He was a psycho, but being a psycho isn&#39;t illegal. What was illegal was him murdering a bunch of people.</p>

<p>He claimed to belong to multiple opposing terrorist organizations. No one who was an actual member of those groups would do that, because they hate each other and have deep religious differences between them in some cases.</p>

<p>He may have convinced himself he was a soldier on the side of Allah, but he wasn&#39;t a member of terrorist organizations and at the time the FBI investigated him, he was just a garden-variety nut.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He hates the US. Deeply. He opposes everything the US stands for. He hates our freedoms and our way of life.</p>

<p>He still wants to have trade and immigration with other countries just at managed rates.</p>

<p>He did make contact with terrorist organizations(travels to Saudi Arabia previous to attack) and frequented their sites which led to him being investigated in the first place.</p>

<p>He also just claimed ISIS only didn&#39;t he? Even claimed ISIS in the 911 calls. All these terrorist groups have some variations in their belief system but still have much more similarities than differences. Switching between these groups for terrorists is not abnormal.</p>

<p>He may have been psychopathic. That would need an evaluation. Not all mass murderers are psychopaths by definition. Some have ideologically justified reasons for their attacks. The percentage of DSM criteria psychopaths in a population is much lower than that of murderers. This all doesn&#39;t change the fact that even with a lot of background information, the FBI can&#39;t determine who is and isn&#39;t a threat. If a refugee isn&#39;t on our known terrorist database, we have little background of who they are and if there are bad apples in the bunch.</p>

<p>What about our freedoms and way of life does he hate? Seems like he supports all freedoms. As far as the press, he is running for President of the US and there is a company owned by his Rival&#39;s supporter constantly publishing dishonest news stories. Just like the writer can publish what they want, Trump can choose who he invites to his rallies. Since he&#39;s only kicked out 1 of dozens of the press vs. Hillary who doesn&#39;t even hold press conferences, I&#39;d say he&#39;s done much less to stifle the media than she has.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t encourage mob violence at his rallies? Time and time again, videos released show Trump supporters get attacked much more often than them being the attackers. Even in his rallies in Texas, cops said that protesters were being bussed in and they were the ones attacking Trump supporters.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t psychic. You believe Hillary will accomplish it, and I believe Trump will. So far I&#39;ve seen Hillary oppose taxing products coming in from other countries or limiting the influx of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say we had open borders. I was saying that a wall would help control that number of illegal immigration to keep it within manageable ratios for employers to employees.</p>

<p>Numbers I found on politifact were increasing Syrian refugees to 65,000. Total refugees to 155,000. If we just focus on the Syrians, I would much rather house 325,000 in another country like China. May not be a big deal to you but to them it&#39;s a really big deal. That&#39;s a really large group of people that we can help escape war in their country while helping them build a self sustaining community somewhere safe.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to add to my earlier statement about illegal immigration, I&#39;m not saying Hillary wants to increase bringing in illegal immigration. Just that she hasn&#39;t taken initiative to decrease how many people come here illegally. Laws that would give courts the ability to deport illegal immigrants(with discretion) and a wall to keep them out are how you keep control of employer to employee ratios. If everyone who is deported comes back in the same way they did the first time, it doesn&#39;t do much good in keeping job positions open for people who are here legally and will get paid a legal wage.</p>

<p>His wall is worthless. Most illegal immigrants are here illegally via the power of visa overstays. A wall, in and of itself, won&#39;t stop people who want to cross the border illegally; getting over or under or through a wall is simply not very hard.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He has said he wants to revoke freedom of speech and freedom of the press so that he could go after the press for saying mean but true things about him, like they do in Europe. He has had an inconsistent view of the right to bear arms. He doesn&#39;t believe in the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment or the right to due process. He doesn&#39;t believe in equal protection under the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like the writer can publish what they want, Trump can choose who he invites to his rallies. Since he&#39;s only kicked out 1 of dozens of the press</p>

<p>He has blacklisted at least seven major media outlets.</p>

<p>Press conferences are irrelevant.</p>

<p>He has said he would pay legal costs for supporters who attacked protestors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time and time again, videos released show Trump supporters get attacked much more often than them being the attackers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have been the attackers in many cases, and in many cases they&#39;ve gotten into fights (which is to say, both sides have been fighting). Moreover, they frequently provoke conflict.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that the protestors haven&#39;t done bad things a lot, because they have behaved reprehensibly.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t have fights like that at Cruz or Rubio or Jeb rallies. Or at Clinton or Bernie rallies.</p>

<p>Trump attracts violence and basks in a culture of violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I&#39;ve seen Hillary oppose taxing products coming in from other countries or limiting the influx of illegal immigration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free trade is good. Trump shouts about how evil free trade is while engaging in it himself. You buy lots of goods from other countries.</p>

<p>The reality is that free trade makes for lower prices and better products. It also means more exports, which means mroe jobs.</p>

<p>Wiki but has sources. Estimated border crossings would be around 500k. Around 50% of the 1Million who came in 2015.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a saying but idk if you&#39;ll like it so I made a more logical point underneath. &quot;Locks don&#39;t keep out criminals, they just keep honest people honest.&quot; If you leave your phone locked in your car, there is a much lower chance of it being stolen than if you leave it out in the open on a table or on the floor. The idea is that a normal person may see it out in the open and take it since that action involves little &quot;criminal thought&quot; vs someone who is a criminal breaking into a car to take it. Walls work just like locked doors work. They set up 10 foot walls that are easy to clime around music events, but only a small percentage of people climb over them. Without walls a lot more people sneak in.</p>

<p>A high wall is only part of the equation. Constructing that high wall will give us straight and clear line of site for several miles at a time. Would make for a much more efficient border security program.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apadivisions.org/division-18/publications/newsletters/gavel/2013/07/personality-disorders.aspx">http://www.apadivisions.org/division-18/publications/newsletters/gavel/2013/07/personality-disorders.aspx</a>
It is in the DSM.</p>

<p>EXACTLY! The FBI is not infallible. Would you let 65,000 strangers come live in your home? Aside from potential risk, why take the action that helps less people? Like I said before, you can pay to house 5x that much in another country and help them develop a safe, self sustaining society.</p>

<p>Terrorist members have jumped between groups in the past. The development of ISIS had help from other radicalized groups, not just those fighting against the government in Syria/Libya.</p>

<p>Not revoke freedom or speech or freedom of the press. He wanted to be able to hold media accountable for libel like you can if someone lied about you or your business in the real world.</p>

<p>He completely supports right to bear arms and talks about he is endorsed by the NRA. You really seem to be reaching at this point.</p>

<p>He is in support of due process just like every president in the past including Obama who has left Guantanamo Bay open. No cruel and unusual punishment. Waterboarding only against ISIS who already torture prisoners and people who are not even soldiers. We still hold our laws of war with UN countries, not mass murdering terrorist organizations. Supports in equal protection under law.</p>

<p>He has blacklisted them from his private press conferences. Hillary doesn&#39;t hold any press conferences so has essentially blacklisted all media outlets. He does it so companies who lie about him don&#39;t get more publicity. She does it so she doesn&#39;t have to answer any questions that weren&#39;t approved by her campaign.</p>

<p>That comment was a joke and the crowd took it as one. Do you really think anyone who isn&#39;t a robot would hear that and think &quot;Hmm Trump said he&#39;ll pay my legal bills, I should totally go attack that guy.&quot; Since humans understand jokes, it didn&#39;t turn into a frenzy with the whole crowd punching the protester.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say both sides didn&#39;t fight. I said that in most videos and even media coverage, Trump supporters got attacked much more often. I&#39;ve seen many videos of Trump supporters being chased down and attacked. Even the girl that had the whole mob yelling at her. Trump supporters attacking has been much less frequent.</p>

<p>Well if you convince large groups of people that someone is Hitler reborn to kill them all and that all his supporters and racist women haters, it turns people violent. They stop seeing them as people with different views and see them as enemies. This is why Trump supporters get attacked much more frequently.</p>

<p>Free trade can be good, not always. We can&#39;t compete with manufacturing costs of countries paying people $2 a day and not putting any regulations on their factories. Also companies making products for less money doesn&#39;t mean the product gets cheaper. When the Oreo company moved to Mexico, Oreos here still maintained their price. The company didn&#39;t move to Mexico to save Americans money, it moved there to make a profit.
Trading to other countries is good but don&#39;t forget that America is one of the largest if not the largest consumer countries in the world. Complete free trade leads to more manufacturing jobs lost due to inability to compete with their cheap unregulated work force than more jobs with an increased market since making products here in the US is more expensive than making them in other countries. People make more money selling to us than we do to them.</p>

<p>On that note I would like to introduce the idea of trade leverage. Say we start putting a 30% tax on all items coming in from China. This would lead to us being able to buy more American good and put a strain on China&#39;s economy. At that point we can set up negotiations to reduce this tax if they do things like reduce carbon/methane emissions, increase minimum wage, more regulations on their products coming into the US. Leverage our position as global consumers is one of the best ways that we can encourage the world as a whole to improve. Also what I said earlier about investing in agriculture/shelter for poor countries rather than trying to bring as many of them as we can over here.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a saying but idk if you&#39;ll like it so I made a more logical point underneath. &quot;Locks don&#39;t keep out criminals, they just keep honest people honest.&quot; If you leave your phone locked in your car, there is a much lower chance of it being stolen than if you leave it out in the open on a table or on the floor. The idea is that a normal person may see it out in the open and take it since that action involves little &quot;criminal thought&quot; vs someone who is a criminal breaking into a car to take it. Walls work just like locked doors work. They set up 10 foot walls that are easy to clime around music events, but only a small percentage of people climb over them. Without walls a lot more people sneak in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong that locks keep honest people honest, but you don&#39;t understand the US-Mexico border.</p>

<p>People who cross the border are already consciously breaking the law. It isn&#39;t like walking into an unlocked house; they&#39;re crossing the fucking desert at night or fording the Rio Grande. Or being smuggled across in vehicles or crawling through tunnels or similar things.</p>

<p>Anyone who goes to the US border to enter the country illegally are already going through a ton of trouble to do so. They&#39;re already committed to violating the law.</p>

<p>Thus, the fence won&#39;t stop them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not revoke freedom or speech or freedom of the press. He wanted to be able to hold media accountable for libel like you can if someone lied about you or your business in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media exists in the real world and are subject to the same laws as everyone else.</p>

<p>The standard for libel is extremely high in the US because you are free to express negative opinions about people. The person who wants to sue you for libel must prove that your statements were maliciously false. The truth is an absolute defense, and opinions are protected under the first amendment.</p>

<p>So people are free to call him a fascist. He doesn&#39;t like it. But then, he has actual neo-Nazis volunteering as campaign staff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He completely supports right to bear arms and talks about he is endorsed by the NRA. You really seem to be reaching at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump has said that people who the government adds to the terrorist watch list should not be allowed to purchase guns. Taking away people&#39;s rights without due process is a pretty big deal, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No cruel and unusual punishment. Waterboarding only against ISIS who already torture prisoners and people who are not even soldiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except by that logic, it is okay for ISIS to torture our people, because the Bush administration tortured people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has blacklisted them from his private press conferences. Hillary doesn&#39;t hold any press conferences so has essentially blacklisted all media outlets. He does it so companies who lie about him don&#39;t get more publicity. She does it so she doesn&#39;t have to answer any questions that weren&#39;t approved by her campaign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Washington Post got blacklisted for reporting his statements verbatim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well if you convince large groups of people that someone is Hitler reborn to kill them all and that all his supporters and racist women haters, it turns people violent. They stop seeing them as people with different views and see them as enemies. This is why Trump supporters get attacked much more frequently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it doesn&#39;t help that a lot of them are actual neo-Nazis, and <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/633086/neonazis-vow-defend-donald-trump-supporters-republican-convention">that the neo-Nazis have pledged to show up to &quot;defend&quot; him.</a></p>

<p>And you know, him <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-says-deleting-alleged-anti-semitic-tweet-was-mistake-1467852667">retweeting anti-semetic stuff...</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can&#39;t compete with manufacturing costs of countries paying people $2 a day and not putting any regulations on their factories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given we are the #2 exporter in the world, clearly we can and do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Oreo company moved to Mexico, Oreos here still maintained their price. The company didn&#39;t move to Mexico to save Americans money, it moved there to make a profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a company is unprofitable, it will be shut down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trading to other countries is good but don&#39;t forget that America is one of the largest if not the largest consumer countries in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, which means free trade is good, because it means we benefit from it because we consume so much. Low prices = us being richer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complete free trade leads to more manufacturing jobs lost due to inability to compete with their cheap unregulated work force than more jobs with an increased market since making products here in the US is more expensive than making them in other countries. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t have a free trade agreement with China, which is where most of those &quot;job losses&quot; came from.</p>

<p>Moreover, those jobs are never coming back. Ever. It is Trump&#39;s big lie. It isn&#39;t worth having people in the US do those jobs. We have seen manufacturing return to the US in recent years, but there hasn&#39;t been much job growth because we automate the labor.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the ultimate reality of the situation - it isn&#39;t worth paying people $10 an hour to do something worth only $2 an hour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People make more money selling to us than we do to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except both sides benefit enormously from increased trade. We make more additional money due to trade than we lose in the trade deficit, and we also become much wealthier because we can afford more stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On that note I would like to introduce the idea of trade leverage. Say we start putting a 30% tax on all items coming in from China. This would lead to us being able to buy more American good and put a strain on China&#39;s economy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand at all on even the most basic of levels.</p>

<p>China will further restrict trade from the US in response to putting a tariff on their goods.</p>

<p>This will hurt the US for two reasons - one, it will drive up the cost of many goods by 30%+, and secondly, it will cause US exports to fall, which costs American jobs.</p>

<p>It will hurt the US more than it will hurt China, but it would hurt both countries. Which is stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Security has decreased people coming over. Places with walls have much less people trying to scale those walls. A bigger better wall will decrease flow of cars, slow down people trying to climb up/down, and help our border security by improving line of sight. The other thing about a wall though, is you can&#39;t see what&#39;s waiting for you on the other side. If the ground in lower, if there are cops already waiting there to pick you up. It adds an element of uncertainty. As far as honest people honest thing. Getting smuggled in doesn&#39;t make you feel like a criminal, crossing a river doesn&#39;t make you feel like a criminal, climbing a 20+ foot wall with barbed wire on top probably will set you over that threshold.</p>

<p>Who is his neo-Nazi campaign staff? Wouldn&#39;t a news organization calling Trump a Nazi be libel? What about lying and saying that Trump said Obama was working with ISIS? Those seem like blatantly false and libelous statement. Lies and false accusations are different than spinning words he said to have a different interpretation than the one he intended to make.</p>

<p>Again though, not talking to media means 100% media blackout for Hillary. At least Trump talks to several MSM organizations like CNN and MSNBC who attack him all the time. Attacks and spinning stories are shitty but he doesn&#39;t kick them out.</p>

<p>Hillary agrees on that no gun while on terrorist watch list too. What he also said was that the FBI should have a limited amount of time in order to make a case against the person to keep them on the no fly list. Hillary did not talk about any time limits. Trump is much more 2a supportive than Hillary.</p>

<p>ISIS already tortures our people. Like I said before, they don&#39;t play by the rules. And waterboarding it still light years away from them. They use schools to store weapons and use human shields.</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t WaPo got kicked out after they lied and said that Trump accused Obama of supporting ISIS.</p>

<p>His staff retweeted a picture they either were sent or found online that had spread to dozens of blogs and websites by that time. I&#39;m sure the staffer didn&#39;t pull it from the anti-Semitic comedian and hold onto it for 2 weeks. Even then, his staff didn&#39;t see it as anti-Semitic. People asked on the street by different news groups didn&#39;t find it anti-Semitic. You had Rabbi&#39;s calling in saying it wasn&#39;t anti-Semitic. It is an image that in and of itself isn&#39;t anti-Semitic. If someone want to look for meaning to it they will find it. Trump saw it as Hillary being corrupt, not Jewish. Media spun it to try to make people believe something else. That star was posted on a Frozen DVD(or could be a book, don&#39;t remember) no one called it anti-Semitic. Media also liked to ignore the fact that Trump&#39;s Son-In-Law and daughter are both Jewish. How he turned an all white Miami golf club into one that accepts Jews and Blacks. Unlike Hillary who remained in an all white golf club.</p>

<p>As far as some bad supporters go, Hillary has ones with tainted history too. Including killers, rapists, racists. Just because Hitler enjoyed drinking milk doesn&#39;t make milk evil. I don&#39;t blame Trump for his supporters just like I don&#39;t blame Hillary for hers. Except the ultra wealthy using her to get rich of course ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.worldsrichestcountries.com/top_us_exports.html">http://www.worldsrichestcountries.com/top_us_exports.html</a>
We export different things and mostly to countries like Canada, Mexico, the UK. Only 7% goes to massive China since they can produce their own goods for cheaper. Also don&#39;t forget those exports include things like airplanes and weapons. We also have 19 Trillion dollars worth of investing in companies that makes us look like we&#39;re growing but we&#39;re in the same bubble as we were in before the market crashed last time.(same bubble, different reasons)</p>

<p>The Oreo company was profitable in the US hiring US employees and paying taxes into our system. Now they are more profitable and we lost those jobs and taxes.</p>

<p>Think about what you just said about low prices. China has really low prices. They don&#39;t get to buy more because the prices are low. People who lose jobs can&#39;t buy cheaper items or pay taxes into the system. Also free trade doesn&#39;t mean cheaper prices. Many companies have moved and now make much more money and still sell for the same price. Moving the company isn&#39;t for us to save money, it&#39;s for them to make more money.</p>

<p>No free trade with China is what helps keep our jobs going. Put more taxes on products coming in and some of those companies will find it cheaper to relocate back to the US and sell to us here.</p>

<p>If it costs $2 an hour to make it there, $3 more an hour to ship it here, and $5 more an hour after we tax it, that will make it competitive here.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t become wealthier. The rich become wealthier. They get more power to limit their competition. They get more control over who sells what. Our country isn&#39;t wealthier now, we are just floating on debt. You can say &quot;oh but we spent less than a trillion so far this year&quot; to which I say &quot;If you buy a 40 inch pizza it might feed you a couple days before you get hungry again&quot;. We aren&#39;t building sustainable system. There was the whole huge solar energy scandal with Obama where it was his backers who received a majority of $150 Billion and the majority of those companies bankrupted soon after. I think our total renewable energy production only went up a few percent too.</p>

<p>They suffer more from us than we suffer from them. We are 18% of theirs while they are also only 7% of ours. It would be like them saying &quot;let&#39;s lose 18% of the money we make from exports by not selling to America instead of only losing 2% by decreasing our smog production.&quot; These sort of deals, although usually done for other things than decreasing smog or improving worker minimum wage, happen all the time all over the world on every level. In the end, we will still have higher taxes on their products that will get reduced as they reduce smog output and improve minimum wage.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You see tons of articles about Hillary&#39;s emails, but few articles about Donald Trump&#39;s known to be illegal dealings - his ties to the mob, his fraudulent Trump University, his fake hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get out, please.</p>

<p><strong>If Trump just cashed in the interests of the [dollar amount] he inherited, he’d be richer.</strong></p>

<p>He only inherited $50 million, like his siblings, and he’s the only one to have become a billionaire. Also, his total fortune is much higher than the commonly repeated $4 billion. Also, this argument basically boils down to: “He went out, built something and created tens of thousands of jobs instead of doing nothing all day. What a moron. Now, if he&#39;d just leeched off his inheritance, that’d be a guy I could respect!”</p>

<p><strong>He’s racist!</strong></p>

<p>Calling for a temporary ban of a certain ethnic or religious group that has proven to be dangerous to national security is allowed by 8 US Code § 1182. Roosevelt and Carter did it, as well. Even Obama did it, when he stopped all refugee requests from Iraq for six months in 2011. And pointing out the national statistics that show how certain races and religions have a huge tendency to commit violent crimes isn’t racist, either. Facts aren’t racist. There is a reason Trump has the highest support of blacks of any GOP member in modem times. And there is a reason even Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam has recently endorsed him.</p>

<p><strong>He wants to deport ALL immigrants!</strong></p>

<p>Nope. Only the illegal ones. Which, again, is what the law says. How is wanting to uphold the law extremist or racist?</p>

<p><strong>He’s a misogynist!</strong></p>

<p>Criticizing one or some women does not a misogynist make. He also criticizes a lot of men. Is he a misandrist? Screaming “misogyny” to deflect legitimate criticism is dishonest. A lot of women understand it, as proven by the fact that millions of them are voting for Trump.</p>

<p><strong>LOL hair</strong></p>

<p>Each strand is made of pure gold and woven by blind American nuns. It&#39;s also real.</p>

<p><strong>He went bankrupt a bunch of times. What a loser.</strong></p>

<p>Donald Trump owns more than 500 companies. Of these, he only declared bankruptcy 4 times. That’s an impressive success rate that very few can brag about. Also, “bankruptcy” does not necessarily mean failing. There are different kinds of bankruptcy, and using it is an extremely common strategy. Trump used bankruptcy to force renegotiation of his debt terms. He ended up making millions in savings by shafting the bankers who were screwing him with high rates which were locked in even after the rates had dropped. Aren’t they screwing you, too? Isn’t it about time we have someone in charge who has experience being screwed instead of doing the screwing?</p>

<p><strong>His hats are made in China! He’s a hypocrite!</strong></p>

<p>Some knock-off companies have started making and selling MAGA hats and shirts on their own. Trump is not affiliated with them. His real merchandise is all made in the USA. While it’s true that some of his many companies use Chinese workers, this is because the current regulations force businesses to outsource jobs to stay competitive. Trump is the only candidate that wants to change this system even though, as an entrepreneur, it would be convenient for him not to. So he’s certainly the least hypocritical of all candidates.</p>

<p><strong>He’s gonna start WW3!</strong></p>

<p>He’s the least likely candidate to do so, since he wants peaceful relations with Russia and pushes for military isolationism. Hillary is a neocon warmongering cunt, since she’s bought and paid for exactly by the people that profit immensely from foreign wars.</p>

<p><strong>But he wants to bomb ISIS!</strong></p>

<p>Coddling terrorists only allows them to behead and burn more people. A true leader always chooses the hard option without hesitating, if the only other option is letting terrorist win. Every day we hesitate in destroying the Islamic State with all our power, that day’s victims are also on our hands.</p>

<p><strong>He’s unpresidential.</strong></p>

<p>Low blows and provocations on social media are an advertising move (and clearly a very successful one), and the other candidates do just the same–and worse–but with less benefits. Also, “presidential” is a very personal opinion. Please point out a more presidential candidate, keeping in mind that there is a difference between being “presidential” and being just another professional politician trained to spew bullshit non-arguments for hours on end.</p>

<p><strong>He’s stupid!</strong></p>

<p>From his old tests, his IQ has been estimated at 156 at the very least. That’s genius territory.</p>

<p><strong>He wants to waste billions on a wall.</strong></p>

<p>Like Israel and other countries with a criminal immigration problem did, seeing immediate and immense benefits. And since illegal immigration is estimated to cost $82 billion a year, and The Wall is not liable to cost more than $20 billion, in 3 months we would start earning money and paying for itself (and as many upgrades as technology can allow).</p>

<p><strong>Trump instigates violence at his rallies!</strong></p>

<p>Up to this point, the only ones to use violence have been Sanders’ and Clinton’s supporters. In Chicago, thousands of them attacked Trump’s supporters, the police, and even the ambulances that came for the injured, besides looting stores and breaking everything in sight for no reason. Said looters have then bragged about their First Amendment infringement on all social media and received no punishment whatsoever for their criminal actions. Sanders, Clinton and the other republican candidates even accused Trump of this chaos in a desperate, shameful attempt to grab some more votes. Trump, on the other hand, has always openly disapproved violence and asked his followers to be peaceful. The only “violent” acts that ever happened at his rallies were the removal of disruptive protesters. Yet, because one old white man punched a black, offensive protester in the face, every Trump supporter has instantly been labeled a violent racist. Because attributing the flaws of single individuals to whole heterogeneous categories of people is not racism, when the liberals do it.</p>

<p><strong>His real name is Drumpf.</strong></p>

<p>It’s amazing how racist the liberals get when Trump’s family anglicizes their name, something that almost every immigrant does. Are they going to start calling everyone by the names of their ancestors? Are they going to mock every immigrant who Americanizes their name? The hypocrisy is staggering.</p>

<p><strong>He’s just another 1-percenter! Only rich white people want him to be president!</strong></p>

<p>If he’s supported by the 1%, why is literally every single news site, GOP candidate, and Democratic candidate against him? Why do rich people like George Soros fund other people to run against him, to rally against him, and to riot against him if he only has the interests of rich people in mind? Wouldn’t all the corporation-supported media and 1-percenters be backing him instead of trying to label him as Hitler?</p>

<p><strong>He wants to make all muslims be put on a register in the US! It&#39;s just like when Hitler wanted all the jews to wear the star of David!</strong></p>

<p>This is a blatant quote-mine that pops up in nearly every argument about Trump. It’s referring to when he was talking about ISIS members sneaking in with the refugees that ended up in Canada. He wants to know why the NSA didn’t put them on their “terrorist” registry when they’re all posting shit on Twitter and Facebook, posting pictures of themselves with guns, ISIS flags, etc. and coordinating through social media. The NSA already puts people on registry lists when they show potentially dangerous behaviors, why is it wrong for Trump to want people who have posted evidence that they’re terrorists to be on those lists?</p>

<p><strong>He wants to take away freedom of speech by suing the media for reporting the truth!</strong></p>

<p>The media almost never tells the truth and has ruined people’s lives with their slander and libel, which is already illegal to do. They just don’t get punished for it. Trump just wants to enforce already existing slander and libel laws. Is enforcing the laws that already exist wrong?</p>

<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you destroy any shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is generally a sign of severe mental illness if you think that everyone who disagrees with you is a shill.</p>

<p>Seriously. I doubt they spend money on Reddit. TBH, it&#39;d be fairly trivial to make Reddit all-Hillary, all the time. It only takes a few thousand votes to get a story to the front page. Set up a farm with a large number of IP addresses (either IPv6 or use TOR or something similar). You could use a botnet to upvote and downvote posts of your choosing. It would easily overwhelm the natural number of people on Reddit, and you could set the whole thing up for a couple of million dollars.</p>

<p>Reddit just isn&#39;t big enough to withstand something like that. 5k votes or so is enough to completely flood news or politics or whatever else with what you wanted or to suppress whatever you wanted. You&#39;d only need maybe a dozen people to do 24/7 manipulation of Reddit.</p>

<p>The fact that they don&#39;t do so suggests that they don&#39;t consider Reddit worthwhile enough to do this with.</p>

<p>And I mean, if you think about it, the very fact that it only takes a few thousand posts to get to the front page indicates there just aren&#39;t all that many people who are actually actively engaging here.</p>

<p>You still need people to write different posts. Respond to hundreds of arguments simultaneously. You also need accounts that have been around for long periods of time so they don&#39;t look bought out. I have no doubt there are less shills than Trump or Bernie supporters on reddit. Upvoting and downvoting through a botnet can only happen so quickly otherwise I&#39;m sure some mod will get suspicious at these thousands of (especially new)accounts simultaneously up/downvoting posts in unison.</p>

<p>As far as things making it to the front page, you have people spread around the many subreddits. A 5k post could have 8k upvotes/5k downvotes if we are ignoring vote fudging(something they do here on reddit to keep posts from getting to high up).</p>

<p>As far as reddit being worth it.

<p>I do understand that one of the symptoms of mental illness commonly seen in conspiracy theorist types is that they are important, but the reality is that arguing with fanatics is a pointless waste of money. They&#39;d be better served simply upvoting positive messages or arguments against what people are saying than to argue with specific posters, who are unlikely to be convinced by anything they say.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how realistic those numbers are; Reddit, like many other ad-supported websites, may inflate its numbers to make it seem more attractive to advertisers. We know the problem is widespread.</p>

<p>I mean, it is worth considering that the default subs only have ~10 million subscribers. That sounds like a lot, but many are inactive, and many people have multiple accounts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how many people Reddit actually has on it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;d even notice, TBH. They&#39;re not really the sharpest tools in the shed, and I don&#39;t think the mod tools are actually all that great analytically.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that hard to do, given that people have historically done multivotes to promote themselves and took long periods of time to catch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that you&#39;re calling me a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; on your post on the conspiracy subreddit.</p>

<p>Many threads are argued throughout reddit on political subreddits. They need people to respond to them. If the post has 2 pro Hillary comments at the top and 100 Anti Hillary comments on the bottom, it looks like a botnet upvoted those 2 posts and Hillary doesn&#39;t actually have many supporters. Upvotes, downvotes, comments, new submissions. Months of employment for you guys and your handlers. Probably costs some money. </p>

<p>Subscribers isn&#39;t the entire picture though. Reddit has a quite a bit of lurkers on here too. When the Obama AMA came on Reddit&#39;s page views brought in MSM like numbers.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier in this posts, multivotes aren&#39;t enough. You need comments in the thread showing support too. Actually didn&#39;t they catch Unidan for having multiple accounts to upvote his own posts?

<p>I&#39;ll be real honest here: the only reason I&#39;m subscribed to this sub is because I thought it would be a bunch of Weekly World News kind of wacky conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I am constantly disappointed by the sub actually just being generally kind of sad.</p>

<p>It took them ages to catch Unidan. If you were reasonably sophisticated, you&#39;d create a bunch of accounts and use a rotation of them to upvote stuff, preferably mirroring time zones, possibly after doing something where you had, say, Hillary post a link to somewhere on Reddit, thus allowing you to conceal your surge of new voices.</p>

<p>As long as you weren&#39;t using the same IP addresses for them (and with IPv6, you could give each of them their own address), it would be pretty hard for them to catch them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It took them a while to catch him but didn&#39;t he only have like 2-3 accounts? That would definitely make it harder to catch vs 5k accounts. I agree with your theory of setting up a botnet with a few thousand accounts for upvotes but you still need pro hillary/anti trump/bernie posts in the comments. Comments also seem more viable when it is older accounts.</p>

<p>As far as the IP addresses, if all the same few thousand IP&#39;s are upvoting/downvoting all the same posts, in the same order, it looks bad. I&#39;m sure many mods will let it slide but a suspicious mod might want to look deeper into it so it&#39;s good to cover your bases just in case.</p>

<p>Well, if I was doing it, I&#39;d have set up an excessive number of accounts, and use a randomizer to determine when within certain hours of the day each would post. This would mirror natural human behavior - most people only read Reddit in certain hours of the day, so by making it look like they were in various time zones/working hours, you&#39;d be able to manipulate things better. It&#39;d also mix up which accounts were voting.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;d add to the expense, but depending on how you set the whole thing up, it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be all that much harder. The hardest part (and largest expense) would probably be the IPs and making sure that they seemed variable enough.</p>

<p>Of course, it also depends on how many people use, say, TOR; if large numbers of Reddit users use TOR, you could actually do it far more easily.</p>

<p>That said, they might have defenses against people using TOR for stuff like this. Then again, they might not; I don&#39;t know how sophisticated Reddit is technologically.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but you could just hire some people.</p>

<p>I think the biggest problem with it would be that you&#39;d have to figure out some way to get those large number of accounts to post at least occaisionally. I don&#39;t know what the usual voting:commenting ratio is, but that seems like the most likely thing to screw over your botnet.</p>

<p>That being said, you probably would only want to run the whole thing for a limited period of time, and then taper it off after the election; the less time you run it for, the less impact it has, but the less likely you are to get caught. You don&#39;t want to get caught running something like that (and if you do get caught, you&#39;d probably want to have a second botnet come up shortly thereafter for your opponent so you could &quot;catch&quot; them too).</p>

<p>Of course, this is all off the top of my head.</p>

<p>I suspect the real thing that would stop people from doing this would be the danger of actually getting caught running something like that. Then again, we know that in previous elections various politicians bought fake facebook accounts to make them seem more popular (though there&#39;s some evidence that the candidates themselves were being scammed on those).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I have no clue.</p>

<p>I just would like to think that if someone gave me $4.5 million to take over Reddit for Hillary that I&#39;d actually be able to do it, so I assume that other people, who presumably do this for a living, would be able to come up with something at least as good if not better than I can by randomly coming up with shit.</p>

<p>Then again, I might be underestimating how much it would cost to set up that many IP addresses. Addresses themselves are really cheap, but you might need more expensive tech than I&#39;m imagining to do it.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you&#39;re just willing to commit blatant crimes, you could set up a malware botnet for less, but &quot;Clinton campaign infects PCs to promote herself on Reddit&quot; is... not the headline you want.</p>

<p>Though if you were particularly dastardly, you could maybe con the other campaign into paying you for illegal services, and then turn them into the FBI.</p>

<p>We know that there have been attempts to hack into Hillary&#39;s email server. We know that she accessed her emails in areas where they could have hacked. What we don&#39;t know is if other people managed to get into her server and stole her classified and private emails.</p>

<p>If she became president, someone or some country could have that information. Information that Hillary and her lawyers painstakingly deleted all traces of before handing it over to the FBI.

<p>The FBI found no evidence her servers were compromised; that doesn&#39;t mean that her servers <em>weren&#39;t</em> compromised, but it makes it less likely. Ironically, the State Department was compromised during the same time period.</p>

<p>No. There&#39;s no evidence she did anything illegal, so there&#39;s no reason to believe she&#39;s any more vulnerable to blackmail than literally any other politician.</p>

<p>Indeed, there&#39;s good reason to think she&#39;s less vulnerable, simply because all the previous &quot;scandals&quot; thrown at the Clintons has resulted in them weathering them, so threatening to reveal something damning about them is kind of like pissing into the sea.</p>

<p>I mean, she&#39;s certainly less vulnerable than Trump, given Trump&#39;s dealings with the mob and long history of court settlements and fraud suits and mistresses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mob history has been looked into and turned up short. Same with court settlements and mistresses. Hillary&#39;s campaign has been spending a lot of money trying to dig up any dirt they can on Trump. If they don&#39;t find it, no one will.</p>

<p>I see where you&#39;re reasoning comes from suggesting that since they couldn&#39;t find evidence of a successful hack would make her less likely to have been compromised. I disagree though. Many hack attempts and use in &quot;hostile&quot; areas seems to point to a successful hack. We do also know that people she communicated with were compromised too. They could have some of those deleted emails.</p>

<p>Gonna use another example since I like them. Say you got a fiancee who&#39;s been going out a few nights a week saying she&#39;s out with her gf&#39;s watching movies. This has been going on for a couple years now so you decide to look into it. Turns out your wife lied and is hanging out with just 1 guy friend. They also are going to his house every time she&#39;s out. You start realizing that she did come home smelling musky those nights too.</p>

<p>So you ask her about it and when you do, a phone rings. She pulls it out of her pocket, and it&#39;s not the Samsung Edge you got her for Christmas. No, it&#39;s a cheap burner phone that you didn&#39;t even know she had. So you ask her &quot;hey babe can I see your text messages to that dude you been hanging with&quot; and she says sure but first deletes 33,000 text messages before handing you the phone.</p>

<p>You end up going through the phone and it seems like the half that she left behind doesn&#39;t contain anything illegal. She did mention in one of the texts how she needed this second phone so you wouldn&#39;t be able to see her texts on your monthly statement. You also find out that she had several dirty pictures saved on that phone that turns out might&#39;ve been sharing a line with a college fraternity.</p>

<p>Now you didn&#39;t find anything criminal, but then again, it was pretty bad of her to delete those 33,000 texts. Do you still trust her? Are you sure those frat guys didn&#39;t got the texts or the nudes and wouldn&#39;t try to blackmail her with them? Do you still put that ring on it come November?</p>

<p>No. The cause is our social circles. I don&#39;t spend time around the kind of person who supports Trump; I haven&#39;t seen a single Trump bumper sticker or sign.</p>

<p>But they do, presumably, exist (though I suppose the news could just be playing an elaborate prank on us all).</p>

<p>Actually, it isn&#39;t. None of the sites I regularly frequent aside from Reddit and 538 have any Trump supporters at all that I&#39;ve found. IRL, I don&#39;t see any Trump supporters, ever.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t very surprising. I live in an affluent area with low unemployment, little racism, ect.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure poor black people would struggle to find Trump supporters in their communities as well.</p>

<p>Remember, Trump has record <em>low</em> support. The dude has the highest unfavorables anyone has ever seen out of a presidential candidate for a major political party. A quarter of Republicans say they won&#39;t vote for him, and less than half of them voted for him in their party primaries.</p>

<p>He has <em>loud</em> supporters, but they&#39;re really not that numerous.</p>

<p>Ron Paul was similar, if you can remember him - he had very vocal supporters, but they weren&#39;t actually all that numerous.</p>

<p>If you spend time around poor white trash and racist middle classholes, his support may seem omnipresent. But outside of them, he has few enthusiasts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like someone gave you the most obvious script in existence. Trump rallies have thousands of guests! Hillary&#39;s...not so much. Trump&#39;s subs have hundreds of thousand of subscribers. Hillary&#39;s...not so much. I live in a purple state and have met tons of Bernie and Trump supports but not many for Hillary. Gotta be a reason why her campaign has spent over $80 Million so far on her campaign. Seems like she&#39;s not as confident about how many supporters she has.</p>

<p>My guess is &quot;not much&quot; and &quot;not many&quot;, and the fact that you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist likely means that you hang out with people who share your political views as most people are made uncomfortable by people who spout off about chemtrails and similar nonsense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m upper-middle class. I went to Vanderbilt University. My friends are all intelligent, educated people with science and engineering and writing and rationalist backgrounds. Even amongst the people who make less money, they still work in the technology, education, or literary sectors.</p>

<p>People who are successful are in part successful because they&#39;re capable of recognizing reality.</p>

<p>People who are unsuccessful are in part unsuccessful because they blame their failures on other people.</p>

<p>A lot of conspiracy theories are ultimately about people comforting themselves about how they&#39;re secretly a majority, no matter what reality says, and that the world is out to get them, and that their failures are not because they&#39;re just kind of generally worthless human beings.</p>

<p>Meh conspiracy theories aren&#39;t necessarily comforting. It is the brain freaking out to tie events together in ways that may or may not exist.

<p>The FBI didn&#39;t fail on the guy in Orlando at all. The guy in Orlando was not connected to any terrorist organizations. He was basically a shithead who claimed he was totally awesome and a big bad terrorist, but he wasn&#39;t actually in contact with any terrorist organization.</p>

<p>Do you know how many dickheads there are who claim to be badass criminals in the US?</p>

<p>Lots.</p>

<p>Most of them are mentally ill blowhards or wannabes. And he was no different.</p>

<p>He was a psycho, but being a psycho isn&#39;t illegal. What was illegal was him murdering a bunch of people.</p>

<p>He claimed to belong to multiple opposing terrorist organizations. No one who was an actual member of those groups would do that, because they hate each other and have deep religious differences between them in some cases.</p>

<p>He may have convinced himself he was a soldier on the side of Allah, but he wasn&#39;t a member of terrorist organizations and at the time the FBI investigated him, he was just a garden-variety nut.</p>

<p>He hates the US. Deeply. He opposes everything the US stands for. He hates our freedoms and our way of life.</p>

<p>He hates freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He encourages mob violence at his rallies.</p>

<p>He still wants to have trade and immigration with other countries just at managed rates.</p>

<p>No one is opposed to this.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a loud blowhard with no plan to accomplish it.</p>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t have open borders. That&#39;s why we have illegal immigrants. If we had open borders, they wouldn&#39;t be illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>The US is not going to accept many refugees anyway. It isn&#39;t a big deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just one question for you about Hillary since this is the one I haven&#39;t found a good response for.</p>

<p>We know that there have been attempts to hack into Hillary&#39;s email server. We know that she accessed her emails in areas where they could have hacked. What we don&#39;t know is if other people managed to get into her server and stole her classified and private emails.</p>

<p>If she became president, someone or some country could have that information. Information that Hillary and her lawyers painstakingly deleted all traces of before handing it over to the FBI. It could give someone or some country the ability to blackmail the president. Doesn&#39;t that bring up justification for increased concern?</p>

<p>Just in case you say &quot;if they had it they would have released it by now&quot;. They would be waiting until she was president and had the most to offer and the most to lose from the information getting out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a saying but idk if you&#39;ll like it so I made a more logical point underneath. &quot;Locks don&#39;t keep out criminals, they just keep honest people honest.&quot; If you leave your phone locked in your car, there is a much lower chance of it being stolen than if you leave it out in the open on a table or on the floor. The idea is that a normal person may see it out in the open and take it since that action involves little &quot;criminal thought&quot; vs someone who is a criminal breaking into a car to take it. Walls work just like locked doors work. They set up 10 foot walls that are easy to clime around music events, but only a small percentage of people climb over them. Without walls a lot more people sneak in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong that locks keep honest people honest, but you don&#39;t understand the US-Mexico border.</p>

<p>People who cross the border are already consciously breaking the law. It isn&#39;t like walking into an unlocked house; they&#39;re crossing the fucking desert at night or fording the Rio Grande. Or being smuggled across in vehicles or crawling through tunnels or similar things.</p>

<p>Anyone who goes to the US border to enter the country illegally are already going through a ton of trouble to do so. They&#39;re already committed to violating the law.</p>

<p>Thus, the fence won&#39;t stop them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not revoke freedom or speech or freedom of the press. He wanted to be able to hold media accountable for libel like you can if someone lied about you or your business in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media exists in the real world and are subject to the same laws as everyone else.</p>

<p>The standard for libel is extremely high in the US because you are free to express negative opinions about people. The person who wants to sue you for libel must prove that your statements were maliciously false. The truth is an absolute defense, and opinions are protected under the first amendment.</p>

<p>So people are free to call him a fascist. He doesn&#39;t like it. But then, he has actual neo-Nazis volunteering as campaign staff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He completely supports right to bear arms and talks about he is endorsed by the NRA. You really seem to be reaching at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump has said that people who the government adds to the terrorist watch list should not be allowed to purchase guns. Taking away people&#39;s rights without due process is a pretty big deal, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No cruel and unusual punishment. Waterboarding only against ISIS who already torture prisoners and people who are not even soldiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except by that logic, it is okay for ISIS to torture our people, because the Bush administration tortured people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has blacklisted them from his private press conferences. Hillary doesn&#39;t hold any press conferences so has essentially blacklisted all media outlets. He does it so companies who lie about him don&#39;t get more publicity. She does it so she doesn&#39;t have to answer any questions that weren&#39;t approved by her campaign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Washington Post got blacklisted for reporting his statements verbatim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well if you convince large groups of people that someone is Hitler reborn to kill them all and that all his supporters and racist women haters, it turns people violent. They stop seeing them as people with different views and see them as enemies. This is why Trump supporters get attacked much more frequently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it doesn&#39;t help that a lot of them are actual neo-Nazis, and <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/633086/neonazis-vow-defend-donald-trump-supporters-republican-convention">that the neo-Nazis have pledged to show up to &quot;defend&quot; him.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can&#39;t compete with manufacturing costs of countries paying people $2 a day and not putting any regulations on their factories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given we are the #2 exporter in the world, clearly we can and do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Oreo company moved to Mexico, Oreos here still maintained their price. The company didn&#39;t move to Mexico to save Americans money, it moved there to make a profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a company is unprofitable, it will be shut down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trading to other countries is good but don&#39;t forget that America is one of the largest if not the largest consumer countries in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, which means free trade is good, because it means we benefit from it because we consume so much. Low prices = us being richer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complete free trade leads to more manufacturing jobs lost due to inability to compete with their cheap unregulated work force than more jobs with an increased market since making products here in the US is more expensive than making them in other countries. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t have a free trade agreement with China, which is where most of those &quot;job losses&quot; came from.</p>

<p>Moreover, those jobs are never coming back. Ever. It is Trump&#39;s big lie. It isn&#39;t worth having people in the US do those jobs. We have seen manufacturing return to the US in recent years, but there hasn&#39;t been much job growth because we automate the labor.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the ultimate reality of the situation - it isn&#39;t worth paying people $10 an hour to do something worth only $2 an hour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People make more money selling to us than we do to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except both sides benefit enormously from increased trade. We make more additional money due to trade than we lose in the trade deficit, and we also become much wealthier because we can afford more stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On that note I would like to introduce the idea of trade leverage. Say we start putting a 30% tax on all items coming in from China. This would lead to us being able to buy more American good and put a strain on China&#39;s economy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand at all on even the most basic of levels.</p>

<p>China will further restrict trade from the US in response to putting a tariff on their goods.</p>

<p>This will hurt the US for two reasons - one, it will drive up the cost of many goods by 30%+, and secondly, it will cause US exports to fall, which costs American jobs.</p>

<p>It will hurt the US more than it will hurt China, but it would hurt both countries. Which is stupid.</p>
