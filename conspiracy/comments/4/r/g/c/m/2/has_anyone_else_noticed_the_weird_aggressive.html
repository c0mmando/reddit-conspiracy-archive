<p>What more proof would you need.  The truth is staring before you.  Even from the legal perspective where there is a massive double standard where a man can slap a woman and get thrown under a jail but a women can stab a man and get probation.</p>

<p>It has infiltrated every aspect of life.  Now, I love women.. yes women but this is being purposely done to destroy society as a whole.</p>

<p>Men and Women are biologically wired differently.  And to push women into roles (Company based, Presidential Based etc.,) that were created by men for men, and have attributes where the biological man&#39;s brain just works better at, what happens when you put a woman in this role. </p>

<p>Most fail.  </p>

<p>Not because their dumb or anything like that.  The role&#39;s and attributes are geared toward the masculine mind, not the feminine mind.  And as such, it will be very difficult for a woman to sustain it.  </p>

<p>The bigger question why a would a woman even want to any way?</p>

<p>There&#39;s things women can do that a man literally can only dream of doing... so what&#39;s the big push to drop all things feminine and become feminine-masculine machines destined to take over the masculine world when the feminine world has yet to be scratched?  Strange... indeed.</p>

<p>One will say to the above.... YOU&#39;RE JUST A MISOGYNIST!  Far from.  Why is it that when a woman creates a company and grows it, sustainable on a large scale, everyone gives her a standing ovation as if that is something difficult for a woman to do?  Because it is. And that is why you rarely see it.</p>

<p>Yet men create companies all the time, and it is expected, it is no big deal.  Again, because the brains are wired differently biologically.  </p>

<p>I know for sure this is the Twilight Zone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By nature, women are extremely calculating and logical when it comes to choosing the entities that will empower or support them. They also have strong in-group bias, so what one woman does, many others will follow and support. Knowing this psychology, they can be used to expand government, and thus control by the elites. This quality has made it easy to push the idea of equality, and say that women and men are equal, and that it is a virtue for a woman to attempt to copy what was previously known as a man&#39;s path. In essence, women are being turned into defacto men. </p>

<p>Going back to what I previously stated, women only choose the best mate (entity) to support and reproduce with. Women now being on economic par with men having chosen what was previously considered a man&#39;s path, means that they have no need for these men that otherwise would support them financially. They look to higher social status males (or males that provide benefits other than financial ones) to copulate with and attempt to lock down in commitment. Of course, having an even bigger pool of women to choose from, high status men have no desire to settle down with just one woman (this plays into male biology as well - by design males can impregnate hundreds of women, women only need one provider). </p>

<p>So what you end up having is a decline in offspring because of this new mass of unsexed men and hedonistic behavior of women jumping from high status male to high status male. For the women and men that do &quot;settle&quot; and get shacked up, divorce comes later, hence the divorce industry (divorce rates are sky high in the west). </p>

<p>Depression also comes to many, as seemingly decent men who did what they were told to do to become successful (there&#39;s also an element of emasculating social programming there that I didn&#39;t mention) are finding that women aren&#39;t flocking to them at all. </p>

<p>For women, as their bodies age and they become less fertile, their bodies scream to them &quot;find me a mate now!&quot; as a last ditch effort to get pregnant (before time runs out), which is of course in conflict with their social programming of equality and &quot;I can have it all&quot; mindset. This too leads to depression and neuroses in women. </p>

<p>As for the genocide part, look to the birth rates in various western countries to see who&#39;s not reproducing anymore. </p>

<p>This was a quick and dirty reply, but there&#39;s so much more that can be said about this whole situation. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s to commit genocide on us. It has nothing to do with Hillary. She&#39;s a byproduct of the mental illness itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://captaincapitalism.blogspot.com/2015/09/blame-women-disproportionately-for.html">You&#39;ll want to read this.</a> It all started almost 100 years ago... Except don&#39;t do what the title says. Women are just pawns. Blame... well, you know <em>who</em> to blame.</p>

<p>Men are superior to women and therefore have more responsibilities than women. Women are superior to children and therefore have more responsibilities than children. Superiority means “leadership over”, due to increased maturity and reason. It does not come with a connotation of hate. Women do not hate children because they’re superior to them in the same way that men do not hate women because they’re superior to them. Although plenty of men have their hang-ups with women, the reverse is just as true. Men are more mature than women, who are more mature than children. This is about hierarchy of maturity, of which men are at the top. The less mature you are, the less reasonable you are. You wouldn’t want an immature person in charge of you, and, assuming you found someone competent, you wouldn’t say you were equal to the person in charge of you.</p>

<p>The problem with people today is women have been told that it’s bad to let a man be in charge of them, and men have been told to treat women as equals rather than subordinate dependents for whom they care. Men are superior, and they have to be in order to be eligible. That’s reality. For the sake of ego preservation, a woman will want to think of herself the “first mate” or “partner”, but men aren’t the captain, they’re the ship. Without men, there is nothing–neither base nor foundation. Women rely on men vastly than the opposite, and any functional relationship between a man and a woman is always based on this model.</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean she’s not important, it means men are depended upon more than they depend on. It means the distribution of burden is disproportionate in order to reflect your difference in maturity. The male burden is greater because the female need is greater. The female need is greater because women are more immature, and by extension of being less mature, less competent. In fact, it’s dangerous for men to depend on women emotionally, but the reverse is perfectly acceptable. This is the burden that comes with being at the top of the maturity hierarchy. Emotional loneliness is accepting that men cannot confide all their deepest secrets and fears–not unless they’re schmucks who wants to see their relationships fall to shit. Women are so upset they’re not really equals that they’re completely ignorant to the fact that not being the final person on whom everyone depends is a privileged position, that when push comes to shove women want someone to lean on and someone to blame, and that true equality to men is something they could never handle. Like a child who wants to stay up late and eat unlimited amounts of candy, they only see the privileges of being a man, not the burdens.</p>

<p>Notice how women always go on about maturity in a way men don’t seem to care about. They’re like the damn maturity police. It reminds me of little kids who insist they’re grown-ups out of insecurity. “Women are equal to men,” touted by women is the same infantile narcissism as a child claiming “I’m not a little kid anymore!” It stems from the desire to be taken seriously by people of greater maturity and capability. This is all ego. Remember, you will find the truth in action rather than words, for in words they claim equality to man but in action they demand superiority to him. In relation to the statement “women are children” this is hyperbole. What it means is “women are childlike.” If they weren’t, men wouldn’t want them. Feminine charm comes from a certain present-orientation–feminine beauty comes from a lack of aging. Women  play up innocence and play down their cunning because this is what makes them attractive to men. Innocence is an inherently childlike quality. Men don’t try to seem innocent because it’s not masculine. Things that are childlike are inherently unmasculine, but they aren’t unfeminine. Why? Because women are closer to children than men. Stop thinking this is some way of talking women down or some sad attempt at dehumanization. It isn’t. It’s a truism, regardless of whether it suits your sensibilities or feelings. </p>

<p>Shrewd women constantly leverage the appearance of innocence to get people to help them. Women pout, men don’t. Women have strops, men don’t. Women cry more than men. Women are less rational than men. In summary, women are more mature than children, but less mature than men.</p>

<p>You can teach a woman to behave well, but she is still a woman and so requires discipline in the same way a child does. She craves it. She will not “be good” because “she’s a good woman”; she will only “be good” because men convey authority. In order to convey authority, men must be superior–superior meaning more mature and more competent. This is the natural order of things. Egalitarianism is an indoctrinated ideal. It is only “normal” to you because you grew up brainwashed by jewish feminist garbage. It is not normal in nature and it is not indicative of reality.</p>

<p>Women’s childlike qualities are not just physical (smaller, weaker, less hair, etc.); their neonatality is echoed mentally. The most attractive women have greater neonatal traits than less attractive ones. Women and men are not psychological equals. Men can love them, care for them, and even depend on them for small things, but they are not equals and never will be.</p>

<p>As Schopenhauer said, “She is somewhere between a child and an adult; an adolescent, perhaps.” If you can’t accept that–if you need to believe in the feminine ego porn that she’s equal to a man in every which way–fine. Believe it. But that doesn’t mean what I’ve said is wrong. It means you’re unable to accept an aspect of reality that discomforts you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been noticing and thinking this for a while now. But I also see it happening with minority heroes replacing white ones -- Star Wars, women and black men. New hero of &quot;24&quot; is black. There was a huge push for James Bond to be Idris Elba or Gillian Anderson (instead it looks like they&#39;ll go for Tom Hiddleson, so instead James Bond will be played by a gay man, I guess).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s only about women, as much as it is about undermining the white male patriarchy. </p>
