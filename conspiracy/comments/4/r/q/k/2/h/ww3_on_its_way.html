       While some may consider this conspiracy kind of 'out there', looking at the facts and the current trends, it seems entirely possible, especially given what history has shown us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last two world wars in Europe are the result of nationalism, plain and simple, directed towards other nations, and various situations of multi-polar politics, such as prior to World War One where the accumulation of arms resulted, with the death of Franz Ferdinand as a catalyst, in war. 
What we are currently seeing is the re-nationalisation of Europe. This referendum result in the UK is the catalyst of what will become a wave of referendums in Europe, tearing the European project apart and resulting in its collapse, along with the potential separation of the Union over in the UK, just to add insult to injury. 
With the increasing assertiveness of Russia (and the USA), testing boundaries and response times (2013 mock invasion of Sweden, Russia / USA Baltic 'jet face off'), along with progressively projecting her influence into the middle east, not only leading to potential for 'power clashes' reminiscent of pre-World War politics within the middle east through undermining US hegemony in the region, but also exacerbating a NATO Russia divide that is increasingly become apparent (NATO currently engaged in largest exercise ever in Poland / Russian arms build up (

       </a>
       ), along with issues in the South China sea over sovereignty and nationalism (

       </a>
       ), furthered by the rise of North Korea as a nuclear power, the world is in a more unsafe position than it has ever been, since 1945, being a perfect example of multipolarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, even the harmonious Japan has recently, under legislation from government, transformed their military into a force capable of foreign intervention. (
       <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/29/national/politics-diplomacy/japans-contentious-new-security-laws-take-effect-paving-way-collective-self-defense/#.V36uCPkrLIU">

       </a>
       ) Such legislation could result in disputes over sovereign territory such as the Senkaku islands, potentially becoming more heated, simply adding more heat to a boiling pot of Eastern / Western tension.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The country is divided, the conservatives are divided, the labour party is divided". This is just in British politics. Recent politics has been hugely polarising, which is dangerous, as we have seen, twice in a century. Indeed, the rise of Trump or Le Pen in France highlight this. Frederick Bastiat spoke of how "if goods do not cross borders, soldiers will". Indeed, this further reinforces my point. We are not trading with Russia like we should be. In fact European sanctions have pushed Russia and China closer together than ever before, essentially forming what Bush spoke about, an "axis of evil".
      </p>
      <p>
       This was simply some historical background, and current information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many believe the migrant crisis to be a mistake on the behalf of the EU, highlighting its inability to find common ground due to political, social and economic splits between member states. Some conspiracy theorists thus, due to this obvious failure, believe this was an effort by the 'elites' of the European project to remove sovereign barriers within Europe, thus facilitating the 'European Dream' of a federal Europe that so many European elites very obviously hold. ("“Europe’s nations should be guided towards the superstate without their people understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose but which will irreversibly lead to federation.”" // "There will be no peace in Europe if the States rebuild themselves on the basis of national sovereignty, with its implications of prestige politics and economic protection…. " - Both quotes Jean Monnet, architect of the European project.)
The migrant crisis was not social engineering to break down sovereign barriers between states, thus facilitating a federal Europe in the long run. It was an attempt to exacerbate the swing to the right, which we are seeing. Those in control are not dumb. They understand human nature, and they also recognise the fact Europe is a culture built on the foundation of ancient ways, hugely resistant to short term change through migration, as somewhere like America may not be. Indeed, the regular publicising of acts of religious fervour in the news, further this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid this is all part of the movie we see unfolding day by day. This is nothing new. The British exit from the EU is not the end of the elite. This is not the end of federalism, and this is not the end of the path we are inevitably going down. We all know what happens in relation to federalism and integration after a war. We have seen it before (both world wars! - WW1 followed by the league of nations, World War 2 followed by a literally endless list of international bodies that undermine sovereignty of states). Perhaps the next one is going to be on such a grand scale, it facilitates integration that we have not yet seen, while also culling huge bodies of the population, making the human race's movement into the future more sustainable, and more controllable.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, to conclude, I believe, like many that the current situation in international politics is being engineered by an elite that we do not see or know of. Again, like many I believe that previous wars have been finely engineered, to further the underlying cause of every conspiracy on this page, and on the internet, a global government with no boundaries and a unified global population. What this may look like (Orwell or Marxist global utopia?) I do not know, so I will leave this to you and your imagination. I believe that what we are seeing in politics with right wing and left wing becoming increasingly disparate and popular, is never healthy, and inevitably results in war. Those who argue it does not, are simply refusing to learn from history. After all, history repeats itself. I believe that Brexit is the beginning of a 're-nationalisation' and weakening of Europe that will result in conflict between Russia and the West (weak Europe = assertive Russia), thus potentially igniting the dangerous situation that is seen in the East, resulting in a world war that will bring about a period of peace and unification like we have never seen before.

       No your absolutely right. What I'm actually doing is totally ignoring the facts, and simply falling for the same western media portrayal as the majority of the population does. Thanks! In SO many ways the US has been worse. Maybe I should correct this.

       While you in some ways correct, you must remember that in 2008 Russia invaded Georgia, essentially a US satellite state for it looking at NATO membership, and the various implications of this (democracy, for example). They also annexed Crimea in 2014 due to its want to become more western and liberal. So while NATO and the EU exacerbate Russian nationalism, Russia is flawed in many many ways.

       Russia is flawed, tell me a state that isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And tell me how can you overlook USA which did that to about mmh... 100 countries to Russia that did it, how much, twice in the last 20 years, maybe 1/10 of USA in the last 100? and it's second greatest power after USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has it's skeletons in the closet, but USA has a fucking graveyard in there. The fact i'm saying you shouldn't focus that much on Russia doesn't mean i take them as holy, hell i know Putin has high mafia circles. But they at best just kill some people and once in an age they invade a country. USA go full MK on citizens and invade routinely using any excuse they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll take a biased natural law against a full-psycho law anyday. I wouldn't want any of them to rule the world, just i believe Russia would be a much smaller inconvenience. Go check the number of wars started by each country since ww2 and you may see why. Best of luck!

       I like the idea that Russia annexed Crimea because it wanted to become "more western and liberal". What evidence can you offer to support that assertion? Russians might retort that Crimea has been part of their nation for rather longer than the USA has existed, and that the Kremlin was acting on a decisive referendum of the overwhelmingly Russian population of Crimea. But your version seems much more likely -- sources, please?

       The referendum was also very obviously faked. The UN declared it illegal.

       I have to say the idea of an EU army to face Russia is an excellent reason for Brexit, and indeed was cited by British military brass as the reason why they voted to leave. I'm delighted Hammond et al will no longer have a voice in the EU to advance their psychotic agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone should be surprised that a region populated by a majority of ethnic Russians voted to rejoin Russia when they witnessed a violent coup against the government that the majority of them voted for. It's one thing to say the referendum was unconstitutional, as the UN did, and I'm open to arguments on the matter. But to claim it was "obviously faked" as you do would require a very high standard of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while we're on the subject of standards of evidence, links to The Guardian do not greatly impress me. The Guardian is a propaganda channel so compromised it actually pretended the British Labour Party was infested with anti-semites in a laughable attempt to remove its leader -- and it's even still trying to pretend that WTC7 was brought down by office fire, 15 years after the event. It's fake through and through.

       Perhaps it was rather rash to say obviously faked, though given Russia's history with democracy, and the links between the Kremlin and the referendum, I struggle to believe anything otherwise.
      </p>

       On the Guardian point, there is, like I said, tonnes of other articles saying the same thing.

       No doubt. But I'm sure if I looked on rt.com (another compromised channel, of course) I could find tonnes of articles emphasising the meddling of Nuland, the use of the right sector in the coup against Yanukovych, the failure of the US to produce a shred of evidence linking Russia to MH17, and so on.

       What has always happened before world wars, is the creation of smaller conflicts throughout the globe, that eventually catalyse a larger, bigger war. Thus, becoming a world war.

       I don't think the US are afraid of starting it at all. They are the ones testing boundaries most of all in the East.

       Do you really can't perceive a difference between the people at the top deciding wars for their own reasons(most wars are economical) and how the elite motivate their population to willingly sacrifice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Chauvinism or Exceptionalism gives a group an excuse for aggression. Nationalism in itself is a defensive concept to protect its entity. Both can obviously be combined but it's not right to define them as the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       WW1 and WW2 from the UK/US elite perspective were wars for (economic) domination.

       Not massively. Chauvinism, exceptionalism, nationalism are essentially the same thing. While I can see where you are coming from, chauvinism being more aggressive, more associated with perceived superiority and thus more likely to cause war, nationalism is defined as largely the same thing. ("a feeling that people have of being loyal to and proud of their country often with the belief that it is better and more important than other countries"). It's just a slightly more extreme form, doesn't really constitute a post I don't think.

       Would wars decided by the political elite best be described as interventions, being so as the elite would intervene (or a least try sell it that way) to gain political, social or economic gain

       I'm not sure, I think what is happening in the US, is either a total fuck up and no thought needed (probably unlikely), or the killing of blacks is in an attempt to enrage the black community (Black Lives matter becoming increasingly militant) thus allowing for the establishment of a more military esque police force. This essentially creates more a police state, easier to control etc.

       I think it has been going on for a long time.
