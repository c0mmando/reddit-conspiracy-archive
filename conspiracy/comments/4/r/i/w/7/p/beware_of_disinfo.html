<p>I hear you <a href="/u/ruejitsu">/u/ruejitsu</a>. It&#39;s meant as obfuscation from the controlled demolitions that took down the twin towers and WTC7. See, they want us to argue about the method of controlled demo (thermite/unproven-tech/a-bombs even!) rather than to focus intently on Newton&#39;s Laws of Motion and how they completely and unequivocally show perfectly timed controlled demos for all 3 skyscrapers.</p>

<p>Start here, with noted physics professor David Chandler. Here, he analyzes the controlled demolition of the North Tower on 91101. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSApOavkHg8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSApOavkHg8</a></p>

<p>Then he gets into the downward acceleration of the North Tower, using a computer program to track the speed at which the &#39;top portion&#39; of the building was given very minimal resistance to the 2/3rds of the intact below structure. </p>

<p><a href="http://911speakout.org/">http://911speakout.org/</a> is a great place to learn more about the controlled demos and the individuals who are coming forward and demanding a new investigation into the controlled demolitions that took place on 91101.</p>

<p>I gave you 3 examples of disinformation <strong>in the same thread.</strong> Don&#39;t get so upset that your question was answered repeatedly! You should be thanking me. Instead you turn into a fussy kid who seemingly pooped their pants.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m posting disinformation, just like you asked for. Don&#39;t ask the question if you don&#39;t like the answers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you just complained about someone doing the same to you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m answering you in 1 thread. The other user followed me through multiple threads. Kids don&#39;t understand the difference between singular and plural. That comes later. You&#39;ll get there eventually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>someone doing the same to you in this very thread</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, singular vs. plural. I gave you multiple examples in <strong>1 thread</strong>, while the other user mentioned <strong>followed me through multiple threads spewing disinfo.</strong> I&#39;m not surprised you&#39;re avoiding looking at that user&#39;s disinformation, it helps you obfuscate better. Example below, for those that are confused by your obfuscation attempts.</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re right, you don&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t mean this sub isn&#39;t being flooded with content by groups that have an ulterior motive.  You act as if whoever might do this is of such low intelligence that they would only create a couple of accounts and just repost the same shit over and over.  Rest assured, astroturfing has become an exact science with oodles of dollars being poured into maximizing it&#39;s effectiveness; It&#39;s not just governments that are interested in doing it, it&#39;s anyone that has something to gain, financially or otherwise, from convincing groups of people that other groups of people approve or disapprove of someone or something.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not debating that the Clinton&#39;s are corrupt garbage, they are, but to think that a subreddit like this wouldn&#39;t be targeted by astroturfing campaigns for political or commercial purposes is naive. </p>

<p>This sounds like you are dismissing the possibility that any, or atleast most, anti-Hillary content that is posted is artificial simply by virtue of the fact that she is a grade-A scumbag and lots of people don&#39;t like her.  </p>

<p>My point in response was that just because she has a way of creating her own negative press doesn&#39;t mean that <em>all</em> the negative content that you find on here about her is from people who are posting it for legitimate reasons.  If that isn&#39;t what you were implying then I apologize.</p>

<p>Then, I asked a user (who was following me from thread to thread) to follow up on his obfuscation from a previous post. SOMEONE on this subreddit erased this link because it made the JTRIG-trainee look like the complete obfuscation expert he is:</p>

<p><a href="https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4qiphn/disinformation_the_noplane_theory_discuss/d4tf1b0">https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4qiphn/disinformation_the_noplane_theory_discuss/d4tf1b0</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s getting the <em>rocky</em> treatment. Anyone familiar with this sub knows what that means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Eh, the Clintons are involved in so much corruption and so many conspiracies you could dedicate an entire sub to them and never run out of content.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actual disinfo or posted here to distract&quot;</p>

<p>This sounds like you are dismissing the possibility that any, or atleast most, anti-Hillary content that is posted is artificial simply by virtue of the fact that she is a grade-A scumbag and lots of people don&#39;t like her.  </p>

<p>My point in response was that just because she has a way of creating her own negative press doesn&#39;t mean that <em>all</em> the negative content that you find on here about her is from people who are posting it for legitimate reasons.  If that isn&#39;t what you were implying then I apologize.</p>
