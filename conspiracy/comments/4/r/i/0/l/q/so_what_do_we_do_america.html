I&#39;m tired of people who say &quot;Americans need to wake up&quot; and &quot;the people are too docile. They deserve what they get.&quot; But when asked what their solution is, &quot;<em>crickets</em>&quot;. If you don&#39;t have an idea, you&#39;re a sheep as well. This is the closest we&#39;ve been in a long time to everyone agreeing on the fact that something needs to be done. But what do we do? My thought is to occupy the House and Senate with hundreds of thousands of people and demand everyone of them resign now. We will vote on new seat holders. I&#39;ve suggested similar ideas in the past but was met with criticism and negativity. So, I ask, what&#39;s everyone else&#39;s ideas on how to take back control of our government? Or are we beyond that and screwed now?</p>

<p>In my opinion, the censorship of the internet is coming very soon.  And once we no longer have this free communication network, all hope for reform will be lost. Back to the days when you only know what you get from the media.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said this a few times.  The public takeover of national TV broadcasting and radio networks must be the first step.
Communication.
Everyone in the country must know what is going on an be aware of the schedule for revolution.</p>

<p>Someone must be the face and voice of the movement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grow a garden. If that&#39;s too much to take on, grow just one plant you can consume. If you&#39;re intimidated by that, consider volunteering with a community garden. If you have no time for that, buy some food at a local farmers market. </p>

<p>Consider organizations like <a href="https://represent.us">https://represent.us</a>. If that particular group doesn&#39;t appeal to you, find one that does. Participate in local elections. Ask friends and family to participate with you. </p>

<p>Shop locally. Try to divert at least some of what you spend toward businesses based in your own community. Spread the word about mom &amp; pops you like. You can even shop locally on etsy. Try to cut out spending at big chains like Walmart, even if you only cut 10%. </p>

<p>Go out of your way (even if only occasionally) to get to know your own neighborhood. See what it has to offer. Support what moves you. Ask friends &amp; neighbors to join. </p>

<p>Think small. You cannot take on the federal government, but you can build a strong support system within your community &amp; move upward from there. Small acts of defiance can make big changes &amp; can be very rewarding personally at the same time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything this person said is something we have done within the past two years. Its hard believe me. The ease of one stop shopping at places like Walmart are so tempting cause if you are not at home chances are you are spending money.</p>

<p>Looking up local farmers market opening times is the best idea to get a start. You won&#39;t be sorry either. Get some meat from the local butchers if there are any. Some fresh fruit and vegetables. </p>

<p>You may not taste the difference, but I assure you that you will notice it after a week. You won&#39;t feel as tired and run down at the end of the day. Rather then spending money to see a movie look for local parks or something like that. </p>

<p>Kids would much rather be outside then in a theater for an hour or two. If they don&#39;t then you need to fix that quick. During the summer we watch the bats together in our back yard. Right now we have lightning bugs that are just breathtaking to watch at night. </p>

<p>As for community outreach this is tricky. You have to find something you enjoy and others may as well. Long time ago I realized that to reach a person you do so thru their kids. </p>

<p>So we started a Lego group at a local library. Don&#39;t hate cause Lego is very relaxing to many adults out there. We had so much Lego that it seemed a waste to just keep it for ourselves. So we started letting others play with it. </p>

<p>Then I got better at finding it cheap so we sold quite a bit off and used the money to buy sets for kids that otherwise wouldn&#39;t get toys at Xmas. Really reached a great deal of parents. </p>

<p>Some it didn&#39;t cause they don&#39;t care about anything but when the next bill is due. We still invite my sons entire class to his Bday party and every year only one kid shows. </p>

<p>Well this year we had a nerf gun war. Just him, his classmate, and the neighbors. He had a ball and his mom was over the moon saying its great he had fun cause usually they don&#39;t do stuff like that at Bday parties here. </p>

<p>Well wife and I have acknowledged that we are &quot;those&quot; parents in &quot;that&quot; house cause we don&#39;t like living that boring life. </p>

<p>Sometimes if the feeling is right I will bring up current events and ask their views. Many have no clue cause they say its above their paygrade or they just don&#39;t have time to worry about it with their jobs and such. </p>

<p>They are complacent with it all. Its not that they are stupid they just feel its in good hands cause they see no ill effects in the day to day they live in. </p>

It&#39;s just that amount of money you&#39;re taking out of the system. Now imagine a thousand people do that, and so on. We&#39;ve now given the agri-corporate-industry a pause. It&#39;s small, but how many dollars does that translate into lobbyist funding? Apply that concept to Walmart. Do something as small as saying you&#39;re only gonna buy birthday gifts from local makers this year. Apply the idea to 1000 people in your community, and so on. That makes a dent in walmart&#39;s expendable lobbyist fund. </p>
