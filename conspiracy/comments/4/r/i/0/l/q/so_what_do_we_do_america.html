       You're tired of the bs and corruption in our government, I'm tired of it, we all want a change. I'm tired of people who say "Americans need to wake up" and "the people are too docile. They deserve what they get." But when asked what their solution is, "
       <em>
        crickets
       </em>
       ". If you don't have an idea, you're a sheep as well. This is the closest we've been in a long time to everyone agreeing on the fact that something needs to be done. But what do we do? My thought is to occupy the House and Senate with hundreds of thousands of people and demand everyone of them resign now. We will vote on new seat holders. I've suggested similar ideas in the past but was met with criticism and negativity. So, I ask, what's everyone else's ideas on how to take back control of our government? Or are we beyond that and screwed now?

       The answer is a national strike. To just stop working. Stop going to work, stop buying stuff, just shut it all down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The French have been trying it, though we've not gotten much news of it here. But that country is close to being brought to its knees by people shutting down the ability to travel or have their trash picked up.

       It would probably have to grow in number over time, like Occupy. The people who start it would need to try and squirrel some money away at first. Some sports stars would be a great way to jumpstart it.

       That's why lots of people wouldn't do it, they wouldn't be able to survive. If we ALL could take a month off work to storm Washington, DC, I think it would be more feasible for more people.

       That's why the french and italians grow grapes.  They get grapes, jam, dolmas (grape leaves) and then they can wash it down with wine.  They trade their grape items for cheese.  And literally sit around drinking wine, eating grapes bread and cheese all day. It's not that bad of a diet.  (joke)

       I agree with op.  Action is needed now before things get much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the censorship of the internet is coming very soon.  And once we no longer have this free communication network, all hope for reform will be lost. Back to the days when you only know what you get from the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said this a few times.  The public takeover of national TV broadcasting and radio networks must be the first step.
Communication.
Everyone in the country must know what is going on an be aware of the schedule for revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone must be the face and voice of the movement.

       Grow a garden. If that's too much to take on, grow just one plant you can consume. If you're intimidated by that, consider volunteering with a community garden. If you have no time for that, buy some food at a local farmers market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider organizations like
       <a href="https://represent.us">
        https://represent.us
       </a>
       . If that particular group doesn't appeal to you, find one that does. Participate in local elections. Ask friends and family to participate with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shop locally. Try to divert at least some of what you spend toward businesses based in your own community. Spread the word about mom &amp; pops you like. You can even shop locally on etsy. Try to cut out spending at big chains like Walmart, even if you only cut 10%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go out of your way (even if only occasionally) to get to know your own neighborhood. See what it has to offer. Support what moves you. Ask friends &amp; neighbors to join.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think small. You cannot take on the federal government, but you can build a strong support system within your community &amp; move upward from there. Small acts of defiance can make big changes &amp; can be very rewarding personally at the same time.
      </p>

       We are not screwed. You can only eat an elephant one bite at a time.

       Everything this person said is something we have done within the past two years. Its hard believe me. The ease of one stop shopping at places like Walmart are so tempting cause if you are not at home chances are you are spending money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking up local farmers market opening times is the best idea to get a start. You won't be sorry either. Get some meat from the local butchers if there are any. Some fresh fruit and vegetables.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not taste the difference, but I assure you that you will notice it after a week. You won't feel as tired and run down at the end of the day. Rather then spending money to see a movie look for local parks or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids would much rather be outside then in a theater for an hour or two. If they don't then you need to fix that quick. During the summer we watch the bats together in our back yard. Right now we have lightning bugs that are just breathtaking to watch at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for community outreach this is tricky. You have to find something you enjoy and others may as well. Long time ago I realized that to reach a person you do so thru their kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we started a Lego group at a local library. Don't hate cause Lego is very relaxing to many adults out there. We had so much Lego that it seemed a waste to just keep it for ourselves. So we started letting others play with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I got better at finding it cheap so we sold quite a bit off and used the money to buy sets for kids that otherwise wouldn't get toys at Xmas. Really reached a great deal of parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some it didn't cause they don't care about anything but when the next bill is due. We still invite my sons entire class to his Bday party and every year only one kid shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well this year we had a nerf gun war. Just him, his classmate, and the neighbors. He had a ball and his mom was over the moon saying its great he had fun cause usually they don't do stuff like that at Bday parties here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well wife and I have acknowledged that we are "those" parents in "that" house cause we don't like living that boring life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes if the feeling is right I will bring up current events and ask their views. Many have no clue cause they say its above their paygrade or they just don't have time to worry about it with their jobs and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are complacent with it all. Its not that they are stupid they just feel its in good hands cause they see no ill effects in the day to day they live in.

       It is disheartening. We are in the grips of corruption. Corruption so horrible and so anti-liberty that it has to manifest itself with rhetoric, nice suits, smiling faces and waving Old Glory, and for you and I to demand change  we are labeled as unpatriotic. Truly depressing.

       Bring back the guillotine. The French gave us the statue of Liberty, now we can adopt another of their traditions.

       Eat the rich. They're fat, and they don't do much physical labor, so I bet their meat isn't tough and stringy like us poor folks. Besides, I'm fuckin' hungry. I'm ready for Rockefeller ragout.

       But even when we manage to get good, honest local politicians in, they have no power to change national politics either! You are given ZERO responsibilities/power as a freshman congressman, and it stays that way until you prove to the higher-ups that you are willing to "play ball".

       The politicians don't work for you, they work for the money controllers, so they don't care what you think. It's the economy, stupid! You PAY them to do this to us! Anyone who borrows money contributes to the debt pyramid that allows them to control everything. End home mortgage and other types of credit, and the whole house of cards comes down.

       It's wouldn't have to be like that. Think of it this way - say you had a couple of tomato plants &amp; you grew enough to not by store-tomatoes for say, 2 or 3 months. It's just that amount of money you're taking out of the system. Now imagine a thousand people do that, and so on. We've now given the agri-corporate-industry a pause. It's small, but how many dollars does that translate into lobbyist funding? Apply that concept to Walmart. Do something as small as saying you're only gonna buy birthday gifts from local makers this year. Apply the idea to 1000 people in your community, and so on. That makes a dent in walmart's expendable lobbyist fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just simple lifestyle changes. We are a huge population. Simple trends can make an impact, but it starts with individuals. We vote with our dollars too.

       I think probably the best thing to do just try to create strong communities, look out for others and start building relationships based on integrity and mutual respect. That would be a start.

       If we only had as much outrage when we invaded Iraq as we do over a bunch of emails.

       Stupid is sometimes illegal, but not always. The internet amplifies everything.

       You lot won't do shit. You whinge about the second amendment and your freedom to own guns, but it'll never be used to rise up against a government.

       There will just continue to be more mass shootings everyday and your leaders will just continue to start wars and bomb more countries while dragging the rest of us along with you.

       So we're back to ignoring

       FBI involvement in these mass shootings? Ok.

       You don't bring handguns to a AI-controlled, satellite-coordinated drone fight.  Maybe you Brits are uninformed, but we''re dealing with flying terminators now.

       So if you think it's smart that we 'rise up', then maybe the English aren't as smart as their accents would suggest, Mate

       But even when we manage to get good, honest local politicians in, they have no power to change national politics either! You are given ZERO responsibilities/power as a freshman congressman, and it stays that way until you prove to the higher-ups that you are willing to "play ball".

       That's why I think the House and Senate should be the target. Most of them have held their seats for decades! They're the ones who got us into this mess. Once they start fearing for their jobs, shit will get done. Or out with the old, in with new.
