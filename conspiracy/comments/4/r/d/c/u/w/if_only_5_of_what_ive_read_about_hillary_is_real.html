<p>If only 5% of what I&#39;ve read about Hillary is real, which is low balling if you ask me, then at best she&#39;s a criminal, at worst she&#39;s a murderer.  I&#39;m not a Trump supporter by any means, but Hillary is definitely not the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; that people are throwing around.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the job of a defence attorney? I mean if there aren&#39;t gonna be wins for the defence why bother with a trial? I mean laughing about it is stupid and evil AF but I get that she was doing her job</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends on how you look at that sort of thing.  If you are a court appointed attorney that is one thing.  Then you have a moral obligation to defend the person to the best of your ability regardless of if you agree with it or not.  This wasn&#39;t a court appointed case.  Hillary (and her firm) took the case voluntarily and even after knowing the man was guilty decided to keep the case and try to get him off.  They didn&#39;t have to do that.  This wasn&#39;t some moral grey area in the law.  I&#39;m all for everyone getting a fair trial but personally I wouldn&#39;t have taken a case where I&#39;m defending a rapist who I know is guilty.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even the obviously guilty deserve a rigorous defence. Failing to do so runs the risk of not defending someone who is actually not guilty, and may enable to the prosecution to get away with sloppy practices (which may endanger future trials). I&#39;d never celebrate a case where the guilty are not found as such, but deciding that some people aren&#39;t entitled to a robust defence is a dangerous road to follow IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes you are right, that is the job of a defense attorney, but that sort of behavior is unacceptable for a potential president. Getting people off for DWIs or pot possession is one thing and Rape is a whole different universe, especially if you know they are guilty and the child was 12 and he more than likely would do it again, which he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So while Obama and Hillary now pretend to be the best of friends, filled with nothing but admiration for one another, this is clearly phony.  Hillary had to back off of her attacks on Obama when they were rivals 8 years ago.  Interestingly, she backed off rather quietly.  I have heard the JFK Junior story previously.  Obviously the Obama team had some dirt on her.  So could it have been this?  </p>
