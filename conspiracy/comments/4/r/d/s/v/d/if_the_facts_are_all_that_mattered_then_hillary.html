        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Direct quote from FBI Director James Comey during his dubious double speak speech.</p>

<p>&quot;In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.&quot; </p>

<p>In his wishy washy speech he says only the &quot;facts&quot; matter and no politics are involved. If the facts are the only thing that matter, then this is an airtight case for prosecutors. This link <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/08/whoa-hillary-e-mail-instructs-aide-to-transmit-classified-e-mail-without-markings/">http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/08/whoa-hillary-e-mail-instructs-aide-to-transmit-classified-e-mail-without-markings/</a> takes anyone who wants to know the truth directly to the email, Hillary Clinton sent to Jacob Sullivan instructing him to break federal classification laws. She broke the law plain and simple. Americans need to hold these criminals to the fire. This is a fact, a fact that proves guilt and intent. This email is the benchmark for prosecution. Americans of all stripes must unite and protest the DOJ to do something about this Goliath issue of justice for all, regardless of celebrity status or political maneuvering.   </p>

<p>Comey, I realize how delicate of a position you are in, but you screwed us royally.</p>

<p>Lynch, you sold us out, betrayed our trust, parsed your words and lied about it. Whatever kibble you are given by your masters whether it be scotus or some other cushy position won&#39;t help you live it down. you will always remember your failed dreams to be great in the eyes of history. In reality your life will be regarded as a comedy of errors.</p>

<p>Hillary, America knows what you did, and not just during your tenure as the worst SOS in U.S. history. Every day commoners as you see us or as I call them Americans, like me are spreading the word to every corner of this nation that there are in fact two scales of justice that operate in this country. One for the likes of obscenely wealthy criminals like yourself, and the one created to deal with disenfranchised Americans with actual hardships and grievances against an increasingly illegitimate system. We know what you did, we know the countless victims your corrupt foundation defrauded under the guise of charity, we know who you conspired with, we know the trail of crimes that have haunted you your entire life. I will not forget about this ever. Your shamelessness is unprecedented, you will pay for everything you have done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the goddamn twilight zone out there as far as I&#39;m concerned. Anything goes ... for them ... The only thing that goes for you is that noose being pulled tighter and tighter, like the torture technique mobsters use by tying people&#39;s necks to their feet. </p>

<p>Politics in a broad sense is just a horror show of grotesque injustice, conceived to demoralize the enslaved citizenry on a daily basis and to make sure they can&#39;t even begin to think of dissenting with the depressing cloud of evil pathocratic bureaucracy looming over their heads.</p>

<p>This life already has no purpose, but politicians like this thundercunt are doing everything in their might to make it even more bleak and senseless than it already is. They&#39;re sadists, they&#39;re narcissists, they&#39;re corrupt, dangerous, megalomaniacal, liying pieces of sociopathic garbage. Every fucking label in the DSM could be easily handed out to people like her. Filth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to learn the difference between internal departmental rules, and criminal law.   For it to be criminal she would have to be sending the documents to someone without the proper security clearance, or by her gross negligence the classified information ended up in the hands of someone without the proper clearance.  Neither of those things happened, so she is not being charged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently you have no idea what you are talking about. Did you even read the article showing the email she sent asking Sullivan to send classified documents unsecured? She broke almost every record keeping law ever created in America. All of the things you stated didn&#39;t happen, happened. Congratulations! You win the blind and deaf award for political and legal ignorance, also called a Sheeple. Congrats now go back to the field and rejoin the herd, real Americans are busy fighting the slow creep of tyranny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a just one of a litany of laws she broke. You can do all the  research to you hearts content.</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 2071 - Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally</p>

<p>Current through Pub. L. 114-38. (See Public Laws for the current Congress.)</p>

<pre><code>US Code
Notes
</code></pre>

<p>(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, (like the 60,000+ emails now government records when they co-mingle with with born secret SAP material on her illegal server, that were deleted) mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, (like deletion for example) or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office (like secretary of State perhaps?), or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</p>

<p>(pay attention to this next paragraph)</p>

<p>(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, (which she did when she deleted 60,000 government emails, records subject to FOIA requests to which she tried to conceal) shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 795; Pub. L. 101–510, div. A, title V, § 552(a), Nov. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 1566; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(I), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did she not want anyone to see these emails? </p>

<p>Answer: They prove that she was selling US government favors for &quot;donations&quot; to her family&#39;s  corrupt foundation piggybank. The email conversations would have proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt. That&#39;s why she not only wiped the server but probably made several passes over the hard disks. In doing so, her mass deletions of emails from her illegal server also deleted classified government documents some classified to be at the level of special compartmentalized information or SCI that she had Jacob Sullivan strip of all markings and send electronically and unsecured. All of America&#39;s enemies are now privy to this SCI.</p>
