       I'll tell you what.  People who have are just now waking up from a 25 yr coma--I don't fault them one bit.  Or time travelers from before 1970 who just pulled up in a DeLorean, or GED people under 20 working at mcdonalds.  I just don't expect low-information people to get it, so they are off-the-hook.

       You and everyone else who has even a semester of college should be exposed to a sufficient level of clintonian intrigue that it begs for investigation. If you didn't do your due diligence, then you have no right to talk on the subject.

       You're forgetting fearful people over 65. We can't just shun our parents and grandparents. They're not low information, and they're not uneducated. But they're still making completely inexplicable political choices and will argue them until they're blue in the face. I've been able to get a little traction in some areas  - but not much.

       My parents are in that age range. I'll bring stuff up, and they'll listen intently. But they will steer it right back to how great of a person Obama is and how this country has seen worse times, so we'll be fine.

       I think that's one of the reasons to ban voting after 70. It kills me that the grandkids aren't enough to make them throw off the yoke of propaganda, but you mention that and they glaze over and say, "But what can you do?" and go right back to stating that voting Trump or Clinton's the only way forward. :/

       I find it weird that people who lived through the Viet Nam era and watched all the governmental bullshit that took place still believe in the system. My mother today called the FBI report a "witch hunt." She still makes a mean apple pie so I guess she's alright.

        Hillary &amp; Bill has been CIA assets all along, since they spied on their fellow students on Oxford university campus, back in the 1960's.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        They did a good job and ascended to Mr. and Mrs. Governor in Arkansas, which was used to funnel drugs into the USA from South America, to fund various CIA projects.

       is dead dead dead fucking dead in the United Stares of America. Now that she has clearly demonstrated that she is above the law, beyond the reach of justice, this is what is going to happen:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        She will fake/steal/defraud the 2016 election. The corporate owned mass media will cheer her grand victory.
       </li>
       <li>
        Another bailout for the bankers.
        <em>
         (A financial crash is quickly approaching, the tax payer will get stuck with a bill, my ge-estimate ranges from 22 to 100 trillion).
        </em>
       </li>
       <li>
        A decent into an Orwellian big brother state.
       </li>
       <li>
        She will fuck over the 99% and enrich the 1%.

       So eli5, but just because they "recommend no charges", does this mean that there isn't a chance that it'll happen? Or does it mean that she's pardoned regardless? I already know that they won't because this system is totally corrupt, but does this mean there's no legal way to prosecute her?

       If enough people are enraged by this -- and they should be -- she will not win. That does not mean that Trump will win . . . he already has his own problems with securing the nomination . . . but Dems would have to find an alternative to Hillary.  What Hillary has done is blatantly criminal and I do not see how the American people can ignore her transgressions.  Time for a reset.

       I think that's one of the reasons to ban voting after 70. It kills me that the grandkids aren't enough to make them throw off the yoke of propaganda, but you mention that and they glaze over and say, "But what can you do?" and go right back to stating that voting Trump or Clinton's the only way forward. :/
