    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>President Hillary Clinton</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hillary &amp; Bill has been CIA assets all along, since they spied on their fellow students on Oxford university campus, back in the 1960&#39;s.<br/></li>
<li>They did a good job and ascended to Mr. and Mrs. Governor in Arkansas, which was used to funnel drugs into the USA from South America, to fund various CIA projects. </li>
<li>They did a good job and ascended and became Mr. and Mrs. President.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now they are back in business, their path littered with dead bodies, now funded by Wall Street and protected by the CIA. As I said all along, always being the <del>pessimist</del> realist, <strong><em>Due Process of Law</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Rule of Law</em></strong> is dead dead dead fucking dead in the United Stares of America. Now that she has clearly demonstrated that she is above the law, beyond the reach of justice, this is what is going to happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>She will fake/steal/defraud the 2016 election. The corporate owned mass media will cheer her grand victory. </li>
<li>Another bailout for the bankers. <em>(A financial crash is quickly approaching, the tax payer will get stuck with a bill, my ge-estimate ranges from 22 to 100 trillion).</em></li>
<li>A decent into an Orwellian big brother state.</li>
<li>She will fuck over the 99% and enrich the 1%. </li>
<li>War with Iran - Russia and China will have no option but to join than the fray.</li>
</ul>

<p>The End. There will be nothing left after the nuclear war but cockroaches and Hillary sitting in her bunker with the company she deserves.  </p>

<p>No clear evidence Clinton intended to violate laws</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, so it&#39;s not about whether or not you <em>actually</em> violated laws, but rather if you had intended to violate them and then violated them?</p>

<p><strong>Can we just get rid of this ridiculous pretext that we are all equal under the law?</strong> We clearly are not.</p>

<p>Might as well get rid of FOIA too, since it&#39;s largely useless if it can be subverted in this manner...</p>

<p>Furthermore, let&#39;s just go ahead and stop pretending that &quot;we the people&quot; have anything to do with what the Establishment wants. They are going to tell us what we need to do, they are going to make sure we make the correct &quot;choice&quot;, and they (not you) know what is best for you.</p>
