       It isn't a viable excuse, Director Comey is confusing the audience with two different kinds of intent. General intent is I throw a brick off an overpass without necessarily trying to kill someone. Specific intent is me intentionally killing someone with a brick. I would be charged with murder either way. The laws Hillary broke don't even require either form they only require gross negligence, notice how he said she was "extremely careless".
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore she didn't have to intend to put the files at risk. She knew the law, she is secretary of state and she opened multiple private servers to obstruct justice. There's no other reason for that. James Comey is lying outright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my post from earlier on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the law doesn't matter in the United States anymore. Go have fun, just change your party registration over to Democrat first.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 USC §1924. This statute states that any employee of the United States who “knowingly removes [classified] documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.” Hillary set up multiple private servers explicitly to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 USC §798. This statute states that anyone who “uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States…any classified information…shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.” Hillary transmitted classified information in a manner that harmed the United States; Comey says she may have been hacked and that her email server was less secure than gmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 USC §2071. This statute says that anyone who has custody of classified material and “willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years.” Clearly, Hillary meant to remove classified materials from government control. He even admits her lawyers went in and destroyed several thousand emails to but "not with the intent of conpromising national security."
      </p>
      <p>
       Her lack of intent to have the files intercepted by other countries is irrelevant. She intended to break the laws above. That's how law works. If I get drunk and drive my car into somebody I don't walk away free because I didn't intend to hit them. The intent is in breaking the law itself. James Comey's exuse-making for Clinton would never stand in the court of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is proof that the FBI, in addition to the DOJ, NSA, and ATF are all corrupt government organizations bought off or threatened by the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration.

       In the end, these poor souls are in so deep they cannot charge the Clintons without the risk of facing the death penalty, with their families not too far behind. The things keeping this corruption alive are the simple fear that the Clintons generate amongst the 0.0001%, also that Americans are too lazy/unintelligent to form an organized dismantling of the government.

       Follow the money to the Clinton Foundation and the intent becomes clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was nothing more than more corruption the way Comey-Tose layed out the criminality and then decided that his opinion on what was worth pursuing or not was more important than the legal facts.   Its just 1984 double speak.   The democrats had their back up plan for continuity of the neo con agenda:

       Ignorantia juris non excusat : Latin for "ignorance of the law excuses not" is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely because he or she was unaware of its content. There does not have to be any intent at all in the equation.

       She was being investigated by the FBI under the Espionage Act.   It requires that you either intentionally give classified information to unauthorized people like Petraeus did, or that information ends up in the wrong hands through your gross negligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any mishandling she did was just a violation of State Department protocol, and not a crime.  The worst that could happen is some sort of internal reprimand or discipline by her superior(President Obama) if he felt it was necessary.
