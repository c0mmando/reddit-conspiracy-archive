       President Obama: "We are horrified over these events"
Last night, law enforcement officers in Dallas, Texas who were keeping people safe during a peaceful protest were targeted and attacked.
This morning, President Obama offered a statement on these tragic attacks and made it clear that we as a nation stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas.
"I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas ... Let's be clear: There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement. The FBI is already in touch with the Dallas police, and anyone involved in these senseless murders will be held fully accountable. Justice will be done."
Watch the President's statement, or read it below.

With your understanding, I want to begin with a few words about the situation back in the United States, specifically the situation in Dallas, Texas.
My team has been keeping me updated throughout the morning of the evening in Dallas. I spoke this morning with Mayor Rawlings of Dallas to convey the deepest condolences of the American people. I told him that the federal government will provide whatever assistance Dallas may need as it deals with this tremendous tragedy.
We still don’t know all the facts. What we do know is that there has been a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. Police in Dallas were on duty, doing their jobs, keeping people safe during peaceful protests. These law enforcement officers were targeted, and nearly a dozen officers were shot. Five were killed. Other officers and at least one civilian were wounded -- some are in serious condition, and we are praying for their recovery.
As I told Mayor Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas. According to police, there are multiple suspects. We will learn more, undoubtedly, about their twisted motivations. But let's be clear: There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement. The FBI is already in touch with the Dallas police, and anyone involved in these senseless murders will be held fully accountable. Justice will be done.
I will have more to say about this as the facts become more clear. For now, let me just say that even as yesterday I spoke about our need to be concerned, as all Americans, about racial disparities in our criminal justice system, I also said yesterday that our police have an extraordinarily difficult job and the vast majority of them do their job in outstanding fashion. I also indicated the degree to which we need to be supportive of those officers who do their job each and every day, protecting us and protecting our communities.
Today is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices that they make for us. We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead, we’re going to have to consider those realities as well.
In the meantime, today our focus is on the victims and their families. They are heartbroken. The entire city of Dallas is grieving. Police across America, which is a tight-knit family, feels this loss to their core. And we're grieving with them. I’d ask all Americans to say a prayer for these officers and their families. Keep them in your thoughts. And as a nation, let’s remember to express our profound gratitude to our men and women in blue -- not just today, but every day.

       They're throwing out events faster than I can keep up now.  Both of the racial shootings from the last couple days looked fake (Alton Sterling footage was fishy and Philando Castile's girlfriend didn't seem to give a shit that he was dying next to her) and now they drop this one on the populace.  People on facebook are getting up in arms and I'm just shaking my head because they never even bother to question their TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't had a chance to look at Dallas in depth yet but the story already seems too perfect.  Narrative plays into the racial divide, the gun-control divide, the civilian/police divide, and the idea of "domestic terrorism".  Screams manufactured to me.

       Dallas looks SO fake. they are just piling them on these days I agree. and most people have no critical defense. it's so surreal.
      </p>
      <p>
       in all my observation - when Obama makes an immediate (same day or 48 hrs) public address about an event -- each and every one of those events is staged, amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course many other events are staged too. I think we are getting maybe like 10% real news these days -- I can't tell what percentage really - but it's got to be pretty low.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's like we are in a cult -- they have most people so in denial that these lies are coming at us -- they could tell us the sky is falling tomorrow and everybody would run for cover.

       I wasn't going to say anything because citing Polaris as proof of a globe shows you don't know anything about the flat earth model. How is Polaris supposed to prove the earth is spherical?  If anything it presents a problem for globers.  You wouldn't expect it to stay in the same spot over a long exposure if earth is flying around the sun.

       Doesn't account for the domed sky that generally accompanies the flat earth model.  A domed firmament would perfectly explain the angles we see Polaris and even the reversed rotation in the southern latitudes.  It's just another case of someone arbitrarily stating, "This couldn't work on flat earth!" when they don't have an actual grasp on the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't "push" flat earth, I'm just a globe skeptic.  Things like this are part of the reason.  All these people attempting to "debunk" while they can't step away from their indoctrination enough to actually look at the other side.  I don't know the actual shape of the earth but I've found more glaring issues with the globe model than the flat.  People have to look at the evidence and decide themselves.

       You didn't even read that article.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The congruous relationship between the altitude of Polaris and latitude of the earth is impossible on a flat earth. The geometry of a close star suspended above a flat plane is very different. To a traveler on a flat earth who is moving away from Polaris directly south, the apparent altitude of the star will appear to decline, but not at a constant rate as would be seen on a globe. In fact, the farther away the observer gets, the slower Polaris will appear to descend. It's a matter of simple geometry. As the degree of altitude decreases, concurrent distances increase exponentially. This means that the altitude of Polaris will almost never agree with an observer's latitude. To see Polaris at an altitude of 0° on the horizon (as is observed at the equator) would actually be impossible because an observer would have to be an infinite distance away. Basic trigonometry reveals why. If you can solve a right triangle (or use an on-line right triangle calculator), you can verify this for yourself.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no way to reconcile this inconsistency of the flat earth model with observable reality. The apparent position of Polaris in the sky, as observed from any location in the northern hemisphere, indicates beyond question the curved shape of the earth. This is empirical evidence that anyone can validate for themselves by simply measuring the altitude of Polaris with a homemade clinometer and comparing the result to their latitudinal location. If they match, you're on a curve. There is no theoretical distance over a flat earth where Polaris could be positioned that can mimic this relationship. It's impossible. A flat plane can't mimic a curve.

       Why do you think the main past time of the Flat Earthers is to attack NASA? Because they are the representation of Science and Reason. If the FE folks weren't conditioned to believe NASA is lying to them then anyone with a calculator and science book could ruin all that lovely mind bending.

       Again, the domed firmament accounts for that.  If the sky were curved like it is in most flat earth models I've seen, the angles would behave like they would with a curved earth.  The issue is just that you think the idea of a dome over earth is religious.  Sorry bud, but trusting anything out of NASA is religious as well when they've been proven to lie in the past.  The more I see of NASA, the faker it looks.  I used to love NASA and outer space as much as the next guy until I seriously looked into this stuff so I get it, but do you really believe

       If you look into the history of heliocentrism and the globe model, you'll see some of their biggest proponents were the Jesuits and the Catholic church.  There was a TIL recently on that exact subject.  Heliocentrism has always been steeped in Freemasonry with Pythagoras, Galileo, and Newton being lauded by them as some of the best Masons.  That's why

       This is absolutely false. A curved sky does nothing. Polaris would be at the top of the curve. It doesn't move. The angles at which we observe Polaris from earth are simply impossible on a flat earth. The only way around that fact is to deny the truth of geometry which would be denying the truth of mathematics itself. To say the earth is not round is the same as saying 1+1 does not equal 2.

       you haven't proved anything if you think "polaris" proves the earth must be a spinning ball and can't be a flat disc you are going to have to write out your proof.
