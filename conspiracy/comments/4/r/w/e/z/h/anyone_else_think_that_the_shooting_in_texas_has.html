    <div class="md"><p>This might be the largest conspiracy in America since 9/11 due to the amount of coordination in the succession of events being carried out that may influence a race war, gun reform, politics, martial law, etc. I honestly believe that the 2nd shooting in which the man was killed in his car is a hoax. Two back to back police killings is not a coincidence and not unusual, but two being reported IS unusual and certainly no coincidence given the fact that it happened after Hillary Clinton was exempt from all criminal charges and let off scott-free. Also keep in mind that the actual trial itself had a media blackout and took place during a holiday, July 4th. A time where everyone will be outside grilling, oblivious to the news. Then the next day, this whole event transpires and continues for the next couple of days. Either Hillary Clinton has consistently been having the longest streak of luck in political history, or these events are all false flags and hoaxes. There is no such thing as a coincidence during a political year. With all the money flowing around at this time, anything can be done. Going back to a point from earlier, I believe the 2nd shooting was a hoax. The reasons being:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was recorded DIRECTLY after the man supposedly got shot</li>
<li>WHO records their boyfriend getting shot?</li>
<li>The woman actually said something along the lines of &quot;my boyfriend is dead now, they shot him&quot; before he was actually dead, keeping an eerily calm composure along with her 4 year old child who seems to be taking the situation just fine.</li>
<li>Sketchy details altogether</li>
<li>Again, the composed 4 year old child saying &quot;that&#39;s okay mommy I&#39;m with you&quot;. Seriously, this is WAY too dramatic. You just don&#39;t expect this type of composure and maturity from a 4 year old. </li>
<li>The way practically the whole event was recorded, unlike any of the other shootings</li>
</ol>

<p>To me it seems like the second killing was a hoax to invoke outrage across America and to also prevent any discarded sentiment for the last killing because details about the first man being a pedophile with criminal history would incite that. With the second shooting taking place, people would be disgusted, sentimental, and provocative, thus giving a reason and a motive for someone to go out and shoot police. </p>

<p>Now, this WHOLE event where 12 police officers got shot was executed by a lone gunman who is a retired army veteran? Whoever buys this story is an idiot, I&#39;m not gonna get into this much further. We all know that this is just the tip of the iceberg in promoting a globalist doctrine. This event is nothing in comparison to the unrest and turmoil that will ensue if its agenda is fulfilled. I&#39;m calling this whole event a hoax/false flag. Too coincidental, too implausible, too convenient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I said hoax/false flag/inside job because we don&#39;t have all the details... I believe some of the event is a hoax... and some of it is a false flag. I know people died, but I know the official story is not true. When you have police officers using the word conspiracy on CNN you know you are not crazy. I&#39;m tired of being lied to, especially after 9/11.</p>

As they were asking the guy questions a woman came on and called him Michael (and then a last name).  Don quickly stopped the woman and said it was Michael &#39;Kevin&#39; and as the woman went to say his name again don cut her off and they dropped her from the call. </p>
