       This might be the largest conspiracy in America since 9/11 due to the amount of coordination in the succession of events being carried out that may influence a race war, gun reform, politics, martial law, etc. I honestly believe that the 2nd shooting in which the man was killed in his car is a hoax. Two back to back police killings is not a coincidence and not unusual, but two being reported IS unusual and certainly no coincidence given the fact that it happened after Hillary Clinton was exempt from all criminal charges and let off scott-free. Also keep in mind that the actual trial itself had a media blackout and took place during a holiday, July 4th. A time where everyone will be outside grilling, oblivious to the news. Then the next day, this whole event transpires and continues for the next couple of days. Either Hillary Clinton has consistently been having the longest streak of luck in political history, or these events are all false flags and hoaxes. There is no such thing as a coincidence during a political year. With all the money flowing around at this time, anything can be done. Going back to a point from earlier, I believe the 2nd shooting was a hoax. The reasons being:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        It was recorded DIRECTLY after the man supposedly got shot
       </li>
       <li>
        WHO records their boyfriend getting shot?
       </li>
       <li>
        The woman actually said something along the lines of "my boyfriend is dead now, they shot him" before he was actually dead, keeping an eerily calm composure along with her 4 year old child who seems to be taking the situation just fine.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sketchy details altogether
       </li>
       <li>
        Again, the composed 4 year old child saying "that's okay mommy I'm with you". Seriously, this is WAY too dramatic. You just don't expect this type of composure and maturity from a 4 year old.
       </li>
       <li>
        The way practically the whole event was recorded, unlike any of the other shootings
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       To me it seems like the second killing was a hoax to invoke outrage across America and to also prevent any discarded sentiment for the last killing because details about the first man being a pedophile with criminal history would incite that. With the second shooting taking place, people would be disgusted, sentimental, and provocative, thus giving a reason and a motive for someone to go out and shoot police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this WHOLE event where 12 police officers got shot was executed by a lone gunman who is a retired army veteran? Whoever buys this story is an idiot, I'm not gonna get into this much further. We all know that this is just the tip of the iceberg in promoting a globalist doctrine. This event is nothing in comparison to the unrest and turmoil that will ensue if its agenda is fulfilled. I'm calling this whole event a hoax/false flag. Too coincidental, too implausible, too convenient.

       Timing sure is coincidental, and I agree that it is absurd to think that a single gunman could take-down so many officers.

       2 gunmen. I live in Dallas. People are dead, innocent people. Regardless of what you think this is a time of grief for a lot of families and not a time to tell people that the death of their loved one was a hoax or a conspiracy. I like this sub and I subscribe to many theories but honestly its too soon. Today has already been hard enough

       The word hoax is very inappropriate to say when real people actually died, I agree. The point is more that the people who organized this are very powerful, not random whackos.

       That's why I said hoax/false flag/inside job because we don't have all the details... I believe some of the event is a hoax... and some of it is a false flag. I know people died, but I know the official story is not true. When you have police officers using the word conspiracy on CNN you know you are not crazy. I'm tired of being lied to, especially after 9/11.

       Lot of people agree with you, just be very careful in the language you use because it's very easy to de-legitimize yourself by using a slightly incorrect word when people are throwing around the conspiracy label. I just think hoax is an incorrect word to use is all, but I can see why you'd use it.

       I saw this along with another suspicious segment with don lemon on CNN.  They had a guy 'Michael Kevin' who was w witness who live streamed the scene on his facebook.  As they were asking the guy questions a woman came on and called him Michael (and then a last name).  Don quickly stopped the woman and said it was Michael 'Kevin' and as the woman went to say his name again don cut her off and they dropped her from the call.

       It's "convenient," but it's also coincidental. Most people weren't paying attention to the hearings and don't really care much. There's no need to distract anyone. Instead, a crazy, angry guy (and maybe others) shot a bunch of cops.

       I disagree with the "coincidental" part of your argument. This may well be the straw that breaks the 2nd amendment's back, which would in turn mean that the snipers were agent provocateurs (like what happened in Ukraine).

       What would be the point of non-coincidental timing? The average citizen (in other words, damn near everyone), doesn't care much about Clinton's issue. There's no
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to distract. So why do you see it as not coincidental, timing-wise?

       Clinton should be going to trial for tax evasion for the Foundation and instead she's getting the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this whole situation is starting to look more and more like a coup, it makes sense that the Foundation people would be proactive and start disarming people right before the coup takes place.

       There's no coup. A lazy populace that demands very little from it's representatives makes a coup unnecessary.

       Lot of people agree with you, just be very careful in the language you use because it's very easy to de-legitimize yourself by using a slightly incorrect word when people are throwing around the conspiracy label. I just think hoax is an incorrect word to use is all, but I can see why you'd use it.
