    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree but whoever or whatever ISIS are, the motivation for attacking their own people (supposedly) in their holiest site is what I am questioning. I have no doubt people can be made to do ridiculous things, but it&#39;s those pulling the strings and their motivations that need questioning in this instance. What is the end goal here? The west aren&#39;t reporting it in the way they report other attacks, the Muslims are outraged... So what was to gain? I&#39;m telling you, this one is different. A mistake maybe? A rogue agent(s)? complacency? If you wanted to gain support and sympathy from a people you would not blow up their holy city! If you wanted the world to believe Muslims really were supporting and sponsoring ISIS you wouldn&#39;t either. It seems like a no win situation regardless of who you believe ISIS to be. Not to mention this is all going on during the holy month of Ramadan... A peaceful time. Someone is using the crusades to fuel hatred between the Muslims and the West. I am simply saying that they have either overplayed their hand or something has gone wrong. Watch this space.</p>

<p>Also, everyone outside of America knows ISIS is a function of the US State Department. So it&#39;s hard to watch someone who&#39;s catapulting the propaganda about ISIS being some monolithic &#39;Islamofascist&#39; organization talking about how <em>others</em> are brainwashed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This goes beyond just somone invading your backyard and you taking back your land. Blowing up car bombs and killing civilians is not fighting an enemy who invaded your land. Shooting and killing 50 plus people in a gay bar is not fighting those who invaded your land. Those who commit these violent acts are not fighting for their land but for their religion regardless of who created them </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of Muslims have explained endlessly that No, ISIS does not represent their religion any more than Timothy McVeigh or Anders Behring Breivik represents Christianity. The fact that Christians struggle daily to make that connection proves that it&#39;s not just Islam that creates fundamentalist terrorist behaviors. </p>

<p>So until you can prove ISIS is actively brainwashing anyone, I will maintain that the culprit here is religion mixed with the presence of a foreign, occupying force. And that occupying force was well aware of how it&#39;s presence would radicalize the population before it invaded. So all of this is intentional and paid for by the American taxpayers. Which is why your American government will NEVER defeat ISIS. It&#39;s not supposed to. </p>

<p>All of this is obvious to persons who haven&#39;t been brainwashed by Christofascist Media. </p>

<p>Then you&#39;re definitely not looking hard enough. It&#39;s okay, I get it. Propaganda is easy and plentiful, the lazy always choose that over the more difficult truth - that religion itself is the cause of war, and every religion is complicit. </p>

How when Muslims come up to these peaceful protesters and say that if the police weren&#39;t around they would stab them on sight. Or tell me how I no longer feel safe in my own country anymore because we are being yelled at how islam will take over germany and that our people will die in the name of Islam along with our children being orphans. That Allah will take them in as family. Tell me how whenever somone gets attacked here by a Muslim, the police do fuck all to help.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice strawman argument. No, I do not believe all of them are extremists. That is intellectually stupid to even think so. However, around 25% if Muslims support extremist views such as terrorist attacks and believe they would implicate sharia law as described in the Quran. Now, 25% may seem like a small percent but when you realise that 25% of over a billion followers, well that equates to around 300 million people who support this barbaric ideology. That&#39;s about the size of the United States who are radical. Of course not all of those 300 million are ready to strap a bomb ono their  chest and kill in the name of Islam, however, all of those 300 million are radical and do support such violent acts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, another strawman argument. 10 Islamic countries stone rape victims to death. They also kill gays. They believe in honor killings. Most Muslims support this ideology which practices these things on a daily basis. The difference between Muslims and other religions is that the radical muslim extremists are fighting for their religion. Those who fight for the west, i.e Christian Americans, are fighting for political reasons. Maybe not with the best intentions but you don&#39;t see Christians or any other religion killing civilians to push their religion</p>
