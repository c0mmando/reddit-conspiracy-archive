    <div class="md"><p>It hardly distracted from Clinton.... I just saw a piece on her a few minutes ago on tv. Oh, and I read quite a bit on her today from major news outlets. If this is a distraction, it&#39;s about as distracting someone sneezing during a rock concert at 120db.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The distraction works not by completely removing the Clinton scandal from the news but by making it seem far less shocking in comparison to the death of multiple cops. Peoples willingness to accept a situation is highly contextual. When a more extreme event occurs, the previous event that caused outrage quickly becomes the accepted norm. People can only become outraged at so much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it so hard to see thd logical conclusion in this. Cops are racists. I don&#39;t say this to be edgy; it&#39;s the fucking truth. I&#39;m white (and technically an immigrant being from England), lived in America most of my life and every run in I&#39;ve had with a police officer has been as it should be. They&#39;ve been polite, abide by my rights, heck I even told a police officer &quot;no&quot; when asked for my ID, and not get pushed to show it.  Now my friend Omar, who is half Moroccan hates cops because every instance he has ever had with them has been rude, hateful, and aggressive. Now cops are killing in cold blood, and are getting away with it. It was only a matter of time before someone picked up a gun and started shooting back. I don&#39;t condone attacking police officers, but until we take a hard look at those ment to &quot;serve and protect&quot; and punish officers who break the law to the maximum sentence the law allows (because let&#39;s be honest; if you&#39;re ment to uphold the law and you break it your punishment should be greater because quite frankly, you knew better.) this will keep happeneing, and in greater numbers. People are feeling helpless, backed into a corner, and are reacting to it. We are entering into true dissent; just in time for the shit shows that will be the DNC and RNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup. actually came here to post that same thing. How is Obama gonna help ISIS take over the world if his crook of a successor doesn&#39;t get elected next? </p>

<p>&quot;...Let&#39;s break out the cell phone cameras and restart this police brutality thing again- that seemed to captivate people pretty well the first time around.&quot; </p>

<p>My favorite part is remember in the Ferguson protests all the police were in swat gear? Obama called for a friendlier police force. Now normal cops attempt to contain Dallas protests- shot dead, injured because not enough protection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched this last night and, despite knowing Clinton would never even get a slap on the wrist, it was shocking to see the FBI without a thinnest argument as to why she shouldn&#39;t be charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/rS2etsMO_9Q">https://youtu.be/rS2etsMO_9Q</a></p>
