    <div class="md"><p>There was a black mercedes full of tight-lipped CIA agents who were picked up accidentally and then quietly released without any fanfare, and now the news has forgotten that it took place.  Lucky for somebody the &quot;lone sniper&quot; was killed by a friggin&#39; bomb so he can&#39;t confirm or deny any of this, or even that he was the shooter.  Maybe he was the shooter, or maybe he was bound and gagged, trying futilely to shout &quot;they set me up!&quot; through the duct tape gag before they detonated the patsy.  I guess we should just trust that the authorities wouldn&#39;t lie to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that a legitimate question? Watch the videos. A cop is executed in a 1 on 1 firefight and at the same time 4 cop cars and officers are pinned down by sniper fire on Main street. There&#39;s at least 2 shooters from that evidence alone. If you watched any of the live feed there were people screaming a third shooter stepped out of a cop car before killing a cop. Then he gets into a black mercedes and speeds away, and thats not a description people are just making up because it sounds conspiratorial. The same citizens are the ones yelling at the shooter getting away. You dont need to be a cop or trusted figure to identify a criminal at a crime scene. We cant give you any evidence other than watch all the videos people posted online and think for yourself. Sources at this point should be common sense and critical thinking. An Army construction worker laid waste to an entire police force on his own, and they had to use a robot bomb from a Federal EOD team to take him out. Come on man. To top it all off they give you the picture of him in a dashiki with the power fist raised? You dont even need to be creative to connect these dots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. People are down voting you when you are simply asking for some shred of evidence, which is completely rational and expected and should be done more often. Maybe then we can bypass disinfo and speculative BS that only perpetuates the bias of the person making the claim. However,  I am a bit confused about the close quarter,  tactical shoot out that happened while other officers were allegedly pinned down several blocks away. That just doesn&#39;t sit right, you know? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be that the echo of the gun fire caused the officers to think there was another gunman pinning them down when there was not. This would explain why the originally thought there were more gunmen and then backtracked to a single shooter. Regardless, people (even trained) are not the best observers when they are under extreme stress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see that, but wouldn&#39;t echo from rounds discharged 2 blocks away on the ground be very different from those allegedly coming from immediately up above, not to mention the ricochet and bullets not flying by? I get that they might still be ordered to cover and wait until more Intel was gathered and backup arrived too though. Maybe you&#39;re right. I guess I need a better timeline of the videos overlaid on a city map....especially the videos where multiple officers where locked down by their cruisers and you could hear the rounds, and the video where the officer tragically lost his life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acoustics can be amplified in weird ways. I&#39;m guessing you would just have to be there to get an understanding of the sounds echoing off of the structures. Regarding the main video, you can see officers on there bellies with cars between them and the shooter. Thus, it seems that they thought they were pinned down by more than one shooter. But, they now think they were not.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/dallas-county/breaking-shots-fired-and-officers-down-at-downtown-dallas-protest/266881573">WFAA (ABC affiliate)</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>TWO ARRESTED AFTER FALSE LEAD</p>

<p>Meanwhile an officer saw <strong>a man wearing camouflage and carrying a bag when he got into a Mercedes and sped off</strong>. He went up Interstate 35 before he was pulled over and surrounded by police.</p>

<p>Police questioned both occupants of the vehicle before releasing them. The driver told News 8&#39;s Demond Fernandez he was just picking up his brother from the bus station and the bag was his brother&#39;s luggage.</p>

<p>Earlier Thursday, Dallas police circulated a photo of what Chief Brown called a &quot;person of interest&quot; in the crime. They say that man, Mark Hughes, has since turned himself in and been released. Hughes and his attorney may speak about the situation later on Friday or in the coming days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mercedes incident confirmed.</p>

<p>Now, before you start whining, this is not <strong><em>proof</em></strong> anything. It is <strong>evidence</strong> that should be considered - like the mysterious van owned by <strong>Urban Moving Systems</strong> following the 9-11 attacks. The van reportedly had evidence of explosives, and was full of illegal Israeli Nationals (alleged Mossad agents) who were flush with cash, and who were quickly released, only to disappear - along with EVERYONE associated with the moving company.</p>

<p>No &quot;proof&quot;, just evidence to be considered.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the official word.

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s all or nothing then, eh?</p>

<p>Either EVERYTHING is a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, or there is NO SUCH THING as &quot;conspiracies&quot;, right?</p>

<p>Was 9-11 a conspiracy? <strong>Yes</strong> - even if you believe the <strong><em>official version</em></strong> - which is that 19 hijackers <strong><em>conspired</em></strong> to hijack airplanes and fly them into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon...</p>

<p>Was the Liberty Incident a &quot;conspiracy&quot;? <strong>Yes</strong> - even if you believe the <strong><em>official version</em></strong> - which is that Israel <em>mistakenly</em> identified the US ship as an &quot;Egyptian freighter&quot; - there is NO QUESTION that President Johnson, McNamara and others <strong><em>conspired</em></strong> to prevent US forces from defending the ship, and put a gag order on the incident to shield Israel from criticism.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that you are one of those people who doesn&#39;t know what the word <strong><em><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/conspiracy?s=t">conspiracy</a></em></strong> actually means, right?</p>

<p>You&#39;re accusing me of being black and white?</p>

<p>Hey, you&#39;re the one who said <em>&quot;Oh my... Everything is a leap to conspiracy&quot;</em> after I named numerous events - some of which are <em>known</em> to be conspiracies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course there are conspiracies and of course not everything event is reported accurately--which is exactly my point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And my point is that one should not be so quick to <strong>dismiss</strong> circumstances and evidence as <strong><em>not conspiracy</em></strong> based on the word of &quot;official pronouncement&quot; - especially when there are unusual and suspicious activities associated therewith.</p>

<p>Evidence is evidence, and dismissing it offhand simply because some &quot;official source&quot; said we should would be naive and foolish, especially given the treacherous track-record of our &quot;trusted officials&quot; in recent history.</p>

<p><strong><em>/Saddam has WMD&#39;s!!!</em></strong>, for example</p>

White hating black intent in killing whites.  Maximum Bias confirmation support of one the ugliest talking points on the circuit. and all in one place to be copied and pasted everywhere,&quot;from that liberal NPR.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve gathered the shooter moved around a lot. He was on ground level behind a pillar first and that&#39;s were he shot the cop. He then went to the Bank of America building across the street to the 2nd or third floor and was shooting there. Then He went to the garage across the street and was killed by the robot. they probably thought there were multiple shooters because he was moving around in a short period of time. He was very aggressive.</p>

<p>&quot;The chaos started when at least two snipers fired from an elevated position on police officers minutes before 9 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), Brown said. He called it an &quot;ambush-style&quot; shooting.
&quot;We believe that these suspects were positioning themselves in a way to triangulate on these officers from two different perches in garages in the downtown area, and planned to injure and kill as many law enforcement officers as they could,&quot; he told a news conference earlier — noting that some victims were shot in the back.</p>

<p>Other suspects might still be at large. &quot;We&#39;re hopeful that we have got everybody, but we don&#39;t know that for sure,&quot; Rawlings told NBC&#39;s TODAY.
He said the suspects in custody were &quot;being pretty tight-lipped,&quot; but their motives were clear. &quot;It&#39;s simple ... they wanted to kill police officers. And sadly, they did.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was equal <del>ignorance</del> guilt passed around to all media last night. Sadly they each care more about being the first with details that facts mean shit. </p>

<p>On the multiple sniper aspect though, some people on the ground <strong>did</strong> report that shots were coming in from 2 separate high vantage points. Could this be ricochet or even sound echoing btwn buildings? </p>

<p>I&#39;m also personally confused on who the shooter in the video is (video where shooter comes around the pillar behind him &amp; shoots). It appears this was/may have been the same time shots were active elsewhere, was the soldier experienced enough to build/adapt a mechanism to shoot on timer so he could appear to be more than one person? Sorry, just interested in some input. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s all or nothing then, eh?</p>

<p>Either EVERYTHING is a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, or there is NO SUCH THING as &quot;conspiracies&quot;, right?</p>

<p>Was 9-11 a conspiracy? <strong>Yes</strong> - even if you believe the <strong><em>official version</em></strong> - which is that 19 hijackers <strong><em>conspired</em></strong> to hijack airplanes and fly them into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon...</p>

<p>Was the Liberty Incident a &quot;conspiracy&quot;? <strong>Yes</strong> - even if you believe the <strong><em>official version</em></strong> - which is that Israel <em>mistakenly</em> identified the US ship as an &quot;Egyptian freighter&quot; - there is NO QUESTION that President Johnson, McNamara and others <strong><em>conspired</em></strong> to prevent US forces from defending the ship, and put a gag order on the incident to shield Israel from criticism.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that you are one of those people who doesn&#39;t know what the word <strong><em><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/conspiracy?s=t">conspiracy</a></em></strong> actually means, right?</p>
