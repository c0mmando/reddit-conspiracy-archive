You completely ignore hundreds of terror attacks that have happened in the last year - many with clear footage to prove they aren&#39;t false flags and many outside the West Bank.

If you actually read stuff here you would have gotten that Zionist Freemasons Rule the world, Israel like the US, is just another Cannon Fodder nation to control regions. It just happens to be an apartheid nation, committing genocide against palestinians , which is something many people detest here and voice opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same problem with Jews that I have with Muslims &amp; Christians. As a group, all three of you are dangerous to the cultures you invade. You are all taught that you are chosen people, that you are favored by a creator, that you may usurp &amp; control any society&#39;s resources, that you should eliminate those who aren&#39;t like you, and that you will receive rewards for your atrocities. All 3 groups produce violent individuals who are willing to harm &amp; kill others to forward the repulsive agendas of your political leaders and your predecessors have done this for generation after generation. </p>

<p>People make excuses for these so-called religious organizations, saying that it&#39;s only the most radical of you, but in truth, it&#39;s all of you. Even the mildest moderates hold genocidal beliefs, wether you act upon them or not - because the belief that some higher power chooses you over mankind, is a genocidal belief. </p>

<p>Of course there are attacks on Jews. There are attacks on everyone. However, <em>all</em> the attacks are because of these beliefs. This sadistic behavior stems from the same origin and seeks the same goal. </p>

<p>You linked an article about the number of Jews vs Palestinians &amp; the comparison of the birthrate. Why would you care about such data if you didn&#39;t inherently believe your own population should be growing more quickly? Even that little detail reveals your genocidal beliefs. </p>

<p>You are all the same: some of you hold bombs while others hold books, but the core beliefs don&#39;t vary. The world would be a more peaceful place if the Muslim/Christian/Jewish triad did not exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same with racism or any of these groups that&#39;s claim superiority over other groups. That&#39;s where the problem is; people seriously holding the belief they are above their fellow man. I wonder what that behavior is based in, tribe/group mentality? It&#39;s one of the least admirable traits of humans. It can be observed from local sports teams to national identity. Something deeply ingrained in us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will agree completion is ingrained in us - the desire to prove oneself superior at something. Sportsmanship is also ingrained.  </p>

<p>However, if you want to make examples of racism or nationalism, you have to factor in manifest destiny, which is god-given, and takes us right back to that same triad. </p>

<p>I do see your point however, that violence can stem from many factors surrounding superiority, but if you look at history, you will clearly see a pattern: For every major genocidal movement, one of the <strong>Big Three</strong> is the root cause - wether there is violent retaliation or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let&#39;s create a hypothetical. 
Let&#39;s say that the Palestinians never lived in the Gaza Strip and it was always Israel. What would you do if the Palestinians came to your land, with some help from the US and UK governments, and said &quot;It&#39;s ours now, get out&quot; and started killing any Israelis that didn&#39;t leave?
You&#39;d obviously fight back because you don&#39;t want your land stolen from you where your people had been living for generations. So how can you say the Palestinians have no right to defend themselves? The indigenous people of the Americas had every right to defend against colonists, as did Africans, so stop your sob story about being attacked by Palestinians. You said yourself you&#39;ve never even seen any rockets.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how much land Israel has stolen from the Palestinians in the past 70 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well blaming one country or people is a lot easier than looking at the individual issues the world faces as the complex, multifaceted situations they often are. Examining such large problems is an insurmountable task that has no easily identifiable culprit or cause, so let&#39;s blame the jews, or the blacks, or the rich.</p>

<p>Edit: You disagree so downvote that shit. You could up vote for visibility and make a counter argument, but then you would need to have such an argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What in God&#39;s name are you even talking about? Are you suggesting because some attacks are real that they all are? Or are you suggesting that because Israel get&#39;s attacked that they are completely redeemed for the institutionalized genocide they have set up for Palestine? Because neither of these arguments really makes sense to me. It makes complete sense to me that the Palestinians would attack back. These are not fucking castrated dogs, they are human beings, of course they will fight back. I encourage em too, only a drugged up and brainwashed population like us Americans will stop fighting back when we are being killed in the streets. Israel has no definite rights over the Palestinians, it is only through manipulation of language and history that they have gamed the first world into buying into their sob story. This is the reality, whether you are willing to face that or not. I am not impressed by 6 million, when you are killing thousands in the same way, dead in the streets while their families watch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that all attacks are real. You guys were grasping for something after the Orlando attack but there was nothing solid to prove it was a false flag.</p>

<p>Your point about genocide is exactly what I am talking about. Israel is not committing genocide at all. Any Palestinian who was killed in the last year (except for maybe 4 or 5) were involved in terror attacks, violent rioting,etc. The civilians who died in Gaza are to be blamed on Hamas. You cannot expect a country to just sit back and let 5000 rockets fall. Hamas set up shop in civilian areas (there&#39;s plenty of video proof). So please explain to me this genocide exactly. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/.premium-1.634336">http://www.haaretz.com/.premium-1.634336</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let the rockets fall? Have you seen these fucking rockets? I will see more firepower tonight for the fourth of July. These rockets are nothing more than propaganda to justify the extermination of Palestine as a race and a country. And what we are seeing in Israel is the real life version of genocide. Just because there is no cartoonish villain like Adolf Hitler calling for the absolute extermination does not mean it is not genocide. A great efect of the Hitler propaganda was so that genocide can happen under our noses without us realizing, as long as nobody says it ouright, for people like yourself it is like it is not even happening. Pitiful stuff. You should be ashamed. </p>
