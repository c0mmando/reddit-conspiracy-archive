    <div class="md"><p>An escape route? What is he, James bond? It was a parking garage that was surrounded, with multiple  helicopters. </p>

<p>I agree with your point about explosives. </p>

<p>As for ammo,  my reasoning for thinking he was low was because (I&#39;m definitely not an expert) let&#39;s say he had extended magazines for an ar-15 with .223. That&#39;s 30 rounds in a 16&quot; magazines. He shot a lot of bullets. And he didn&#39;t have a backpack, so that was my thinking.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is you would think they would want to interrogate him at least instead of saying, &quot;Oh yeah we talked to him, got all we wanted, let&#39;s send in a bomb&quot;. They wanted him dead. It seems suspicious (this is r/conspiracy, after all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had plenty of ammo apparently; he was prepared for a prolonged fight. I don&#39;t think tasers, flashbangs, or tear gas would have cut it because he was still armed with a semiautomatic weapon and was clearly skilled in using it. They might have been able wait him out and allow sleep and/or hunger to get the better of him.</p>

<p>I think the reason they opted for the robot was that he claimed that he had planted bombs in the vicinity and he was therefore still an active threat requiring immediate neutralisation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They used a explosive phone apparently. Makes you wonder if the purpose was to give an excuse for a body that can&#39;t be identified (blown off face). You know like if Israel did the attack and shot a random black dude in that area to use the body as the patsy.Then the FBI&#39;s job is to find via their NSA built profiles a suitable patsy, whack the, then at a later point switch the bodies. In the good ol&#39; days (port arthur) they seemed to set up the patsy before hand, but now they make no effort. Like the gay shooter at Orlando. Or the muslim guy and his tiny wife (mistaken for 3 caucasian shooters) at san bernadino. Lack of coordination suggests foreign intelligence doing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhhh, I can kind of see the argument but the other side of that is that it&#39;s not much different from him being shot dead by a sniper for holding a hostage. In this case he has bombs set up and the hostages are the police officers who are gonna have to go in to take him out.</p>

<p>The bombs take out waiting, you can&#39;t just let that kind of threat linger.</p>

<p>The only way he was coming out alive was with a lot more dead officers. So you either kill the &quot;hostages&quot; IE the cops going in. Or you kill civis with his bombs going off. Or you kill him with a &quot;sniper&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The way that they have just been constantly using fear-mongering propaganda throughout the last year or so (It&#39;s been going on for decades, but it&#39;s been going up drastically this year), and how people are just continually buying the same stuff, from the same style attacks, over and over again, is genuinely making me furious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting how these planned murders keep on being used to their maximum political extent to constantly barrage not only people&#39;s rights,, but their entire rational reasoning as well.</p>

<p>We are constantly conditioned into believing that these events are random. We are basically told to ignore all patterns, to ignore convenient coincidences, lest we be called a crazy &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot; </p>

<p>Will people ever realize how ridiculous this is, that we are basically being told that people with lots of money and agendas can never lie? That politicians (except the ones on the other divide and conquer side) are working for us, even though they do the exact opposite every time?</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly painful, and outright scary, that all of these people just keep buying this stuff up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On my phone, do you have a link?</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://archive.is/279jn">Found it.</a> At first I&#39;ll admit it raised my eyebrows, despite being written so poorly. Not that I believe in a conspiracy, but it&#39;s certainly a little confusing.</p>

<p>For one thing, logistically this would be a nightmare. Hiring confidential actors off of craigslist? In the same section riddled with ads for prostitutes and porn stars? I&#39;ve done castings for food commercials on craiglist, in Dallas, paying money (not a free lunch like this ad), and it&#39;s a cattle call of idiots. The organization and high level of perfect-planning required for amassing a group of proficient confidants off of craigslist and further training/executing whatever plan is in the works makes the idea of &quot;actors&quot; extremely unbelievable to me. If you had the time and money for that, just hire real actors. Random streetwalkers would also be the most likely to spill stories about the whole operation, and you can&#39;t just make a dozen people with families disappear at once either. Combined with how a person on June 19th wouldn&#39;t have known that two black guys in different states would be killed by police (july 5th and 6th) and a protest would even be lodged in Dallas. Combined with how no one would even need actors for this operation, they just need a gunman. Or gunmen, but you wouldn&#39;t hire a clandestine group of highly training snipers off of craigslist. Also, and most damning against this, is how apparently there are multiple ads like this in a variety of cities.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a prank.</p>

<p>A suspect who died after a standoff with Dallas police said he wanted to kill white people -- especially white officers -- and that he was upset about &quot;the recent police shootings,&quot; Dallas Police Chief David Brown told reporters Friday.</p>

<p><strong>The suspect was killed by a bomb that authorities detonated</strong>, Brown said.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was</strong>,&quot; Brown said.</p>

<p>Five police officers were killed and seven others were injured in the ambush that began Thursday night, officials said. It was the deadliest single incident for U.S. law enforcement since September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>Two civilians also were injured in the shootings, the office of Dallas&#39; mayor has said.</p>

<p>Most of the injured Dallas police officers have been released from the hospital, Brown told reporters.</p>

<p>&quot;This must stop -- this divisiveness between our police and our citizens,&quot; Brown said. &quot;<strong>We don&#39;t feel much support most days</strong>. Let&#39;s not make today most days. Please, we need your support to be able to protect you from men like these, who carried out this tragic, tragic event.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a planned and carefully executed event.  The Dallas shooting was orchestrated in the wake of the huge civil unrest after the string of murders by police that have taken place recently.  The event was designed to foster a sense of sympathy and affection for the police at a time when so many American&#39;s are ready to rise up against them.   </p>

<p>Make no mistake, this was planned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a good observation. As a planned event it would garner sympathy for the police while simultaneously putting a cap on the Black Lives Matter movement.  Now people will connect Black Lives Matter protests with black people murdering police instead of police murdering black people. The ramifications of the scenario seem a little too &quot;neat&quot; for it to have been simply a random event.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite possible that the shooters were groomed by CIA and let loose much like we hear about FBI grooming &quot;terrorists&quot; in their sting operations. Only difference is the CIA takes it all the way instead of stopping them.</p>

<p>I have this working theory that civil unrest is reaching unprecedented levels and thus &quot;next level&quot; theatrics and engineered disasters are beginning to be deployed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also let&#39;s not forget that just as the public opinion was swaying toward the new narrative that Sterling got himself killed by &quot;reaching&quot; for a weapon (that came out of the pocket we see a cop put his hand into) another unjustified shooting happened with Castile and they had some hard times lying to fit a narrative there. It took a couple days for them to suggest that his parking tickets and traffic stops warranted the unprovoked shooting of him.</p>

<p>So right on the dawn of a resurgence of BLM and support against authoritarian methodology a bunch of cops get shot to death during a peaceful BLM protest. Not just shot to death but by a magical sniper who left his sniper roost, snuck out the back, killed another cop, and then ducked into an empty parking structure which lucky enough had no people in it and was subsequently <em>bombed</em> by the police so there&#39;s a 0% chance we ever see a picture of the corpse that is in any way identifiable.  The other suspect killed himself and the other &quot;suspects&quot; actually weren&#39;t suspects apparently. Nothing strange going on here!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was obviously a march organized by BLM that this shooting occurred at. BLM is funded by George Soros. George Soros is friends with Hillary, and has donated to both her campaign and her foundation. Remember the posts here with apparently leaked texts from BLM organizers saying there will be a summer of chaos? Also, I&#39;m certain I saw posts recently here predicting Dallas as a future target. I honestly wrote those off as too tinfoily, but I stand corrected. Sources at the bottom.</p>

<p>Edit: It has come to my attention that it is incredibly easy to fake DM&#39;s, so take the whole &quot;Summer of Chaos&quot; thing with a grain of salt. I am simply leaving it because it is suspicious.</p>

<p>There goes Hillary <em>correcting the record</em> again. <strong>Filthy pig.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been my fear for ages. DNC convention seems far too convenient. I really hope it doesnt happen. It is the kind of thing that is GUARANTEED to incite civil war. If someone kills this man then Black Lives Matter gets blamed.....Ugh i dont want to think about it. Agenda 21 keeps seeming more and more real.</p>

<p>edit: i do think something horrible will happen though. Way i see it, our news outlets report the news they report for a reason. They have been pushing for a huge rally at the DNC. Well maybe not &quot;pushing&quot; but they are actually talking about it. This tells me they want people to know about it and they want people to go. That being said...&quot;They&quot; are known to do some fucked up shit.</p>

<p>I do appreciate your input and always remember, you may think you only reach a few people with what you share, but it&#39;s easy to forget the impact you can make when those people share what you told them, and then those people share, and then those people share...etc. Whether it&#39;s info like what you gave me, or just an idea, or an opinion, it&#39;s not as hard as we all think to make an impact.

<p>... and others</p>

<p>it makes absolut no sense when blacks would kill cops on black lives matter protests ... they could do it everywhere with same effect.</p>

<p>only one who would profit from this are people against the black live matter protests ... to push the whites against the blacks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And? I never said anything different. I was talking about the people claiming this was a government false flag, rather than a civilian acting against what he perceived to be a violently oppressive government.</p>

<p>I was pointing out that the people that claim to be preparing for a revolution are usually the first ones to deny any act is a revolutionary act.</p>

<p>Take that occupation in Oregon. No sooner had it happened than many &quot;militia&quot; leaders started claiming the leaders were FBI informants tricking people into a &quot;false flag&quot; attack. Same here.</p>

<p>For some reason, the people that claim to want a revolution never rally behind acts like this, but instead claim they are &quot;false flags&quot; carried out by government agents.</p>

Division was eroding with the posibility of increased sympathy among previously divided groups.</p>

<p>The effect of these shooting is galvanized division and increased fear. If there is nefarious intentions at play, I believe their basic intentions are to weaken any populist movements that might be occurring. Division is the enemy of populism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you can&#39;t respond. You call them ridiculous assumptions, but you can&#39;t explain how a gun can stop a bullet, can you? You also can&#39;t explain why none of you gun nuts advocates for the wearing of kevlar vests - equipment that actually <em>can</em> stop bullets.</p>

<p>And you really don&#39;t want to have to explain this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, Branas’s study found that people who carried guns were 4.5 times as likely to be shot and 4.2 times as likely to get killed compared with unarmed citizens. <strong>When the team looked at shootings in which victims had a chance to defend themselves, their odds of getting shot were even higher.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/">https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s simple logic that gun nuts refuse to even contemplate - if you are in a position to shoot an offender, he is in a position to shoot you, and the more you try to do it, the more chances you give him to do it to you too.</p>

<p>Having no gun and running away is significantly less risky than having a gun and engaging in a shootout. It&#39;s simple logic borne out by the statistics.</p>

<p>You think getting in a shootout will save your life. What you forget is the other guy might be a better shot.</p>

This is CNN&#39;s footage - from a slightly different angle. Notice it&#39;s blurred out and they skip the actual shooting - they didn&#39;t skip the shooting last night. I remember thinking the person who was shot fell much slower than Fox&#39;s version and I thought he was either shirtless or wearing a white shirt (it was hard to tell with all the blurring going on.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;re right, this is actually a description of the tactic from a tactical course instruction breakdown:</p>

<p>&quot;Faking is an important skill that is often overlooked and not taught. Good faking is an important key in just about every offensive combat situation. A fake simply is a deception or decoy move to throw the defender off balance, or get him leaning the wrong way just long enough so the offensive shooter can gain a step or two on him, or so a flanker can open up the shooting lane.&quot;</p>

<p>Just kidding, it&#39;s from a <a href="http://www.coachesclipboard.net/CuttingAndFaking.html">basketball</a> tips page and I replaced the word(s) basketball, player &amp; passer with combat, shooter &amp; flanker.</p>

<p>There is no way that&#39;s the first time this guy&#39;s been in combat. You don&#39;t learn that shit from Call of Duty. The guy did it all in one fluid motion as if it was totally natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, and on the thread in r/protectandserve they unanimously agree from the footage that these guys are properly trained for tactical combat, no question. 
My hope is that with police officers knowing this was planned and carried out by professionals it will prevent any later claims that this was just some angry gang bangers getting their revenge on white cops, and a real investigation about who is involved will follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;re right, this is actually a description of the tactic from a tactical course instruction breakdown:</p>

<p>&quot;Faking is an important skill that is often overlooked and not taught. Good faking is an important key in just about every offensive combat situation. A fake simply is a deception or decoy move to throw the defender off balance, or get him leaning the wrong way just long enough so the offensive shooter can gain a step or two on him, or so a flanker can open up the shooting lane.&quot;</p>

<p>Just kidding, it&#39;s from a <a href="http://www.coachesclipboard.net/CuttingAndFaking.html">basketball</a> tips page and I replaced the word(s) basketball, player &amp; passer with combat, shooter &amp; flanker</p>

<p>But you&#39;re still probably right because I don&#39;t know of too many black guys who are into basketball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which means BLM will have an enormous counter protest movement anywhere they go now as they are associated with being cop-killers. If the point is to cause schism and a race war, there you go.</p>

<p>Remember, this was probably one the most multicultural BLM protests yet because Castile&#39;s death was so much harder to obfuscate and lie about than Sterling&#39;s since Sterling had a police record, a gun (that looked planted since we see the cop&#39;s hand go in his pocket), and he was starting some shit before the police got involved. Then Castile&#39;s death comes along and a large amount of people who didn&#39;t care about BLM woke up and said, &quot;this shit isn&#39;t right.&quot; It took them a while to dig up dirt on Castile and the dirt they had wasn&#39;t dissuading people from joining the BLM/anti-police state movements. </p>

<p>I had a buddy in Afghanistan. He was ordered to snipe and kill an American soldier who was in the process of being captured by Taliban forces because that soldier had intel the CO was afraid would leak. He said he missed the shot and the CO immediately called in an air-strike then beat the living shit out of my friend, put a gun to his head, and reminded him how their lives only serve one purpose, the purpose he gives them. He presumably didn&#39;t execute my friend because there were too many other soldiers looking on (none of them doing anything about the situation I might point out). Well, extend that thinking to our generals and nation&#39;s leaders who are far more psychotic than my buddy&#39;s CO.  They&#39;ll kill a few of their own if it discredits the enemy.</p>

<p>Now BLM is split along racial lines again, the next rally is likely to have a lot more agitated (read: violent) protesters, the fence sitters won&#39;t be sitting, and the haters will be out in full force. Even the strongest BLM supporters are going to wonder if its worth being part of a movement that is now being called a terrorist movement, especially if they&#39;re afraid of agent provocateurs in the crowd.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll see a lot more military hardware at the next big rally too. Maybe they&#39;ll finally deploy that heat laser they&#39;ve been using on foreigners.</p>

I think the past 15 years have been a mission to scare the people. I think we have reached a point where that fear is going to be manipulated into accepting a fascist government. Please please let me be wrong but, I feel something is going to happen at the DNC convention resulting in Obama declaring Martial Law and suspending the election. After that all power/water/banks will be shut down indefinitely as civilians are rounded up and taken to FEMA camps. God i dont want to think about it but it&#39;s fucking happening</p>

<p>This in itself was a crime based on divisiveness (the guy supposedly wanted to kill white people  and cops because of the stuff happening recently).</p>

<p>When a nation is divided and people hate each other, it takes the focus away from real problems (and any potential solutions to them). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree with this.</p>

<p>I think all of the other potential results, i.e gun control, marshal law, etc. are definitely likely to follow with more events. And I&#39;m also totally willing to believe that this was some sort of false flag/psyop potentially with the CIA or FBI involved (sniper in Dallas on 7/7 definitely seems like a nod to past events).</p>

<p>But what you said is an absolute guarantee. These events combine together to result in more division, more fighting, more hatred, more animosity, more violence, more death. It&#39;s really said that, we, as Americans are constantly caught up in this bullshit, while the powers that be try their best to brainwash us to hate each other and direct our anger at each other, preventing many from being angry at who they should be angry at: the elites.</p>

<p>Who knows? Maybe this time it&#39;s true. I suspect it&#39;s not based on the reliability and availability of the evidence I&#39;ve seen so far. And from a &quot;grand metanarrative&quot; perspective it&#39;s kind of hard to buy. These nearly omnipotent, power crazed, shadowy globalists wouldn&#39;t let a little thing like an election get in the way right? Surely there&#39;s some better way to &quot;brave new world&quot; us into oblivion without suspending elections. But who knows. </p>

<p>People should be prepared for disruptions to daily life even if we can&#39;t be sure they&#39;ll happen or predict their specific causes, for the same reason that people should buy insurance. And it&#39;s always better to be alert and keep your eyes and mind open. </p>

<p>If it were multiple people then it was definitely organized, but that doesn&#39;t mean it &quot;requires&quot; training to look through a scope, point, and shoot. It&#39;s pretty straight forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>777 is the antithesis to 666 in religion. Jews consider 3 and 7 to be &quot;perfect numbers&quot;.</p>

<p>Christians consider it to be the sign of the threefold perfection of the holy trinity. The perfect beings represented a perfect number of times by the perfect number 777</p>

<p>Some Christian sects consider it to be the number of the end of revelations. 7 angels, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls of wrath</p>

<p>Occultists and Qabalah use it for a different meaning completely away from God. They&#39;re farther into magic and mysticism. <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1766.cfm">They revere the number 33 above all others</a>. Masons, Occutists, Qabahlists, and luciferians.</p>

<p>Aleister Crowley wrote a whole piece on triple 7.  <em>777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley</em>, which outlined the Law of Thelema. A philosophical religon he believed he was the prophet of.</p>

<p>The occult meaning behind 777 would be more likely if they actually cared about symbolism.</p>

<p>The symbolism they use is clear as day in many places once you know what to look for and read about guys like Crowley and Albert Pike.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe in magic or mysticism for them to believe it. They do a lot of weird fucking shit. If they follow Crowley then they&#39;re batshit crazy but will implant the symbolism into everything they do because they believe in the power of numbers and symbols even if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Instability caused now would fit in with Pikes third world war as a way to continue the exhaustion and nihilism</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the religions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, International Communism must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.&quot;</p>

<p>Gen. Albert Pike 1871</p>

<p>There is a lot more to it but I find it&#39;s better to just let a curious individual read and draw conclusions for themselves given a small bit of information that they can use to investigate for themselves past what I say. Telling someone outright will make an unprepared person dismiss you outright. Most people will just read, scoff, and continue on with their day anyways.</p>

<p>He said &quot;As much as I like the idea of a sniper team and a few people on the ground it&#39;s proly not the way it went. We did shit like that all the time in Iraq. To avert incoming fire and make them think we had more guys then we really did and locate their position. When the adrenaline is going It&#39;s not hard to move around like Sonic on crack. You fire off some rounds from up high around the area you think they are. As they&#39;re returning fire to that position run down and open suppressive fire to a more precise area you think they&#39;re at, then run back up and open fire again when you have them zeroed in. It not only helps you find your target it also confuses them so you can get a clean kill. I&#39;d run up and down stairs in full gear in Iraqi summer weather. So doing it around a few buildings with elevators in Dallas would be a cake walk.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That it the same thing I am here to find answers to. Apart from the fact that it was reported that there were multiple shooters who ambushed the police penning them in with gunfire from high up, I am having trouble believing that a lone gunman could have fired on police from the top of a building and actually made it out of said building without being met by the scores of police below. I mean how many exits were there for this shooter to have made it out of a building and proceed on foot to take out more police? The police were there literally seconds after the first shots were fired. Their first protocol would have been to completely surround the building, yet this one guy got out to continue a gunfight with police, which he also escaped from. When has that ever happened before?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chaos started when at least two snipers fired from an elevated position on police officers minutes before 9 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), Brown said. He called it an &quot;ambush-style&quot; shooting.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe that these suspects were positioning themselves in a way to <em>triangulate on these officers from two different perches</em> in garages in the downtown area, and planned to injure and kill as many law enforcement officers as they could,&quot; he told a news conference earlier — noting that some victims were shot in the back.</p>

<p>Other suspects might still be at large. &quot;We&#39;re hopeful that we have got everybody, but we don&#39;t know that for sure,&quot; Rawlings told NBC&#39;s TODAY.</p>

<p>He said the <strong>suspects in custody</strong> were &quot;being pretty tight-lipped,&quot; but their motives were clear. &quot;It&#39;s simple ... they wanted to kill police officers. And sadly, they did.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yknow, it&#39;s funny, I don&#39;t subscribe to this sub but I come here from time to time to confirm my memory of events. Maybe it&#39;s time i subscribed. Everything you&#39;re saying is what I remember, the idea that anything else is being said is shocking. Unless what was said at the time was wrong which is equally bad. That man who was accused, who turned over his gun, is screwed because the media got it wrong. Either the media got it wrong, or the media got it right and it&#39;s being covered up. It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t hold them accountable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a conspiracy theorist is considered a nut job and whatever. I&#39;m a normal person who has lived in Dallas all of my 38 years. I get a text from best friend last night who says turn on the news now. I watched it all play out. I went and told my husband to turn off his Sopranos marathon and come watch this.  When he wasn&#39;t interested at first I texted him and said seriously they have snipers in the  Bank of America building (big green bldg) and El Centro college. </p>

<p>These were real things that happened in real time less than 24 hrs ago.  No one is saying in order to subscribe you have to be a flat earther or believe in UFOs. I havent believed what the media has told me for awhile but this one really is crazy because so many people saw this happening. </p>

<p>THe establishment and media want a race war. We know it. They know that we know. They don&#39;t care. We must not allow them to continue to shove words into our mouths and cascade thoughts into our minds. We are better than that. The majority of people don&#39;t want to hate and despise one another. We are sick of that. We want there to be harmony. We just don&#39;t know how to go about it because someone isn&#39;t taking the reins. We can all lead. We just have to move as one. I know this seems like a silly response but I honesty don&#39;t know what to do or say anymore except for instill thoughts of hope and assurance to others. We can change what is. I know it. You know it. </p>

It&#39;s pathetic, pitiful, and an insult. It tells you what they really think of the average useless eater.</p>

<p>Although triggering a race war through the media isn&#39;t going to bear any fruits, this IS the beginning of an accelerated militarization of police. If a race war won&#39;t start, then they&#39;ll at least attempt martial law.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any will to change things</p>

<p>That much is more than obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so I&#39;m not ineffective</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that you apparently don&#39;t understand how degenerate is a mind that doesn&#39;t want things to change in a world like this one, I&#39;d say you&#39;re far more ineffective than you think.  You just apparently don&#39;t know it.</p>

<p>Lack of will tends to make you mentally and emotionally indolent like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>get out and do what you strive to do.</p>

<p>Been doing that.</p>

<p>Also, the way that guy moved to kill the police officer behind the pillar was truly astounding. He either was in ecstasy or highly trained. I&#39;m talking about Vympel grade training here.</p>

<p>Someone should investigate this.</p>

<p>Sufi influence? What are you talking about? I&#39;m genuinely curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are currently 3 world powers. The globalists, headed by people like Soros; The Russian-Chinese Eurasian block, headed by people like Aleksandr Dugin; Islam, headed by the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The sufi influence is just one of the ways that the Muslim Brootherhood can achieve their goal. This influence happens on the most elevated leves of mankind, religion. That means if you are not razor sharp in knowing your tradition, you will not be able to know if you are actually taking part in your religion or Islam.</p>

<p>I myself am not capable of explaining the whole process, but basically you should look for western leaders inside Tariqas. 
You should also look into the &quot;Traditionalist School&quot; and its people like Frithjof Schuon and René Guénon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m taking a philosophy course with a ex-member of Schuon&#39;s Tariqa, so I&#39;m not talking out of my ass here.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s 3 suspects in custody and 1 dead.  Some say suicide.  Some say shot by cops.  But ABC is reporting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police Chief David Brown says a suspect in the overnight attack that killed five police officers, wounded seven others and wounded two civilians said he was upset over the recent police shootings of black men and wanted to kill white people.</p>

<p>Brown said at a news conference Friday that the suspect made the comments before he was killed by an explosive used by police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like absolute bullshit.  He made a comment and then was killed by a police explosive?  what kindof explosives are police using?</p>

<p>Other suspects might still be at large. &quot;We&#39;re hopeful that we have got everybody, but we don&#39;t know that for sure,&quot; Rawlings told NBC&#39;s TODAY.</p>

<p>He said the suspects in custody were &quot;being pretty tight-lipped,&quot; but their motives were clear. &quot;It&#39;s simple ... they wanted to kill police officers. And sadly, they did.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the police chief is claiming that the suspects in custody have basically admitted to being involved.  that&#39;s going to look bad when it turns out he&#39;s full of shit.</p>

<p>No surprise this happened on 7/7.  These mercs love that date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone else want to hear the audio from Micah Johnson&#39;s announcements to the police while they had him cornered?  </p>

<p>All the news reports are stating that he said he wanted to kill cops, he wanted white people to due, he had bombs all over Dallas. He also stated (oddly?) that he had no ties to terrorist groups and that he was working alone.  </p>

<p>It seems convenient that the shooter basically laid out the whole story in his statements to the cops while he was cornered. Why would be provide all these details to the police?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t wanna jump to any conclusions here, I would just like to hear the audio so I can make my own judgments on this aspect of the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally feel that this, Orlando, Ferguson, Jade Helm, Sandy Hook etc etc are the results of a continuation of a Vietnam-era operation called the Phoenix Program.  William Colby and Ted Shackley of the CIA oversaw a program whereby at least 1800 &quot;suspected VC&quot; were killed every month as part of an effort to destabilize the country and inflict a sense of absolute terror and dread in the Vietnamese people. When Colby returned from Vietnam and became director of the CIA in 1973 I think he imported the program to America and began to create as much fear, division as possible and to create an overwhelming atmosphere of terror and paranoia. For example, many serial killers had ties to that particular era of Vietnam including Arthur Shawcross and Leonard Lake. It&#39;s not much of a leap to speculate that perhaps they were unleashed by the Deep State as an experiment in mind control. I believe what we see today is an attempt to create an American insurgency that will give them the excuse to live out their paranoid fantasies of martial law and overt fascism brought on by undercover deathsquads roaming the country.Look at that guy caught in LA with a car full of weaponry on the same weekend as the Pulse shooting, it seems to me like he was a part of a much bigger plan. If you want more info on the serial killer/Phoenix Program connection read Programmed To Kill by Dave McGowan, it&#39;s essential to understanding the depth of the American brand of social manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for the info about &#39;Programmed To Kill&#39;. Maybe I can buy a copy for my eBook (Kobi eReader). </p>

<p>Wow, I had no idea that the hole went that deep (or deeper). It&#39;s kind of sickening to hear that someone who&#39;s sole goal was to inflict as much terror/fear/horror onto the Vietnamese went onto becoming the CIA director. Fuck... By any chance did Colby get any &quot;training&quot; from Kissinger? Didn&#39;t Kissinger write the book on terror? </p>

<p>I feel kind of sad these past few days... why can&#39;t we all learn to love each other, and see what the Deep State is doing to us. Already a few online friends are telling me that they&#39;re terrified of going out at night. When I asked why they said that they felt like we were living in a matchbox, and at any moment someone was going to light a match but light it inside the box. I feel that way sometimes... but sometimes I also want to be positive and try not to stress out in front of my family or co-workers or friends. Not many people at work were feeling &quot;chummy&quot;. </p>

<p>Okay, good talking to you man. Cheers! </p>

<p>So you&#39;re already creating a dissonance of events </p>

<p>The last cop was shot, according to your link, 2 hours and not 3 hours after the incident happened. </p>

<p>And at 10.57pm, the time reported in your link, the lone suspect was still alive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point I was making is that is seemed to take an awfully long time for the cops to get cover, so obviously that refers to the shooting.

<p>An officer was shot days later in pursuit of Dorner during that incident</p>

<p>This is a silly question anyways ... This was the deadliest attack on law enforcement since 2001 as reported by the media.   I don&#39;t have enough knowledge regarding police standoffs within the last 10 years to answer your question in a way that satisfies either of our points.  Can YOU think of a shooting incident that mirrors this one in the last 10 years??  </p>

<p>Is it possible an officer was shot hours into a standoff with a lone shooter... sure is.   Maybe they were shot by friendly fire even.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we do not get evidence from our sensory organs then where does it come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Massive speculation does not equal evidence.  We only have evidence of one suspect firing a weapon.  One perimeter that was surrounded and that was the primary focus of law enforcement.  And one shooter confirmed dead. </p>

<p>Everything else is speculation without evidence.  You can look to the June mass shooting incident at UCLA to see that initial reports are often wrong. </p>

<p>The most obvious thing that I can think of for why people would believe there are multiple shooters in Dallas is the fact that several people including the officers and the lone shooter were exchanging fire and whatever witnesses were assuming that chaos was several shooters.</p>

<p>Kind of like Occams Razor </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occam&#39;s (or Ockham&#39;s) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham. Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born. The principle states that &quot;Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking but I can&#39;t find any incidents.  Once they have the perimeter up they are pretty damn good at not getting hit. In any case, my entire point is that this is an exceptional incident and you have just agreed with me.  Exceptional means unusual, means unlikely, means sort of suspicious that one guy could do so much damage over such a long period of time (if there were more than one shooter that would help explain the exceptional nature of the event). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We only have evidence of one suspect firing a weapon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eyewitness accounts are evidence, police accounts are evidence, videos are evidence.  That doesn&#39;t mean it is impossible there was only one shooter, but the more contrary evidence we find the more unlikely it is. </p>

In what was forming to be a critical moment for the BLM movement, in terms of its revolutionary or, at least, highest propagandistic potential (at both a national level and global level) was almost certainly permanently quashed by the actions of a few, seemingly almost martially-trained, individuals, who, for this exact reason, could simultaneously not but evoke and refer back to the accumulating phylogenesis of decadally recent mass killings and spree shootings in these increasingly Orwellian United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chaos started when at least two snipers fired from an elevated position on police officers minutes before 9 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), Brown said. He called it an &quot;ambush-style&quot; shooting.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe that these suspects were positioning themselves in a way to <em>triangulate on these officers from two different perches</em> in garages in the downtown area, and planned to injure and kill as many law enforcement officers as they could,&quot; he told a news conference earlier — noting that some victims were shot in the back.</p>

<p>Other suspects might still be at large. &quot;We&#39;re hopeful that we have got everybody, but we don&#39;t know that for sure,&quot; Rawlings told NBC&#39;s TODAY.</p>

<p>He said the <em>suspects in custody</em> were &quot;being pretty tight-lipped,&quot; but their motives were clear. &quot;It&#39;s simple ... they wanted to kill police officers. And sadly, they did.&quot; </p>

They know that 90% of America will just swallow whatever the fuck they put on the news, regardless of how blatantly implausible it is. I remember the initial reports saying multiple snipers, and also heard the elevated positions thing. I also remember several people saying that it seemed like a highly-coordinated tactical maneuver. The shooters seemed like professionals. I can&#39;t believe how this shit is escalating, all the hoaxes and false flags.

    <div class="md"><p>Watching CNN, it appears that nearly every witness specifically zeroes in on the fact that the weapons used are AR-15s. From the distances they are at when the videos were taken, I find it difficult to confirm that they are specifically AR-15s, there are many non AR-15 weapons which to an amateur would appear as the scary black gun.  Just my observation.</p>

<p>Black guns matter!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that makes no sense is that all of this looks like the public displays that the military and police have been practicing around the country as part of their &quot;urban warfare&quot; trainings. An impromptu protest with thousands of people is a perfect training op. Military grade armour says that this op wasnt cheap. That guy was unfazed by the policemans shots. That takes practice. The sparks from the shots looked like squibs from hollywood. And how the fuck did he (they) get from their high position just to use infilitration style attack patterns on the ground so fast....? All those angles in a business district late night...? How many cameras were on the scene? I&#39;ve seen at least a dozen angles from people in very stationary positions panning and zooming. It looked setup. You never see one camera moving with the peopke running. Not once. Thats not fear....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that this event also happened in a city that has a police chief who has been making an exemplary policy of deescalation between the police and the public. Complaints about violent police in Dallas have been down 64% since he started this policy making it one of the safest cities. It seems that somebody is trying to sabotage this effort, so that it doesn&#39;t spread across the US.</p>

<p>This is typical for this kind of operation, achieving multiple goals at once.</p>

<p>A similar thing happened with the leftist terrorist group &quot;Red Army Faction&quot; in Germany in the 1970s. They kidnapped and killed a banker who was one the most progressive ones at the time. A banker who was trying to improve the banking system for the good of all.</p>

<p>Something interesting that I saw was this:</p>

<p>If you go to the White House visitor log, McKesson has visited many times. Now he&#39;s an activist and has high level connections, but it seems a little suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think anyone who&#39;s been in Washington long enough understands that the ends justify the means, and the means are controlling public opinion to execute the agenda of the wealthy. It&#39;s not rogue but it is covert. This should be considered successful operation of the government. Quite a lot of our governing is extra-governmental, policy gets created by think tanks, military operations are sold to private firms, the two parties themselves are nongovernmental institutions....so there may have been very little participation by elected and appointed officials, it may have come from those who govern our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that sounds about right. Crazy how differently the government really works from how you grow up thinking it works. What I wouldn&#39;t give to be a fly-on-the-wall when some of this stuff gets discussed, and to actually know the specifics of who calls the shots, who plans the shit, who the actual top dogs are. You hear so many different theories, like it&#39;s the Zionist lobby, it&#39;s the banking elite, it&#39;s the Anglo-American connection, the military-industrial complex, etc. I&#39;m guessing that there is a little bit of truth to all of that, those groups all having more or less common goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figure its a Western triad of nations, peppered with outlying dynastic families of wealth and leading corporations, which use America as their hired muscle and benefit from America being seen as the evil world power antagonizing Islamic extremists. Just look at who benefits the most from our foreign policy and you&#39;re on the right path, surely it&#39;s more nuanced than that but it doesn&#39;t really matter if our leadership are aware they&#39;re being played and still have their own agenda. All that matters is whose society deteriorates/grows and whose power wanes/waxes. America is airtight and still thinks she&#39;s directing the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chain of command. Military personnel are entirely indoctrinated. I don&#39;t mean to imply negative connotations as there is no other way. That said if we assume this is some sort of coup in order to instate martial law then we can only assume &quot;they&quot; are in control of the military. We would have to question the motives of whoever was in control. It is not a soldiers place to question orders. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read enough to know the military often act outside of the law and it is unquestionable that they are willing to kill innocent civilians. I very much doubt the American military would comfortably kill American civilians openly on American soil so in that respect I see your point and agree however I believe if martial law were to be instated I doubt the military would be working primarily for the good of the people and to protect the constitution. They would follow orders to the best of their ability. </p>

<p>All of a sudden, we forget that because we are so drawn to police violence and chaos? They set the stage early. Then later on, out of the blue, a sophisticated attack takes place during a protest designed to address the killings that took place in the morning?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing.  Isn&#39;t the historical purpose of the American right to bear arms rooted in the power of citizens to confront their government if it becomes corrupt?  Haven&#39;t there been major stories recently about police corruption (eg. NYPD)?  So is this American patriotism or American terrorism?  The lines do blur.</p>

<p>The thing about gun control -- at least one aspect of it, is that if you take away the people&#39;s guns, then the authorities don&#39;t have a very good excuse for carrying and using their guns.  It&#39;s all part of disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government may have been behind this, but Trump could easily have had a hand in this event as well.  Think of how easy it would be for him to engineer something like this, and how much he could profit from arranging and knowing who gets attacked and when.   </p>

<ol>
<li>Find a brooding unstable patsy with military training to be your shooter.  Maybe someone who has already been investigated and cleared by the FBI. </li>
<li>Have your operative pretend to be a with a shadowy new arm of BML</li>
<li>Manufacture stressful conditions in your patsy&#39;s personal life to help push him over the edge.<br/></li>
<li>Be there for him and feed him information about where and how to do the attack, to get his revenge.</li>
<li>Have your prescient tweets and perfectly crafted post-shooting facebook response speech and ready to go.</li>
<li>Subtly accuse your opponent of somehow being behind the shooting as a distraction.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, I know nothing. I&#39;ve never posted in this sub before, and I&#39;m not even the type of person who is prone to conspiracy theories.  But Trump&#39;s (and The_Donald&#39;s) incredibly fast and organized response to Orlando first led me to think about how easy it would be for someone to arrange this, how much Trump has to gain from it, and how indicative his recklessness is of a capacity for something like this.    </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s well-rehearsed teleprompter fed response on facebook brought me here to see if anyone else was thinking the same.  His thoughtful poised response to this event--in sharp contrast to his typical ranting--seems very clearly to have been crafted before the shootings took place, and shows him to be deeply profiting from this terrible event. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been known to happen every now and then.  I had to stop investing in stocks because I kept selling just before my picks took off.  But the thing is, I actually had the right picks; my problem was that I didn&#39;t trust my hunches, and I paid dearly for that.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not at all clear to me that my intuition is mistaken about this, and it&#39;s certainly not clear that Trump has nothing to gain by engineering these attacks. Any terrorism on US soil makes Trump look like a genius and gives him an opportunity to be an avenging angel, and that&#39;s a pretty big gain for someone who is neither a genius nor an angel. His heavily scripted and carefully crafted Facebook video response that just spontaneously appeared yesterday currently has 8.5 million views.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This honestly scares the crap out of me. Been following all these events for a while now and I am convinced a race war is being incited followed by Martial Law and the disarming of America.  Friends call me crazy but everything i read is pointing to it. Just the way this went down, how the shooter was blown up, how nobody saw the shooter, how the shooter was supposedly screaming &quot;I want to kill white officers&quot; during the standoff. Everything about this points to false flag. </p>

<p>Everything going on right now has me really thinking about the FEMA camp conspiracy theory. So fucking scary and things are panning out exactly how some have predicted. NWO is real and im scared this is the official beginning. Could an American Holocaust really happen?</p>

Called crazy and met with 100% disbelief. Amazing how these idiots apparently know with absolute certainty that what I&#39;m suggesting is not the case. So damn certain of what they know in a era highlighted by information wars and the spreading of disinformation. I even admitted I couldn&#39;t prove my hypothesis was true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To admit the possibility would be to acknowledge that their own government could as easily kill them at any time, for no reason.  This leap is too much for most people, and explains why parts of history are hard for them to accept.  </p>

<p>There is a strong chance that they believe in the just world hypothesis.  Both popular media and religion reinforce it well.  In these, how often does the &quot;bad guy&quot; win?</p>

<p>Rule 38 (The 48 Rules of Power) explains their reaction well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think as you like but Behave like others
If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and
unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon
them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend
in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who
are sure to appreciate your uniqueness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I learned during sandy hook not to suggest conspiracy on my social media. This shows you how effective false flags can be....by simply making somebody feel sad, scared, angry, etc, you can have a story that&#39;s full of holes and makes no sense. Those who question it will be called insensitive to the dead. Also, it&#39;s very scary for most people to seriously consider the ramifications of a false flag....turns their whole belief system upside down. Also, I have no idea what happened but my starting place is always to distrust the msm. </p>

What would be interesting to know is the sequence of the shootings. Were there gunshots from sniping distance, then close range, then sniping distance? Or was it all sniping distance, then close range?
The police were very quick to try and distract everyone by asking them to look out for the guy in a camo singlet open carrying - of course, after he was found innocent, they didn&#39;t publish their mistake so his name could be cleared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying it is or isn&#39;t a false flag, but AFAIK there hasn&#39;t been any info released on how they identified the suspect. Also, a bomb/explosive device doesn&#39;t always mean that someone is turned into a completely unrecognizable pile of mush to be lethal. The rapid compression from the concussive force of the blast can rupture organs, blood vessels and cause lots of internal mess to all the squishy bits to be lethal even without having enough pressure to cause  dismemberment or have shrapnel running through you. Considering the explosive didn&#39;t necessarily cause massive amounts of collateral damage to the point where logically everything would be utterly vaporized, I think it&#39;s safe to say that plausibly, yes, a small piece of plastic could survive. That doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t have other methods of identification too.</p>

<p>We only have video evidence identifying 1 shooter.  We have several videos showing witnesses likely confusing police return fire as incoming active shooter fire.  Police set up one perimeter for 1 shooter.  After that 1 shooter was confirmed dead, the police escorted numerous people trapped in nearby buildings.  If they ID&#39;ed multiple shooters they would&#39;ve had multiple perimeters, the helicopters would not of stopped flying over head until all shooters were down or captured, and the folks trapped in buildings would&#39;ve remained in lock down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. The BLM movement was gaining some serious momentum and the timing of this is too convenient. What is really distressing to me is how well it worked - I feel like support from white allies for BLM has really disappeared, and now everyone is in the AllLiveMatter camp, which completely disregards the dangers and prejudice that black persons have to face everyday. I&#39;ve just been really depressed seeing this story develop and how it clearly doesn&#39;t add up, that those officers died for some agenda that&#39;s being covered up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way the suspect manoeuvers his weapon, how his feet are evenly spaced as he moves, this person has had CQC training. 
He uses cover, stays calm under fire &amp; fires back without hesitation. 
This is no amateur, he has combat experience, he fires two rounds running from cover forcing the PO to take cover, flanks him, moves in &amp; closes the gap for the kill shot. Well executed attack (no pun intended)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did 9 months combat Iraq or Afghanistan, he may have been clearing buildings depending on what was going on.  Not only grunts do the fighting, they may have all sorts of different people playing grunt at times.  But as a former grunt, in the active Army during peacetime only, I can tell you that I feel like all those basic fire and maneuver skills are still right there for me. I&#39;m not in nearly as good condition, but I can damn sure still fire a weapon with great accuracy, use cover and concealment and perform fire and maneuver if need be.  I just wouldn&#39;t discount his military experience.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff in this article. Says he never saw combat in the Army. Seems odd to me that a guy who never saw combat could be so cool calm and collected while performing all that fancy shooting and evading. Could someone really do that with just training alone? I personally find it fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB are not above faking stuff, of course, but it&#39;s been proven over, and over, and OOOVVVER again that they have exactly ZERO compunction against <em>actually</em> killing whoever they have to kill in order to make the public believe whatever ploy they want them to believe.</p>

<p>There are and have been a <em>lot</em> of casualties in the war against truth, and tptb have no problem with killing and killing and killing some more in their efforts to keep pushing their agendas forward.</p>

<p>Hell, a large percentage of these uber elites think that there are far too many of us &quot;useless eater sheeple&quot; on the planet anyway.  They&#39;re all about cutting down the population by an absolutely MASSIVE percentage as it stands.  They contrive war after war that never had to happen and that have killed <del>tens</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">hundreds</a> of <em>millions</em> of us.  They have pushed forward all kinds of hellish propaganda designed to dumb us down and make us crazed and violent so that we end up destroying ourselves and each other.</p>

<p>We&#39;re little more than tax dollars to them.  We&#39;re expendable chattel that they feed off of and they look upon as being nothing but <a href="http://www.proliberty.com/observer/batterymorpheus.jpg">this</a>...and once the chattel start getting too large in number for them to properly/adequately control and manage, then the sheep herders go toward employing whatever <em>other</em> methods they have to cull them without actually, directly IN THEIR FACE killing them (because the last thing these evil sheep herders want is for their livestock to wake up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPW9mIrQcXA#t=0m38s">turn on them</a>) - although it seems they have indeed been resorting to more in your face, out in the open methods as well.</p>

<p>If a hoax scenario suits them, then I&#39;m sure they have no problem with hoaxing things.  I&#39;m not saying that doesn&#39;t happen.  However, what&#39;s the easiest way to scare the sheep into believing that their brother and sister sheep are actually getting killed?</p>

<p>Well...actually <em>killing</em> them, of course.  Make sure and actually publicly kill a certain subsection of them in front of the entire herd and then blame it on someone/something else (usually within the overall herd itself so that they continue killing each other more and more).  That&#39;s the literal definition of a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You certainly seem to be trying to make some big brouhaha about pushing a &quot;hoax&quot; narrative when it being a false flag and there actually being real casualties is exactly <em>no</em> stretch of the imagination for those powers that have been responsible for such things in the past.  The idea that you think it&#39;s easier to keep people alive and recycle them over and over while trusting them to keep their mouths shut <em>and</em> expecting citizens not to pick up on your recycling of those usual suspects (which citizens <em>have</em> picked up on) instead of just actually killing real, unsuspecting citizens in order to make sure your false narratives are believed is myopic to say the least, and shows a lack of understanding of history and what&#39;s <em>actually</em> happened in many proven false flag attacks of the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, man.  Of course not.  As I said from the very beginning:  This COULD be a hoax.  Sure.  I&#39;m just saying that it could also have been a very <em>real</em> attack - just blamed on somebody else (i.e. a false flag).  Or it could have been a combination of both.</p>

<p>Look, it seems that we&#39;re arguing over something that&#39;s ultimately kind of stupid in the sense that we both actually seem to be on the <em>same team</em>.  In other words, we both seem to know that this event involved a lot of fuckery and wasn&#39;t some sort of &quot;organic attack that &#39;just&#39; took place&quot;.</p>

<p>It could have been a false flag.  It could have been a hoax.  It could have been a mixture of both.</p>

<p>Regardless, my main point is that it doesn&#39;t seem that it was organic and &quot;just&quot; happened.</p>

<p>This attack was about inciting more racial division in the masses, taking heat of Clinton&#39;s obvious criminality, and repealing the 2nd amendment.  THAT&#39;S what this was about.  Doesn&#39;t matter whether it was a false flag or a hoax ultimately, and we (you and I) aren&#39;t doing ourselves or the search for the truth any favors by trying to argue about whether it was a false flag or a hoax.  So it&#39;s all good.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem that this has been the case throughout most of history, however.  History has <em>not</em> shown this idea to be the case.</p>

<p>Hoaxes happen.  Sure.  But people get killed <em>for real</em>, and often.</p>

<p>Either way.  Really doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>You think people weren&#39;t killed?  Fine.  I imagine some haven&#39;t been killed, but I know many are and have been killed.</p>

<p>All moot.  Point is that TPTB hang the population by a manipulative string, and whatever Boston and Sandy Hook were, they <em>definitely</em> were state manipulations.  That&#39;s for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s an &quot;objective fact&quot; is that people have gotten killed in false flag attacks.  Certain events definitely seem to be hoaxes too.  Sure.</p>

<p>What do you think happened during 911?  Do you think <em>that</em> was a hoax too?</p>

<p>And no.  It&#39;s not besides the point - if you&#39;re thinking that - because the point is that the same powers that carried that out are also carrying out all the other attacks that we see regularly today.</p>

<p>It&#39;s moot because regardless of whether people did die or not, the event was NOT as TPTB say it happened and they <em>are</em> using the event to forward an agenda regardless of what it actually was.</p>

<p>You really have this fixation with thiis &quot;hoax&quot; scenario, and it&#39;s really odd actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you can see him shooting it long before he engages the cop that comes up behind him.  He fires 3-4 round clearly in the video ... it&#39;s clearly a rifle of some kind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m stuck at home tonight so I watched a 20/20 special on the shooting and they were reporting an SKS rifle was used.    Not saying they&#39;re right just saying what they reported.  If it was an SKS it had to be one that was modified, most likely, to accept a larger capacity magazine. </p>

<p>Doubtless there were FBI infiltrators in the crowd in Dallas on the night of 7/7, is it possible that included among their operations was the monitoring of Micah Johnson? After all, it has been self-reported by one of Johnson’s own intellectual models, a certain ‘Professor’ Griff, that the FBI has had him under constant communicational surveillance for some time; while Micah X.

I go through the comments all the time and I call out BS from anyone. However I think your missing the overall tone from black groups right now. Groups like the New Black Panther Party are applauding the killings of the police and they made statement that said “WE ARE CALLING ON THE GANGS ACROSS THE NATION! ATTACK EVERYTHING IN BLUE EXCEPT THE MAIL MAN, UNLESS HE IS CARRYING MORE THAN MAIL!” Imagine if a white group said that, this would be the top story in the news for a week and the president would make a statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Something&#39;s very wrong with the whole set-up. Like, not one, not two, but up to <strong><em>four</em></strong> suspected snipers?? </p>

<p>That&#39;s too well coordinated. So yeah, it could&#39;ve been pre-planned, but still, too many cops were gunned down. These guys have good aim with adrenaline pumping, muscles all tense, and targets all moving around. These guys ex-para or something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you are a fucking MORON. The irony is, you ramble on about logic, yet, you clearly don&#39;t understand logic. All cops wear Kevlar, but that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be shot dead by a head or well-placed body shot. Not to mention, civilian Kevlar does not always protect against some types of ammo. So, there goes the silly &quot;logic&quot; of your argument that everyone should walk around wearing Kevlar (as well as your assumption that anyone believes that having a gun automatically protects you from dying by a gun - you made that up yourself). I mean, seriously. 🙄</p>

<p>And, just because someone supports the second amendment doesn&#39;t make them a gun nut. I don&#39;t even own a firearm! Nor do I advocate that everyone should own one. I&#39;m an advocate of reasonable gun control measures, actually. Nonetheless, the choice to bear arms was afforded to each citizen of this country FOR GOOD REASON by our founding fathers. But if your username (and accompanying ignorance of the real issue at hand) checks out, you wouldn&#39;t know anything about that, so I really have no clue why you&#39;re trying to argue the ethics of a constitutional amendment that you clearly have zero understanding of. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you read <a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-riddle-of-the-gun">this</a> for a THOUGHTFUL, well-researched, well-cited discussion of the issue (I don&#39;t agree with Harris 100% but it&#39;s an excellent argument, nonetheless). Then read up on the 2nd amendment and we can talk. Until then I don&#39;t have time for your ridiculousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To kill as many people as efficiently as possible? </p>

<p>5.56 millimeter ammunition is not designed to kill as efficiently as possible. It is actually designed to be a combat multiplier. The round is more likely to wound you then kill you. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so popular with militaries and was pushed to get implemented in Vietnam. If I shoot guy (a)  it does not kill him, guy (b) and possibly (c) are going to step in and help him. So with one shot I have the potential of taking out multiple individuals out of the fight.</p>

<p>I served nine years in the military, two tours in Iraq. The M16/M4 utilizing 5.56 ammunition fucking sucks. Has almost no stopping power. You shoot someone they&#39;re going to take a while to go down. Unless you hit them in the heart or head. Hell, guys in Afghanistan headshot someone at 300 yards and it won&#39;t kill them because the round won&#39;t pierce their skull.</p>

<p>Frankly sir your opinion is exactly that an opinion, propagated by movies and media that  carries little fact. The M16 series of weaponry is actually an exceedingly ineffective unreliable weapon system. Anyone in the military who actually ever use them in combat has become to hate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope that one day that the military does decide to go back to 7.62mm. I can understand the fact of being able to carry more ammunition using 5.56 millimeter, but our military has become so mobile even Squad level has their own vehicles. so the ability to carry ammo cans in the vehicle will compensate for that tenfold. Even if that&#39;s not possible, it&#39;s no longer necessary to carry over 200 rounds of ammunition on your body. You&#39;re not away from the forward operating base or a resupply point for days, potentially weeks on end. You and I both know that real life firefights you&#39;re not going to go to that much ammunition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think that those attempting to control civilians access to Firearms are using the AR-15 style weapon as a symbol so they can use it to focus their attacks. When you see that type of weapon the first thing you think is &quot;hey, that&#39;s the kind of gun the Army uses.&quot; You see it in movies, video games and there is this inevitable thought that this must be the Pinnacle of Weapons Systems. I mean if it&#39;s good enough for the forces who defend our country it must be pretty damn good. Then the media attaches all these Buzz words to it. Military grade, High-Power and it creates this paper tiger that is easy to demonize.</p>

<p>When facts if you ever dig into them throw the buzz words out the window. Military grade? Military-grade Weaponry are made by the lowest bidder have been in service for decades and half the time have been maintained by some incompetent SOB. 
High powered? You have to be kidding me here... The kinetic energy transferred by 5.56 ammunition is almost laughable. High velocity yes, high powered no...</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m probably going to get burned alive for what I&#39;m about to say but just look at the numbers. In all these shootings where an AR-15 have been used there are more wounded than dead. Thank God that no more people died and I am thankful of that. The only thing though, if the shooter had been using a different weapon system such as a M14 or God forbid a magazine-fed shotgun. the numbers would be inverse with more dead than wounded. </p>

Furthermore this thread started with &quot;Please keep it civil and post all related content regarding the sniper shootings, including videos, articles and theories here&quot;, if people here have formed a conclusion based on what they have watched, heard, and seen, that&#39;s called forming an opinion. Quit with the insults it just makes you look silly, instead explain to everyone why things are the way they are, be constructive instead of saying &quot;your dumb&quot;, and &quot;you&#39;re not&quot; seeking the truth.</p>

Instead of focusing on the recent trend of Black Supremacy with radical groups like BLM that they openly support. Then again that is the plan of George Soros and his puppet states. Devide the citizens so that they can create a society where the elite runs everything and all, while their legions of useful idiots are far to busy fighting eachother aswell as voting in things that will only benefit the elite and not your average working class citizen (eg, gun control, and vote remain in Britain).</p>

<p>Edit: it appears now 11 officers were shot, 1 civilian.  This makes a total of 12 shot.  5 died leaving 7 alive.  So we still have a 7 and 11 to work with.  Here come the downvotes.</p>

<p>Edit 3:  as of now, the numbers in edit one still stand.  I wanted to add that there are 4 suspects, 12 shot, 12+4=16 so, 7/7/16.  Also as noted above, there are a total of 16 people involved, 1+6=7.  Take all this however you want, even I feel like I&#39;m reaching a bit, but there it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, i have a unique perspective, i joined a secret society in college. so ive been through initiations and been exposed to a fair amount of the occult through that. it led to me doing a lot of reading on the subject and talking with other members about that aspect of the society (i was our ritual master for 2 years) </p>

<p>when it comes to ceremonial magick and things like numerology effecting real world outcomes its pretty simple, if you get a big group together and hold a ceremony that all of them think is going to work it changes all of their thinking and goals to align with the wanted outcome. (think of it like a church service where the preacher tell you all to go out and do gods will)</p>

<p>things like skull and bones and some of the other powerful secret societies tend to only pull membership from the &quot;elite&quot; as well (keep in mind most of the occult societies of the past were 100% made of old world nobility) so many of the ruling class are true believers in this stuff. some just pay lip service to the occult aspects but like to use things like numerology as a sort of signature, like a serial killer leaving his mark for those who are like minded to notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing your perspective on this. I&#39;ve been wondering how much of the occult belief is true and how much is really just cover or smokescreen. You said that many are true believers but some just pay lip service but use numerology as a sort of signature. That actually aligns well with an argument put forth by Miles Mathis, that a lot of the numerology is just a way for them to put their signature on it and also to signal to others &#39;in the know&#39; that the event is &#39;one of ours.&#39; Here is a relevant paper on this: <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/occult.pdf">http://mileswmathis.com/occult.pdf</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in your opinion about it. Feel free to PM me if you don&#39;t want to have the discussion out in the open. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i havent read this befroe, im going to take a look, im not worried about it being public at all, though this is a bit longer than what i can tear through at the moment.
ill do a quick gloss over it and let you know what i think of the first few pages in a few minutes.</p>

<p>okay right off the bat, he gets in to the rosicrucians and masons, so he is on track with that for sure.
the society i am a part of is very very closely linked to the freemasons, i know a few master masons who have confirmed that elements of our ritual do in fact cross over (of our founders 2/3&#39;s were masons before or became them later)</p>

<p>within the freemasons there are quite a few sub groups. see here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_bodies#/media/File:Structure_of_Masonic_appendant_bodies_in_England_and_Wales.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_bodies#/media/File:Structure_of_Masonic_appendant_bodies_in_England_and_Wales.jpg</a></p>

<p>now people who buy in to the illuminati stuff are not wrong, they are just a century or two late. they were in fact a sub group of Freemasons back in the 15th or 16th century. do they still exist? i doubt it, does an equally secret group that likely does the same thing? almost definitely.</p>

<p>if you want to look at the occult as it links to free masons and other secret societies, start looking at the rosicrucians (they are still active, they have a website for recruitment, ive pondered joining actually) and the O.T.O</p>

<p>both found here (<a href="https://www.rosicrucian.org/">https://www.rosicrucian.org/</a>) and here (<a href="http://www.oto-canada.org/">http://www.oto-canada.org/</a>)
these are actually real organizations that do still practice.</p>

<p>now both of these groups are considered high society, both have extensive involvement with numerology and Kabbalah. the OTO was another small group similar to the Illuminati (to a degree a revival of the ideas) it was for a time headed by Alister Crowley, the self professed beast, and wickedest man alive. crowley is one of the biggest names involved with high ceremonial magick, numerology, and kabbalah.</p>

<p>his favorite was sex magick based orgies (my kind of man) he was known to have relations and &quot;ceremonies&quot; with several high &quot;ranking&quot; people (there is even a story that links the bush family to these rituals which makes a lot of sense when you consider they are all members of skull and bones, and the whole bohemian grove thing)</p>

<p>the idea of the numbers of significance also treads back in to ancient holidays, festivals and solar alignments.
you see elements of this stuff pop up in things like the 4 blood moons conspiracy with isreal, the cults of Saturnalis and the kiddie porn investigations and other.</p>

<p>our Gregorian calendar is one of the only ones that is not based on the lunar cycles, if you have noticed many of these rather questionable events just so happen to go down during or just after a new moon or full moon and that should not be ignored.</p>

<p>in the same way a person who believes in astrology listens to their astrologist when they planning their month, the people who are pushing these events along are also setting them up to fall on these dates.</p>

<p>just look at this years full moons for example and remember a full moon lasts 3 days with the calander date being the middle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. No rush. I don&#39;t think you can really gloss it in the first few pages. Take your time, and if you don&#39;t get to it, so be it. I think you&#39;ll find it very interesting and worthwhile. By the way, in <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/unabomber.pdf">his paper on the Unabomber,</a> Miles makes the following claim when discussing Gerald Gardner:  &quot;While Crowley hid behind “magick”, Gardner hid behind the Wiccan movement, which he founded in 1954. I showed you in my Tate/Manson paper that the Intelligence communities love to hide behind Satanism and magick and the
occult. I suggested you ignore these feints as purposeful dead-ends. Satanism works as perfect cover for Intelligence, since most researchers love to be diverted into it: it is much sexier than the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>And <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/tate.pdf">here is the link</a> to the Tate/Manson paper he mentions.  </p>

<p>While Crowley hid behind “magick”, Gardner hid behind the Wiccan movement, which he founded in 1954</p>

<p>they are the same thing one is simply a continuation of the other. i to this day identify myself as a &quot;pagan&quot; i wouldn&#39;t call myself wiccan because the law of threes makes no sense within the frame work presented.</p>

<p>satanism frankly does not exist. the whole idea of satan is christian, the gods and entities these groups worship predate the very concept of satan by 1000&#39;s of years.</p>

<p>a great example is Palymara, the original temple there was to Ba&#39;al who was also known by the name Beezelebub. only a few months ago a mock up of the Arch of Palymara was set up in london and in NY <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36070721">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36070721</a> </p>

<p>this stuff is all around us, hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p>if you are interested in learning a lot about the symbolism being used &quot;the secret teachings of all ages&quot; is a really good resource you can usually pick up pretty easily on amazon or a book store that covers several different cultural traditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. To what extent do you think TPTB really believe in this stuff, and to what extent do they just use it to manipulate others or use it as a smokescreen? Like for example, do you think the guys at the very very top believe in it? Or could you assign some percentage to the people who really believe vs. the people who just use it. </p>

<p>Also is there any form of child abuse involved in these rituals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from my experience id say its probably a 60/40 split in true believers/lip service.</p>

<p>as for child abuse nothing that i am aware of, however when you dig in to some of the older cults im pretty sure their is. human sacrifice is certainly not off the table, and tend to focus on youth, purity etc. so im sure in the dark corners it does happen.</p>

<p>most of these groups are focusing on ancient roman/greek and other cults that were on the fringes of those empires. i have not really looked at that angle of the older cults and such frankly because i have a feeling how dark that rabbit hole gets and don&#39;t really want to venture down it.</p>

<p>our organization never goes much beyond hooded robes and repeating ancient languages and mock ritual. most lower level ones don&#39;t really cross in to anything &quot;real&quot; generally. things like fraternities and the freemasons are sort of laying the ground work to find the more serious sects. think of them as the elementry school introduction, rosicrucians/o.t.o would be your middle school, and then you learn about the real big leagues so to speak.</p>

<p>he touches on crowley, but calls him a satanist, which imho having studied quite a bit of his work is a bit too simplistic, i highly recommend a reading of &quot; the book of the law&quot; i think it is one of his better texts that help sort of get inside the head of the sort of people we are talking about.  <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm</a></p>

<p>much of this appears to be simple gibberish to the non-initiated, the reactions of people who are and are not in the know to what is presented is quite different based on their knowledge of symbolism and is a very good way to gauge how in the know some one really is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first appearance of 777 was published anonymously in 1909 after Crowley had written it from memory in just a week. An introduction to one edition by &quot;Frater N∴&quot; states that Crowley may have published it anonymously because it was taken from a Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn manuscript that was obligatory for initiates to memorise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has gotten &quot;routine&quot; where this group (can&#39;t actually say because of political correctness, race card, etc.) escalates from protest into madness. WHY do police allow this? The protesters are NOT acting as any other protesting group does. No other protesters exhibit this amount of violence as the burning of cities, massive looting, shutting down of bridges and streets that create havoc for thousands, etc. Police are under orders to do &quot;crowd control&quot; a specific way, but things have changed over the years and so their policies need to be adjusted accordingly. When the riots are expected in particular, and when protests start escalating, &quot;the big guns&quot; need to be called in. This can be water hoses, tear gas, more specialist police types as National Guard, etc.
This protesting group needs to be taught that when they disagree with something, protest in a way to get attention to their problem, but they have no right to go over the line into insane criminal behavior as killing cops, burning down cities, looting stores (which will many times destroy small businesses and their owners lives) or even prevent people from living their lives, by blocking streets and bridges. I believe if police were allowed to respond to these riots accordingly, many of those participating in them will stop. This will leave the continuing riots with a much smaller group of those too ignorant and unwilling to learn proper civilized behavior and will be able to be corralled quicker and dealt with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That it the same thing I am here to find answers to. Apart from the fact that it was reported that there were multiple shooters who ambushed the police penning them in with gunfire from high up, I am having trouble believing that a lone gunman could have fired on police from the top of a building and actually made it out of said building without being met by the scores of police below. I mean how many exits were there for this shooter to have made it out of a building and proceed on foot to take out more police? The police were there literally seconds after the first shots were fired. Their first protocol would have been to completely surround the building, yet this one guy got out to continue a gunfight with police, which he also escaped from. When has that ever happened before?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chaos started when at least two snipers fired from an elevated position on police officers minutes before 9 p.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), Brown said. He called it an &quot;ambush-style&quot; shooting.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe that these suspects were positioning themselves in a way to <em>triangulate on these officers from two different perches</em> in garages in the downtown area, and planned to injure and kill as many law enforcement officers as they could,&quot; he told a news conference earlier — noting that some victims were shot in the back.</p>

<p>Other suspects might still be at large. &quot;We&#39;re hopeful that we have got everybody, but we don&#39;t know that for sure,&quot; Rawlings told NBC&#39;s TODAY.</p>

<p>He said the <strong>suspects in custody</strong> were &quot;being pretty tight-lipped,&quot; but their motives were clear. &quot;It&#39;s simple ... they wanted to kill police officers. And sadly, they did.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying it is or isn&#39;t a false flag, but AFAIK there hasn&#39;t been any info released on how they identified the suspect. Also, a bomb/explosive device doesn&#39;t always mean that someone is turned into a completely unrecognizable pile of mush to be lethal. The rapid compression from the concussive force of the blast can rupture organs, blood vessels and cause lots of internal mess to all the squishy bits to be lethal even without having enough pressure to cause  dismemberment or have shrapnel running through you. Considering the explosive didn&#39;t necessarily cause massive amounts of collateral damage to the point where logically everything would be utterly vaporized, I think it&#39;s safe to say that plausibly, yes, a small piece of plastic could survive. That doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t have other methods of identification too.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem that this has been the case throughout most of history, however.  History has <em>not</em> shown this idea to be the case.</p>

<p>Hoaxes happen.  Sure.  But people get killed <em>for real</em>, and often.</p>

<p>Either way.  Really doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>You think people weren&#39;t killed?  Fine.  I imagine some haven&#39;t been killed, but I know many are and have been killed.</p>
