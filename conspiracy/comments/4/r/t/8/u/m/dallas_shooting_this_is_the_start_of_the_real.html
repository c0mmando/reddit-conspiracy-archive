       From what I heard, it's a vendetta against cops because they are targeting black people. This is retribution. But it's more than what the Bernie Sander morons are doing. I loved Bernie, but when he endorsed Hillary in order to keep Trump from winning, I was like, this needs to burn down. And I don't endorse Trump either. None of the above actually, not anymore.

       The system does indeed need to come down, but what happened in Dallas wasn't any sort of citizen uprising.  It was a black ops cointelpro false flag attack set up by TPTB themselves to A) get heat off of Shillary Cunton and her criminal activities w/The Clinton Foundation, and B) the state attempting to confiscate guns yet again.

       Can't disagree with that one.  At this point, the cops are very much the enemy of the citizenry.  They are an arm - an extension - of the evil that the state machine has become.  They do the bidding of the enemy of the people...so yeah.  They have indeed very much become the enemy of the people as well.

       I don't really think it's very fair to say "it's all hearsay".  It's a lot more than just hearsay.  There's been more than enough evidence throughout history to strongly link what took place in Dallas with all the many established false flag attacks that have taken place for political purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the ducks are lining up in a nice row on this event and the chicanery and fuckery started running amok almost immediately - very much like all the other contrived events of the past that TPTB have used to heavily manipulated the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we know
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what happened?  No.  Of course not.  However, I think it can be safe to say that some of us have at least a pretty good if general view that this was not some sort of organic event that just happened "because black people hate white people" or some dumb, divisive bullshit like that.  What happened seems pretty heavily orchestrated to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no.  It's not all hearsay at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not arguing with you here at all, by the way.

       Well, I can't disagree with you on the build up. And based on the history of fuckery that the "leaders" of this country have been up to I wouldn't put it past them. It's a bit too convienent to say the least. The guy was up there saying he/she was killing white cops in retaliation for that black dude who was shot by that white cop a few days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just meant that I need more info before I put a stamp on it. I can see this as an attempt to try to disarm the public. As much as I hate that guns are all over the place in America, we have little choice due to the people who run this country. If it was nice and cool, like Iceland, then it would be all good, but this country is run by motherfuckers of the worst ilk.

       I was speaking with a Korean war vet today and he was saying that this is only going to get worse. I have to agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all good, we are still cool. No worries. Personally, I wish this shooting sparked a million people to march on DC with guns in hand.

       Why put any stamp on it, however?  Just say it was an unfortunate event that was likely the result of PTB fuckery.  I think that's a safe enough, nebulous enough, accurate enough stamp to put on it without feeling that you have to get too much more specific and yet still having a decent idea of what an event actually was.

       This country is definitely that, but I'm not even sure Iceland's all that great, to be honest with you.  Perhaps I'm hyper cynical about state governments, but I wouldn't doubt that the government of Iceland is cool because the citizens have been completely defanged and declawed so nobody does anything to each other over there.  If  the government of Iceland
       <em>
        just

       so happened to want to fuck its citizens over, then the people would have a tough time fighting back.

       I've been studying up on Iceland. I'm a fiction writer and I'm working on a dystopian scifi novel. Iceland is the last free place in the world in my story and I based that off of the fact that they have jailed their corrupt people and have been fairly neutral after WWII. It seems like a great place, other than the fact that it's fuckin cold all year round.

       Iceland really cold all year round?  I heard somewhere that the reason they called it Iceland is because they didn't want marauders going there thinking it was the lush, beautiful, generally green place it is. - i.e. trying to keep people out.

       It's green, but it's also like 50F to 60F in the summer. lol. So, yeah not frozen, but it's not exactly warm. Lots of green too. Based on my research, that place rocks for many reasons. Costs about as much to live there as it does in Oregon, and I don't mean Portland, but like Eugene or Salem. They have the cleanest food in the world. They are the second longest living people in the world behind the Japanese. They have geothermal heating all year round so most of the roads stay ice free. They have some of the cleanest air. Tons of seafood (great fishing) and lamb. They have around 320K people, so a small community and people can be on the same page. They seem to be logical in how they deal with politics. They threw fruit in masse when they found out their president had a shell company from the panama papers and made him resign. I'm sure I'm missing a few things, but that's pretty cool to me.

       I don't even know what a "liberal" or "conservative" is.  Those are stupid tags that TPTB have indoctrinated impressionable citizens to believe in and give credence to in order for them to believe the whole, stupid "two party" narrative that
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       doesn't exist in the first place and is all part of one club that
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       not in - and that I'm not in and no pleb is in.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that I have exactly zero idea what you're talking about or referring to because I've never payed enough attention to a "liberal" or a "conservative" to know what they even are in the first place.

       I'm assuming you meant to post something else, as this sentence is not grammatically correct.  "I'm sorry that I thought your view were anti liberal"?  Is that what you meant to say?

      <p>
       Regardless, it doesn't matter what you try to label it as.  Like I said above, I have no idea what those labels are, as I've never payed attention to them or bothered to look up what they are or what they mean.  Call it whatever you want.

       Not saying what the cop did was right to shoot him when reaching for his wallet however, who's to say the guy didn't say he had a gun that he can legally carry, then immediately reach for his wallet. When carrying a gun at a police stop, you need to say you are armed and allow the officer to proceed from there. Supposedly the guy was a known gang member also which doesn't help this case. Now, did the cop need to shoot him? Probably not. Are cops a little trigger happy? Sure. But when a man who says he's armed reaches for his wallet where his gun may be without the officers consent to do so, well then you have another death by officer

       The system does indeed need to come down, but what happened in Dallas wasn't any sort of citizen uprising.  It was a black ops cointelpro false flag attack set up by TPTB themselves to A) get heat off of Shillary Cunton and her criminal activities w/The Clinton Foundation, and B) the state attempting to confiscate guns yet again.
