<p>Even a small wastebasket fire could bring down the AT&amp;T building in Nashville, TN.  Because steel framed buildings are vulnerable to collapse of any small heat fluctuations from within the building.  This is sceince.</p>

Firemen&#39;s actions are based on scientific evidence, they act according to fire safety manuals that haven&#39;t been altered as a reaction to 9/11, which if it is legitimate, should. According to the official narrative, steel-reinforced highrises should now potentially collapse as a result of fires. This changes everything. Of course it won&#39;t actually change anything, because people realize that what happened on 9/11 is not what was told on the news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should google all the new NYC building codes that were enacted after 9-11 to prevent any new structures from also collapsing in a like manner. There were about ten of them and they all concerned more lighted exit signs, wider stairwells.... but surprisingly, not one had anything to do with using unmeltable office fire steel. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert but it seems making steel that melts at basically room temp is a bad idea.  </p>

I&#39;m surprised they don&#39;t just go back to something more reliable like concrete because concrete is stronger than steel.
