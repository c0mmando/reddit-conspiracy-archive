        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>

<p>During his Freshman year at Georgetown University, Bill Clinton received a “B” in a demanding History course taught by a professor named Carroll Quigley. Clinton soon became enamored with this Harvard-educated professor, and years later mentioned the man as a major influence on him during his acceptance speech at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A76LFGtWhRQ">1992 Democratic Convention.</a> Quigley was brilliant. The man held three Harvard degrees, taught at Princeton and Harvard, and then settled at Georgetown for two and a half decades. During this time, he served as a consultant for the Defense Department, Navy, and other government organizations. Quigley was well connected, and never denied being part of what he termed the “Anglo-American establishment.” I give these background details so you know that this man is an authority - perhaps <em>the</em> authority - when it comes to analyzing the development of modern Western civilization.</p>

<p>Quigley published a famous 1,300 page book called <em>Tragedy and Hope</em> that traces the history of the West from the end of the 19th century through 1963. Copies of the book were actually destroyed and censored soon after it was published due to the sensitive information it reveals. Quigley wasn’t afraid to name names, and discussed the trend towards Globalism (i.e. a more centralized planetary financial and political structure) decades before this development became (relatively) common knowledge. </p>

<p><em>Tragedy and Hope</em> contains information about the true nature of global power relations that can help Red Pillers better understand how the world functions. This type of knowledge is invaluable as we move into an era with increasing tension between Globalists and Nationalists. </p>

<p><strong>THE RISE OF GLOBALISM</strong></p>

<p>From Rome to the Third Reich, there have always been people who want to consolidate political, economic, and military power into a centralized (i.e. “Global”) system. Indeed, the story of Globalism is as old as civilization itself. For the purposes of this post, though, we’ll start in the 1920s and trace how this movement towards centralization impacts people in the modern world. During the 1920s, Quigley writes,  “The powers of financial capitalism”  attempted &quot;to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.” (324) Remember: that’s a guy on the inside writing that - not a “conspiracy theorist.” </p>

<p>Quigley explains that then (and now) the top people in American and English finance and politics formed a single network unbounded by “outdated&quot; ideas like national sovereignty. These transnational business/social circles eventually took on a more concrete form when British aristocrat Alfred Milner and various associates founded the first Round Table group in 1919. Milner recruited various powerful people in England to the Round Table, and would draft the top kids out of Oxford as well and gradually teach them how the Game of empire is played. Milner was also a close friend of British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who made a fortune exploiting diamond miners in South Africa. After Rhodes died, much of his wealth was used to fund the group’s operations. Milner and Rhodes were early Globalists. Quigley explains that they both “sought to unite the world…in a federal structure around Britain.&quot; To actualize this goal, the men accrued &quot;secret political and economic influence behind the scenes” and wrestled &quot;control of the journalistic, educational, and propaganda agencies” (1) of England and America. </p>

<p>Indeed, Milner was quite open about his preference for a Global government run by Anglo-American elites. Wikipedia states: “Right until the end of his life, Lord Milner would call himself a ‘British race patriot’ with grand dreams of a global imperial parliament, headquartered in London…” (2) Round Table groups were formed in every British territory and dependency, and also in the United States. The Council on Foreign Relations - a top American foreign policy think tank - was originally set up as the U.S. wing of Milner and Rhodes’ quest for global dominance. This network heavily influenced university chair appointments, media outlets, and the English and American national governments via domination of each country’s central banking apparatus. </p>

<p>This ultra wealthy Globalist set was (and is) dead set against national sovereignty (especially in America), since strong and independent countries refuse to be assimilated into feudal systems and central banking scams. Indeed, U.S. Admiral Chester Ward, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations for over 20 years, wrote in 1975 that the organization’s goal is “submergence of U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful one-world government.&quot; He continued, &quot;In the entire CFR lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as ‘America First.’” (3) This claim may at first seem incredible, but this is the former Judge Advocate of the Navy talking here. Ward came to disagree with the Council’s goals and eventually distanced himself from the group. </p>

<p><strong>GLOBALISM IN WORLD WAR II</strong></p>

<p>We are taught an idealized version of the Second World War in school that leaves out many important facts, especially concerning the role Globally-minded industrialists and financiers played in the rise of Nazi Germany. Even before I was awake, Hitler’s rise seemed odd. The Germans were so broke and indebted in the 1920s and early 30s that people were starving. Inflation famously forced people to use wheel borrows of cash just to buy simple products like milk and butter. Hitler came to power in 1933, and in just six years built one of the fiercest fighting forces the world has ever seen. Where the hell did he get the money to do this? And how did he get it so quickly?</p>

<p>As it turns out, Hitler’s Germany was built on American investment capital. Quigley explains that U.S. banks purposefully suffocated the German economy during the Weimar Republic era (the brief democratic period between World War I and Hitler) by raising interest rates and cutting back on loans to German businesses. This group preferred to do business with a government that would invest in a lucrative military build up (enter Hitler). 
Henry Ford, for example, did so much business with Hitler that he was awarded (and accepted) a top Nazi model in 1938. General Motors also sold millions of cars to Germany throughout Hitler’s reign. The president of GM’s German division, James D. Mooney, mentions in his journal that he practiced his best sieg heil before meeting with Hitler to secure lucrative contracts in 1934. (4) And that’s just touching the surface. Germany needed special tetraethyl lead gasoline in order to fuel its air force, but couldn’t produce any domestically. American company Standard Oil shipped massive amounts of this fuel to Germany in 1938, and also taught Nazi scientists a way to produce a synthetic form. The significance of this transfer of technical know-how cannot be understated; many people believe that Germany could not have formed an offensive fighting force without tetraethyl lead gasoline. </p>

<p>These actions weren’t illegal - just opportunistic businessmen looking to turn a profit. However, Prescott Bush (W’s grandfather) was caught laundering money for the Nazis <em>during the war.</em> Bush was president of The Union Banking Corporation, which was seized in 1942 by the federal government under the Trading With the Enemy Act. This company was providing a safe haven for the wealth of a Nazi industrialist named Fritz Thyssen who was a key early backer of the Nazi party. There’s more to go into here, but the point is that a transnational class of elites profited from the rise and eventual destruction of Hitler. Hitler woke up to what was happening, but was powerless to do anything as War had already broken out. </p>

<p><strong>GLOBALISM TODAY</strong></p>

<p>Globalism is all about centralizing power, resources, and control in a small group of people. I mentioned the Round Table groups in England and a small Group of American industrialists that were able to spread their tentacles out far beyond their country’s borders in order to maximize profits. This trend continues today. The Clinton foundation, the European Central Bank, the United Nations etc. All corrupt, all looking to break down sovereign people’s Frame in order to take their money. Don’t give in to Globalism. Freedom is found in national sovereignty (i.e. separating from the Globalists), not in being a blind member of the Herd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good job putting globalism into the context of the ambitions of turn of the 20th century industrialist Cecil Rhodes (rhodesia/s.african mining interests), and his connection with Milner.  This actually explains a lot, filling in a piece of the puzzle connecting to the early american industrialist dynasties and thereby, to the rev. war and beyond into history.</p>

<p>Also good job in demonstrating that financial climate of preNazi Germany as created by the establishment which was abusing them into a mass social movement based on anger, betrayal and desperation.</p>

<p>Hopefully the rest of you here read it like I did: that these preconditions of preNazi germany parallel the current climate in america.  As a cautionary tale.  Well done, sir.  For this excellent piece I&#39;m giving you gold.</p>

<p>BTW <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-Hope-History-World-Time/dp/094500110X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1467584637&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tragedy+and+hope">Tragedy and Hope</a> has been on my reading list, ever since I found out it was written by Clinton&#39;s prof and was &#39;conspiracyish&#39;.  Also, refreshing to see the matrix/truther use of <em>&#39;redpill&#39;</em> that isn&#39;t in the context of tricking women into sleeping with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another step in sabotaging Germany&#39;s dominance in European economics. Like WW1 and WW2, those actions were based around Germany&#39;s dominance in economic trade. Germany was the sole owner of debt in the EU, especially after the Ukrainian coup de&#39;tat that had the US aid Germany in the seizure of gold from Ukrainian banks.</p>

<p>WW1 was deliberate in destroying the German agreement in the middle-East that would have massive oil claims go to Germany within range of its railroad to Bagdad. WW2 was started because Britain didn&#39;t like Germany&#39;s anti-colonialism mentality and their ability to barter and turn European nations away from the crown.</p>

<p>Britain is a dying monarchy. And they did it to themselves by destroying European nationalism and unity. They are in bed with the devil and have been for a long time. That devil being the jewish banking community of greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post!</p>

<p>I take issue with a couple of your assumptions, though.</p>

<p>&quot;Hitler woke up to what was happening, but was powerless to do anything as War had already broken out.&quot;</p>

<p>Poor guy, just trapped in the machine.  So sad... You know, he had no choice but to order his troops to invade Albania, Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Great Britain(Guernsey), Hungary, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldavia, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Russia, San Marino, Slovakia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia etc?  </p>

<p>RIGHT?</p>

<p>WTF dude?</p>

<p>Germany was punished financially for a reason after WWI.  They were unpredictable aggressive and dangerous. The fact that American financiers were involved in the buildup of the German army prior to the breakout of the war doesn&#39;t make the financiers complicit in Nazi Germany&#39;s actions.  They&#39;re just selling money.</p>

<p>However, I do agree with you on the the Bush family.  Treacherous fucks.</p>
