        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">261</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-07-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/timoppenheimer.html">timoppenheimer</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been police shootings throughout the past decades, and body and cell phone cameras have existed for years if not decades. The media can start a campaign about minorities being killed by the police at any time, and yet it starts right now. </p>

<p>BLM is sponsored by Soros. Clinton is sponsored by Soros. The media is sponsored/controlled by Soros. Clinton is the chosen candidate. When public outrage began to build over the decision not to recommend charges for Clinton, the media (FB, twitter, plus mainstream) started running with police shootings. For the next few weeks, every time a citizen is killed by a police officer, the media will try to gin up outrage to distract from Clinton. This will only work if no one notices, but we have noticed. I have noticed.</p>

<p>Tell your friends. If you hear someone talking about the police shootings, immediately agree that police shootings are terrible, add that stat about the cops killing more Americans during the Iraq war than there were casualties, and then change the topic. Point out that there have been police shootings for years, but now that the public is upset about Clinton getting a pass on obeying espionage laws, the media is reviving the police shooting stories. </p>

<p>The police shooting story is a perfect story for the media in this case. The &quot;villain&quot; (police) is effectively immune, in our system, to backlash other than violent uprising; the systems that govern police do not have adequate feedback loops to change the rules that dictate police behavior and immunity. Furthermore, the BLM groups can make dog-whistle attacks on white people, so that a good deal of the outrage gets dispersed in the interracial fighting. Meanwhile, the public gets the impression that the news is either (a) nothing going on, or (b) black people are being victimized, we must organize! The community organizing turns into riots because no feedback loops exist to change the system, and the story can be repeated in a few months time, after more infrastructure has been destroyed by out-of-state looters. </p>

<p>Edit: metal_up_your_ass has pointed out that it could be linked to summer (potentially either by being scheduled like seasons, or by dint of the large numbers of young people on the streets in the summer time, or perhaps some other link). This is a point worth investigating. </p>

<p>I have a question, for anyone who knows something about police bureaucracy. Couldn&#39;t the current (nominally liberal) president end this whole thing by forcing police to discipline officers via citizen panels, like how juries are done? Just draw some names every time there&#39;s a police brutality charge. I think Obama could end this by threatening to pull all Federal funding to police stations if they refused to give civilians oversight in police misconduct cases. Anyone who knows more, please share. </p>

<p>Eh, gun control laws in America are inherently flawed unless they&#39;re on a federal level. City and statewide laws do literally nothing because you can drive twenty minutes away and buy a gun in a state or a city with lax gun control. You can&#39;t really draw conclusions using that. Places like the UK where things are done on a national level have next to zero gun related crimes. But at this point there&#39;s just way too many guns in the US to even bother trying to get something similar done. Even if laws are passed it wont do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop using logic.  This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, not a serious conspiracy research website.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believed that surveillance is real, then Hillary&#39;s e-mails were known about the entire time.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believed NSA whistleblower William Binney, then the NSA &amp; FBI had/have full real-time &amp; historical access to all electronic communications from all Americans stored in Utah.  Including every &quot;deleted&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; e-mail from Hillary.  And they had it the entire time.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> paid any attention, Comey is the ex-Bush Administration lackey who inherited 9/11 FBI Director Robert Mueller&#39;s 9/11 FBI secrets.  Repeat:  <em>9/11 FBI secrets.</em></p>

<p>Did <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> think Comey was a good guy?</p>

<p>Why does Obama appoint <em>only</em> ex-Bush Administration officials to run intelligence &amp; military agencies?</p>

<p>Does <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> think 9/11 is smaller than Hillary&#39;s e-mails?</p>

<p>Does <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have the insight to recognize that Hillary&#39;s &quot;lost&quot; e-mails are still in-play as a conspiracy factor that can be used to link her to <em>anything</em> including Cheney nuking Los Angeles? Or to the upcoming Global 9/11?</p>

<p>The NSA refused to give Hillary a secure Blackberry because &quot;it cost too much.&quot;  Was Hillary being set-up the entire time?  She&#39;s dumbfuck enough to not recognize that her <em>domestic</em> enemies could surveil her and set her up.</p>

<p>Those &quot;lost&quot; e-mails are exactly like Nixon&#39;s 18 ½-minute gap.  Read between the lines on that one, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Those missing e-mails are a much bigger story.  And according to Russ Baker, Watergate was a coup.</p>

<p>Why is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so primitive?</p>

<p>The entire premise that &quot;Clinton controls the FBI&quot; is idiotic if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> knew the story of Louis Freeh &amp; the Clintons in the 1990s.</p>

<p>If anything, Freeh set-up Bill Clinton with OKC on behalf of Team Bush to permanently shut Bill&#39;s mouth for 9/11 (which makes OKC part of 9/11, and there&#39;s plenty of overlapping players).</p>

<p>If anything, Hillary was not blackmailed by OKC/PATCON like Bill was, thus Hillary can use OKC/PATCON against Comey, who is a secret-keeper.</p>

<p>But Comey has Inslaw aces to use against Hillary (Reddit Gold for any anti-Hillary Redditor who knows what I&#39;m referring to, and the specific initials are C. H.), and the stakes are much higher than prison or &quot;treason&quot; for Hillary.</p>

<p>But <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are just drooling, hysterical Clinton-haters who can&#39;t see that the Big Picture is way beyond murdering the Clintons, or crashing a plane into the Capitol Dome and exterminating the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>If anything, the Clintons are so arrogantly stupid (or stupidly arrogant) that they deserve prison.  But the Comey/Bush team will give us all much worse than prison.  The Clintons are getting set-up for a military coup.  And so are you.</p>

<p>And Hillary will be dead by springtime, with no more presidents or elections.</p>

<p>A lot of people here know that.  And that&#39;s exactly what they want.</p>

Downplaying the issue, making false claims (such as that Clinton&#39;s email issues are somehow equivalent to Colin Powell&#39;s), and telling the public that there is absolutely no reason why they should even <em>consider</em> further investigation into Clinton&#39;s past, her term as Sec of State, Whitewater, emails... you get the idea.

<p>The publishing bias when there are many news outlets is that publishers take whatever they&#39;re presented with, because if they ignore it another paper will pick it up. Today, with 6 corporations controlling most of the national media, publishers can decline stories. Gamergate and the GamesJournoPros list showed the ease with which 50-100 reporters can collude; is it really such a stretch to imagine that the editors could do something similar?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gamergate thing was so irritating to me that I barely paid attention to it. But I will definitely check it out. And now that you mention it it reminds me of this old story regarding a similar email list that a lot of the more leftist activist journalists used back in, say, 2006. They were quite obviously &quot;colluding&quot; (or, I&#39;m sure as they&#39;d put it, &quot;giving each other professional courtesy by sharing important stories and editorial advice&quot;.)</p>

<p>Thanks will take a peek at GG list. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two reasons they didn&#39;t just ghost it. First was that the email scandal is small compared to the Clinton Foundation scandal. Talking about the emails all the time is misdirection. Your focused on the small crime instead of the massive one. Second reason is that another popular liberal candidate was running this time. A lot of Liberals really liked Sanders an wanted him to have a chance. At first those Liberals just tried to brush off Hillary&#39;s email scandal. But when it became clear she was beating Sanders then suddenly Liberals wanted to talk about this scandal again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems as if there is a conspiracy to divide us racially. Every time a black man is shot by police it goes viral,  however more white people are shot by police on average. This isn&#39;t a problem that is racial in narrative, it&#39;s an issue of police use of deadly force. The Clinton&#39;s are a joke, they can be attributed to various suspicious &quot;suicide&#39;s&quot;, the Clinton foundation which stole millions in donations meant for Haiti, and not to mention the email scandal. Hillary is being promoted even though she pretty much stole the Democratic nomination, because they have dirt on her. She can be controlled.

Black men are anywhere between 7-21 times more likely to get shot by police. Get your facts straight before you start coming up with baseless theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I immediately thought we would have another national tragedy, or they would exploit something in the news to hide the Clinton controversy for a bit... I also thought it was weird the lady in Minnesota was so calm when your significant other was just shot multiple times, to give her credit who knows how you would act with a gun still pointed at you. But what about the 4yr. old with a gun that just got discharged into the car... You would expect her to be upset at least by the noise if she didn&#39;t understand what was going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deep state has shown its ugly head everywhere today.  People who I haven&#39;t spoken to in years have suddenly reappeared and argue like paid trolls.  It&#39;s likely they are now police or military psyop trolls.  White SJWs have told me to shut up about police brutality, and let black people speak for themselves.  Some other idiot started gangstalking me, by messaging me on multiple platforms to tell me &quot;blue lives matter, police lives matter, all lives matter.&quot;</p>

<p>The shooting in Dallas tonight is obviously the work of agent provocateurs.  I am not doubting the officers died, but it was likely the result of deep state planning, to scare people away from BLM protests and vigils.  They can&#39;t handle the fact that we are angry and willing to go into the streets.  They want to keep us caged in our jobs and our houses.  Then they can divide and conquer, like they have been.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about a race war.  This is far deeper than that.  They want everyone to feel powerless to the government.  Whether it is Clinton&#39;s acquittal on classified emails / Clinton Foundation, or the open season on black bodies by police officers, or agent provocateurs disrupting protest, they want us to feel divided, powerless, and fearful.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give them any time of day.  Don&#39;t listen to conservatives and trolls, just to &quot;hear them out.&quot;  They are paid representatives of the deep state, trying to program you to continue to be a slave of the murderous system running our country, rather than thinking about how to make our society more humane, or holding the high-level criminals accountable.</p>
