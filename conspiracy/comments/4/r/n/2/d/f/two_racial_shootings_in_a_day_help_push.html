    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think the agenda is bigger than getting Hillary in power. To me it seems they&#39;re inciting a race war, with full on rioting. That&#39;s how it looks to me. If you consider Trump&#39;s narrative, the consistent persecution of black people in the prison system, then all these videos of black people <em>literally</em> being executed by white cops with the full protection of the law, it looks very much like division by race and making people seem so powerless and downtrodden that they react with violent disorder... And then when they have us fearing and fighting each other? Who knows. Martial law? More cop powers? It&#39;s no coincidence that it is beginning to happen in Europe too. A sudden surge in hate crimes and racism in the UK, persecution of Muslims... It&#39;s surely part of the same objective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my thought also.  I have seen this mentioned in more then one place and it seems very plausible.  Honestly both cities they picked for the RNC and DNC both will bottle neck and prevent people from leaving the city in general.  Cleveland has a shit load of construction every where that everyone here knew they weren&#39;t going to finish, and Philly has taken most of their trains off the track from a mysterious stress fracture that was missed in their routine checkups and just found. Not to mention both cities have some big impoverished areas with a good amount of cop hate. </p>

<p>Someone else is speculating that with these big groups caught above ground MSM will create the storyline and police will heat up conflict trying to herd these people who may just want to go home.  This is what happened when the main riot sparked in Mondawmin, Baltimore and this is what ended up declaring Marshal law.  But it seemed like over kill honestly, especially if you were watching the live helicopter feed of it.</p>

<p>This also may be a wild speculation, but just a thought.  The Cavs winning the second to last game didn&#39;t make sense, something was up with the Golden State, a heard some few floating comments about a possible rigging. But, when Cleveland did win and we had our parade of 1.3+ million people in the city (which is the most we have had in a while, our St. Patties day parade is our yearly biggest at half of that gathering).  I think it was to test our public transport out of the city when dealing with huge crowds or to map foot traffic to leave the city.  Some interviewed people said it took 4/6 hours to get back to their cars.  </p>

<p>Just some thoughts though.</p>

<p>Same thing happened in KC when the Royals won. Cars were literally parked on sidewalks and pulled off onto ramp walls. People were so desperate to come to downtown to have a big party. It was a literal nightmare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps they wont stop until police are further militarized and privatized. You think there&#39;s brutality now, wait for that to happen. People ask, &quot;When will it all stop?!&quot; It won&#39;t ever stop, its just going to keep coming and coming like a boot stamping on a human face for all eternity. It wont stop even if all guns are banned. It wont stop even if the crimes are no longer committed against a single group of people. But there will be a standing private army that maims, kills, and jails indiscriminately. All races, creeds, genders, religions, dissenters, free thinkers, artists, in and outside of free speech zones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only reply on the persecution of Muslims, probably has a lot to do with the current behaviors of certain refugees coming into Europe.</p>

<p>Now, obviously the media picks and chooses what it will and will not show to the people and a lot of times, it&#39;s hyper-inflated. But if anything like this is actually happening in Europe, I can understand why people are bent out of shape:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FPXXHknv0g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FPXXHknv0g</a></p>

<p>As for the media airing these two shootings in America, it seems very clear to me that it&#39;s a way to get people&#39;s attention on something other than what is happening in the political sphere. And it&#39;s enough to ignite civil war among the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts on this are, I&#39;m not convinced there is a sudden crisis with sexual assaults being committed by migrants. At best it is hyper-inflated, at worst it is flat-out lies to (successfully) incite hatred.
I mean, the media would have us believe the migrants are sex-starved savages, yet Europe has had migration from these countries for decades and we know that simply isn&#39;t the case. So I ask myself, why all of a sudden would these migrants be unable to control themselves in their host country? An easier question to answer might be- What motive might the media have for claiming that these people are raping and assaulting native Europeans? We know their persecution would further a political objective, so is it a stretch of the imagination to think that fitting up a bunch of immigrants who can barely speak English with a crime might be incredibly easy and effective?</p>

<p>What I do know for sure is, I&#39;m a white guy who&#39;s lived in an area with a huge Muslim majority for about 8 years until recently, and I&#39;ve had nothing but positive experiences. Certainly there is not a high percentage of sex crimes committed by the immigrants who settle there so i cannot imagine why it would be different elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the &#39;sudden increase in sexual assaults&#39;? No. There has always been predominantly males seeking asylum, it&#39;s the nature of migration. And never before has there been stories of groups of foreign men roaming the streets believing they have the right to assault women due to their culture or the ignorance to believe they can. 
We used to be told that all these men were coming here, stealing our jobs and then sending the money earned back to their families living in their country. Remember that? Seems that isn&#39;t enough any more. Now these males coming to this country are also sex-starved predators stealing our women in order to get people&#39;s blood boiling. I don&#39;t buy it, I don&#39;t believe it.</p>

<p>No, why bother when it already happens every day. What I find more likely is that the media selectively picks and chooses when to pursue these every day occurrences, when it suits them.</p>

People die from police officers everyday in America, there are several thousand police-related deaths a year in America. Do you get it? Why are you just hearing about this now?</p>
