        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From back in January, but some (including Comey) perhaps forgot about it. I&#39;ll just leave this here:</p>

<p><a href="http://observer.com/2016/01/hillarys-emailgate-goes-nuclear/">Hillary’s EmailGate Goes Nuclear: Does the latest release of Hillary’s State Department emails include highly classified U.S. intelligence?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its information comes from a high-ranking source with direct access to Sudan’s top military and intelligence officials, and Mr. Blumenthal’s write-up repeatedly states the sources—there turn out to be more than one—are well-placed and credible, with excellent access. It’s the usual spytalk boilerplate when you want the reader to understand this is golden information, not just gossip or rumors circulating on the street, what professionals dismiss as “RUMINT.” Needless to add, this is generating a lot of talk in Sudan, where the media is asking about this shady affair—and how Mr. Blumenthal, who’s not exactly an old Africa hand, knew all about it.</p>

<p>In fact, the June 8, 2011 Blumenthal report doesn’t read like CIA material at all, in other words human intelligence or HUMINT, but very much like signals intelligence or SIGINT. (For the differences see here). I know what SIGINT reports look like, because I used to write them for the National Security Agency, America’s biggest source of intelligence. SIGINT reports, which I’ve read thousands of, have a very distinct style and flavor to them and Blumenthal’s write-up matches it, right down to the “Source Comments,” which smack very much of NSA reporting and its “house rules.”</p>

<p>But is this an NSA assessment? If so, it would have to be classified at least Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information, a handling caveat that applies to most SIGINT, and quite possibly Top Secret/SCI, the highest normal classification we have. In that case, it was about as far from Unclassified as it’s possible for an email to be.</p>

<p>No surprise, NSA is aflutter this weekend over this strange matter. <strong>One Agency official expressed to me “at least 90 percent confidence” that Mr. Blumenthal’s June 8 report was derived from NSA reports, and the Agency ought to be investigating the matter right now.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forgot the part were Sid wasn&#39;t a government employee, had no clearance and was expressly forbidden from joining the state department by as rumors have it Obama himself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s insubordination and theft of classified materials.</p>

<p>Frankly reading some of them sometimes sounds like he was in direct contact with the source or their handlers. That&#39;s running unauthorized spy missions for SoS...</p>

<p>Or maybe he was just cc: on the NSA reports which again needs to be looked in.</p>

<p>It ok that Hillary had access (as SoS you&#39;d expect that) but Sid absolutely shouldn&#39;t have, and he shouldn&#39;t have been practically briefing the SoS of the information himself. </p>

<p>In any event he was acting as if he was a state department employee...</p>

<p>If Hillary is president it&#39;s highly likely Sid will be getting a high level position in the government. </p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;re still wrong. Either way, you still haven&#39;t shown me anyone that defines &quot;free&quot; as &quot;paid for with taxes&quot; which was your original point. Who is being semantic now? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said before, that&#39;s not how it&#39;s paid for. I don&#39;t consider a tax as a  flat percentage of income as the poor getting a free ride, but you clearly don&#39;t care about being right or informed. I&#39;ll give you the last nonsensical word. That seems to be all you really care about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol it sounds more like youre the one concerned with the last word because Ive given you several different examples that a rational person could agree with. Ive said several times I agree that we should have tax paid education and healthcare. Ive said several times that Im only explaining how &quot;free shit&quot; isnt an irrational phrase to use when talking about these things and that we should just be honest. The whole reason that taxes are based on a rate instead of a flat # is because the rich are supposed to cover for the poor. And thats why people want there to be tax paid healthcare and education, so that the less fortunates expenses are supplemented by those better off. Which for the billionth time, I agree with. But again, for the billionth time, lets be honest about it. </p>

<p>I also think fighting for tax paid healthcare and education is the treating of the symptom instead of the cause, but thats an argument for another day.</p>

<p>Almost everything we pay taxes for is a shared communal thing, whether you agree with it or not. When it gets into things like education and healthcare people are hesitant because it isnt a communal thing, its direct. Some people treat their body terribly, I dont want to pay for that guy, but I do want to pay for the little girl with cancer whos family is poor. Some people go to school only for the check they get, some people go to school for inspirational dance theory, I dont want to pay for those people, but I do want to pay for an intelligent young man who is going into engineering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appropriate allocation of tax dollars, and perhaps a slight increase in <em>all</em> taxes - amounting to less than the average person pays for health insurance each year, and especially when you take deductibles and co-pays into account. And certainly less if you include what the average employer pays for the average employee. </p>

<p>Corporations in the United States have one of the highest <em>nominal</em> tax rates in the world - they love to bitch about it. Thing is, after deductions, subsidies, rebates, and shady accounting, many corporations pay an <em>effective</em> tax rate of 0%. I propose <em>cutting</em> corporate taxes, but eliminating ALL subsidies and deductions for businesses. Same for people really. Cut tax rates, eliminate deductions. </p>

If either dislikes the other then you go find a different doctor, same as you do now. The only difference is those who don&#39;t currently have the funds to pay a doctor right now would be able to see one.</p>

<p>The kicker to this argument is you can ask the nuttiest of republicans how they&#39;d feel about having their social security taken off the table for their own retirement and they flip their shit. Both systems are the exact same concept we&#39;re discussing - everyone pays into the system and everyone, at some point, gets to benefit from it. </p>
