       NASA Erased Original Moon Footage
      </p>
      <p>
       By Sarah Fleming, AP Science Writer November 17, 2014
      </p>
      <p>
       WASHINGTON â€“ "It's appalling that NASA didn't have the common sense to save perhaps the most important historical footage of the 20th century."
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA put a man on the moon but didn't have the sense to keep the original video of the live TV transmission. In an embarrassing acknowledgment, the space agency said that it erased the original Apollo 11 moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the videotape.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Hollywood is coming to the rescue. The studio wizards who restored "Casablanca" are digitally sharpening and cleaning up the ghostly, grainy footage of the moon landing, making it even better than what TV viewers saw on July 20, 1969. They are doing it by working from four copies that NASA scrounged from around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first batch of restored footage was released just in time for the 40th anniversary of the "one giant leap for mankind," and some of the details seem new because of their sharpness. Originally, astronaut Neil Armstrong's face visor was too fuzzy to be seen clearly. The upgraded video of Earth's first moonwalker shows the visor and a reflection in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The $230,000 refurbishing effort is only three weeks into a long project, and only 40 percent of the work has been done. But it does show improvements in four snippets: Armstrong walking down the ladder; Buzz Aldrin following him; the two astronauts reading a plaque they left on the moon; and the planting of the flag on the lunar surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nafzger said a huge search that began three years ago for the original moon tapes led to the "inescapable conclusion" that 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and taped over. The original videos beamed to Earth were stored on giant reels of tape that each contained 15 minutes of video. In the 1970s and '80s, NASA had a shortage of videotapes, so it erased 200,000 of them and reused them.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did NASA end up looking like a bumbling husband taping over his wedding video with the Super Bowl?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nafzger, who was in charge of the live TV recordings back in the Apollo years, said they were mostly thought of as data tapes. It wasn't his job to preserve history, he said, just to make sure the footage worked. In retrospect, he said he wished NASA hadn't reused the tapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside historians were aghast. "It's appalling that NASA didn't have the common sense to save perhaps the most important historical footage of the 20th century," said Rice University historian and author Douglas Brinkley. He noted that NASA saved all sorts of data and artifacts from Apollo 11, and it is "mind-boggling that the tapes just disappeared."
      </p>
      <p>
       The remastered copies may look good, but "when dealing with historical film footage, you always want the original to study," Brinkley said. Smithsonian Institution space curator Roger Launius, a former NASA chief historian, said the loss of the original video "doesn't surprise me that much. It was a mistake, no doubt about that," Launius said. "This is a problem inside the entire federal government. ... They don't think that preservation is all that important."
      </p>
      <p>
       Launius said federal warehouses where historical artifacts are saved are "kind of like the last scene of `Raiders of the Lost Ark.' It just goes away in this place with other big boxes."
      </p>
      <p>
       The company that restored all the Indiana Jones movies, including "Raiders," is the one bailing out NASA. Lowry Digital of Burbank, Calif., noted that "Casablanca" had a pixel count 10 times higher than the moon video, meaning the Apollo 11 footage was fuzzier than that vintage movie and more of a challenge in one sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's certainly a little better than the original," Launius said. "It's not a lot better." The Apollo 11 video remains in black and white. Inchalik said he would never consider colorizing it, as has been done to black-and-white classic films. And the moon is mostly gray anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neil Armstrong had the last word about the video from the moon: "I was just amazed that there was any picture at all."

       Because the landing craft looked like a second grade art project.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is our best engineering , capable of being blasted off of the earth and landing on the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at just the obvious fit and finish issues. I'm pretty sure you couldn't lift this gently with a fork lift and keep it from falling apart.

       Posting images like this as if they demonstrate what the lunar module was constructed from is disingenuous at best and outright misinformation and deliberate ignorance at worst.  This should give a better idea of what the construction of the module actually contained:

       Fair enough, I'm not an engineer so I trust the word of the hundreds of engineers who worked on the lander over the words of somebody who draws judgement from single photographs.

       Here is still some more additional information regarding the construction if you are interested, specifically regarding the refinement of the module (the attempts at making it lighter) here which seems to be what the OP has issue with:

       <p>
        By the end of 1965, Scrape and SWIP had pruned away 1,100 kilograms, providing a comfortable margin below the control weight limit. One of the more striking changes to come from this drive for a lighter spacecraft was the substitution of aluminum-mylar foil thermal blankets for rigid heatshields. The gold wrapping characteristic of the lander's exterior saved 50 kilograms. Many of these weight-reducing changes made the lander so difficult to fabricate, so fragile and vulnerable to damage, that it demanded great care and skill by assembly and checkout technicians. Structural components took on strange and complex shapes, requiring careful machining to remove any excess metal...

       I cannot know the motivation of some random other individual but in some cases insiders may  want to get a message out in any way they can without actually violating   their non disclosure agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example might be the obvious Photoshop job in the famous 5 frames from the 9/11 Pentagon attack where there are heavy black lines  outlining the foreground shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadows don't have heavy block outlines around them normally. every copy of the pictures show the same anomaly  It's a cry for help from an insider  or insiders who cannot otherwise  speak.  find your own set.  They're all the same. The originals were photoshopped

        Don't you think we could make a flat panel of sheet metal with proper fasteners spaced reasonably with nice tight joints rather than this crap with random gaps between very loose fitting panels.

      <p>
       They aren't "sheet metal panels".  Some research into what they actually are might be warranted so that in your future criticisms you at least use the correct terminology:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The foil is MLI - Multi-Layer Insulation, and it is actually pretty complex. Heat is transmitted in a vacuum only by radiation, the key to insulation is to reflect as much energy away as possible. The layers were designed to do this maximally, and the layers had only enough contact between them to maintain the integrity of the material - contact points create heat conduction, making them less effective. Thus it is very wrinkly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The black foil coverings are over the areas more exposed to heat from the attitude jets, visible just above them. The plume deflector below the jet directs heat away from there, but some extra protection must have been warranted. Since they are black, they are probably surfaced with graphite.
       </p>

       I remember thinking the same thing when seeing those pics for the first time. Looks like absolute crap. Wouldn't be able to withstand the tiniest amount of force or impact. It just makes no sense.
Then again, Kubrick would have been too smart to create a fake film with something looking that shitty. 2001:ASO proves that he damn well knows how to sell convincing spacecraft.

       This article - deliberately - fails to mention the most important part of  this.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA's "original moon footage" was never broadcast directly.
       <strong>
        Instead the NASA moon footage was projected onto a screen and the major television networks filmed that screen and broadcast the images from the screen "as live".
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, copies of this film-of-a-film broadcasted second generation footage survive, which is great, but the ORIGINAL first generation tapes were never made available for independent analysis, and never will be. Whether you believe the absurd story that NASA "lost" those tapes is up to you, but I would suggest that those tapes, if they were destroyed, were done so deliberately because they revealed things that NASA didn't want revealed.

       The article also deliberately seems to omit the fact that the original tapes from the other lunar landings are still readily available and that the 'missing tapes' only apply to the Apollo 11 mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be a tactic aimed at taking advantage of the gaps in knowledge that many conspiracy theorists have regarding the lunar landings.  Many times you hear people asking "why did we never go back" when in fact we have been there 6 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are mountains of third-party evidence for the lunar landings.  To post something like this as 'evidence' of some kind of cover-up both lacks adequate research into the tapes themselves as well as a gaping hole in knowledge regarding independent proof of the lunar landings.

       I spent a few years as a contractor technician for NASA.  We stored the tapes in a shed in the parking lot. It was air conditioned so not too bad. Those tapes are expensive so we rotated them. We would use whatever tapes are the oldest, degaus them and put a new label on for the new launch. Nothing nefarious about it.  By the time a tape was reused whatever it used to be was years ago.  My guess is that the original moon landing tapes were simply overwritten.  I would hope that they asked about it and were reassured that they were backed up somewhere.  And whoever was responsible sure isn't speaking up. Would you?  That would be the biggest "oh shit" moment ever.

       Hey, tapes are reusable.  Also they probably used new for the moon landing and wrote over them later when things were tight. I'm just guessing here. I don't actually know what happened to those tapes.  I worked with mostly NOAA launches.

       Tapes were very expensive back in that era. So expensive it was often cheaper for them to film off the screen via a 16mm or 35mm camera and print the resulting kinescope. The BBC almost erased all of Monty pythons shows but someone in the department called terry jones and the tapes were saved.

       There's more to it than this. My local PBS TV station has a local documentary about how they actually were the first station to broadcast Monty Python and were instrumental in having saved it. I think most of the stuff in this article is from after that. Before PBS was involved it was KERA that showed it. I'll try and find something online to support this.

       They never went to the moon. NASA is like your buddy who swears he time traveled to 2050, shows you some pics that look like he took them at a  studio, He can never prove it by going back, and no other human can do it 50 years later either. So what are the chances he can time travel? Same chances NASA can leave the earth. I doubt we can even leave earth's atmosphere, nevermind 200 miles out. A while back,  I Learned SOFIA, the Telescope mounted on a airplane can see further than Hubble, and is far more superior lens replica of Hubble...hmm.... are they just giving us doctored pictures from SOFIA? Is there anything in orbit? Google and facebook using balloons and drones to map out regions. Why resort to terrestrial data gathering if satellites exist?

       You could learn how simple it is to enter low earth orbit (even on accident) from a single high school class instruction. Yet you insinuate that we, as a relatively advanced society, are unable to even leave low earth orbit when we as the human race have been doing it reliably for 50 years.

       (a reputable site to add a UTM overlay to google maps) and find yourself a national park. Print out a copy of the map with UTM overlay so you can navigate the old fashioned way with a map and compass. Go to this national park, deep into some secluded area and notice when you have zero cellular service. Now go deeper. Turn on your GPS, and you will see it begin to "connect" to satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, your GPS unit is just a receiver, so you are not "connecting" in the traditional sense that you would understand. Our (our as in the United States' GPS system as created and maintained by the US DOD, used by every western civilian GPS receiver in the world) GPS satellites are constantly transmitting a 30-second, 1500bit digital message at 50bps at 1575.42mhz and a second identical signal at 1227.6mhz. This message is encoded with a PRN sequence that is different for each satellite. Any GPS receiver you purchase has the PRN codes installed already so that it can differentiate between all 32 satellites at any given time. Your GPS receiver, being a tiny computer, does "math stuffs" while taking the signal from 3+ separate satellites and computes it into coordinates X,Y, and Z. Using this information (if you bought a fancy one it will overlay the information on a built in map) you can plot the coordinates on your printed, internet sourced map. Then, you can use simple terrain identification to determine if said coordinates are accurate (if not, you likely don't know how to use a map, as those coordinates are accurate to within 100meters).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this would not be possible if these GPS satellites were not in low earth orbit. If we simply used google or facebook balloons as you put it, we would not have accurate coordinates (as said balloon is affected by wind and is in motion on the Z axis) not to mention it is a bad idea to have nuclear powered balloons.

       This is absolute BS! Ok, Im not arguing that the original footage is true and that man did land on the moon at the given date. But man has landed on the moon at some point. There is so much science and physics based on this that it is undeniable. There is a mirror on the moon that we shoot a laser at to check the distance.In my undergraduate and postgraduate,I worked with many astronomers, and they all know man landed on moon. In a science as pure as physics,where big money pharma or even big money at all doesnt corrupt the physicists,its hard to imagine why they would go along with "this conspiracy"! Also,serious thaught and effort is been put into a mission to Mars. Surely these brilliant scientists wouldnt put so much effort into something that they "know is not possible"!!

       Ask Virgin galactic guy why they cannot launch a rocket that NASA perfected in 1950. I mean Elon musk is landing fake rockets backwards on ship in the sea. Do you believe that with billions of dollars, and year 2015 technology Virgin galactic can't launch a rocket that all the other frauds claim they have? Virgin Galactic was proof launching rockets outside of the NASA fakery is very difficult if not impossible at this stage. There is problems in leaving  earth's atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have get caught up in bullshit, ask yourself, 50 years later, why can't independent like Virgin launch a rocket successfully? Don't pay attention to the Atari graphics of Elon musk and jeff bezos fakery. Virgin Galactic actually showed continuous flight video of all their attempts. They were the first real attempt at space.
