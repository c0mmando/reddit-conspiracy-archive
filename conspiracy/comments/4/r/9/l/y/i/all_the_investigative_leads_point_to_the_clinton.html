        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why was the huffpo story, written by Frank Huguenard about a RICO charge against the clintons and the foundation get pulled so abruptly? </p>

<p>Why did the DOJ recently ask the court to delay foundation emails for 27 months? </p>

<p>&quot;Department of Justice officials filed a motion in federal court late Wednesday seeking a 27-month delay in producing correspondence between former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonâ€™s four top aides and officials with the Clinton Foundation and Teneo Holdings, a closely allied public relations firm that Bill Clinton helped launch. &quot;</p>

<p>It seems that the FBI analyst on 4chan&#39;s pol board might be right on the spot. Everything implicating the foundation is being scrubbed and or delayed. </p>

<p>The clinton foundation intersects at the heart of all these matters, it&#39;s a common link between all the scandals. I don&#39;t think the suspect agent is wrong, I think all effort should be made in exposing these connections surrounding the clinton foundation. This leak on pol was on purpose. They are helping the American people connect the dots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>clinton must have gotten on to the idea that foundations were the perfect money laundering scheme from his Canadian friend Frank Giustra during the 1990&#39;s. Exposing the charitable foundation pyramid racket and regulating them in America now would undue the power of the 1 percent globally. They are trying to prevent us from identifying the source of the inequality that helps them consolidate wealth for their families. Too bad we are on to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what the 4chan team has so far. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hC14wUzLw1EJ0GfDcDm9GAJoOnF2V0pM36uy3NuEzw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hC14wUzLw1EJ0GfDcDm9GAJoOnF2V0pM36uy3NuEzw/edit</a></p>

<p>Check out 8chan as well, both chans are doing Clinton Foundation General (CFG) threads around the clock. Based on my lurking, it looks like CF is the nexus for a corruption ring that ensnares the heads of media and government. </p>

<p>Remember the pedophile rings we&#39;ve been getting hints at? There may be a pedo ring involved in CF, in that Bill throws wild parties and then (perhaps) has a camera man go around the party with a young girl or boy to get pics for blackmail. That was one of the theories being floated in the 8chan thread. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of info being slowly uncovered. If you want to help, go check out the threads, pick a few targets, and start looking for connections. </p>

<p>Tavistock is something you&#39;ll want to brush up on, it&#39;s the beginning of Soros&#39;s money laundering, it gives money to a bunch of major charities to spread degeneracy, including the Feminist Majority. </p>

<p>This is an exciting time to be alive, and I&#39;m glad to be here to see it all. Good hunting, gentlemen!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing is everything. The timing is the most crucial thing imaginable. It doesn&#39;t even matter if she&#39;s executed for the treason she HAS committed. The timing MUST line up properly.</p>

<p>She has to be <em>indicted</em> AFTER becoming nominee, and she has to be <em>convicted</em> AFTER the deadline for showing up on the ballot in individual states but before the election.</p>

<p>If this happens, it doesn&#39;t matter who the DNC puts up (it won&#39;t be Sanders, Berniebots; don&#39;t delude yourselves) to replace her because there will be no legal Democrat candidate in any state. Trump wins all 50 states in a landslide, with the second largest number of votes being retarded write-ins for Bernie and the third being the Libertarians.</p>

<p>You said it, but not much of what you say is true, so yeah.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Missouri,_2000">Dead people have run in elections and won  before,</a> so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.    Ballot substitutions after the deadline have happened before like in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_Jersey,_2002">NJ Senate race in 2002.

    <div class="md"><p>The individual states have deadlines by which potential named candidates and their parties must be registered to be on the ballot. You may always write in any legally eligible person, but for the name to show up it has to get in before that deadline.</p>

<p>If she&#39;s convicted after said deadline, that&#39;s it for the Democrats. When Obama picks Biden to run, it won&#39;t matter, because he couldn&#39;t legally show up on the ballot itself.</p>
