<p>Good afternoon. As of today, I am officially a former “digital media specialist” (a nice way to say “paid Internet troll”) previously employed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign (through a PR firm). I’m posting here today as a confession of sorts because I can no longer continue to participate in something that has become morally-indigestible for me. (This is a one-time throwaway account, but I’ll stick around for this thread.)</p>

<p>First, my background. I am [redacted] … and first became involved in politics during the 2008 presidential race. I worked as a volunteer for Hillary during the Democratic primary and then for the Democratic Party in the general election. I was not heavily involved in the 2012 election cycle (employment issues – volunteering doesn’t pay the rent), and I wasn’t really planning on getting involved in this cycle until I was contacted by a friend from college around six months ago about working on Hillary’s campaign.</p>

<p>I was skeptical at first (especially after my experience as an unpaid volunteer in 2008), but I eventually came around. The work time and payment was flexible, and I figured that I could bring in a little extra money writing about things I supported anyways. After some consideration, I emailed my resume to the campaign manager he had named, and within a week, I was in play. I don’t want to get bogged down on this subject, but I was involved with PPP (pay per post) on forums and in the comments section of (mostly-liberal) news and blog sites. Spending my time on weekends and evenings, I brought in roughly an extra $100 or so a week, which was a nice cushion for me.</p>

<p>At first, the work was fun and mostly unsupervised. I posted mostly positive things about Hillary and didn’t engage in much negativity. Around the middle of July, however, I received notification that the team would be focusing not on pro-Hillary forum management, but on “mitigation” (the term our team leader used) for a Vermont senator named Bernie Sanders. I’d been out of college for several years and hadn’t heard much about Sanders, and so I decided to do some research to get a feel for him.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was skeptical of what Sanders was saying at the beginning, and didn’t have much of a problem pointing out the reasons why I believed that Hillary was the better candidate. Over a period of two months, I gradually started to find Bernie appealing, even if I still disagreed with him on some issues. By September, I found myself as a closet Bernie supporter, though I still believed that Hillary was the only electable Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>The real problem for me started around the end of September and the beginning of October, when there was a change of direction from the team leader again. Apparently, the higher-ups in the firm caught wind of an impending spending splurge by the Clinton campaign that month and wanted to put up an impressive display. We received very specific instructions about how and what to post, and I was aghast at what I saw. It was a complete change in tone and approach, and it was extremely nasty in character. We changed from advocates to hatchet men, and it left a very bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea, here are some of the guidelines for our posting in October:</p>

<p>1) Sexism. This was the biggest one we were supposed to push. We had to smear Bernie as misogynistic and out-of-touch with modern sensibilities. He was to be characterized as “an old white male relic that believed women enjoyed being gang raped”. Anyone who tried to object to this characterization would be repeatedly slammed as sexist until they went away or people lost interest.</p>

<p>2) Racism. We were instructed to hammer home how Bernie supporters were all privileged white students that had no idea how the world worked. We had to tout Hillary’s great record with “the blacks” (yes, that’s the actual way it was phrased), and generally use racial identity politics to attack Sanders and bolster Hillary as the only unifying figure.</p>

<p>3) Electability. All of those posts about how Sanders can never win and Hillary is inevitable? Some of those were us, done deliberately in an attempt to demoralize Bernie supporters and convince them to stop campaigning for him. The problem is that this was an outright fabrication and not an accurate assessment of the current political situation. But the truth didn’t matter – we were trying to create a new truth, not to spread the existing truth.</p>

<p>4) Dirty tactics. This is where things got really bad. We were instructed to create narratives of Clinton supporters as being victimized by Sanders supporters, even if they were entirely fabricated. There were different instructions about how to do it, but something like this (<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/31/1443064/-Dis-heartened-Hillary-Supporter">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/31/1443064/-Dis-heartened-Hillary-Supporter</a>) is a perfect example. These kind of posts are manufactured to divide and demoralize Sanders supporters, and are entirely artificial in nature. (The same thing happened in 2008, but it wasn’t as noticeable before social media and public attention focused on popular forums like Reddit).</p>

<p>5) Opponent outreach. There are several forums and imageboards where Sanders is not very popular (I think you can imagine which ones those are.) We were instructed to make pro-Sanders troll posts to rile up the user base and then try to goad them into raiding or attacking places like this subreddit. This was probably the only area where we only had mixed success, since that particular subset of the population were more difficult to manipulate than we originally thought.</p>

<p>In any case, the final nail in the coffin for me happened last night. I was on an imageboard trying to rile up the Trump-supporting natives with inflammatory Bernie posting, and the sum of responses I received basically argued that at least Bernie was genuine in his belief, even if they disagreed with his positions, which made him infinitely better than the 100% amoral and power-hungry Hillary.</p>

<p>I had one of those “what are you doing with your life” moments. When even the scum of 4chan think that your candidate is too scummy for their tastes, you need to take a good hard look at your life. Then this morning I read that the National Association of Broadcasters were bankrolling both Clinton and Rubio, and that broke the camel’s back. I emailed my resignation this morning.</p>

<p>I’m going to go all in for Bernie now, because I truly believe that the Democratic Party has lost its way, and that redemption can only come by standing for something right and not by compromising for false promises and fake ideals. I want to apologize to everyone here for my part in this nasty affair, and I hope you will be more aware of attempts to sway you away from supporting the only candidate that can bring us what we need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton SuperPac “Correct the Record” is openly admitting to spending $1 million to hire fake online Hillary supporters to swarm social media sites like Reddit and counteract Sanders&#39; [actually existent unpaid] enthusiastic supporters&#39; points about Hillary in the interest of “unity”.</p>

<p>Couple quick things: first, there have been a number of diaries claiming to “have switched from Bernie to Hillary” lately, and some of them have been from recently created accounts with no record of pro-Sanders remarks or diaries. More such people have populated the comment sections of such diaries, and someone is reccing them despite what I judge to be their incredible lack of helpful information. That is just a fact, and my opinion about said fact. Second, if one wanted to make the case that there were a vast Clintonian conspiracy behind that rash of new accounts and diaries, this is certainly what one might consider corroborating evidence. Note the SuperPac has already spent $4.5 million on God knows what. So let&#39;s be honest this could have been already happenening, and now they believe they have more or less locked up the nomination and so are getting more belligerent/open about it. Third, note that Sanders-supporting diaries tend to still dominate the rec list day in, day out, and that Sanders has no Super Pac. We are on to your presumptive corporate shilling, in other words. Not that we can prove it. What I&#39;m saying is that this is why I have donated so much money to Bernie, because he is a candidate whose message, strategy and tactics are all above board. I.e. What they appear to be. He has gotten this far without steroids. Paid or not, Clinton supporters are welcome aboard.</p>

<p>Citing “lessons learned from online engagement with ‘Bernie Bros,’” a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to “push back against” users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.</p>

<p>Correct the Record’s “Barrier Breakers” project boasts in a press release that it has already “addressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.” The PAC released this on Thursday.</p>

<p>The PAC was created in May of last year when it was spun off from the American Bridge SuperPAC, which is run by longtime Hillary and Bill Clinton supporter David Brock. Brock also founded the left-wing media watchdog website Media Matters for America.</p>

<p>Some Bernie Sanders-supporting users on Reddit already started to notice the changes on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>“This explains why my inbox turned to cancer on Tuesday,” wrote user OKarizee. “Been a member of reddit for almost 4 years and never experienced anything like it. In fact, in all my years on the internet I’ve never experienced anything like it.”</p>

<p>Correct the Record, which has received $5 million this campaign season and has spent almost $4.5 million of it, according to OpenSecrets.org, outlined its strategy against “swarms of anonymous attackers” in a press release.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this is true, and the person who wrote this is reading this, although I want to thank you for telling the truth, to be honest I have mixed feelings about this. </p>

<p>Seriously, it&#39;s no thanks to &quot;enablers&quot; like this person (&quot;truther&quot;?) that helped turn my friends into enemies. So many people I know of are 100% die-hard supporters of Hillary Clinton, and no matter what I said or showed them proof of how bad Hillary was they all called me the crazy one, and that my guy (Bernie Sanders) was just an &quot;angry old man&quot;.  </p>

<p>Yeah, thanks a lot to that person and all his/her former colleagues for swaying people&#39;s minds whenever some of us try to show the truth, but they (PR firms) ruin it by coming up with some of the most obscure reasons in denying it. Or just saying &quot;but gotta vote for Hillary, or Trump will destroy the world!&quot;  Oh give me a break. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to say that the Clinton Foundation is also pretty much buying votes, by giving none of the money they raise to helping people.  Instead spending so much on bullshit projects with liberal leaning companies to buy votes.  Just look up how many crappy nyc/sf companies list CF as a client, and make some shitty website for a project of their that does nothing to help anyone.  Very similar to North Korea in that its just one big show.</p>

<p>The only time NY turns red is if the whole map turns red in a landslide like Reagan, or Nixon &#39;72.  It has not been a swing state (meaning a close state in a close election) since maybe 1948.  Polls at this point don&#39;t mean much, but <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ny/new_york_trump_vs_clinton-5792.html">23%</a> is a big margin to overcome.   There are half a dozen states that Trump could conceivably turn red, but NY is not one of them.</p>

<p>Which came first the chicken or the egg?  Shes been buying influence for years by given her buddies business or making buddies from it.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not going to argue random nonsense with you.  You are looking at things after the fact.  She has been running for president for a decade now. </p>

<p>I understand you are on this site because you want to post picture of women and endlessly argue.  I know about this because I worked at one of these companies.  And no I&#39;m not going to look anything up for you (the vast majority probably don&#39;t list it).  The clinton foundation pays for votes, get over it.  Im starting to think you might be a paid clinton troll for the amount of bullshit you are spewing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand New York, the city is huge for trump, polls are totally meaningless.  There are so many Queens latinos who can&#39;t be polled who love Trump.  And upstate is Trump country.</p>

<p>As opposed to Sanders who just tried to buy votes by promising to pay of your student loans and raise the minimum wage?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She has been running for president for a decade now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, working harder and longer than your boy Bernie is cheating?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are so many Queens latinos who can&#39;t be polled who love Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even though <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0saxqj5.jpg">latinos are massively against Trump</a> everywhere else in the country, there are millions of them hiding from pollsters in Queens who are going to turn  NY red?   Not to mention the fact that latinos historically have the lowest voter turnout of any group and the main reason for the increase in voter registration among latinos this year is to vote <em>against</em> Trump.  Spewing bullshit indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>upstate is Trump country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, you got one fact right.  Well, sort of right.  Upstate is Trump country except for Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse.  You know, where most of the people live.  He&#39;s doing great with cows though.  So he&#39;s got that going for him, which is nice.</p>

<p>The other day tops on this sub was an alt-right nutcase from 4chan barely pretending to be an FBI agent. Now we have only a slightly better performance from some random Joe pretending to work for CTR. Is this sub just going to be anonymous people writing works of fiction that is what the subscribers want to hear?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the legitimacy of the OP himself, I don&#39;t doubt all of the candidates are employing individuals to carry out similar tactics.  Just look at how many anti-Hillary posts litter the front page, it&#39;s staggering how one-sided it is. That&#39;s not to say that Hillary isn&#39;t worthy of extreme criticism, because she is, but the post content are so heavily biased against one particular candidate it&#39;s laughable.  There are 12 anti-Clinton posts on the front page, and zero anti-Trump or anti-Sanders posts.  Make no mistake, this board, too, is heavily manipulated.</p>

<p>Sad state of affairs, but not surprising. It&#39;s too cheap and easy, not to mention effective, to hire people to do this kind of work.  People by and large don&#39;t seem to think much yet about whether the comments they are reading are actually being posted by real people who mean what they say, so I expect this kind of shit will continue until it is no longer cost effective- i.e a long time. </p>
