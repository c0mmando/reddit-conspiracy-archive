        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We need to keep our eyes on this for arrests and/or claims of &quot;domestic extremists&quot;. Anchor interviewing someone who mentioned this is near where JFK was assassinated. </p>

<p>This is going to be huge. I don&#39;t know what the protest was about yet. (Okay, it was a protest over the 2 police shootings that happened this week.)</p>

<p>Edit 1: 3 DART transit officers shot</p>

<p>Edit 2: Live thread here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/live/x7xfgo3k9jp7/">https://www.reddit.com/live/x7xfgo3k9jp7/</a></p>

<p>Edit 3: Still looking for video footage of the actual shooting.</p>

<p>Edit 4: 4 DART officers shot</p>

<p>Edit 5: Up to 9 officers wounded</p>

<p>Edit 6: 3 officers are deceased. 2 are in surgery. 3 are in critical condition. Number up to 10 officers shot. 2 sniper shooters.</p>

<p>Edit 7: No suspects in custody. Search underway.</p>

<p>Edit 8: Snipers were from elevated position. (This is all first reporting from CNN live TV.)</p>

<p>Edit 9: Conversation about high powered rifles and targeted victims.</p>

<p>Edit 10: Baltimore officer weapy, saying we need leadership now and we won&#39;t tolerate violence anymore on any side.</p>

<p>Edit 11: Former detective saying the 2 snipers haven&#39;t been apprehended yet.</p>

<p>Edit 12: We have a witness of a potential sniper now. Witness is saying he was wearing came and on the streets carrying weapons.</p>

<p>Edit 13: Another witness is corroborating the camo story.</p>

<p>Edit 14: Picture up with black man wearing camo T-shirt carrying a rifle/gun of some sort. On the streets.</p>

<p>Edit 15: Cops saying there may be a bomb. </p>

<p>Edit 16: Second picture of camo rifle guy casually standing in a group. </p>

<p><em>Edit 17: This is my own thought: This is the dumbest thing ever. No person would just casually walk around with a rifle and let his picture get taken while planning a police assassination. This is ridiculous.</em></p>

<p>Edit 18: Time to up the count: 11 officers shot, 3 dead.</p>

<p>Edit 19: Time to up the count again: 4 officers are now dead.</p>

<p>Edit 20: OOOOOO. CNN now has VIDEO, too! This outta be good.</p>

<p>Edit 21: Still waiting for this supposed video.</p>

<p>Edit 22: Brother of suspect said his bother handed rifle over to the police. Story rapidly changing.</p>

<p>Edit 23: Video is same video on the live thread. You can only hear gun fire. You can&#39;t see anything of substance. </p>

<p>Edit 24: CNN saying police say that there may be more than 2 people involved. Repeat of video again.</p>

<p>Edit 25: Witness being interviewed. Nothing of substance. </p>

<p>Edit 26: Camo guy just turned himself in. Suspicious package discovered and being examined by bomb squad.</p>

<p>Edit 27: Another suspect in custody who apparently was in a shootout with Dallas SWAT officers.</p>

<p>Edit 28: Still no pictures or video of police being shot or taken to hospital.</p>

<p>Edit 29: Reporter saying there are bullet holes on a police car. (Pics please?)</p>

<p>Edit 30: CNN reporter saying he&#39;s watching/watched gurneys of police being brought to hospital. (I guess CNN doesn&#39;t give their reporters cell phones or digital cameras to report the news with.)</p>

<p>Edit 31: Witness on the phone saying he saw a person shooting &quot;clear as day&quot;. He says he has video.</p>

<p>Edit 32: Video footage shown. Total bunk. You can&#39;t see anything; you can only hear shots fired.</p>

<p>Edit 33: Anchor says &quot;very graphic&quot; as they play it again. I can&#39;t see anything.</p>

<p>Edit 34: Witness with video that shows nothing says social justice should not use violence or something like that and that this is a terrorist attack and now he&#39;s saying sniper had a few mags. (There&#39;s no way he could see that from this video - it&#39;s black inside the windows). Witness now saying it was an execution.</p>

<p>Edit 35: Okay, I&#39;m just not seeing what this witness is saying he&#39;s seeing. But he knows exactly that this was a black Chevy Tahoe that was the sniper&#39;s car. Maybe not a sniper from a window now? Sorry, I&#39;m just not seeing it.</p>

<p>Edit 36: Okay, I see one person fall slowly near a column after gun fire. That&#39;s all I can make out from this video.</p>

<p>Edit 37: I need to give this a rest now. As far as I can tell, you can&#39;t see anything of significance in this video to determine anything. Goodnight all. Stay on top of this.</p>

The Minnesota incident really was pointless because the deceased was pulled over for a missing tail light. He told the cop he had a weapon as well a a carry permit, and when he reached for his ID the cop shot him 4 or 5 times out of fear. Dallas wasn&#39;t the only city with protest about this either.</p>

<p>It was yesterday. Yeah, still part of this week, but I think this is important.</p>

<p>Yesterday 2 people killed by cops, and plastered all over MSM. Today protests, and seemingly well organized sniper cop killers. Could be the true instigators are related? </p>
