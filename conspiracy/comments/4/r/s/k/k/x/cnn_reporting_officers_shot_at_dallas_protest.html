       We need to keep our eyes on this for arrests and/or claims of "domestic extremists". Anchor interviewing someone who mentioned this is near where JFK was assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is going to be huge. I don't know what the protest was about yet. (Okay, it was a protest over the 2 police shootings that happened this week.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 1: 3 DART transit officers shot
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Live thread here:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/live/x7xfgo3k9jp7/">
        https://www.reddit.com/live/x7xfgo3k9jp7/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3: Still looking for video footage of the actual shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 4: 4 DART officers shot
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 5: Up to 9 officers wounded
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 6: 3 officers are deceased. 2 are in surgery. 3 are in critical condition. Number up to 10 officers shot. 2 sniper shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 7: No suspects in custody. Search underway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 8: Snipers were from elevated position. (This is all first reporting from CNN live TV.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 9: Conversation about high powered rifles and targeted victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 10: Baltimore officer weapy, saying we need leadership now and we won't tolerate violence anymore on any side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 11: Former detective saying the 2 snipers haven't been apprehended yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 12: We have a witness of a potential sniper now. Witness is saying he was wearing came and on the streets carrying weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 13: Another witness is corroborating the camo story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 14: Picture up with black man wearing camo T-shirt carrying a rifle/gun of some sort. On the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 15: Cops saying there may be a bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 16: Second picture of camo rifle guy casually standing in a group.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Edit 17: This is my own thought: This is the dumbest thing ever. No person would just casually walk around with a rifle and let his picture get taken while planning a police assassination. This is ridiculous.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 18: Time to up the count: 11 officers shot, 3 dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 19: Time to up the count again: 4 officers are now dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 20: OOOOOO. CNN now has VIDEO, too! This outta be good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 21: Still waiting for this supposed video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 22: Brother of suspect said his bother handed rifle over to the police. Story rapidly changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 23: Video is same video on the live thread. You can only hear gun fire. You can't see anything of substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 24: CNN saying police say that there may be more than 2 people involved. Repeat of video again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 25: Witness being interviewed. Nothing of substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 26: Camo guy just turned himself in. Suspicious package discovered and being examined by bomb squad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 27: Another suspect in custody who apparently was in a shootout with Dallas SWAT officers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 28: Still no pictures or video of police being shot or taken to hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 29: Reporter saying there are bullet holes on a police car. (Pics please?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 30: CNN reporter saying he's watching/watched gurneys of police being brought to hospital. (I guess CNN doesn't give their reporters cell phones or digital cameras to report the news with.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 31: Witness on the phone saying he saw a person shooting "clear as day". He says he has video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 32: Video footage shown. Total bunk. You can't see anything; you can only hear shots fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 33: Anchor says "very graphic" as they play it again. I can't see anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 34: Witness with video that shows nothing says social justice should not use violence or something like that and that this is a terrorist attack and now he's saying sniper had a few mags. (There's no way he could see that from this video - it's black inside the windows). Witness now saying it was an execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 35: Okay, I'm just not seeing what this witness is saying he's seeing. But he knows exactly that this was a black Chevy Tahoe that was the sniper's car. Maybe not a sniper from a window now? Sorry, I'm just not seeing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 36: Okay, I see one person fall slowly near a column after gun fire. That's all I can make out from this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 37: I need to give this a rest now. As far as I can tell, you can't see anything of significance in this video to determine anything. Goodnight all. Stay on top of this.

       Couldn't agree more. Mossad has been itching to capitalize on the racial tensions in "our" country. Now they just have to sit back and watch the catastrophe that's about to happen.

       The news was looking grim for Hillary so they had to change the story.   I can't believe how much control they are exerting.  They are really putting themselves out there to get her into office.  It won't be good for us once they do...

       I bet the police kill another possibly innocent person this year.

       I don't even understand what you're getting at? I haven't even looked at this footage or event. I have absolutely not declared it a hoax or false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think I just willy nilly write off everything as a hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely do not and I back up each of my claims with well formed arguments using evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you have the nerve to play down the accuracy of my prediction, even though you have no understanding of the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please Mr. Masterbater with your astute understanding of the times, tell us what will happen next, since interpreting current events and predicting the trend come so easily to you.

       NBC Dallas just read a statement from the Dallas PD that said 3 dead, 2 more in surgery and 3 more in critical condition. Shot from snipers from above.

       This post is great! There absolutely needs to be a running log of all the changes the media makes... Not the updated info, but a log where we can see fundamental "facts" of stories change.

       When I woke up today (7/8)-
MORNING NEWS: its 1 lone army veteran gunman.; the gunman was an "angry black man shooting only white cops"
      </p>
      <p>
       AFTERNOON NEWS: "This Dallas tragedy is the worst attack on law enforcement since 9/11"
      </p>
      <p>
       (Since when was 9/11 an attack on law enforcement? Like... wow. Just wow)

       The protest was about blacks being shot by police.  I
       <em>
        believe

       it was a BLM event, but it might not have been.

       Even more specific it was about the 2 videos that showed black men being killed by cops in Minnesota and Louisiana this last week. The Minnesota incident really was pointless because the deceased was pulled over for a missing tail light. He told the cop he had a weapon as well a a carry permit, and when he reached for his ID the cop shot him 4 or 5 times out of fear. Dallas wasn't the only city with protest about this either.

       It was yesterday. Yeah, still part of this week, but I think this is important.

      <p>
       Yesterday 2 people killed by cops, and plastered all over MSM. Today protests, and seemingly well organized sniper cop killers. Could be the true instigators are related?

       Now that some time has passed...  Where is the CCTV/surveillance video footage from nearby buildings,  police body camera footage, or video footage from inside the parked police cars?  Can we request these via a FOIA I wonder?

       I'm watching footage of it right now on CNN, and it sounds like combat footage from Iraq.  It's getting ugly but I kind of expected it to happen honestly.  I saw it coming with the rise in police brutality.
