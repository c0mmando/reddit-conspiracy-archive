The only correlation I can figure is the election is gearing up and they want to dumb it WAY down for people. Also Builderberg just happened. Maybe just they got sick of this page. Too much INFO getting spread around. They couldn&#39;t shut it down so they turned it into a joke.</p>

Most of the posts about Bilderberg this year were downvoted the fuck out of or purposefully kept from making the front page. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Bilderberg&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">Compared to years gone by where Bilderberg meetings dominated the front page</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you&#39;re over thinking and reading into it too much.  I have posts about Hillary down to my fifth page, and have a few new stuff on Louisiana too.  There can only be so much new stuff.  This is Reddit.  There are more than a few hackers and tech savvy users here.  I&#39;m more likely to believe these sorts of questioning posts if I see lines code detailing manipulations, redirected traffic, deletes.  </p>

<p>Que personal rant.  </p>

<p>The key to any good conspiracy is to control just enough.  Too much control  breeds suspicion and can lead to leaks/word getting out, just as can too little.  1984 is fiction.  That level of control really isn&#39;t feasible in our society, at most not continuously.  Not yet, that is.  The fewer stuff &quot;they&quot; have to put their hands on the better.  </p>

<p>I am an Anthropology grad.  Conspiracies have shaped have history for better and for worst, and so I&#39;ve spent a lot of time studying them.<br/>
As a counterpoint to myself.  I must say the Google search and Facebook manipulations means tactics are changing.  But more connections, more patterns observed, more evidence uncovered before some can be unearthed.  Otherwise we are just grasping at straws, victims to our own desire feel like we are seeing patterns and have uncovered something that indeed may not be there.  </p>

<p>Want to get better at seeing patterns of conspiracy and reasons for motive?  Pick the brain of a historian of politics, economics, and/or military.  </p>

<p>But it only seems to disrupt current news... where before current news could be acquired from Reddit first. Reddit now plays catch up.</p>

<p>::EDIT::</p>

<p>Also regarding your last statement. What are your thoughts regarding &#39;Appeals to Authority&#39;? It would seem much of the criticism of &quot;The establishment&quot; comes against those whom you suggest would best be approached about the subject... people who may very well be involved in conspiracies against the public interest.</p>
