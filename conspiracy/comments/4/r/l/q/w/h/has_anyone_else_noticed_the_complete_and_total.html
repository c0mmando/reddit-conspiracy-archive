       I know it has something to do with that algorithm but in the face of such dramatic revelations coming out lately, it's seriously odd when you compare the reddit experience regarding up to date news and important issues compared to just a year ago.

       I bet if some movie star died we'd know about it though.

       This page has gone WAY down hill the last few months. Most of the stuff posted is garbage, the rest is psyop or planted ops info bait. The only correlation I can figure is the election is gearing up and they want to dumb it WAY down for people. Also Builderberg just happened. Maybe just they got sick of this page. Too much INFO getting spread around. They couldn't shut it down so they turned it into a joke.

       I completely agree. Most of the posts about Bilderberg this year were downvoted the fuck out of or purposefully kept from making the front page.

       How is it interesting? There is no evidence presented.  He just made a statement pointing fingers seemingly random at me and another mod for being at fault.

       How are we at fault?  Where does my responsibility begin and where does it end? What COULD I do to end the problem? Why is the perceived problem actually a problem?

       For that matter it's no mystery that HRC is being posted here a lot right now, she literally just got caught repeatedly lying about mishandling classified information and then was caught having her husband secretly meet with LL and then got let off the hook by a man who literally said she was guilty in the same speech that he said he wasn't pressing charges.

       I was just about to make a post about it, myself, when I saw yours. There's been two major police murders this week, along with the reveal that Hillary won't be indicted, and the top posts on All for the last week are shitty memes and TILs for the first 3 pages.

       Something drastic is happening to reddit. It's been happening for months, but I feel like it might be beyond usable at this point.

       It's all about signal to noise ratio. Drown out stuff that matters with fluff that doesn't.

       I agree. I seems everywhere you go, Voat, ATS, even the Guardian and the Intercept seem to be shy on news that should be happening, all the stuff we're going to find out about sometime between now and fucking eventually.

       Meanwhile, HRC seems to have Assange lipstick all over her cock, since those supposed emails to bring about her demise are what - still incoming?

       Anyway, yes, there appears to be a pretty good black out on current news, at least from search engines here in the U.S.

       Perhaps you're over thinking and reading into it too much.  I have posts about Hillary down to my fifth page, and have a few new stuff on Louisiana too.  There can only be so much new stuff.  This is Reddit.  There are more than a few hackers and tech savvy users here.  I'm more likely to believe these sorts of questioning posts if I see lines code detailing manipulations, redirected traffic, deletes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Que personal rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to any good conspiracy is to control just enough.  Too much control  breeds suspicion and can lead to leaks/word getting out, just as can too little.  1984 is fiction.  That level of control really isn't feasible in our society, at most not continuously.  Not yet, that is.  The fewer stuff "they" have to put their hands on the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am an Anthropology grad.  Conspiracies have shaped have history for better and for worst, and so I've spent a lot of time studying them.
       <br/>
       As a counterpoint to myself.  I must say the Google search and Facebook manipulations means tactics are changing.  But more connections, more patterns observed, more evidence uncovered before some can be unearthed.  Otherwise we are just grasping at straws, victims to our own desire feel like we are seeing patterns and have uncovered something that indeed may not be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to get better at seeing patterns of conspiracy and reasons for motive?  Pick the brain of a historian of politics, economics, and/or military.

       They stated themselves the algorithm has changed. What I described is a complaint presented to Reddit as an organization several times. It's apparently being looked at.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it only seems to disrupt current news... where before current news could be acquired from Reddit first. Reddit now plays catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
       ::EDIT::
      </p>
      <p>
       Also regarding your last statement. What are your thoughts regarding 'Appeals to Authority'? It would seem much of the criticism of "The establishment" comes against those whom you suggest would best be approached about the subject... people who may very well be involved in conspiracies against the public interest.
