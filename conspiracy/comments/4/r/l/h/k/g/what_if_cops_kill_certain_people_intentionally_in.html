       And the ones that always get tons of play on the media stations are the ones that are black and the ones that are actively resisting or were committing some crime. Have you seen the ones who get shot by police that are compeltely innocent get play on the news channels? Complete silence. They only give air time to the ones they know will play into their narrative, and it's completely fucked. It's to distract from the obvious corruption with the FBI and Clinton, I'd say.

       That's what Black Lives Matter is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of police violence has never been specifically about African Americans. If anything, if there's a single group of people that is targeted by police violence it's the physically and mentally impaired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of police violence isn't actually with the police, it's with the fix in the judicial system that keeps police from being prosecuted for crimes. Police get charged with crimes at less than .001% of civilians, under similar circumstances. In a world where police actually got charged for committing crimes, it wouldn't matter if a police ran someone over for being negligent or shot someone of another color because they were racist. Justice would be served either way. In other words, if the justice system did its job, it wouldn't matter if cops were racist; they would not be able to act racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why making it a race issue is nonsensical. BLM is
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       for the power structure, because there isn't even an achievable goal, just empty rage, directed at the wrong place. The right place to direct anger is in the process of judicial branch collusion, which interestingly enough seems to be at the center of the current Hillary debacle as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for media distraction, what a lot of people don't realize is that collusion isn't always conspiracy. It's not an organized group of people furthering an intentional agenda. What it is, is a long line of palms greasing palms. It's hands across the sea, tucking money into each other's pockets. Each hand is only serving its master, often rather ignorant that its master is serving masters who are serving masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is how the machine operates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news knows what topics are verboten, and they pick from the rest when they need to avoid. When they do pick the "right" topic, it gets the spin. Even regular people take part. If they haven't questioned the dialogue, then they perpetuate it. And even truthful incidents, like police brutality, may distract from something else. Herrings all the way down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, cops have colluded on vast conspiracies plenty of times, but it's for reasons more immediately advantageous to their masters than a vague media smokescreen.

       No, police deaths.  Police were being increasingly killed while FBI stats show civilian deaths decreasing simultaneously.

       Crime in 2010 dropped to its lowest rate since 1967 in Los Angeles, Seattle, and St. Louis, as well as its lowest level in many years elsewhere:

      <p>
       Crime from 2009-2013 is plummeting, according to the FBI:
       <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/november/crime-statistics-for-2013-released/crime-statistics-for-2013-released">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, police deaths in 2010 jumped nearly 40%:
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/28/police-deaths-2010_n_801901.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Police deaths spiked again in 2014:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, many of these police deaths occurred in "single-massacre incidents":

       Police shootings of civilians in the U.S. are skyrocketing also (in contrast to background decreasing civilian-vs-civilian shootings):

      <p>
       So you seem to miss my point that although
       <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/november/crime-statistics-for-2013-released/crime-statistics-for-2013-released">
        violent crime is plummeting
       </a>
       , police shootings of civilians are up because police are being "hyperstimulated" because police deaths are up in single-massacre incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that the foreground stories of "police vs. civilians" we are hearing about loudly does not reflect the background level of violent crime in the U.S. which is low.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police are being artificially hyperstimulated to mistrust civilians (intentionally or not, that is the net effect), and in turn civilians mistrust police [and the cycle that may have begun artificially begins to become an organic cycle].

       Wow.  Thanks for this.  I didn't know this.  It's weird because in Baltimore, a city where only a couple of years ago poor people were rioting and fighting cops who were exposed to lead as stated in your article, but it appears the poor areas of Baltimore had a problem with lead exposure as well.

       You bet.  Think about all of the lead problems currently in U.S. city water, across the country.

       Gasoline used to be sold as "Leaded" and "Unleaded".  It began to be removed from gas stations in the 1970s, but was not banned until

       Yes. They are already executing people in the streets. And we know that hate groups in this country have an inordinate amount of LEOs in their ranks. A race war would provide the perfect cover for the State indiscriminately killing even more people of all colors.

       I was thinking the same thing.  Of course, it could very well just be systemic in that they are made to behave in a way which brings very predictable outcomes.  Still you detect an agenda and a bigger picture here and so do I.

       I think it is more of the power that be using the media to influence witch stories get used and at what time. Local or state police are to small to be apart of some bigger hidden agenda.

       Exactly. More Black people get killed every day by other Black people that Cops in a year I imagine. The media determines what story to blast on the TV on repeat 24/7. They can create riots this way if they want like they did with the Rodney King thing. They just played the video of him being beat down by cops not mentioning the car chase or showing him resisting arrest that led up to that beating. Just a repeat loop of White cops beating a Black man. Was all it took to get riots going that swept the city and had people getting pulled out of their cars an nearly beaten to death.

       In my opinion this is more scary. Because of the violent nature of the US in some areas they have an abundant supply of stories like the one just recently. The ability to manipulate minds of the people with actions not of your own can be a very powerful and even sinister.

       This is basically the essence of what a false flag does.  If you extend this out from just cops to the globalist powers that be, you'll see it happen all the time.  No way in hell I believe some "lone nut" killed Jo Cox, for example.
