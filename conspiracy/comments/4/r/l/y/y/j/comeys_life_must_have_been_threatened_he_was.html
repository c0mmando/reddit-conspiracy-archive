<p>The whole thing is a theatrical sham.  The FBI was watching people like Spitzer, and interrupted his trajectory of interfering with the economic meltdown.  The CIA spies on the Senate.</p>

<p>Yet somehow nobody was watching Clinton?  Bullshit.  They knew the whole time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR ... In February 2008, Spitzer wrote an editorial in the Washington Post identifying regulators&#39; failure to control subprime lending markets, which became the economic meltdown later that year.  Three weeks later (after Spitzer&#39;s editorial), Spitzer&#39;s use of prostitutes was revealed by the New York Times from court records of an FBI wiretap of Spitzer, who had been under surveillance by the FBI without any specific investigation dating back years.</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code ¬ß 793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer‚Äî</p>

<p>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>

<p>wtf?  Nice post, OP</p>

<p>BUT- he claimed that there was no evidence of her being hacked.  So the bottom line is that they haven&#39;t shown that the data she was in charge of WAS misplaced.  That&#39;s why Guccifer is sitting in Alexandria.  She can&#39;t be charged until the hack is proven.</p>

<p>permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean- technically it was removed from its proper place of custody, but if &quot;everyone does it&quot;, which is the case according to Clinton, then it&#39;s questionable what the proper place it.</p>

<p>it wasn&#39;t transmitted in violation of anyone&#39;s trust, necessarily.  And while she destroyed her emails, it didn&#39;t really destroy the information- at least in a manner that can be proven.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty gray right now.  Clearly it violated protocol and she should get her wrist slapped at the very least.  But it&#39;s difficult to prove criminality UNLESS it can be shown that her bad judgement compromised the confidential/ classifies/ secret/ top secret information to the point that it WAS stolen.  At that point, I feel like you&#39;d HAVE to charge her.</p>

<p>Interestingly, other countries (like Russia and China and Israel) are the ones who are going to know whether or not the law was broken).  That means she&#39;s potentially compromised because they can hold that information over her head.  If they leak it- she goes to jail.  That makes a Hillary Presidency either very dangerous OR maybe a little safer...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a very literal analysis of her statement, though.  I&#39;d suspect that there are many things that high ranking government officials do to avoid being associated directly with a paper trail.</p>

<p>Those officials who &quot;don&#39;t use email&quot;- like the article claims of condi rice- are clearly communicating somehow.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re using snailmail or an iphone...  My guess would be their staffers are on email OR they are using their staffers&#39; email and this provides plausible deniability.</p>

<p>He just did the math. </p>

<p>If he goes after Clinton and she still becomes Pres, FBI loses. </p>

<p>If he does not and she becomes Pres, FBI wins. </p>

<p>If Trump wins, he said she was guilty but did not say procecute, so he is a team player. FBI wins.</p>
