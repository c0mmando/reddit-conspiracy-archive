       It's just something that I can't really wrap my head around with supposedly so many crisis actors out there. What keeps them from opening their mouths?  A shit load of hush money with a bit of extortion perhaps? That's a lot of people to keep track of. Has anybody here ever been a crisis actor?

       The theories are wrong.  People really died. Not once has anyone ever "come back to life" to reveal the plot, because it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is the crux of it, all the threories die at this point of an explanation that cannot be made.

       Stop conflating false flags with hoaxes.  There can be crisis actors even though others died.  They 'control the narrative' to help explain to the public what happened, to shut down further inquiry from the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perfect example is 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11 2997 people (iirc) died.  Then, a crisis actor, "the harley guy" mark walsh came out of the woodwork, and kept repeating 'the fires were just so hot'...'leading to progressive collapse'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crisis actor.  People also died.   Crisis actor + people died.  So....
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I repeat.  Stop your conflating the two because if you do it from now on, we'll know that you yourself are trying to 'control the narrative' here on

       Lol. I agree with your point regarding the false dilemma, but way to facilitate and encourage free-thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never ceases to amaze me (yes, I'm stupid) how often crowds of conspiracy investigators devolve into people who mock or attack the motivation of anyone who disagrees with them. You know, the same way the "sleeping masses" accuse conspiracy theorists of being insane or paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You must be
       <em>
        purposely
       </em>
       spreading falsehoods if you pretend you disagree with my analysis." is the equivalent, mirror image of that behavior. It's just another charge of "heresy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable people, confronted with a new fact or set of facts, can reasonably interpret and even perceive those facts differently. It happens all the time, and often enough it has nothing to do with big corporations or shadowy governments paying people off, nor with intellectual cowardice. It's hard to change one's perspective and in my experience accusations rarely smooth the transition.

       Or good-hearted people who (at least) say they were approached to be crisis actors and told the people to fuck off-that they were going to the media?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the same question about gangstalkers. I believe 100% that mind control experiments are going on, but the gangstalking people still baffle me. If even .0001% of supposed gangstalkers or crisis actors responded with, "That sounds like a truly evil proposition. I'm going to tell people you suggested that to me," we'd be inundated with reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an unusual person in that there are things I am ready to die for, but I'm not totally alone. I know at least a couple people I would bet my life would at least say "no" and then tell others about it.

       Consider the following scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You have an AI program that is hooked up with mass surveillance and has decades of social psychology to understand how humans work.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The AI program finds ways to manipulate people (stalkers) into 'being at a certain place at a certain time', 'to look out for a certain person'.  Perhaps they've been getting fed emails from a "protected' or 'authoritative source', someone from an intelligence agency for example, that has 'deputized him/her' to help assist them in tracking down 'an alleged (serial killer / pedophile / drug dealer / murderer / stalker)' in the community.  This person then is notified to go to a certain place and 'watch out for' this disreputable / potential criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) This AI program has a deep knowledge of everyone from mass surveillance

       4) The AI knows when you leave your home, when you take a shower, approx where you are located and headed using your cellphone's gps/wifi and cell tower triangulation sent back to servers.  Also, if the AI has access to NRO satellite data, they can actually see you, with a potential resolution of 1 cm
       <sup>
        2!!
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Using the 'pattern of life' and seeing that you left your home, it can send email / sms / skype / facebook / twitter / foursquare / 'other' instant messages to various 'deputized' community citizens to 'watch you'.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) The targetted individual is now under humanint field surveillance by people who have been tricked, duped with disinformation into thinking they are doing good, protecting the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this requires mind control.  All it requires is panopticon and highly active communication network with a dynamic asset development and appropriation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is happening, it's immoral and abusive and it's also lacking in manners.
      </p>
      <p>
       These military-industrial aristocrats are supposed to have manners, but their 'tough mafioso abuses'  reveal them as undifferentiated from dirty impoverished commoners with no sense or justification for their hungry useless mouths.

       I'm not sure how it works, but I'd imagine that they take out an ad, then they do background checks on the applicants to find out their political views and then they choose the most fanatical ones that fit the agenda.

       Obviously a mix of hush money and threats against themselves and their family. But a more general point about this type of 'where are the whistleblowers?' question. To blow the whistle assumes that there is some media outlet you could actually blow into. One premise of the hoax hypothesis is that the media is "in on it." They are controlled by the people perpetrating the hoax. So do you think they're going to give space to someone who comes out and says, "hey it was a hoax"? No, they're not. Sorry, not gonna happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And any crisis actor involved knows that. They know that if they tried to open their mouth on some other platform like twitter, they would be (at best) ignored and more likely blackballed and slandered. Their reputation would be torn asunder. They would be framed or set up or whatever. In fact, if you ever do see the MSM giving any credence or airtime to a "crisis actor who has come forward," you can bet that it is just a set up to then paint them as an insane liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the premise of a crisis actor or other person involved in the conspiracy "coming forward" neglects the fact that there is really nowhere to come forward to. And what that means is that any person who gets media coverage for whistle-blowing is (almost) guaranteed to be part of the controlled opposition, a part of another psyop. They are never ending and coming from all directions. It helps to keep people destabilized and gives them something to talk (and worry) about.

       Also strange that no one recognizes the crisis agents from their "past" life. But there's a pretty reasonable explanation for that... Think of where these actors are deployed: drills with mock fatalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Sandy Hook, for instance. Thousands of relatives attended these funerals and memorial services for a child they knew didn't exist. Why? They were paid to attend these "services," which were actually where they were told that they had to live their lives as these new characters, and pretend to know the "grieving parents" or face serious consequences. There could also be mass brainwashing/hypnosis at these gatherings, and you'd be asleep not to think there was a touch of satanic ritual going on as well.
