    <div class="md"><p>They want race wars, getting rid of free speech, arrests for social media posts, make sure vets can&#39;t get guns because they are actually trained to use them.</p>

<p>Its because everyone is waking up like crazy to how rigged the gov and system is and that a few hundred 1%&#39;ers own the majority of money, and all of us combined can simply go after these few hundred and redistribute the wealth. So they program mkultra style shooters like this to further their agenda so we are too busy fighting ourselves over politics, race, divisons, etc instead of joining forces to fuck up the 1%</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small primer on Cultural Marxism: <a href="https://youtu.be/G8pPbrbJJQs">https://youtu.be/G8pPbrbJJQs</a></p>

<p>CM is about the oppressed (minorities, lower class etc) and the oppressors (elites, oligarchs, professional-class etc) and how to resolve the inherent inequality (through horrible social movements like; political correctness, feminism in it&#39;s current form, social justice etc) .  Since the crash of 2008, multiple races have been coming together to oust the elites.  Just like in the past, when the whites and blacks were coming together, the Government offered whites, land/property for free out West (not blacks).  Once the whites got &quot;theirs&quot; they abandoned their quest for justice/equality etc.  </p>

<p>This time, the inequality is so obvious that the people are amassing together again.  For the last few years these movements that have sprung up have been taken over by government agencies and used to orchestrate division (instead of cohesion) between the joining forces, once again shrouding the elites from the eye of the public.</p>

<p>The OP is right though in his personal experiences.  I have also noticed several opposing views clash on Facebook with no real &quot;good&quot; coming from the discussions.  This shooting is slightly different than most though.  With Pulse, it was civilians targeted by an extremist (or so it&#39;s said).  This recent attack is one on the Policing force of the oligarchs.  The demographic of rage is far different than the shooting on civilians.  </p>

<p>These two type of shootings (civilians vs officers) seems to galvanize both forces in hating the other.  The civilians are upset because the Police Force they&#39;re paying with taxes did nothing to prevent the attack.  The Police are upset because civilians they&#39;re paid to protect are shooting back at them for being complicit (knowingly or not) in executing other civilians.</p>

<p>People need to realize, the real target is the central banks, think tanks, corrupt foundations (WHO, IMF etc), Wall Street, the .001% (and the 15-25% being the professional class who support the status quo and  the establishment&#39;s golden children; GMO&#39;s, Vaccines, Petro-industry, perpetual war, pro-Israel, anti-Russia etc etc.</p>

<p>Incoming wall of text on how to make effective change in the world by yourself:</p>

<p>You can do a lot by not supporting any of the business or institutions destroying the land, sea, air and beings on this planet.  Stop eating at fuckery places that pay their employees shit and have horrible food for you.  Stop buying furniture laced with chemicals that will slowly kill you (curtains, blankets, sheets, mattress, pillows, rugs, sofas etc).  There are plenty of alternatives that don&#39;t require the flame-retardants you stuff your face in for six-to-eight hours a night.  Open your wallet, if you have a bank card from any of the financial institutions you know have wronged the people (through LIBOR, exchange-rate scandals, laundering drug-cartel money, silver/gold exchange-rate scandals etc), get rid of it and go to your local Credit Union.  Stop taking their chronic prescriptions and fix your fucking issues.  Masking the symptom (while drastically altering your brain-chemical chemistry) instead of fixing the underlying cause is not a way to solve your issues.  Every one goes through depressing states in their lives, that&#39;s life.  You don&#39;t need a pill for the rest of your life to deal with the sorrow/stress/memories.  Mourning is a process.  If you are still mourning, you are doing it wrong (speaking from personal experience as many close friends and family have died in my life).  Praise the fact they existed and that you were part of their life.  Check your clothes.. make sure it&#39;s not made by children/slaves for pittance.  Eat healthy, try and eat meat less than a few times a week (if that).  Meat-based diets are one of the main driving forces of man-made climate change.  If anything made by man is not considered Natural/Nature, then stop using the excuse that, in Nature, animals eat other animals.  We&#39;ve evolved beyond the natural order of things (just observe how we&#39;re the cause of the unnatural Sixth Extinction Event).  Just because some animals cannibalize others and it&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we should as well.  We know enough now to supplement the needed Vitamin B-complex and more that is obtained from meat-based sources.</p>

<p>Basically, be responsible for every thing you do/say.  Vote with your dollar, stop supporting the corporations you know are killing us/the planet.  Become self-sufficient.  Honor others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pills for mental issues, composed of complex pharmaceutical agents is completely different than a Vitamin B-Complex (made from non-toxic elements) that supplements what a person misses from not eating meat.  The supplements one takes does not alter brain-chemistry in the way a pharmaceutical pill does.  These are completely different substances as society recognizes (one requires a prescription because of how potent/toxic/dangerous it is).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A (Hegelian) dialectic in progress, to control the masses using a strategy of tension, keeping them hopelessly divided, continually blaming one other for their woes, thus deflecting any attention or blame directed toward those who truly wield power, allowing TPTB to consolidate even more power and control in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Only to a magician is the world forever fluid, infinitely mutable and eternally new. Only he knows the secret of change, only he knows truly that all things are crouched in eagerness to become something else, and it is from this universal tension that he draws his power.&quot;</p>

<p>They, of course, consider themselves magicians.</p>

<p>There is a plan in motion, in motion now for more than a century, and that plan will come to fruition within the lifetimes of the second generation from now... most of the world is not included in that plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We might (should) refrain from any kind of even potentially inciteful rhetoric for a while. Carefully and cautiously breed calmly and try not to get hurt anymore.</p>

<p>Myself, I had a black friend as a little child. I was fortunate to see Asians doing what I thought was Karate but was Tai Chi. I became more than myself by being with people different than myself.</p>

<p>Then they started hurting me. Oh, it happened a couple times, and it still happens.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t call out &quot;Northerner&quot;. The blacks haven&#39;t been as bad as just all of them, and that includes whites, muslims, blacks, <em>and</em> mexicans (although I have not been personally wronged by a Mexican that I know of). Put the criminals in jail PLEASE and make sure all the good ones are kept well, and I mean it kids. Really. There&#39;s been bad stuff going on.</p>
