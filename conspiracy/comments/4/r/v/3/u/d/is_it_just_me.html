    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I&#39;m wondering what they&#39;re trying to distract us from with this wave of &quot;police killing black people&quot; stories that came out right after the FBI recommended no charges for Hillary. Maybe that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to distract us from - the fact that they just admitted she&#39;s at fault and in the same breath said they weren&#39;t recommending charges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m worried it could be something larger since the Clinton Foundation is still under investigation and state department just reopened the Clinton email investigation, do you think that the FBI&#39;s no charge call is the only thing they&#39;re trying to distract from?

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, these events as they are implicated a much greater conspiracy. Why would a person in such a position as AG, Director of FBI, and president turn a blind eye to deliberate, intentional,  negligent handling of classified material? Why would they do that when they know millions of Americans have a clearance, have repeated the same training year after year, and know she is guilty of many violations? They must be pretty certain they won&#39;t get called out.  We know Obama and Hillary are complicit. Most of us see trump as a wildcard, if he is then that is further threat of being called out. So either Trump is a Hillary stooge to throw her the election, or the FBI, DOJ, AG, and president already know Hillary will be the next president. Or maybe there won&#39;t be an election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Institutional racism is long over in the US. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t @ssholes...but they act as individuals, it&#39;s not the squad, unit, or force...it&#39;s just that @sshole. The cops train, test, audit and review everything. When there&#39;s an officer involved homocide, IA immediately starts an investigation. It&#39;s not all perfect, but they do. If there&#39;s racism, it will be dealt with. Not to mention, these guys know the public wont just sit back and take it. Obviously, look at the riots and assassinations already. 
But there&#39;s another side to all this. The media. As soon as word gets out that a black person was shot by a white cop, the media blasts that an Evil Racist White Cop murdered a defenseless black kid. Investigation barely even started and no matter what, that cop is guilty. Doesn&#39;t even matter what the investigation turns up. Not to mention, every reasonable criminal knows they have to run and fight with the cops to be legit. And to top it off, there are &quot;political action groups&quot; call for the murder of all cops. 
Do you think, maybe these guys are nervous and scared? I would be. (Except for a few of the really crazy ones, I know they are.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres no way in hell that they are ALL just misunderstandings and rushes to judgement so whether or not its true in this specific case, it doesnt change the fact that they have been gunning down innocent minorities for a very long time. On purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I have done the research. I&#39;m not saying @ssholes don&#39;t exist. I&#39;m saying institutional racism doesn&#39;t within the LEO. Statistics tell a different story. Ever hear the saying, &quot; In God I trust, all others bring data.&quot;? If you look at the data, black people being killed by cops is about 25% of those killed by cops. But, they are over 70% of total interactions with cops. Over half of those killed by cops are white,  yet represent less than 30% of total interactions. I can understand the outrage if it was the case, but statistically it&#39;s not. Almost every time a tragedy makes it to the news, the media is calling it racism loud and clear. Once the investigation is over, if racism cannot be proven you just don&#39;t hear about it anymore. Just like that Mike Hughes fella in Dallas. The media plastered his picture everywhere calling him a suspect. Turns out, he&#39;s a hell of a guy. As soon as shots were fired he handed over his rifle and asked how else he could help. As soon as he learned he was a suspect,  he turned himself in to clear his name. The media showed his face everywhere when they thought he was a bad guy. Once they learned he&#39;s a good guy, they change then subject. The problem isn&#39;t evil racists. The problem is the media lying to you. They are playing you and think you won&#39;t figure it out. Don&#39;t let them play you like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think it is trump covering up his not so great handling of the two people shot and killed, and pushing a racial agenda to get more people on his side. This makes him look good with the police friendly people and supports  his stance that minorities have an anti-white rhetoric. Hmmmmm.......</p>

<p>Or it could be Bernie honestly. This was him retaliating against the BLM movement that took the Mic from his hands however long ago and the minorities that voted en masse for Hillary. </p>

<p>You downvoters are sheep. Care to tell me why my theories are bunk? Wake the fuck up and look at what&#39;s happening right in front of your eyes instead of jumping on some bandwagon. It&#39;s like I&#39;m watching msm in this sub nowadays </p>
