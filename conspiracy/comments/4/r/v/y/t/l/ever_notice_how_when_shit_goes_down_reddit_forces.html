       Oh without a doubt. There is massive manipulation going on and tons of idea's are completely gone. Things I used to see on this subreddit seemed to just vanish one day. They down vote everything, funnel us all into one place, make society ridicule us, it's almost like there is a control system or something.

       It's not the conspiracies everyone is trying to show you. It's the ties between the conspiracies and what the holy books are attempting to teach. There are so many lies that the truth even on conspiracy sites is ridiculed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the possibility of everything being wrong. In my mind everything we are currently taught is wrong. You just need to find the perspective for yourself. Conspiracies when I first started joining this, which wasn't even long ago, lead me down a path of not believing anything I was ever told. Conspiracies today are basically one person saying a point and then everyone else using sources from within the system to disprove it. It's sad honestly, if people knew what we were really trying to teach here it'd be a way smoother ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example what if sun cycles created global warming? What if our excess carbon dioxide isn't creating the heat? What if plants eat carbon dioxide to grow? Is global warming really a thing from that perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
       If 9/11 is an inside job then to what extent will they go to prove humans are violent and insane? What if mass shootings are staged and even murders on blacks, by police officers to create racial tension?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the same tactic is used between whites and browns?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if that tactic has been used to divide all of humanity. Everything we are taught blames someone for the problem. What if all problems stemmed from the same location?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if humanity is divine off birth and wants nothing to do with violence or hatred? That's where this really goes. I know before I figured this out I blamed myself for not being good enough for everything, as many of you I'm sure. You can't get straight A's because you just aren't good enough. You can't be a professional sports player, gamer or rapper because you just aren't good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's wrong. You are good enough and the disconnect between humanity now and what humanity used to be is simply the fact that we don't believe. I believe humans can do anything. I mean anything. We can see right from wrong, we can see the problems and exactly where they came from when we know the information. Before we acquire the information no man can tell you how to figure out the puzzle called life. Very few truly figure it out. This conspiracy site is also part of the problem. The site makes everyone  fear, so does alex jones. They aren't real. There is nothing to fear. If you are divine you will stay alive and won't have any obstacles that are impossible to conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if certain drugs are good and there are 100 bad drugs for every good drug? What if drugs are being created to be bad to make a bad name for certain drugs?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe anything and I'll probably be down voted for this. It's a massive illusion nothing is real. If you can see it for yourself you get to a state of bliss because you know you can't change the way things are, you can only change yourself. Happiness is a choice and so is everything else in life. If you see past the illusion far enough you value far more drastic things than you used to.
      </p>
      <p>
       My perspective is constantly changing but one thing will never change. That's the fact that we're already gods, we're like computers, we learn and we're coded by the way we perceive reality. Everything we perceive right now is like a virus trying to wedge it's way into our minds. Remove all the virus' and you are there. It's a tricky path because it's filled with cognitive dissonance, but maybe it's your ego that's holding you back. People are proud of their accomplishments, everyone accomplishes something. People are proud of themselves and will fight for what they believe in. Don't fight for it, don't believe in shit. That's the moral of the story. Just like I can poke holes in global warming and mass shootings you can poke holes in everything in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't get high grades? Maybe it's just bullshit and some people can remember things better than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't become a politician? Maybe there are secret channels to becoming a great politician.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't make new friends? Maybe your flaws in your personality need to be smoothed over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's hard realizing everything that's wrong with yourself, but that's exactly what's holding this whole thing in place. It's also why drugs are given a bad name, they give you the disconnect and let you know you are a spirit, not a human. Don't fear death.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: This is my opinion people on conspiracy won't agree in masses but you should really use your brain and think.

Thank you so much for giving me just a little bit of hope. I appreciate people like yourself.

       I btw do believe that theres a stronger correlation between sun cycles and the sun heat bouncing off of the clouds, thus creating the higher temps, then humans causing it.

       In the end everybody wins. Hosts and parasites get their own ways. The parasites will be dissatisfied, because their hosts didn't want to live with them anymore. Then they'll turn on each other, making the weakest among them the new hosts, until they decay and all eventually die or go dormant like dessicated vampires.

       I never liked this practice.  If something is big and happening who cares if it takes up 10 of the 25 front page slots.  It's just a measure of popularity, and when that popularity subsides it will rebalance itself through downvotes.

       I was just thinking this about the Dallas thread-
I want to read a variety of angles/theories or sources on it, but I want each major one in their own thread. I can't sift through 840+ comments that are unsorted.... What a way to kill the ability to research multiple viewpoints and investigation into this thing...

       This happened to me on tumblr a few years ago. I wrote an article on the book 'missing 411' which garnered about 3,000 notes in less than 3 hours, when all of a sudden the notes diminished to a single digit. It was insane. If you research the book and the cover-ups, you'll realize why.

       Which missing 411?  It seems to be a podcast and a book in different iterations.  I would love to pick a new author that could lead me to the gas chamber from the list

       There is something going on that they aren't talking about. I can't wait until he writes the book about Florida and Texas. He said there was so much stuff in those two states he decided to seperate them and write a separate book about them alone.
