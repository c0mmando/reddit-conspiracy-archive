       As someone who dips my toe in the conspiracy waters infrequently I can't completely figure out what this latest wave of "cops killing citizens" stories are all about. I know that there is a pretty well accepted idea in conspiracy circles that usually when there is a huge media wave that came up suddenly, it's generally to distract from some larger, more important thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that they're trying to distract us from the fact that it was just exposed that our government is completely corrupt in the FBI not recommending charges on Hillary? It seems that all of the hub bub some people were raising has completely been washed away by the stories of police killing people and the ensuing "protests" (unfortunately most of the populace seems completely unphased by Comey admitting that Hillary did something illegal and contrary to all of her public statements and in the next breath said the FBI wasn't recommending to charge her)
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it something larger?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd appreciate hearing any theories on what the media is trying to distract us from now as I don't want to be distracted by this nonsense. The loss of life and the military-police state are huge problems but I know that the reason they're in the media this week is far beyond the reason they are trying to sell us.

       There are millions of Americans with security clearances. Every one of them must complete the same annual refresher training course to maintain their clearance. The laws Hillary broke, are specifically covered in that training. Each and every person who looked the other way for Hillary is guilty of that same crime. Additionally, the law tells us we must report for prosecution any violations of those laws. So, there's a lot of guilty people in this. The shootings and outrage started the same day the FBI proved they are traitors. As more folks have picked up on this, the shootings and outrage have gotten more attention.

       Right when the entire nation is in backlash over the non-indictment of Shilliary.....what do ya know....back to the old racial violence meme. This always seems to rear its head when they need the world to ignore a pressing scandal...or just when they need to rile up the constituents on either side

       everything you see in the world today by MSM is here to distract you, lead you into a war you don't want and save the status quo.

      <p>
       stop being a slave and start loving all your brothers and sisters around the world including the elite (which is quite frankly the hardest part). be clear in your actions. don't tolerate their lies and killings. give them fair trials.

       BLM exists as a way to make sure that the races don't integrate in their fight against the elite.  The reason why 80% of blacks voted for Clinton is more based on history, but they reason they didn't switch to Bernie over time is a lot more suspicious.

       They did, their votes weren't counted in these primaries though. Any one legitimately left hanging on to Clinton is only doing so to back the "minority" candidate. Sanders is too old, too white, and too male to even be considered by certain people.

       I agree with all of what you've said but with the "don't tolerate their lies and killings and give them fair trials" bit, you make it sound like we can just round 'em up and bring them to justice when it obviously doesn't work that way, since they own the justice system.

       My theory is that this will all come to a halt by October or the coming weeks to Election Day so people can focus on choosing a nominee. I noticed that this shit escalated as soon as the primaries ended, as there was no more dirt to put on Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let me just add that there wasn't a single act of terrorism committed for the entire first half of the year during the primaries unless I'm mistaken. From what I remember the last one before Orlando (hoax) was San Bernadino in December. From my personal experience I can also confirm that blacks have been getting killed by police all year and it's been recorded and posted on World Star. The news ignored this everytime until when Hillary Clinton got involved in a scandal. Let me tell you what I think about these two police shootings... the first one in Louisiana was definitely real. The second one, I believe, is a hoax. It was far too well recorded to criminalize the police and spark outrage. I doubt the media got this lucky with diverting attention from Hillary Clinton's email scandal that two black men were killed in two days by police.

       Why is that buffoon Allison next to a fucking open window filming this? Live gunshots, and this girl and another guy are just watching like deer in headlights. Take cover for errant bullets, you fools!

       In 2009 someone outside my apartment building let out about 6 shots from a handgun. I was watching an episode of The Office in my room. I got up immediately, flipped the light switch off, and crouched next to my bed to shield myself further from a stray bullet, nowhere near the window. These people are beyond fucking dumb. The first person phone video stuff is capturing almost nothing of import lately. At least not what we are allowed to see.
