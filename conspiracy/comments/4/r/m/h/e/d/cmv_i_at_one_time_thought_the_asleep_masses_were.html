       You're not a jerk at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an all-out war on logic and reason, in order to intellectually neuter the public and render them powerless. It's widely known that the CIA [back in 1967] coined the term "conspiracy theorist" in order to stigmatize whistleblowers who were actually showing causal relationships between things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a cheating spouse, the government had to convince the public "not to believe its lying eyes". So they came up with an interesting methodology: Promoting the concept of the "random nature of the universe". In which all pattern-recognition is an illusion. (By switching the public over to this thought-system, they cut out the legs from under the whistleblowers--who rely on their audiences seeing the causal relationships between different things.)
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a bunch of CIA-funded shills [like the Amazing Randi, as just one prominent example] go around promoting the "random universe" theory . . . and how you noticing patterns is all "an illusion". Randi, by the way, sits on the board of a pedophile front group called "The False Memory Foundation". He basically goes around the country, defending pedophiles from the accusations of their victims. His methodology? To convince juries that "it's all an illusion". That memories and pattern-recognition are all false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Randi, by the way, shared office space in the same building with a CIA field office [at 2941 Fairview Park Drive, Suite 105, Falls Church, Virginia]. His JREF organization is funded by the OSI (Office of Scientific Intelligence, a branch of the CIA's Science Directorate). He's been implicated in participating in their MK-Ultra program, and has been called in to defend subjects with CIA ties to the famous "Project Monarch" CIA pedophile program.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the most frustrating thing: Watching these government-funded propagandists promoting themselves as "Champions of Science," when science is all about pattern-recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientific method is based on
       <em>
        replicable
       </em>
       experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does "replicable" mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       It means: PATTERNS are established.
      </p>
      <p>
       So patterns DO exist. (They're not an "illusion".) We are not in a "random universe". If we were there would be no laws of physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So these people aren't "champions of science". They're promoting a deeply pseudo-scientific position: namely, that patterns are an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in summation: You can always spot a shill when they tell you that 1) Pattern-recognition is an illusion of cognition, and that we live in a random universe and 2) That we should never believe our lying eyes, and 3) That we should ostracize anyone pointing out patterns and causal relationships between events, dismissing them as "crazy" conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: Make no mistake. Up until the modern era, the whole of education was bent toward teaching people how to develop their skills at pattern recognition. Aristotle, for instance, said that the surest sign of genius was the poetic ability to coin a new metaphor. Why a metaphor? Because it demonstrated the ability to see patterns between seemingly unrelated things. . . .  It represents a dramatic break with the entire history of Western education to suddenly start teaching people that "seeing patterns" was bad, and a sign of craziness. The province of only conspiracy theorists and kooks. And that "sane, respectable people" stayed away from noticing patterns and causal relationships. It's all part of the deliberate dumbing-down of the populace.

       Is Randi affiliated with all the attacks discrediting SRA and trauma based mind control/ multiple personalities etc.?  Also, in all my research over the many years, i have never been able to find concrete evidence for Monarch.  I definitely believe it exists and is prominent in Hellywood, but i want something i can point to for the skeptical.  I can point at wtc 7 and say it defies physics, i can say dont you think the pozners, rosenbergs, parkers, tsarnevs etc have some (more than) weird connections, but Monarch seems very elusive.  If you could enlighten me it would be much appreciated.

       Yeah, Project Monarch is going to remain elusive, because it's so horrific [it touches on so many of our cultural taboos] that people don't even want to think about it. Which ensures that it's never reported on TV . . . and which enables the people engaging in it veritable immunity from scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Project Monarch was basically a splinter program off of MK-Ultra. Both programs were based on achieving mind control by first psychologically breaking your subject. Sex abuse was routinely used.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife was reading this blog by a guy who stumbled across creepy MK-Ultra-style documents (at a place called Indian Lake). In the file folders he found pictures of little kids. What was eerie was that most of them seemed to be blind. (Here's one:

        http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/619/1673/1600/32.jpg
       </a>
       ) At any rate, he ended up finding some creepy abandoned building in the middle of the woods, with hidden prison cells in them, moldering toys, and camera-monitors mounted on the walls to watch the inmates. Here's the link:

       You are awesome!  I hate to be one of those guys, but i am intimately aware of larry king, jimmy saville, johnny gosch, hastert, epstein, alfred kinsey and so on.  It's getting people to understand these are not "isolated incidents" but actual glimpses at the world beyond the veil. I think there needs to be a concerted effort by those in this community to develop a curriculum integrating basic psychology, real history, and correlation that DOES equal causation in a non threatening approach towards those who are unaware.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing i have found that can raise some eyebrows is using 1984 as a segue, ask why the people giving us the news are cia interns that are part of the vanderbilt family (anderson pooper) or the self explanatory mika brezenski (i butchered that name).  The elites are using elites to give us their news?  Come on people!
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, who are your favorite youtubers.  I love freeradio/jeff c, corbett, pocketsofthefuture, even the vigilant christian is awesome sometimes.  Obviously No Agenda is swell, and i must curse here...FUCK ALEX JONES!

       I basically hover toward economic podcasts on Youtube: Things like the X22 report. On the lighter side, I don't agree with him on a lot of things, but I like the spirit of Bill Whittle: his unapologetic Americanism and masculine resistance to the prevailing decadent popular culture. I saw his presentation on the Origins of Political Correctness, and was a fan ever since:

       Completely agree, it's time that people find out that thinking that correlation does not equal causation at some level is illogical, and that we were told to think illogically our entire lives. We need to prevent ourselves from being completely dumbed down, purely emotional "thinkers" before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your Youtuber choices and I agree that Alex Jones is dangerously misleading, and he is not telling the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tge only thing about your Youtuber picks is that most of them have a lot of subscribers. It could be reverse psychology, but I am tempted to think that their YouTube channels wouldn't do so well if they were putting out the truth that they REALLY don't want you to believe (in other words, something that Alex Jones wouldn't "report").

       It's never just one thing. Some people are ignorant and uninformed. Some have been brainwashed by a lifetime of programming coming at them from every direction. Some are just plain worn out. Some are idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think you're selling another shifting segment short. More and more people are figuring out things aren't like they thought they were. I have had more conversations with people in the past six months, through the rise of Trump, even from people who are against him, that something's not right. That these events are not random.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wouldn't give up or a be a jerk. Buckle your seat belt. Things are only going to get wilder from here.

       Don't worry, I will never give up, nor am I a complete ass to people, overbearing and do I rant sometimes? Definitely.  We all have a little narcissism in us, and this post was just to vent and talk about the scary sides of my attitudes towards the masses.  I am just frustrated, if I really thought I was better/ smarter than everyone, well, that makes me no better than the Clinton's, rothschilds, or trumps of the world does it?  Some days though, I just want people to WAKE THE EFF UP!   I see the general public as crackheads, if they would just clean themselves up and take control, I believe everyone is capable of reaching their full human potential, this all comes from a place of love.  Sometimes though I snap and just chalk it up to everyone is an idiot, which is just not true.

       Nah, not a jerk. I tried getting my family to explain their political beliefs. They can't. Their argument is "this is my opinion because I have an opinion and this is it." They will sometimes follow that up with a Family Guy or South Park reference. I think they are bots.

       There's a lot of people who are asleep that only care about the 50 yards around them at the moment. I can't help but think globally and that everyone needs our help. Just wish I knew what I could do to actually make something happen...

       According to recent studies, conformist, rebellious, or something in between type of behavior is hardwired in our brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will never believe in alternative explanations until others around them believe it first.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is not bad news. In fact, it's good news. You don't need to convince 100% of the people. You need to reach the ones who are not conformists. The conformists will turn when the herd turns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brit Labs did a short video on this recently, using MRIs to check if someone was a conformist, rebellious or in between.

       I think that we live in a society where the thought police is everybody around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to casually mention to a co-worker that 9/11 might be an inside job, I might get in trouble. Even friends and family might think I'm "crazy".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found, though, that some even acknowledge conspiracies, but they just don't care. That's what fascinates me. It's the people that believe the government is capable, but they do nothing to further their research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people, sadly, think the world is just and fair for some reason. They think our current government is here to help us and that elections are real. They vote and feel proud. Yes, people are waking up, but I'm convinced that it's not a huge percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some may claim that we are more educated now more than ever, I actually don't believe so. I think people are mostly programmed, and it's so hard to break a life of programming. Even for myself, I would say it took 10 solid years. And I had experienced some pretty awful things to get to that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       People suffer but differently now. In the US, at least, even the poor generally aren't starving or anything like that. I think it's so easy to become apathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found that one is unlikely to search for the truth if their lives are comfortable. Why would they want to break that illusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance is bliss after all. And in a way, I don't blame people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think for those of who have found something deeper...it can be a lonely feeling.

       People are not too stupid to understand. That's a lie we tell ourselves that inflates our egos. Everyone likes to inflate their perception of themselves. It feels great. Actually, this is not a deficit of intelligence, but rather a deficit of emotional fortitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear is the mind killer. It shuts down complex though. It facilitates quick simple thought. There is actually a change in blood flow from internal organs to muscles and inside of the brain for speed over complexity. This is so that we can fight or flee quickly for survival in a natural environment. In the modern world, it often gets in our way. We're usually better off staying out of fear and thinking about things while we're calm, because we face more complex problems and have more time to think to make better choices. To get there we often have to go through the fears that stop us from even looking at certain information and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious people don't deny the arguments of atheism simply because they are stupid people. Again, that inflates our egos to believe. They deny them, because they quickly realize the implications of those ideas and become afraid. They fear eternal damnation for questioning their faith. They were taught this belief of fear. Also they fear that if it is true that their faith is false, it means that there is no God at all and life is essentially meaningless. Watch the eyes of the true believers as they are confronted with such faith shattering arguments and see their terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going past that terror of the realized implications of ideas and information and actually forcing yourself to consider them anyway overcomes this mind control device. People don't want to think about the perpetual slavery inherent in our debt based fiat currency system, the centralized control of elites being used to centralize control even further toward inescapable tyranny, or the idea of hostile fear feeding, suffering generating ETs that resemble demons working with our elites. All of these things have implications that make people feel fear. They don't want to feel that way, so they just dismiss the ideas without honest consideration in order to maintain their comparatively pleasant state of mind. They joke about the ideas often though and, from a third person perspective, it resembles the religious joking about stupid atheists.

       I did, I recognized the pretentious sounding nature of it.  Complexity is subjective, many people still think Saddam had something to do with 9/11 ffs.  I mean to us, in our circle jerk echo chamber, that is not complex, but to the general public....well, ya know.

       Cognitive dissonance explains part of it. But there's a definite effort being made to keep people uninformed. There's also an effort to discredit the opinions of those who have things even partly figured out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Complex geopolitical events might seem complex. But they arise from a few simple human behavioral traits. One of them is the tendency for the most selfish and aggressive people to gain power. Another is the tendency for those people to always want more than they already have. There's also the strong tendency for individuals to put their own needs ahead of everybody else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand these 3 things, the world makes a lot of sense. The countries where life is shitty are the very same countries where people are the most selfish and aggressive... (e.g. Africa and the Middle East) The countries where life is a lot better are the countries where people are more cooperative and sharing (e.g. Scandinavia, Japan)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the NBA being rigged... why not? It's no different than the stock market. Make it look random so the little people can enjoy the show. But, for the chosen few, a scripted result means plenty of money to be made betting on a sure thing. They also want to make sure the same team doesn't win every year because it's better for business.

       You are awesome!  I hate to be one of those guys, but i am intimately aware of larry king, jimmy saville, johnny gosch, hastert, epstein, alfred kinsey and so on.  It's getting people to understand these are not "isolated incidents" but actual glimpses at the world beyond the veil. I think there needs to be a concerted effort by those in this community to develop a curriculum integrating basic psychology, real history, and correlation that DOES equal causation in a non threatening approach towards those who are unaware.

       One thing i have found that can raise some eyebrows is using 1984 as a segue, ask why the people giving us the news are cia interns that are part of the vanderbilt family (anderson pooper) or the self explanatory mika brezenski (i butchered that name).  The elites are using elites to give us their news?  Come on people!
