       Genuinely curious as to why these files would still need to be classified by the U.S. Government for national security when they are now over 50 years old. Thanks for any responses.

       A number of reasons come to mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Technology - Military. Can't risk it getting into the hands of foreign states. Or maybe even the people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Technology - Energy. Just imagine an alternative energy source to oil. That alone will kill the Petro-Dollar and destroy the global economy, bankrupt hundreds of large energy related corporations, put millions out of work, cause massive civil unrest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Unity - An external enemy would unite the people of the planet. At the moment, we are controlled to have conflicts with certain nations, religions, races, etc. This keeps us busy and allows easier manipulation - simply divide and conquer. If the people united, the first thing they would do is over throw corrupt governments.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Control - There is a government sanctioned religious movement towards atheism. Theories are taught as fact in schools. Humans evolved accidentally on this planet. There is no God. Every man for himself. Be selfish, be greedy, screw everyone. There are no consequences. A selfish, greedy individual is easier to control than someone who believes a higher entity is watching them and will judge them. Any proof that intelligent life exists or is abundant on other planets will get people to be more spiritual. Especially if the aliens bring their own studies disproving evolution or they bring proof of intelligent design. Or worst, they bring their own holy books which validate any earth based religions. Edward Bernays taught us that an ego centric individual, who lives to consume, is the easiest to control. A total sheep. Eat, shit, sleep, fuck, repeat, follow the shepherd.

       Was with you until the Control section. That's just beyond ludicrous. If anything, aliens would wreck modern religion, and would probably be the reason for its origins to begin with (i.e., angels of heaven being extraterrestrials). I'm not saying that I believe that, just that you took quite a leap in logic and highlighted a lot of misunderstanding in this section.

       And then you have the notion of certain craft being capable of violating your airspace at will, outmaneuvering your own aircraft, disabling your nuclear warheads, and doing anything they please to your nation and its inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
       No military on Earth would want to admit such a "threat" or "potential threat" were to exist, even if it were benign, and would perhaps opt to use their own military and intelligence apparatus to recover any evidence, intimidate witnesses, release disinformation in the media to make the topic appear taboo or implausible, to keep such information out of the hands of anyone who doesn't have a "need to know" (or a sensitive compartmented / special access clearance, granted on a case-by-case basis).

       notice how they denied the b-2 for 30 years, and now it's in airshows? wait another 10-15, and we'll see those "ufos" be the three-gens-ago "stealth" fighters/bombers.

       Probably because there is information the gov't doesn't want to be made public. Of all the thousands of UFO reports, all it takes is one genuine report of the earth being visited by beings from another world/planet/whatever to throw things into chaos.  The basic concepts of religion and our place in the universe would be called into question.

       I disagree about things being thrown into chaos. Religions should be able to fit that stuff in in a way that makes sense. Religion is about explaining how the spiritual aspects of the universe work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we go, Christianity - God waited until humanity was ready before revealing this particular aspect of his grand design. Thus, the souls from before and after the revelation could discuss what life was like (once together in heaven) the same way that heaven itself is not revealed in its full glory until death.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just all part of the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       BOOM! ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       (Any other religions you want me to update? He he he.)
      </p>
      <p>
       - Also, I don't see how one group of humans could hide an alien presence from another group of humans. What sort of technology would aliens have to even reach Earth, anyway? Utter hubris to think it could be kept secret through the supposed magic of bureaucratic paperwork (or through the attempt at suppression of such papers).

       I'm not sure about your exact terminology but yes indeed, I agree.  Most if not all UFOs are man made IMO.  Any info about even the old models would reveal too much about the secret propulsion tech.

       there are many types of ufo. these ones have a peculiar way of moving from point to point. i've only had one ufo experience and i was with 20+ others who saw it and there were multiple small lights zig zagging through the sky

       They hold technology that is too advanced for the masses - in their opinion. Regardless of where the came from (Tesla, aliens, etc), anti-gravity and/or free energy exists, and is being kept a secret for obvious reasons. Seems standard issue behavior for a nefarious cabal using the US as their puppet hyper-power.

       There's so much assumptions in this statement. What says they've traveled for a long distance? What says they would want to say hello at all? How can we have any notion of their moral, patience or will?

       I am more inclined to believe the theory of them being watchers, just like we let "nature" happen some times. The same way are "they" sitting back, watching nature unfold on Earth as it is "suppose" to happen. A little bit like when parents let children fail at something because it's a learning experience rather a "this is the correct way" experience.

       That is mathematically highly improbable (see the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">
        Fermi paradox
       </a>
       ). In my opinion there are only two real options that make sense. Either humans exist in some kind of computer simulation (which would explain our lack of even the discovery of alien life), or there is an intergalactic governing body which has placed the Earth under some kind of quarantine. There are of course other possibilities (that life exists only on earth, or that ALL life in the universe is simply too different to even recognize each other as such, are only two examples), but I consider them hugely improbable given the size of the universe, and even our primitive ability to penetrate it with various signals and emissions.

       There is compelling evidence that our current civilization isn't the first, let alone the peak of human society that has existed on Earth (and perhaps even Mars). That notwithstanding, it isn't OUR presence that isn't strange by not being noticed, it's the billions of other forms of life and all their manifestations (I won't bore you with the sci fi possibilities of what THEY could be, beyond perhaps Von Neumann machines), that are highly improbably absent.

       The speed of light is certainly achievable. By energetic emissions such as radio. The time frames for these to reach us from stars are negligible. Space should be filled with barking dogs, and is instead as quiet as a grave. It's a strange mystery with only a few probable answers. I would consider contact with actual physical beings in flying saucers to be the absolute LAST way humans would discover alien life. Though there is very compelling evidence that this has in fact occurred.

       To be honest, I haven't been interested in UFOs etc for many years, as the levels of dis-info on that particular topic are so extreme as to make any actual research impossible. Whitley Streibers "Dark Light" was an interesting read but I've now been informed by friends I trust that he's also a dis-info agent, so it's hard to point to physically published work. I just find it impossible to discount the many MANY accounts of sightings and even contact from people from all walks of life including members of the military, and law reinforcement. That line of inquiry for me was of interest about 20 years ago, so I'm sorry I can't point you to links or anything. I'm not sure if I'd like to actually meet aliens, but I sure would be interested in knowing why the heck we have no evidence of their existence. That fact alone is interesting for it's own reasons, as I mentioned in my first comment.
