<p>I&#39;d like to share my theory with you about population control. If you see any flaws, don&#39;t hesitate to point them out as I just thought of this last night and I&#39;m still trying to wrap my head around it.</p>

<p>They (Governments, Corporations, the Elite) have already started controlling the population: the income inequality is an on purpose thing to weed out the best most obedient workers from the rest of us, so they can be the &quot;elite race&quot;. Almost like what Hitler was trying to do, but on a larger more sneaky scale. </p>

<p>They&#39;re feeding us garbage, poisonous food, unless you can afford organically grown non-GMO foods. This will lead to lasting health effects, eventually killing poor people and those who don&#39;t eat organic non-GMO.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve poisoned our water supply with fluoride, a neurotoxin, to keep us dumb and incapable of thinking for ourselves. That is, unless you can afford Nestle&#39;s bottled water and only drink that.</p>

<p>They&#39;re taking our guns and weapons away so no one will fight back when they come to round us plebs up for the final faze of the pop control.</p>

<p>They watch your every move to determine if you&#39;re a threat to the society they want. If you are, they stage a mass shooting at your location, killing you and blaming the shooting on you.</p>

<p>There are more points to this. Think hard and take a look around. You&#39;ll see it.</p>

<p>Or I&#39;m nuts. Either way, feel free to point out any flaws with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One HUGE PROBLEM with your argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is, unless you can afford Nestle&#39;s bottled water and only drink that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nestle is a swiss company that is poisoning people with their food.  I can say that and not get sued by Nestle.  You know why?  Because I know that they know that I know they fucked up.  I had a long conversation with Nestle and scared the shit out of them.  They tried very hard to discredit me (and were successful because of my preexisting hiv medical condition), mostly making it difficult for me to sue on the basis that my symptoms aren&#39;t related to my condition.  so that&#39;s not stopping me from telling people the truth online.</p>

<p>I sent a sample of their powdered milk to a chemical lab in NJ and it came back with toxic levels of iron and arsenic.  More than 3x the allowable arsenic in codex alimentarius (UN&#39;s FDA); more than 50x the amount of iron stated on ingredients--enough to cause someone to die actually, if they consumed more than a few prepared fluid ounces.  Thankfully, I&#39;m a supertaster and I could immediately taste the metal in their product.</p>

<p>They fucked up.  I posted the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4a7fau/toxic_amounts_of_iron_found_in_nestle_nido_whole/">report on reddit</a>.  I also found that Nestle and Lindt (swiss companies) are <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4b3o0o/i_believe_swiss_companies_are_poisoning_our_food/">poisoning the chocolate with heavy metals also</a>. There is no way this is &#39;mistake&#39; btw.  Or an oversight by quality control.  This is purposeful.</p>

<p>If you trust Nestle you&#39;re a fool and you deserve death.  Actually.  Because I just informed you and if you&#39;re going to go around with this attitude that Nestle is safe somehow, becasue it comes in a bottle, or because &quot;it&#39;s Swiss&quot;, then you&#39;re giving up all your power and responsibility to corporations that mean to kill you.</p>

<p>You said it yourself--population control through toxic food.  </p>

<p>Why would Nestle be exempt because they are Swiss?  With whom do you think you&#39;re dealing?  Swiss are people who made their money funding both sides of all wars; their &#39;anonymous&#39; banks fund white collar crime and mafia activities around the world.  The swiss (octogon trust inc) banks laundered nazi gold and assets into shell corps half a century before the panama papers companies decided to do the same (with help from allen dulles no doubt)...ensuring the nazis got their assets back some time later since those funds were sent back to germany&#39;s single political party CDU now run by angela merkel decades later.  </p>

<p>And yes, Nazis ARE still around.  They are freemasons embedded as double agents in all influential orgs especially the intelligence agencies...thanks to a bad decision our military made in operation paperclip.</p>

<p>You really need to big up your history on the swiss and stop thinking they are such great guys, when really they are cryptofascist mountain nazi templars descendants whose &#39;neutral&#39; position is not only cowardly but profitable and amoral.  Just because you&#39;ve been brainwashed into thinking they are good because of a red cross of medicine...doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t shipping bodybags full of cocaine and drugs loaded into hearsts.  </p>

<p>And poisoning stupid americans with lead and dust and bat turds and metals in their hot chocolates because our FDA and USDA are either wholly incompetent or complicit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could be nuts, but you&#39;re not wrong.</p>

<p>Also, the GMO vs. non-GMO thing is another PR technique to confuse the issue. The issue isn&#39;t necessarily genetically engineered vs. non-GE but what we are genetically engineering <em>for.</em> People don&#39;t want to avoid GE because it&#39;s GE, they avoid it because it&#39;s bathed in poison or because the GE organism is mixing two things we&#39;d rather not mix and hasn&#39;t been well-tested yet - but that same poison is bathing our non-GE foods, too (wheat, sugar cane, grapes, pretty much any non-organic crop you can think of). However, if they are able to spin us up arguing about GMO vs. non-GMO tech (which is convenient for their cut &amp; paste talking points and abusive insults), they slip that poison past us without argument.</p>

<p>Notice the pro-GMO folks never ever laud the non-browning apple - they laud Roundup-ready crops. There&#39;s a reason for this, they&#39;re not &quot;pro-science,&quot; they&#39;re not pro-GMO, they&#39;re pro-selling poison by the truckload.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccination campaigns are part of the depopulation agenda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So in 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health—their eponymous foundation would come into being in two years—they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources ÷ people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control. Thus, vaccines made no sense to him: Why save kids only to consign them to life in overcrowded countries where they risked starving to death or being killed in civil war?</p>

<p>In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Population control is much needed right now. </p>

<p>Taken from another redditor........</p>

<p>&quot;With the population just over 7 Billion and climbing, the world is absolutely strained. Resources are running out even faster than ever. Oil will be all but gone by the end of the century, and agricultural land already covers more than a third of the worlds land area. All this will do is cause suffering for all but the richest people.
Is it morally wrong to think that maybe killing 3 or 4 Billion people is a good thing for the benefit of humankind? Part of me thinks that we need to get over the &#39;ohnoes, everyone deserves life&#39; attitude that could cause us all to be fucked.
I heard a story once about a deer population. There were thousand or so deer on an island, and hunters wanted a permit to hunt, but were refused. They said they needed to for population control. Next year the population doubles. The hunters begged again to kill off some of the deer. The winter came and went and only about a dozen deer were left because they all starved to death. Anyways Im gettin off track so my tl;dr
TL;DR Am I evil because I think the worlds population should be cut in half or less?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s strained because the 1% are greedy fucks. If we invented free energy (which tesla already did), im sure the world would be able to sustain us all perfectly fine. What they mean is there are too many &quot;poor people&quot; who never had a chance against the rigged system in the first place. Remember, we all can live on this planet together... just not in the way we do at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the income inequality is an on purpose thing to weed out the best most obedient workers from the rest of us, so they can be the &quot;elite race&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL the Chinese sweatshop workers are the elite race. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re feeding us garbage, poisonous food, unless you can afford organically grown non-GMO foods. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you believe GMO foods are poison? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;ve poisoned our water supply with fluoride, a neurotoxin, to keep us dumb and incapable of thinking for ourselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile here you are. Apparently enlightened. Do you filter your water? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re taking our guns and weapons away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have they really? Gun laws seem the same as they&#39;ve been for quite a while. People in the US still own guns, sooooo what happened there?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They watch your every move to determine if you&#39;re a threat to the society they want. If you are, they stage a mass shooting at your location, killing you and blaming the shooting on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that were the case, there should be a lot more mass shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The points are not false... just a little over embellished with passion. We have to remember; if we want people to take us seriously, we must not yell or scare them. Present this info with calm and coordinated facts, allowing them to do the research. Remember to make them wonder &quot;is this stuff true?&quot;  By giving them the bait and saying, well... &quot;your life, your responsibility,&quot; they just might take a peek on the internet to see if you&#39;re right or wrong.</p>
