<h2>Stellar proof that you blindly accept when they tell you (or dont tell you) without doing any research or investigation of your own. In the world of information, ignorance is a choice my friend.</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Defense Production Act</strong> Signed in 2014
The Act authorizes the President to require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense (contracts to regulate normal operation in times of emergency). This Act also authorizes the President to establish mechanisms (such as regulations, orders or agencies) to allocate materials, services and facilities to promote national defense (control of resources). Lastly, the Act authorizes the President to control the civilian economy so that scarce and/or critical materials necessary to the national defense effort are available for defense needs.

</ul>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li><strong>National Defense Authorization Act</strong> Signed in 2014
Legalizes martial law in the United States. Allows the United States military to act as a police force, and arrest or use force against any person (including American citizens) suspected of terrorism. Further, they may hold these persons without trial indefinitely.

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Even if the president never uses this power, the fact that he has such unlimited authority over Americans and their property doesn’t sound comforting to people assuming they live in the land of free.</p>

<hr/>

<p>HERE is your media telling you to believe this person is a &quot;victim&quot; of a mass shooting by a &quot;terrorist&quot;:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu9bi4Eyfgw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu9bi4Eyfgw</a></p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s your media ACTUALLY reporting a real incident that they cannot avoid, due to the nature of its recent popularity: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAQbr0u2iw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTAQbr0u2iw</a></p>

<p>Notice how the real victims of this crime are SAD and CRYING!
Why is once scenario an in your face one on one interview. yet the real incident only requires a press conference? </p>

<p>You feel safe living in a police state still?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that a threat? :) </p>

<p>At any rate: try and find out by boarding a plane and then come back to us if they let you on it or not. If you can travel without the slightest bother, then it&#39;s just you being paranoid.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass anymore what the Ziomerican goobermint thinks of me. I&#39;m a white European and not in a gazillion years will I ever atempt to visit the US with the insanely degrading TSA nonsense they put us through. It&#39;s them who are losing out on tourist dollars, not me. The States aren&#39;t that interesting anyway, just propped up nonsense or at most the very same we have over here, only our stuff being way older and more authentic. </p>

<p>I do think there&#39;s a lot of great folks in the States, like most guys around this sub. My country was turned into a tribute paying client kingdom of yours, we have been disarmed, degraded and demoralized ... so I&#39;m by no means still able to lend a hand even if I wanted to. You guys are on your own with this one. The world can&#39;t do jackshit about all the insanity your experiencing, most even don&#39;t have a clue how bad it all is. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll have to come from the inside, but don&#39;t bet on it, don&#39;t try be a hero and don&#39;t do anything stupid. Most folks you consider your countrymen, your people, are just cynical, cowardly, dumbed down and programmed drones, just like mine. It&#39;s no use getting into trouble over any of it. Fuck &#39;em all. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you have a full understanding of the laws currently in place here that give the government the ability to label ANYONE a terrorist.</p>

<p>Just because someone meets the classification doesn&#39;t mean they are put on the no-fly list. </p>

<p>Check this out</p>

<p>My understanding of the system in place now is that it assigns a &quot;threat matrix&quot; to each person, based on all data available (surveillance data, cell phone/gps data, credit information, bank information, etc).</p>

<p>So you can take anything from my business and use it for &#39;defense needs&#39; ... and if you call me a terrorist for whatever reason... you can take me away too!</p>

<p>Complete and utter control on anyone they want without any scrutiny... It&#39;s just a matter of time before they start really pushing these Acts.</p>

<p>I have had upbringing much different from others, so it has been easier to accept without stressing out about it all the time.</p>

<p>But for most americans, that deify their politicians, and believe everything the news tells them, this is crazy talk. Thus they are sheeple.</p>

Between tracing money back to its donors, super delegates, the electoral college, and easily hackable electronic voting, your choice ends being made for you. Obama won&#39;t act on this, but a leader within the next 12 years will, just as Obama was able to use the new powers that Bush provided for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ve been hearing for 7 years and 8 months how Obama is going to impose martial law; he better hurry up, he&#39;s only got 4 months left!</p>

<p>You know how, in 1999, everyone was running around saying planes were going to fall out of the sky, and the electrical grid was going to crash, and everything was going to shut down across the globe, because computers weren&#39;t set up to handle a four-digit date?</p>

<p>And some of us knew this was stupid and foolish, but we couldn&#39;t convince the rest, because they <em>wanted</em> to believe the end was near.  They almost <em>needed</em> to believe it.</p>

<p>And now, in retrospect, those people look stupid and foolish, since planes did not fall out of the sky and mass hysteria did not ensue. </p>

<p>Some of us can see <em>before something happens</em> that what people are saying is a load of bullshit.  And some people have to actually go through it before they realize.  Same with the 2012 nonsense, and the Jade Helm OMG MARTIAL LAW WTF bullshit, and so on.</p>

<p>Guess you&#39;re one of the people who just has to get to December to realize there&#39;s going to be no martial law.  Of course, some of us can see that right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize these bills will carry on to the next president?  And then they&#39;ll renew them and they&#39;ll go on to the one after that, and so on? </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m so happy for you that you have a gift of the crystal ball and knowing before hand that everything is bullshit, that&#39;s clearly a divine gift.  But the facts are that history has shown us time and time again that governments act against their own people when they are given too much power.  So maybe nothing will happen, maybe the government just wants all this power over the people for no reason whatsoever.  I just see no good reason to take the risk and to put trust in people who have shown they have no problem lying directly to our faces.  That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.  So please tell me why that&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Hey Mr Government, my co-worker keeps talking about how something big is going to happen. I think he has been stockpiling food and weapons. I think he is one of those crazy conspiracy theorists you hear about on the news!!</p>
