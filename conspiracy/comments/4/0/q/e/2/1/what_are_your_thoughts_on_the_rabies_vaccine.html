        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s look at some facts and hear me out on this because if your conspiracy theories about vaccines are true, then they should be able to hold up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>Rabies is a terrifying disease, with a 100% fatality rate if left untreated. (Side note: the reason it hasn&#39;t killed is because that requires bodily fluids to mix (like in a bite), which is a terrible main method of transmission) (side note: the reason rabies hasn&#39;t killed all its hosts and died out is because it&#39;s tailored to live in certain animals without killing them for the same reason you don&#39;t burn your house down) And until the late 19th century, if you were bitten by a rabid animal, you&#39;d be better off shooting yourself before spiraling into madness and then dying quite painfully. Of course, this changed with Louis Pasteur, who invented a vaccine against rabies that has saved many, many lives. </p>

<p>If you look at statistics in the 20th century, you&#39;ll notice a huge drop off in cases of rabies, especially in developed nations, where the rabies vaccine is readily available. Why? Because the vaccine is a very effective way of treating rabies (side note: due to the long incubation period of the rabies virus, you can get the vaccine a few days after it enters you without any significant decrease in survival chances). In addition, animals being vaccinated against rabies prevents them from becoming transmission vectors, limiting the spread of rabies even further. (Side note: you can survive infection without the vaccine, but it requires using a risky procedure that could cause brain damage and has a low success rate)</p>

<p>So, armed with this knowledge, I&#39;d like you to give me your stance on the rabies vaccine. Would you receive it if you were bitten by a rabid animal? </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t delete this, it&#39;s a valid question and deleting this makes you no better than the people you accuse of cover ups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t called it a vaccine, a vaccine would imply shooting up anti-venom to prep the system for a future attack (not sure if that would even have the same effect, in this case). Anti-venom (rattle snake bite) and a rabbies shot wouldn&#39;t be considered the same (a vaccine). Not really sure what the point of your OP is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I didn&#39;t. The flu shot is different than receiving anti-venom, or in this case a rabbies shot. Those two are one in the same, and very different to than say the &quot;flu vaccine&quot;, or other vaccines. They are different, in this scenario. Your body cannot build a defense against a poison/vemon or rabbies. It&#39;s comparing apples to oranges... </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a true vaccine if you can get the shot after being bit.  If you asked me if I would &quot;vaccinate&quot; my kids for rabies before being bit,  I would say hell no.  If you asked me if I would give my kids a rabies shot after being bit by an animal,  of course I would. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not many people believe that vaccines don&#39;t work in principle. I think the main concern that people have about vaccines relates to the efficacy and side-effects of <strong>prophylactic</strong> vaccines (ie ones that immunise you against a disease that you might be exposed to in the future).</p>

<p>All vaccines involve some risk (side effects, serious adverse reaction, contaminated batch etc), even if it&#39;s very small.  The  risk/benefit ratio of a flu vaccine could be characterised as low(unknown) risk v a variable (zero to high) potential benefit. For an &quot;at risk&quot; demographic, a flu vaccine could be a life-safer. However, the UK NHS has acknowledged that last year&#39;s nationwide flu vaccine had virtually no benefit because it immunised against the wrong flu strains. In previous years a swine flu vaccine (tamiflu), despite being effective against flu, in some cases <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14239823">caused incurable narcolepsy in children</a>. That&#39;s a risk/reward ratio that many informed people would not consider acceptable.</p>

<p>To answer your question specifically, a therapeutic vaccine, such as the rabies vaccine is completely different, because once you have been bitten by a rabid animal, your risk of death is very high. The risk/benefit ratio of the vaccine could be characterised as virtually no risk/high benefit, so you&#39;d be daft not to have the vaccine.</p>

<p>From a conspiracy perspective (since that&#39;s what you came for!), there is also concern about the systemic risk (eg the incompetence, negligence of the pharma company and the authorities) of prophylactic vaccines, because they tend to be mass-vaccination programmes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Systemic risk is understandable, but ask yourself this: Why don&#39;t people who believe in these conspiracies file a class action lawsuit against the manufacturers then?</p>

<p>Is it because lawyers won&#39;t take the case?
And why wouldn&#39;t they take it when there&#39;s a chance that they could gain fame and money if the guy from the Internet is right?</p>

<p>Because they&#39;d never win, because they think the conspiracy theories are insane. They aren&#39;t being paid to not take the case, they aren&#39;t in on the conspiracy, there&#39;s no question on the bar test saying &quot;Would you reveal that we have a super secret conspiracy going on?&quot;, and they definitely aren&#39;t shape shifting lizard people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it so black and white, though? Would you elect to have a child of yours vaccinated with pandemrix? It might stop them from contracting flu, but it comes with say, a 1-10,000 risk they develop incurable narcolepsy.</p>

<p>I am not an anti-vaxxer, but there are some vaccines where the risk/benefit ratio is not as cut and dry as others. For that reason, I no longer elect to have a flu jab and this is an informed decision: they tend to make me feel lousy for 48 hours, they are of uncertain effectiveness, they come with a real (albeit very small) chance of serious side effects, and there&#39;s only a slim chance I&#39;d have caught flu anyway. </p>
