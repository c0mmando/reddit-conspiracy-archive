       It was published by Henry Ford in his own newspaper and has been proven false for ages. Ford was a well known anti-semitic and friend of Nazi germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, copy pasta because I don't want to type it out:
"Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the US in the 1920s. Adolf Hitler was a major proponent. It was studied, as if factual, in German classrooms after the Nazis came to power in 1933,[1] despite having been exposed as fraudulent by The Times of London in 1921. It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document."

       Don't be ridiculous. Do some research on your own. Or do you think Goldilocks is real to? 
Real conspiracies are actually happening and you're choosing to focus on hating jews. That's moronic.

       My man. The exact plan and way that the conspiracies are being executed are laid out page by page in the protocols. It's not just Jews using t as a playbook, it's all the globalist scum using it. It has the cover of being "anti Semitic" so dumb asses like you don't read it and realize how real it is

       resorting to ad-hominem based on supposition and assumption are we? Very well, I completely understand your method now I suppose. Fill in the blanks with prejudice and fear where there is a void of information. You think there is a "they". You couldn't be more wrong. There are dozens and dozens of theys all with separate and some conflicting agendas. They're called countries for the most part. "globalist scum"... Talk about tail chasing. lol

       Yea. Completely agree. There's the Vatican, the masons, the Russians, Chinese, yakuza and there's also the Zionists. And their playbook is called the protocols. And if you read it you would learn something.

       You just acknowledged there are many different groups all jockeying for power and colluding together. You don't think there are small groups of very rich men that would bribe politicians to have laws passed in favor of their business? That would order someone's murder? Has there ever been a legitimate conspiracy committed [in your mind] by a group of rich people?

       Because those are the most obvious and easiest to prove. Next, we could talk about the proven CIA drug trafficking into the states, then the harder to prove, etc. You avoided my question tho: In your mind, has there ever been a criminal conspiracy executed that is still denied by the mass media narrative (like Gary Webb and Rick Ross' CIA story)?

       You realize it was published in 1905 right? And it predicted the establishment of a "Jewish Palestine". 40 years after that we have Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many other accurate predictions that I could list off but how could a book that so accurately predicts the future be considered a "fake". I agree that it's possible that someone forged it in the name of Jews but it's obvious that so many Zionists stand on the principles laid out in the book.

       Yes, but one of the claims is that it details a long-standing plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Protocols purports to document the minutes of a late-19th-century meeting attended by world Jewish leaders"
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the plans are apparently incredible generic too. "Take over stuff, and keep on taking over stuff until we run the world Mwuhahahaha!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas one of the reasons Jewish people are so prominent in the media is because it was considered to be a low prestige job and one of the few they weren't often excluded from, due to prejudices of the time.

       It's not hard to find out. I believe I've already stated I don't want to type it all out. lol. But yes, it's bogus and served to further fuel hatred towards Jews in the world. Henry Ford, besides all his genius and such was also a hateful asshole in many regards. But that's the turn of the century for you.

       Henry Ford was the one who spread it far and wide through his newspapers. The origins are Russia, who already hated Jews and had frequent pogroms. It is said to have been procured from an eavesdropper. I say Ford because he was the one who was pretty much solely responsible for spreading the lie that it is.

       You're not one of those people that believes it are you? if so, too bad. It's garbage in the purest sense.

       anyway:
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1921, the London Times presented conclusive proof that the Protocols was a "clumsy plagiarism." The Times confirmed that the Protocols had been copied in large part from a French political satire that never mentioned Jews—Maurice Joly's Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (1864). Other investigations revealed that one chapter of a Prussian novel, Hermann Goedsche's Biarritz (1868), also "inspired" the Protocols.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A major source for the Protocols was Der Judenstaat by Theodor Herzl, which was referred to as Zionist Protocols in its initial French and Russian editions. Paradoxically, early Russian editions of the Protocols assert that they did not come from a Zionist organization.[9] The text, which nowhere advocates for Zionism, resembles a parody of Herzl's ideas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Protocols is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of literary forgery, with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921... It does not contain specifics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Source material for the forgery consisted jointly of Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu (Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu), an 1864 political satire by Maurice Joly;[7] and a chapter from Biarritz, an 1868 novel by the antisemitic German novelist Hermann Goedsche, which had been translated into Russian in 1872.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elements of the Protocols were plagiarized from Joly's fictional Dialogue in Hell, a thinly veiled attack on the political ambitions of Napoleon III, who, represented by the non-Jewish character Machiavelli,[15] plots to rule the world.  [Comparison quotes included in source]
       </p>
       <p>
        Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, and wrote literary fiction under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe.  His 1868 novel Biarritz (To Sedan) contains a chapter called "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague and the Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel." In it, Goedsche (who was unaware that only two of the original twelve Biblical "tribes" remained) depicts a clandestine nocturnal meeting of members of a mysterious rabbinical cabal that is planning a diabolical "Jewish conspiracy." At midnight, the Devil appears to contribute his opinions and insight.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1872 a Russian translation of "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague" appeared in St. Petersburg as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. François Bournand, in his Les Juifs et nos Contemporains (1896), reproduced the soliloquy at the end of the chapter, in which the character Levit expresses as factual the wish that Jews be "kings of the world in 100 years" —crediting a "Chief Rabbi John Readcliff." Perpetuation of the myth of the authenticity of Goedsche's story, in particular the "Rabbi's speech", facilitated later accounts of the equally mythical authenticity of the Protocols.[21] Like the Protocols, many asserted that the fictional "rabbi's speech" had a ring of authenticity, regardless of its origin.

       Look at all that secondary slop copypasta'd from Wikipedia.

       You will copypasta all sorts of commentary and vague relationship we weaving.  You're still just attempting to cast shade.

       On top of that, there should be no doubt works of literature have a tendency to resemble other works (both written, performed).  One need look no further than, well, almost anything credited to William Shakespeare.

       If you'd actually looked at the example in the link you would see that the resemblance is nothing short of blatant plagiarism.  If you'd paid any attention to the information you are so eager to ignore, you would see that it all derives ultimately from fiction or satire and the linkages are readily evident.

        Alright, just as soon as you show me a text that preceded it and had not only the same theme but the same structure overall as well as withing specific paragraphs.  Oh wait!  You can't.

        I've killed enough time with you without you simply stepping-up to the actual origin of the work itself.

       Totally valid point.  I mean, all I've done is provide exactly that while you have spent so much of your obviously invaluable time A) saying that the fact people deny it legitimizes it and B) asking me to provide its origin (which I did) while doing nothing of the sort yourself.  But its OK.  I understand you can't offer an alternative source for this document aside from: "Dude, there's this secret cabal of Jews who run the world and they totally kept the minutes of a meeting where they like described exactly how they did it and this this one guy totally betrayed them and released it but no one knows who they are because he didn't say and no one knows who he is because there is absolutely no evidence of any of this ever happening.

       There you go again.

       Besides what you did post was, by your own admission I apparently now need to remind you, a copypasta.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,
       <em>
        truthfully
       </em>
       it was not an issue of what you chose to "type out," but rather your deceptive copypasta attempt to steer the discussion away from its origins and toward the first anti-Semite you could find.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're here to discuss the origins of the work do so.  That's not the case though.  You're using Henry Ford to cast shade.
