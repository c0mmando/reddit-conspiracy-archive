        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">128</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-01-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The United States Government, including and especially the US Military-Intelligence Community, is among the most <a href="https://youtu.be/rbG5Awb7gK4?t=340">insecure, terrified, paranoid, <em>conspiracy theorist</em> the world has ever known</a>.  Everyone knows that the Conspiracy Theorist is a unique individual--a paranoiac, lone wolf, right-wing authoritarian libertarian, neoluddite, antigovernment with poor handle on reality and facts.  That&#39;s what everyone says, so we&#39;ll work with <strong><em>their</em></strong> definition.  </p>

<p>By observing our government&#39;s behavior and its words over decades in multiple domains, outlets and with various permutations, we can form a characterological basis of description of the US government persona, as one suffering from antisocial personality disorder and paranoid schizophrenia.  This characterological basis is derived and described in the psychiatry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders#History">DSM</a>, a manual that was originally created by the very same military intelligence community &amp; census bureau <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder">to describe non-conformists</a>[Pilgrim,David;Rogers,Anne (2005).<em>A sociology of mental health and illness</em>(3rd ed.).Milton Keynes:Open University Press.], who may pose a threat to themselves.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Parsing the Conspiracy Theorist Government</h3>

<p>We begin by parsing characterology above, the &#39;unabomber&#39; trope, with examples of how each part applies.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>I. Paranoia and Lone Wolves</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Paranoiac</em></strong> -- Check.  Mass surveillance against citizens.</li>
<li><strong><em>Lone wolf</em></strong> -- Check.  The government has no real friends.  We know this because a friend is someone you have the courage from which to receive unpleasant criticism.  Our government is waging a war on whisleblowers.  The government only makes abusive deals with other governments because of the strength of the US Petrodollar and our military might / nuclear arms.  Nearly every country secretly hates the US.  Ask any diplomat.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4>II. Right-wing authoritarian libertarian</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Authoritarian</em></strong> -- Check.  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3z5z0v/us_police_have_already_killed_more_people_since/?ref=search_posts">Police state</a></li>
<li><strong><em>Right-wing libertarian</em></strong> (ie: anarcho-capitalist)  -- Check  (Industry deregulation.  No tax for corporations.  No punishing outsourcing.  No punishing inversion.  Wall St. Bailouts.  Not punishing financial crimes enough.)</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4>III.  Neoluddite</h4>

<p>The US government resists new, proven, beneficial technology in favor of old technology.</p>

<ul>
<li>The US Government is <em>anti-encryption</em> (see below).</li>
<li>The US Government is <em>anti-bitcoin</em> (see below).</li>
<li>The US Government refuses to <em>standardize, open source or crowd-audit our voting machines</em>.</li>
<li>The US Government refuses to <em>use the Internet for Voting</em> or even try.  They say it can&#39;t be done, an argument that relies directly on ignoring encryption and other disruptive technologies.</li>
<li>The US Government refuses to <em>dismantle their old nuclear fission reactors</em> in favor of safer thorium reactors, putting everyone and the environment and ecosystem at risk all the time.</li>
<li>The US Government refuses to <em>adopt GMO labelling</em> to inform consumers of the desirable advanced-technology that goes into engineering their food.</li>
<li>The US Government refuses to <em>support solar alternative energy</em> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/solar-panel-energy-power-company-nevada">in a real way</a>, by allowing energy industry to maintain a different market value per KW fossil based energy versus a KW of residential solar energy.</li>
<li>The US Govenment wants to <em>put in a Canadian oil pipe</em> instead of putting solar on every rooftop, or supporting solar energy in any real way.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4>IV. Poor Handle on Facts:</h4>

<p>This section deals with the government having a poor handle on facts.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4>A. Rummyism</h4>

<p>Donald Rummsfeld, Sec. of Defence under child Bush famously said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To rephrase this <em>shitcryptic koan</em>, &quot;you must have faith that &#39;we <em>know</em>, but <em>cannot prove</em>&#39; that Saddam has chemical weapons of mass destruction.&quot;  We found out later, there were no weapons.  We had no proof.  But again, the establishment maintained that they <strong><em>knew something we didn&#39;t</em></strong>, that entitled them to think they are better than us, so we don&#39;t deserve to deal in actual facts.  What&#39;s this conjecture around weapons that don&#39;t exist sound like?  <strong><em>A conspiracy theory.</em></strong></p>

<p>Which was repeated over and over and over a-la &#39;the big lie&#39;, without any evidence.  By Rice, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld.  Even when confronted with the lack of evidence, they still maintained their theories.  I guess that <em>makes the public a conspiracy theoriest by extension</em>, because we believed the <em>government conspiracy theorists</em> from 9/11 until now.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>B. Mass Surveillance of the US public</h4>

<p>After spending Trillions of USD on various surveillance projects from Eschelon to PRISM, to Secret AT&amp;T Room 641A, we find out in 2013 that--despite the widespread and overwhelming moral dread created by a government with such deep distrust of its citizens that it must analyze every thing they do--<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/10/nsa-spying-did-not-result-in-one-stopped-terrorist-plot-and-the-government-actually-did-spy-on-the-bad-guys-before-911.html">they&#39;ve accomplished nothing, stopped no terrorist plot</a>, and mass shootings happen nearly every other week.</p>

<p>In fact, the reason they&#39;ve not stopped any terror is because it doesn&#39;t exist unless they themselves create it by occupation, false flags, or media manipulation.  Hence, they are chasing fantasies, delusions.  Mass shootings--if real and not false flags--are just mass shootings.  Terrorism if not manufactured by the state is actual terrorism.  Failure to understand or make these distinctions proper, makes the government schizophrenic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder often characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to recognize what is real.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Abnormal&quot;</em> -- spying on citizens while claiming to protect them, defying implicit trust of the people who are paying your salary.</li>
<li><em>&quot;Social Behavior&quot;</em> -- interacting directly with citizen&#39;s voice and written communications and tracking their public / social behavior.</li>
<li><em>&quot;Failure to recognize what is real&quot;</em> -- Citizens aren&#39;t terrorists, they&#39;ve not foiled any terrorist plot in America, despite trillions spent on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, when you fail so signally at your job at catching terrorists, you then have to change the definition of terrorist, in order to be able to catch them.  This is akin to lowering the standards of entry so that dummies can get into college: you&#39;re widening the net.  In this case, fraudulently so:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8sr1v/us_dod_now_claims_public_protest_is_lowlevel/?ref=search_posts">Protest is now Terrorism</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/72-types-of-americans-that-are-considered-potential-terrorists-in-official-government-documents">Free Speech is now Terrorism</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/oldspeak/we_are_all_terror_suspects_under_the_fbis_communities_against_terrorism_pro">many ways we could be terrorists</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/news/261048-house-intel-chair-biggest-threat-today-is-terrorists-using-encryption">Privacy is now Terrorism</a>, according ot the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054569/fast-feed/fbi-renews-warnings-on-terror-and-encryption-with-no-clear-solution-in-sight">FBI, with no clear solution</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The concept of <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervigilance">Hypervigilance</a></em></strong>  is an enhanced state of sensory sensitivity accompanied by <em>an exaggerated intensity of behaviors whose</em> <strong><em>purpose is to detect threats</em></strong>.  It&#39;s an activity associated with ptsd, stress, anxiety, <em>paranoia and schizophrenia</em>.  When the US government has <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ozA2VS9cbqs/TFidcrKqBRI/AAAAAAAADj0/sd8gMypcrYE/s1600/6a00d8341c4ebd53ef0120a93be4f5970b.jpg">this many agencies all designed to monitor citizen&#39;s behavior</a>, I would say that&#39;s well beyond <em>hypervigilance</em>.  I would argue that that is incredible overkill.  What did <em>we</em> do to traumatize poor little governement into making it crazy and paranoid?  Did we ask about 9/11 too much?</p>

<p>Anyway, despite their ptsd paranoia, those unfounded fears didn&#39;t stop them from waging a widespread and longlasting <a href="http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2015/11/20/the-war-on-encryption-and-bitcoin-nothing-to-do-with-terrorism-everything-to-do-with-state-control/">war against encryption and technologies like bitcoin.</a></p>

<hr/>

<h4>C. Asset Forfeiture</h4>

<p>The US Patriot Act makes a provision for asset forfeiture, <strong><em>even in the case of only alleged crimes prior to conviction.</em></strong>  Again, they can take actions based on no-evidence.  </p>

<p>Assets include both physical (houses, cash, cars) and non-physical assets such as private information (medical, financial, educational information).  This has been abused, and used to punish and steal from people who carry large sums of anonymous money (cash) regardless of their intent.  It provides a very real incentive for falsification of evidence by law enforcement for them to take what they want.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/current-events/police-seizing-cash-and-property-from-citizens-without-charges/">Police Seizing Cash And Property From Citizens Without Charges</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Their stated reason?  The cash is being used for drugs, or trafficking weapons, or other crimes.  The fact is, they don&#39;t know, they are <em>theorizing</em> but seize anyway.  <em>Again, the law enforcement&#39;s assumption that there is an invisible, unknown third-party with whom the suspected person would trade anonymous cash, is itself a</em> <strong><em>conspiracy theory by definition</em></strong>.  Since a conspiracy involves <em>2</em> or more people.</p>

<p>This is clearly antisocial police behavior, not just in the act itself but in the moral dread and fear that it creates, because now people are under threat of losing everything they have because of any small slip-up.   This rule then expanded to the society level creates a culture of fear.  Creating an atmosphere of fear around you, and thriving within this dread you create is something an <em>asshole would do</em>.  The clinical term for a dreadmongering asshole is &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antisocial (or dissocial) personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. There may be an impoverished moral sense or conscience and a history of crime, legal problems, and impulsive and aggressive behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h4>D. &quot;Evidence-based&quot; Medicine</h4>

<p>Medicine works, <a href="http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/study-radiation-therapy-can-make-cancers-30x-more-malignant/">except when it doesn&#39;t.</a>.  Anti-depressants work, except when they <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582668/">don&#39;t</a> because they are <a href="http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20080227/antidepressants-no-better-than-placebo">no better than placebo</a>.  Now we are seeing that <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2015/12/timberrr-psychiatrys-evidence-base-for-antipsychotics-comes-crashing-to-the-ground/">anti-psychotics also fail the efficacy test</a>, despite their having been prescribed for decades due to the &#39;evidence&#39; based medicine guidelines.</p>

<p>That said, you must only take allopath doctor-prescribed pharmaceuticals, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3v4ags/herbs_dont_work_except_when_they_do/">herbs and supplements just don&#39;t work, except when they do</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3sktb0/people_want_dea_chief_to_resign_after_he_called/cwz07ot">Pot kills except when nih provides 30 studies showing it doesn&#39;t</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3sodlc/magic_mushrooms_are_medicine_for_patients/cwzegro">mushrooms make you crazy, except when nih demonstrates it does the opposite</a>.  These have no medical value and therefore they are on schedule 1 of the DEA.</p>

<p>Just like <strong><em>a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;</em></strong> to claim to have completely non-credible evidence from the highmost institutions of government--and worse yet, evidence they manufactured themselves! So recap, they manufacture evidence to form the basis of claims, and then disregard that evidence because they themselves made it, when it suits them to do so.  Seems legit, being the Government as a whole is a distrustworthy psychopath. </p>

<p>The reality is that <strong><em><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm">illegal drugs cause far less harm compared to non-illegal drugs</a></em></strong>, as shown in the scorecard graph, compiled by former chief drugs adviser to the British government.  Note the harm of cannabis and psychedelics, which happen to be the most aggressively policed and demonized in the media.  Contrast that with the fact that the <a href="http://collectivelyconscious.net/articles/government-says-big-pharma-kills-more-people-than-all-illegal-drugs-combined/">Government Says Big Pharma Kills More People Than All Illegal Drugs Combined</a>.</p>

<p>So we have pharma drugs that don&#39;t work as advertised, based on evidence we say is valid.  And street drugs that sometimes do work but are less harmful than advertised, based on evidence we say is valid.  </p>

<p>And a government that can&#39;t seem to sort out this collection of facts from fiction.  Just like a <strong><em>&quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;</em></strong>.</p>

<hr/>

<h4>E. Privacy, Encryption</h4>

<p>Using the internet now is dangerous because of hackers.  We have a lot of measures in place to allow people to conduct online business securely.  Namely, using SSL, which was itself compromised with the heartbleed exploit, that went unchecked for a very uncomfortably long time.  So many other problems with vendors online, such as the faulty storage of credit card numbers or the social security numbers stored incorrectly in plaintext in a database in SC, have led a discussion on identity theft, financial and personal information privacy on the internet.  It remains clear that privacy and security are very important to safely use the internet.</p>

<p>But despite all the facts, the government doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.  Just like a <strong><em>&quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;</em></strong> to go against popular opinion based on facts.  They would have you give up your privacy and take away your tools for communicating securely, even if it means disclosure to the Deep State of critical and person <strong><em>Intellectual Property</em></strong> such as screenplay ideas or a the plans for a new energy invention.  </p>

<p>Consider this scenario: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You created a car that can drive for 2 hours on a gallon of water and stored the plans in your google drive.  As you&#39;re developing a business plan, an individual who is associated with the Department of Energy starts a company that announces in a press-release that he and his new, worldwide team will be creating the prototype of a car that runs on a gallon of water.  From the description, it sounds a lot like your invention.  Isn&#39;t that strange?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the country is <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/">divided on the issue of privacy versus security</a>, some argue that US Citizens, world civilians generally are not the terrorists but rather the surveillance community itself.  They believe that the <a href="https://www.rt.com/op-edge/nsa-surveillance-terrorism-seaman-475/">NSA is thus creating a culture of fear.</a> as a form of social control.  But <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/section-6-foreign-affairs-terrorism-and-privacy/">overwhelmingly, poeple believe they should not have to give up their privacy for safety</a>, regardless of what they feel needs to happen outside of the us.</p>

<p>Therefore, the continuance of these domestic surveillance programs are very obvious paranoia and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/12/06/obama-islamic-state-oval-office-address-san-bernardino/76880354/">antisocial behavior projected outwardly</a> and <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2013/11/18/nsas-global-threat-free-speech/">injuriously towards the public</a>.  It feels very much like punishment, but for what?  Daring to question the government for 9/11?  </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t going to stop. Not now, not ever, until we have justice.  So government, you can either take some of your own medicine, give us justice or continue on this track.  I will warn you though, if you continue down <em>the-path-without-a-heart</em>, at some point--to quote <em>Manly P Hall</em>: if you continue to believe in magic without the history and wisdom behind it, you&#39;re going to get in a lot of trouble.  You&#39;ll end up in the psych ward with the other lone wolves, spooks and spectres that maybe don&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  I appreciate it.  The first one had a zero downvote within 10 sec of posting, faster than I imagine reddit could even put it up (knowing what i know about reddit caching).  Therefore I figured it was bot-downvoted and reposted.</p>

<p>Also, even if the 0 is real, if people never see it because it&#39;s zero, then it never goes anywhere.  I know this from years of redditing, so I figure it&#39;s legit to alter the headline to make it look better, because often people won&#39;t even read the article, they just downvote the headline.  Anyway, thank you for this friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I didn&#39;t think of that.  What a shit thing to do.  I can tell you I will never do that.  I do the repost-delete thing a lot because damn if every submission isn&#39;t instantly zeroed out (and I know it will never get beyond 0 because people won&#39;t see it)</p>

<p>I think people also stalk.  By that I mean they don&#39;t like that you said something that sounds chauvenistic or racist or politically incorrect or mean and then they&#39;ll go in and downvote everything you&#39;ve done because it&#39;s the only power they have in this world since they cannot effectively use &quot;their words&quot; which are quite powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, this good. When you lay it all out like that though, it seems like you&#39;re putting too much focus on the US. I know its the head of the hydra, but its tentacles are all over the place.</p>

<p>The drug thing will forever and always point me to the fact this country is inherently corrupt. Its been about 20-30 years where its been common knowledge that the Scheduling system is complete hypocritical horseshit. ya no medical value for cannabis, but theres been a program going on since the 1970&#39;s where a handful of patients are provided with their puffs.</p>

<p>I feel like working in DC must be so awkward, they&#39;re not stupid people, they know whats up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding DC, I think alpha house is a fair depiction--a bunch of snotty drunk ivy leaguer masons--but what they don&#39;t show is the pedophilia or the cocaine.</p>

<p>I agree with you about hydra/spectre but that would make the scope of the discussion too large.  Also, hydra can at least have a few tentacles severed if our government had any integrity whatsoever.  I mean, the pope is just an octopus with a funny hat.  His hat won&#39;t stop a rain of nuclear warheads, not saying I advocate that, I&#39;m really just talking about simple physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By its very nature the government distrusts it&#39;s citizens. The reason government exists at all is because it is assumed that everyone is a danger to others.
If all people were benevolent and immune to corruption, then government would not be needed, nor would the idea even exist.
In an advanced society of elevated consciousness there is no centralized controlling entity.</p>

<p>The government does not trust you. The government does not love you. Simple.
Next time you drive in your car look at all the license plates on every vehicle. It is a shackle, one of many that the government uses to oppress its people. Is that how someone who is loved and trusted is treated?
If you say to yourself &quot;it&#39;s only a license plate&quot;, you do not understand. Take a good hard look at your government issued identification.
Those you put up with this shit are not deserving, nor are they prepared for a life of true liberty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be completely naive to use &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; in a derogatory fashion. The bottom line is that history is a running series of conspiracies, and conspiracies are committed by the thousands at every level of society, every day. </p>

<p>If all the facts of a situation are not public and known, then all a person can do is theorize how a particular conspiracy (one of millions) took place using the evidence that is available. </p>

<p>In fact, by the definition, law enforcement are some of the greatest conspiracy theorists that exist. All investigators must theorize how each conspiracy was committed, absent a bonafide confession. </p>

<p>Therefore, to genuinely believe that calling someone a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is some smug put down, on some fool. Really demonstrates the quality of rational thought and intelligence that the person lobbing the attack possesses. </p>

<p>The greatest problem is that most people are cowards and must always remain in the safety of the pack. The pack being the mentality of the herd, the &quot;mainstream&quot;. For stepping outside the pack opens them to attack, which they cannot personally withstand. That&#39;s why they feel so good remaining in the pack, attacking those who dare venture outside of it so they feel better about their inherent inability to stand for anything not sanctioned by the thought police. </p>

<p>Some conspiracy theories are crazy, but it&#39;s not crazy to look at them. The truth is that there are exponentially more true conspiracies, than untrue. Source, history. </p>
