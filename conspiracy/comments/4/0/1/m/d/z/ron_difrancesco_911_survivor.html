        Walking south, they tried to leave the tower at Liberty Street, but another guard redirected them to the northeast exit that led to Church Street. They made their way back through the concourse. It never occurred to either of them that they were still in danger. But the South Tower's steel supports were failing; the building was in its final moments as a skyscraper. As Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Kren passed an adjoining hallway near the Church Street exit, they heard an ungodly roar. Mr. DiFrancesco turned to his right in the direction of Liberty Street, to see a massive fireball -- compressed as the South Tower fell -- roiling toward them. "Run!" he yelled. The two men bolted for the exit. Mr. DiFrancesco was bowled over by the explosion as he reached some stairs. Something slammed into the back of his head. The last thing he remembers is the sound of his own voice: "Help me, help me!"

        DiFrancesco continued down as fast as he could, finally reaching the plaza level. He headed for an exit, but was stopped by a security guard who told him it was too dangerous. He looked out in horror at the falling debris and victims. He was directed to another exit. He walked back through the concourse towards the northeast exit, near Church Street. He was still in extreme danger. Fifty-six minutes had passed since the plane hit. The impact had severed many of the South Tower's vertical support columns. The heat from the explosion and fire had weakened the steel trusses. The floors of the crippled building began to "pancake down" in a floor-by-floor collapse. As he approached the Church Street exit, DiFrancesco heard an "ungodly roar". He saw a fireball as the building compressed. He doesn't know what happened next, and was unconscious for some time after his narrow escape, waking up much later at St. Vincent's hospital in Manhattan.

       Not even internationalskeptics.com has discussed this guy. This guy is walking around mainstream sources everywhere talking about explosions and hardly anybody notices! With the physical evidence of his injuries, which are inconsistent with just being hit by falling debris, this powerful fireball explosion had to have happened. The only thing that's left for debunkers is to explain how the collapsing structure could somehow push the office fires down the core structure hundreds of feet and explode outwards in a focused manner with such extreme force.

       I certainly hadn't heard his story until you shared it.

       It sounds like what happened to Bob Mcllvaine's son.
 But the kicker with his is, he was killed way BEFORE the towers fell and as he was entering the lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is the only 9/11 victim to had had an autopsy. And those results do not lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm mobile right now but I will return and ETA a link with Bob talking about his sons autopsy results.

       I've seen Bob Mcllvaine speak, but his son's injuries could be attributed to the jet-fuel-in-the-elevator-shafts theory (of which there is no evidence for besides witnesses smelling fuel).

       Here is the interview where he talks about his injuries....

       He thinks he was killed by an explosion in the lobby before the first plane hit. His burns were very minor and not the cause of death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jet fuel did indeed burn and kill Jennieann Maffeo and permanently damage Lauren Manning as they walked into the lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Ron's story is interesting and VITAL because by that time there was absolutely NO jet fuel left and certainly not enough to cause a fireball in the lobby to blast this guy across the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what did?

       I'm glad you posted this because I had no idea about him.

       Bob only thinks it was before the plane hit from talking to William Rodriquez. There are witnesses who remembered the ground level explosions after the plane and there's no reason not to just think the before-the-plane witnesses could just be confused.

       Ahh good point.

       I don't think there is any confusion as to what happened to Ron.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post shows that his story is in many places but no one is  questioning it like they have been with Bob's son.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great thing with Ron, he was there, he lived it.
 His story is consistent and has never wavered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it was a final explosion/explosives in the lobby that caused Ron's injuries?

       It is known for a fact that there were explosions coming out of many elevators, mostly the lobby and basement floors. While it is concievable that some jet fuel could've gotten all the way down there, the problem is the sheer force of the explosions. A guy running out of the North Tower after the first plane crash saw a 300 pound steel-concrete fire door that blew off it's hinges and was "crinkled like aluminum foil".

       I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jet Fuel can account for a few explosions but not all. Much of it was burned off on impact. Also quite a bit of it rained down the facade of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it certainly can't explain the fire door (not an elevator shaft) you talk about. Also by the time Ron was escaping there is no way there was any fuel left.

       If the Towers were already collapsing, what's the point of setting charges at the base?

       To make the structure less stiff? This was probably only at the point where the upper portion began leaning.
