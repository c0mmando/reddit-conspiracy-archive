       compelling, yeah--but, he did admit he gave some women 'spanish fly'. i don't think all of them are telling the truth though.

       i'd like to know why Cosby is still 'targeted' for wanting to buy a tv channel &amp; the death of his son always seemed suspect to me.

       The fuckwit admitted obtaining drugs to "seduce" women.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Interest in Mr. Cosby’s deposition grew this month when a federal judge unsealed a 62-page memorandum of law in the case, which had been settled in 2006. The memorandum contained excerpts from the deposition, including Mr. Cosby’s acknowledgment that he had obtained quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women.

       The asshole had been getting away with it for so long that he thought even this admission wouldn't hurt him, and it didn't. He bought off the victim and made her keep silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how rich assholes like this get away with the kinds of crimes that would result in any normal person sitting in prison for a few years, at least.

       Lol but according to you the other day the women reporting sexual assault in Europe must be paid actors... Which is it? You can't have your cake and fuck it too man!

       I never said any such thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said we have no evidence that they weren't false reports. Women have been known to file false rape reports as a weapon against men they do not like.

      <p>
       Not really. I asked if the few sexual assaults that were reported were an increase from previous years, and said that false reports could explain the apparent increase, and that racism might have motivated some of the reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lies surrounding those reports were definitely being promoted by lying racists.

       i agree; he got away with it, for a while anyway. i'm sure there were many people that helped to keep it all quiet. his personal assistant kept a log of how much money he paid to different women.
      </p>
      <p>
       this shit has been ongoing in the media complex forever. for whatever reason &amp; i'm sure there is one, Cosby is the "fall guy". i'm still waiting for the truth to drop about the pervs abusing children.

       "Frank Scotti, a 90-year-old ex-NBC employee, is the latest to go public with stories of Bill Cosby’s past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scotti, who worked as a facilities manager for the Brooklyn NBC Studio where “Cosby Show” was filmed, told the New York Daily News that he arranged for monthly payments and more for eight women during “The Cosby Show’s” run from 1984-1992. He claimed some women would receive as much as $2,000 at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       “He had everybody fooled,” Scotti said to the Daily News. “Nobody suspected.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Scotti provided copies of money orders to four women to the Daily News and said Cosby asked him to put his own name on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       “He was covering himself by having my name on it,” he said. “It was a coverup. I realized it later.”

      <p>
       Almost every major pop star or celebrity icon has lost someone precious to them. Some people in youtube videos and other places have cited this as a blood sacrifice. This is required to move up in the world and a bond of love is more tangible and valuable than anything to the prince of darkness.

       MJ was different but definitely not a molester and Cosby just couldn't take getting old and seeing his community implode, IMO.

       BOSTON — Comedian Bill Cosby and his wife Camille are supporting protesters marching across Massachusetts in opposition to Kinder Morgan's proposed natural gas pipeline.

      <p>
       The couple, who own hundreds of acres of protected land in Shelburne Falls, about 100 miles west of Boston, have been opposed to the pipeline since the company notified them last winter of plans to survey their land.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The star of reality TV show Sons of Guns has been arrested for child molestation - but he insists the claims are the work of a bitter ex-girlfriend.
William Hayden, 49, whose show airs on the Discovery Channel, was arrested in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Saturday on charges of molestation of a child and a crime against nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released, according to the sheriff's website.
While the case has been sealed by a judge, Hayden told TMZ that his ex-girlfriend, who is mother to one of his daughters, went to authorities a week ago and accused him of molesting the girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said that she did it as revenge for him ending their relationship.
Hayden has since married and is bringing up the girl with his new wife. The youngster returned to his home after he was interviewed by Child Protective Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       His older daughter Stephanie, who appears on Sons of Guns beside him, said that her father was innocent.
'There was never any impropriety in our home,' she said. 'He was and is a good father.'
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Monday, she took to Facebook to defend her father.
       </p>
       <p>
        'This was a false allegation and unfortunately that's all it takes,' she wrote. 'My father is a good man, and ALL of his children love him very much and are truly sickened that a person would try to do this to our family. Its not right [sic]. You see the love we have for our family…
'The one thing that really hurts us is that my sister is heartbroken that anyone could think this of her father. Its a nightmare…please stand with us.'
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It seems odd that CPS would interview the daughter, return her to Hayden’s home, and then arrest him anyway. If they thought there was a hint of truth to the allegation, they would have never brought the daughter back to the home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stephanie Hayden, Will’s other daughter and fellow Sons star, is adamant that her father is innocent.

       If you look at Stephanie now she looks like a drug Fiend.

       Does she feel so guilty for locking up her father that she resorted to drugs to get over her shame?

       This is the younger daughter who the older daughter accused her father of brutally raping every day for years. Her body sure looks like an creature who has gone through years of daily  brutal rape.

       I know.  There's no fucking way this guy was born in 1979.  That would make him some unreasonable age or something.  And of course arbitrarily bringing Jewishness into this discussion for no reason is totally relevant.  He's obviously working for the ziofascinazi communists!

       No, I just forgot my password and you're hilariously stereotyping me for it.

       Specifically bringing up supposed Jewish immunity to their supposedly frequent sex crimes to the exclusion of other groups in no way make you sound antisemitic.  Nor does calling everyone who points out that that's what you're doing a J-shill or whatever retarded term you and Cletus have come up with.

       You've got me.  I work directly for the Elders of Zion.  Unfortunately, my position is just below that of septic tank scrubber since my job is to deal with inconsequential morons with weird ideas about how our illustrious and secretive group runs the world.  That, or you are saying really stupid shit and I am pointing it out not because of some conspiracy, but because I miss the days of rational discussion in this sub-

       You really think you don't sound antisemitic?  "$5 missing from my wallet", "Jewish one-liner", "tribe", "You peeps like to hear yourselves talk.", "you guys bash Jesus and moooooslems" and so much more.  Here's a hint:

       OK, chill.  I'm an atheist born Christian by the way, but I can limit it to calling you a bigot if that makes you more comfortable.  The fact is that the vast bulk of your  statements have revolved around disparaging a group based on their religion.  If this discussion had begun with you saying "If he'd been a Catholic priest he would get away with it" and then claimed I was shilling for Jesuits and continually made insulting comments about Catholics, same thing.  I wouldn't have said you were anti-Jesusite as I find that a stupid word, but I would have used something like anti-Christian.  I also don't care about antisemitism more than say bigotry against Catholics but this does not change the fact that all of your statements have revolved around disparaging an entire group based on... um... nothing.  That's bigotry.

       Cosby maybe drugged some women but the underlying message is still important. We shouldn't judge someone in the media. 
We should forget the tabloid trials and wait for a real jury to hear sworn testimony.

       That is. At the same time very good points are made. Such as a lot of these women had long sexual relationships with him, and several have been proven to be lying an others never say rape but forcible kissing. If that itself can be used as a claim of rape there are a lot of men in this country who are now rapists.

       Yep. That is some scary shit for real. An they know it. The general public does not ever see a follow up story. Just like when Richard Jewel was accused of being the Olympic bomber, later found out not to be. I lived in North GTa at the time and several years later when they were still looking for Eric Rudolph some of the locals were confused and remember nothing of it not being Mr. Jewel, they remembered his porn habits though.

       Fair enough.Many posts with videos linked are down voted before there is time to have actually watched the evidence being presented to make a decision whether to agree or not. I know I cannot change the world with a post. But as someone who likes to try it is fucked up when someone disagrees without offering an explanation as to why. Which is rampant in this sub.

       Yeah, it can be frustrating. At the end of the day, though, I think many people will see what they want to and believe what they want to regardless of what's presented to them. I think such beliefs become tied so up in their egos and identities that anything to the contrary is seen as a personal attack. As humans are fundamentally emotional creatures, that generally hurts to a degree. The difficulty is separating one's identity from one's beliefs so that one can have a truly open mind.

       I feel ya. I am of saltine background myself. I grew up different than most. Strangely I have been treated worse by "my own people" than my boys who I grew up with. Their families taught me in the 80's that there were two systems for people in America. It is real sad cause I did not get it until I was moved to all white town in GA and no more of my friends all white people. An I learned I was a nigger according to them. It hit me hard and made me miss home.

       Check out  u/Rotundus_Maximus' post up the thread. He makes valid points. Cosby is being smeared for what he was trying to do. All this racism is dead bullshit is just that. They give enough to keep the libs happy then take away power when it becomes too much. Notice how Oprah has never strayed from her lane. She is rich,she has a network, but she also keeps her mouth shut.

       There's 55 of them.

       its a deliberate take down on Cosby, he said the wrong thing, time to destroy his life and reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       hollywood (jews of course) generally hates black people and black culture. they are not too keen on whites excpet as a cash cow to milk, blacks have been run down by hollywood since its inception, even TV today does the denigration of blacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psych being a good example of how hollywood/burbank portrays black characters, the black sidekick is an intelligent  chemist tech, yet they showed him doing the wide eyed high running gait thing, classic 30s put down.
