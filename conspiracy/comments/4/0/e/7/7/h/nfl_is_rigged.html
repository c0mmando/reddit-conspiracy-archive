       It wasn't always but now it is a $32 Billion SHARED REVENUE CORPORATION, and outcomes can't be left to chance. The NFL is a corporation with 32 departments. The total league revenues are shared equally so there is no punishment for owning Jacksonville vs Kansas City vs Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few fundamentals need to be established:
First, the NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as "entertainment" rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity instead of the 32 separate "franchises" they would want you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, in a 2004 lawsuit vs the NFL, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams, but a single entity. They compete as a unit in the entertainment marketplace, and not subject to Anti-Trust laws." Like the WWE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, NFL Referees are part-time employees of the NFL. NFL refs make less than $75,000 per season. They work for the league, period. Referees are bound by NFL mandated gag orders which prevent them from talking to the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next:
The "Patriots" post 9/11 run. 
The Saints 40 years of losing, then winning a title for a Katrina ravaged city.
The Harbaugh Bowl
Marketing MAGIC !!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Next:
In 2007 a Jets season ticket holder sued the NFL for $185 million and the case reached the US Supreme Court. The Jets fan argued that, all Jets fans are entitled to refunds because they paid for a ticket to a legitimate sporting event. Had he been aware that the games were not real then we would not have gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Judge stated that a ticket to a game only provides you access to the stadium. The fan entered the stadium, witnessed a game, therefore he did not suffer any damages. The fan's lawyer disagreed and argued that the NFL committed consumer fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judges ruled that fixing a game for entertainment purposes was completely LEGAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next:
In 2000 Art Model, a storied and respected owner of the Baltimore Ravens announced he was selling the team. Miraculously, even with one of the worst offenses in NFL history, they won the Super Bowl. And the Ravens were subsequently sold to Steve Busciotti for a record price.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Kraft and John Mara are two of the most business savvy and highly respected NFL owners. Kraft is in charge of the NFL TV broadcast committee and also leads all television negotiations for the NFL. Kraft also is on the board of Viacom (CBS). Kraft negotiated a record TV deal resulted in $24 Billion in revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank was interviewed saying "It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I wish my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl, but these two gentlemen deserve it".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more examples, and no one wants this to be true.....But it is. The NFL said it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We're EXEMPT. Thanks for reading all of this. It is compiled from many sources.

       Bubba Smith accused the NFL of being rigged after the first Super Bowl. He talked about the refs making the game go a certain way in his book. As a Baltimore Ravens fan I can tell you that there is an entire city that believed at the very least the NFL has conspired against  us yearly including the Super Bowl as "we" we're about to blow the 49's out, the lights shut off. Suggs and Lewis spoke about this publicly. This season at the end of several games We would get a flag completely changing the game and on one instance the call was so wrong that the NFL had to acknowledge that we should have won against Jacksonville.

       The lights were shut off because the first half of the game was going so fast,  it was the shortest super bowl half ever at 45 minutes I believe. They needed more ad revenue. The pubs were happy  because everyone ordered more drinks and food to pass the time. This "power outage"  happened in new Orleans after Katrina.  Obvious fraud. I hate the NFL but I still watch games for some reason. The half time show has satanic imagery.  It's really a sick and twisted organization,  the NFL.

       I've not only been saying that the NFL is rigged, I've been saying that any sport involving big money is fixed and they're fixed through the officiating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tim Donaghy was an NBA referee who got caught because a website that covered referee statistics noticed that games that Donaghy refereed swayed in a way that statistically wasn't the norm:
       <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095">
        http://espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then Donaghy turned whistle blower:
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/ex-nba-ref-tim-donaghy-organized-will-always-have-a-hand-in-sports">
        http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/ex-nba-ref-tim-donaghy-organized-will-always-have-a-hand-in-sports
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad part of all this is that a lot of people are
       <strong>
        SOOOO
       </strong>
       invested in their sports and teams that they live in a state of denial about sports being rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a guy who's favorite sport is baseball tell me that he could see how an NBA or NFL game could be rigged but he couldn't see how baseball could be rigged.  This guy has seen thousands of baseball games in his life but won't believe the questionable strike or balls called by the home plate umpire or the questionable slides to a plate being called safe or out by a base umpire because he utterly can't believe baseball is fixed and he's in so much denial about it.  These are what all hardcore sports fans are like and they're all like this.

       I dunno.  If the NFL is rigged for maximum profit potential, then why have Peyton Manning play like shit and lose to the Colts in last years playoffs?  It would have been financially more beneficial to have a Manning vs Brady AFC Championship game then the turd the Colts laid against the Patriots.

      <p>
       All that being said, the endings of the Bengals/Steelers and Vikings/Seahawks seem scripted as fuck.

       Pacman Jones brushing away from the coach,  not hitting or pushing him.  The Bengals were handed 30 yards of penalties on one play. I understand the 15 yard illegal hit to the head penalty but the other flag gave the game to the steelers. It was a joke of a play.   I still. Don't understand  it. Jones didn't hit the coach. Watch the video.

       not only does he hit the coach, more importantly, he made contact with the referee.. which is the penalty. if you want to continue to make yourself look stupid, maybe you should watch Pacman Jones' "scripted" tantrum video he posted to instagram and then deleted. totally also scripted and planned by the NFL.

       That holder ... and to say that knowing you have mentally unstable players on the field, you can totally fit that into the scenes of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is of my opinion or perhaps just thoughts that the nfl has several plays a half that are indeed scripted. What the result is of the play may not be.

       I mean I guess you could argue CIN-PIT, but the Vikings game being scripted?  If so they did a terrible job, and possibly caused the wrong team to win (w/ Walsh missing a simple 27 yard FG to lose).

       Many, many people derive part of their identity with a sport(s) and/or certain teams. I do that with hockey but I understand it's a game with the results that won't have any real impact on my life either way. Win or lose, I'll still get a beer afterwards.

       read the top comment. the most popular sport in the country far and away is won 3 out of four years by a team called the patriots right after the country is attacked and nationalism is being pushed at an all time high? they also were documented to have been cheating during that time and were not penalized.

       Good thread, but more details would be nice. I had a guy added as a friend on Facebook for a while. He was making some far out claims about nukes triggering tsunamis, but he also touched on fixed soccer and rugby matches in NZ. Then some weird shit happened on his Facebook. Literally 20+ sockpuppet accounts would pop out of nowhere and start commenting. I think his account ultimately got hacked and he's not in control of it anymore.

       I played semi professional soccer in Canada. A lot of the owners of the clubs, including my own, were representatives of mafia groups and holding companies from places like Italy, Serbia and Croatia. They were also in bed with many gambling companies. A goalkeeper on a Serbian team was paid to fluff up 'accidentally" causing his team to lose.
