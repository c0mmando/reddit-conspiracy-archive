    <div class="md"><p>If pedophilia is condoned by the Talmud, it is basically Judaic law, so what can be done to stop it? The Talmud also condones stealing from, lying to, and murdering the Goyim. There is also the traditional Jewish circumcision ritual, in which the mohel sucks on the baby&#39;s penis after cutting off the foreskin, and which has resulted in babies contracting herpes. Circumcision itself is genital mutilation, serves no medical purpose (in vast majority of cases), and is potentially used as a form of trauma-based mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it would instantly turn them into your slave. I just think such traumatic experiences early in life could induce a greater tendency for people to engage is sociopathic behavior later on, and therefore it could be used to reinforce a sociopathic culture.</p>

<p>And cutting hair and nails does not cause permanent mutilation, pain, and feelings of helplessness, so your analogy is pretty irrelevant. There is no medical reason to circumcise newborns by default, and it simply results in unnecessary &quot;complications,&quot; and sexual dysfunction even when the surgery is &quot;successful.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doctors and their arguments fall on both sides of the fence.  However, describing circumcision as a &quot;gateway mutilation&quot; which leads to potential long term problems is pure conjecture. Whether it stems from lack of religiosity or outright denial of divinity, I can&#39;t judge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing wrong with &quot;conjecture&quot; as long as it is clearly indicated as such. And you make it sound like there are actual medical benefits to circumcision. It is not exactly hard to teach a child to clean under their foreskin. And I&#39;m not sure what condemning circumcision has to do with &quot;denial of divinity.&quot; I would think that the belief that the foreskin is a &quot;divine mistake&quot; which much be corrected by humans is more of a rejection of divinity than leaving babies intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you make it sound like there are actual medical harms to circumcision. Conjecture is fine and dandy so long as such extreme presumptions aren&#39;t purported. Also, attributing a mistake to the divine would, theologically speaking, be a rejection of divinity. Again, is it lack of religiosity that renders an act of faith to be described in such an abhorrent manner, I can&#39;t judge. </p>

<p>Guys in all seriousness.  You can&#39;t take anything the author stated in this article seriously.  His grammar is terrible,  his points aren&#39;t even closely supported by the quotes he supplies, the guy has no idea what he&#39;s talking about.  </p>

If you&#39;re gunna post antisemetic bullshit,  at least find an article written in a somewhat sophisticated manner so it could at least appear to shed light on a dark truth.  This is just crap.

    <div class="md"><p>Read for yourself:</p>

<p>What exactly did these sages say?</p>

<p>The Pharisees justified child rape by explaining that a boy of nine years was not a “man” (See, &quot;Judaism and Homosexuality: A Marriage Made in Hell&quot;) Thus they exempted him from God’s Mosaic Law: “You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination” (Lev. 18:22) One passage in the Talmud gives permission for a woman who molested her young son to marry a high priest. It concludes, “All agree that the connection of a boy aged nine years and a day is a real connection; whilst that of one less than eight years is not.&quot; 5 Because a boy under 9 is sexually immature, he can&#39;t &quot;throw guilt&quot; on the active offender, morally or legally. 6</p>

<p>A woman could molest a young boy without questions of morality even being raised: &quot;…the intercourse of a small boy is not regarded as a sexual act.&quot; 7 The Talmud also says, &quot;A male aged nine years and a day who cohabits with his deceased brother&#39;s wife acquires her (as wife).&quot; 8 Clearly, the Talmud teaches that a woman is permitted to marry and have sex with a nine year old boy.</p>

<p>Sex at Three Years and One Day</p>

<p>In contrast to Simeon ben Yohai&#39;s dictum that sex with a little girl is permitted under the age of three years, the general teaching of the Talmud is that the rabbi must wait until a day after her third birthday. She could be taken in marriage simply by the act of rape.</p>

<p>R. Joseph said: Come and hear! A maiden aged three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition and if her deceased husband’s brother cohabits with her, she becomes his. (Sanh. 55b)</p>

<p>A girl who is three years of age and one day may be betrothed by cohabitation. . . .(Yeb. 57b)</p>

<p>A maiden aged three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition, and if her deceased husband’s brother cohabited with her she becomes his. (Sanh. 69a, 69b, also discussed in Yeb. 60b)</p>

<p>It was taught: R. Simeon b. Yohai stated: A proselyte who is under the age of three years and one day is permitted to marry a priest, for it is said, But all the women children that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves, and Phineas (who was priest, the footnote says) surely was with them. (Yeb. 60b)</p>

<p>[The Talmud says such three year and a day old girls are] . . . fit for cohabitation. . . But all women children, that have not known man by lying with him, it must be concluded that Scripture speaks of one who is fit for cohabitation. (Footnote to Yeb. 60b)</p>

<p>The example of Phineas, a priest, himself marrying an underage virgin of three years is considered by the Talmud as proof that such infants are &quot;fit for cohabitation.&quot;</p>

<p>The Talmud teaches that an adult woman’s molestation of a nine year old boy is &quot;not a sexual act&quot; and cannot &quot;throw guilt&quot; upon her because the little boy is not truly a &quot;man.” 9 But they use opposite logic to sanction rape of little girls aged three years and one day: Such infants they count as “women,&quot; sexually mature and fully responsible to comply with the requirements of marriage.</p>

<p>The Talmud footnotes 3 and 4 to Sanhedrin 55a clearly tell us when the rabbis considered a boy and girl sexually mature and thus ready for marriage. &quot;At nine years a male attains sexual matureness… The sexual matureness of woman is reached at the age of three.&quot;</p>

<p>No Rights for Child Victims</p>

<p>The Pharisees were hardly ignorant of the trauma felt by molested children. To complicate redress, the Talmud says a rape victim must wait until she was of age before there would be any possibility of restitution. She must prove that she lived and would live as a devoted Jewess, and she must protest the loss of her virginity on the very hour she comes of age. “As soon as she was of age one hour and did not protest she cannot protest any more.” 10</p>

<p>The Talmud defends these strict measures as necessary to forestall the possibility of a Gentile child bride rebelling against Judaism and spending the damages awarded to her as a heathen - an unthinkable blasphemy! But the rights of the little girl were really of no great consequence, for, &quot;When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this (three years and a day) it is as if one put the finger into the eye.&quot; The footnote says that as “tears come to the eye again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years.” 11</p>

<p>In most cases, the Talmud affirms the innocence of male and female victims of pedophilia. Defenders of the Talmud claim this proves the Talmud&#39;s amazing moral advancement and benevolence toward children; they say it contrasts favorably with &quot;primitive&quot; societies where the child would have been stoned along with the adult perpetrator.</p>

<p>Actually, the rabbis, from self-protection, were intent on proving the innocence of both parties involved in pedophilia: the child, but more importantly, the pedophile. They stripped a little boy of his right to &quot;throw guilt&quot; on his assailant and demanded complicity in sex from a little girl. By thus providing no significant moral or legal recourse for the child, the Talmud clearly reveals whose side it is on: the raping rabbi.</p>

<p>Pedophilia Widespread</p>

<p>Child rape was practiced in the highest circles of Judaism. This is illustrated from Yeb. 60b:</p>

<p>There was a certain town in the land of Israel the legitimacy of whose inhabitants was disputed, and Rabbi sent R. Romanos who conducted an inquiry and found in it the daughter of a proselyte who was under the age of three years and one day, and Rabbi declared her eligible to live with a priest.</p>

<p>The footnote says that she was “married to a priest” and the rabbi simply permitted her to live with her husband, thus upholding “halakah” as well as the dictum of Simeon ben Yohai, “A proselyte who is under the age of three years and one day is permitted to marry a priest.”12</p>

<p>These child brides were expected to submit willingly to sex. Yeb. 12b confirms that under eleven years and one day a little girl is not permitted to use a contraceptive but “must carry on her marital intercourse in the usual manner.”</p>

<p>In Sanhedrin 76b a blessing is given to the man who marries off his children before they reach the age of puberty, with a contrasting curse on anyone who waits longer. In fact, failure to have married off one’s daughter by the time she is 12-1/2, the Talmud says, is as bad as one who “returns a lost article to a Cuthean” (Gentile) - a deed for which “the Lord will not spare him.” 13 This passage says: “… it is meritorious to marry off one’s children whilst minors.”</p>

<p>The mind reels at the damage to the untold numbers of girls who were sexually abused within Judaism during the heyday of pedophilia. Such child abuse, definitely practiced in the second century, continued, at least in Babylon, for another 900 years.</p>

However, describing circumcision as a &quot;gateway mutilation&quot; which leads to potential long term problems is pure conjecture.

    <div class="md"><p>The group within Catholics that appears to condone pedophilia is a small one: Their clergy and global organized leadership. The highest levels of the Church are and have been involved not only in sex crimes, but in covering up those crimes for their fellows. </p>

<p>I know most of the followers are just following their parents&#39; tradition of blithely funding the legal defense for pederasts in dresses. They don&#39;t mean any harm.</p>
