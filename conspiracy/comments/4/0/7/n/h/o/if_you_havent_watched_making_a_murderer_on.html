    <div class="md"><p>The cops said that the reason they should not be accused of framing Steven, is that it would have been easier to kill him. This would not only have been more obvious, but more importantly would not have discredited him, which is what they needed to do to defeat his lawsuit. 
Given the lengths they appear to have been willing to go to &amp; the impact on them of loosing the lawsuit, I&#39;d back the notion of them committing the murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;d take guys who&#39;s biggest case ever isn&#39;t a loss. They charged him 200k + for a couple months of research and a few weeks for trial. </p>

<p>Any halfway decent attorney would come to the same logical conclusions that they did, and probably would have done a better job. </p>

<p>How did they not push for a trial outside of their area? How did they not ask the judge to recuse himself when he was clearly colluding with the state?</p>

<p>A lot of bad lawyering happened, despite the documentary painting them favorably. </p>

<p>The first jury was from out of the county. The second trial was out of county IIRC. Why the judge was from the county is a puzzle.</p>

<p>These are pretty good questions. I&#39;m gonna float them to <a href="/r/legaladvice">/r/legaladvice</a> and see what they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually better than I thought it would be and their are some interesting parallels with other conspiracies.</p>

<p>The publicly appointed lawyer starts out &quot;defending&quot; the nephew by declaring him guilty in public the day he took on the role and then proceeds to try to convince him to plead guilty to something he clearly didn&#39;t do.</p>

<p>There was no evidence to support the kids story. </p>

<p>I can think of several cases that have gone exactly like this. Boston Bomber, lawyer declares him guilty due to the influence of his older brother at the very start of the defence. </p>

<p>We can extrapolate on how and why the kid confessed to see links to other cases. </p>

<p>Though it&#39;s not major in the scope of things, it is quite important in how justice is contrived and directed by the state. </p>

<p>The interesting thing is that a lot of the info that was not legit, such as presenting the joke as happening on Nov 3, instead of the tenth and as originating from Steven, rather than a response that fit with the original scenario. </p>

<p>This is then printed far and wide as damning evidence. </p>
