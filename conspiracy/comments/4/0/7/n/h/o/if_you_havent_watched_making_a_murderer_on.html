       If you have still not watched it on netflix you need to set off some time to do so. I have never in my life been more certain of a real justice murder and a conspiracy of grandeur. We need you to do the right thing.

       The cops said that the reason they should not be accused of framing Steven, is that it would have been easier to kill him. This would not only have been more obvious, but more importantly would not have discredited him, which is what they needed to do to defeat his lawsuit. 
Given the lengths they appear to have been willing to go to &amp; the impact on them of loosing the lawsuit, I'd back the notion of them committing the murder.

       I think I'd take guys who's biggest case ever isn't a loss. They charged him 200k + for a couple months of research and a few weeks for trial.

       Any halfway decent attorney would come to the same logical conclusions that they did, and probably would have done a better job.

       How did they not push for a trial outside of their area? How did they not ask the judge to recuse himself when he was clearly colluding with the state?

       A lot of bad lawyering happened, despite the documentary painting them favorably.

       The first jury was from out of the county. The second trial was out of county IIRC. Why the judge was from the county is a puzzle.

       It's actually better than I thought it would be and their are some interesting parallels with other conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The publicly appointed lawyer starts out "defending" the nephew by declaring him guilty in public the day he took on the role and then proceeds to try to convince him to plead guilty to something he clearly didn't do.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no evidence to support the kids story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think of several cases that have gone exactly like this. Boston Bomber, lawyer declares him guilty due to the influence of his older brother at the very start of the defence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can extrapolate on how and why the kid confessed to see links to other cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though it's not major in the scope of things, it is quite important in how justice is contrived and directed by the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting thing is that a lot of the info that was not legit, such as presenting the joke as happening on Nov 3, instead of the tenth and as originating from Steven, rather than a response that fit with the original scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is then printed far and wide as damning evidence.

       Yes, the legal system is far from the illusion of Law and order in LA. I hope that image is about to crumble for good, so the people of the USA can see what the fuck is actually going on. The prosecutor is a fucking sexual stalker and then there are the endless inconsistencies.

       Assuming people are not skeptical because they have been persuaded by something you have not even seen is beyond ignorant and presumptuous. Perhaps look at the information before damning people as sheep

       Because your claiming people are taking spoonfed crap and regurgitating it without critically examining it based on nothing. Just because someone agrees with the filmmakers position doesn't mean they haven't questioned the content at all.

       It means that the documentary is good at showing that there is corruption for those who don't already realize it... And for those of us that already do we should be inclined to question the documentaries alt motives if there are any.
