       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly did these sages say?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pharisees justified child rape by explaining that a boy of nine years was not a “man” (See, "Judaism and Homosexuality: A Marriage Made in Hell") Thus they exempted him from God’s Mosaic Law: “You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination” (Lev. 18:22) One passage in the Talmud gives permission for a woman who molested her young son to marry a high priest. It concludes, “All agree that the connection of a boy aged nine years and a day is a real connection; whilst that of one less than eight years is not." 5 Because a boy under 9 is sexually immature, he can't "throw guilt" on the active offender, morally or legally. 6
      </p>
      <p>
       A woman could molest a young boy without questions of morality even being raised: "…the intercourse of a small boy is not regarded as a sexual act." 7 The Talmud also says, "A male aged nine years and a day who cohabits with his deceased brother's wife acquires her (as wife)." 8 Clearly, the Talmud teaches that a woman is permitted to marry and have sex with a nine year old boy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex at Three Years and One Day
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to Simeon ben Yohai's dictum that sex with a little girl is permitted under the age of three years, the general teaching of the Talmud is that the rabbi must wait until a day after her third birthday. She could be taken in marriage simply by the act of rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       R. Joseph said: Come and hear! A maiden aged three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition and if her deceased husband’s brother cohabits with her, she becomes his. (Sanh. 55b)
      </p>
      <p>
       A girl who is three years of age and one day may be betrothed by cohabitation. . . .(Yeb. 57b)
      </p>
      <p>
       A maiden aged three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition, and if her deceased husband’s brother cohabited with her she becomes his. (Sanh. 69a, 69b, also discussed in Yeb. 60b)
      </p>
      <p>
       It was taught: R. Simeon b. Yohai stated: A proselyte who is under the age of three years and one day is permitted to marry a priest, for it is said, But all the women children that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves, and Phineas (who was priest, the footnote says) surely was with them. (Yeb. 60b)
      </p>
      <p>
       [The Talmud says such three year and a day old girls are] . . . fit for cohabitation. . . But all women children, that have not known man by lying with him, it must be concluded that Scripture speaks of one who is fit for cohabitation. (Footnote to Yeb. 60b)
      </p>
      <p>
       The example of Phineas, a priest, himself marrying an underage virgin of three years is considered by the Talmud as proof that such infants are "fit for cohabitation."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Talmud teaches that an adult woman’s molestation of a nine year old boy is "not a sexual act" and cannot "throw guilt" upon her because the little boy is not truly a "man.” 9 But they use opposite logic to sanction rape of little girls aged three years and one day: Such infants they count as “women," sexually mature and fully responsible to comply with the requirements of marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Talmud footnotes 3 and 4 to Sanhedrin 55a clearly tell us when the rabbis considered a boy and girl sexually mature and thus ready for marriage. "At nine years a male attains sexual matureness… The sexual matureness of woman is reached at the age of three."
      </p>
      <p>
       No Rights for Child Victims
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pharisees were hardly ignorant of the trauma felt by molested children. To complicate redress, the Talmud says a rape victim must wait until she was of age before there would be any possibility of restitution. She must prove that she lived and would live as a devoted Jewess, and she must protest the loss of her virginity on the very hour she comes of age. “As soon as she was of age one hour and did not protest she cannot protest any more.” 10
      </p>
      <p>
       The Talmud defends these strict measures as necessary to forestall the possibility of a Gentile child bride rebelling against Judaism and spending the damages awarded to her as a heathen - an unthinkable blasphemy! But the rights of the little girl were really of no great consequence, for, "When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this (three years and a day) it is as if one put the finger into the eye." The footnote says that as “tears come to the eye again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years.” 11
      </p>
      <p>
       In most cases, the Talmud affirms the innocence of male and female victims of pedophilia. Defenders of the Talmud claim this proves the Talmud's amazing moral advancement and benevolence toward children; they say it contrasts favorably with "primitive" societies where the child would have been stoned along with the adult perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, the rabbis, from self-protection, were intent on proving the innocence of both parties involved in pedophilia: the child, but more importantly, the pedophile. They stripped a little boy of his right to "throw guilt" on his assailant and demanded complicity in sex from a little girl. By thus providing no significant moral or legal recourse for the child, the Talmud clearly reveals whose side it is on: the raping rabbi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophilia Widespread
      </p>
      <p>
       Child rape was practiced in the highest circles of Judaism. This is illustrated from Yeb. 60b:
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a certain town in the land of Israel the legitimacy of whose inhabitants was disputed, and Rabbi sent R. Romanos who conducted an inquiry and found in it the daughter of a proselyte who was under the age of three years and one day, and Rabbi declared her eligible to live with a priest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The footnote says that she was “married to a priest” and the rabbi simply permitted her to live with her husband, thus upholding “halakah” as well as the dictum of Simeon ben Yohai, “A proselyte who is under the age of three years and one day is permitted to marry a priest.”12
      </p>
      <p>
       These child brides were expected to submit willingly to sex. Yeb. 12b confirms that under eleven years and one day a little girl is not permitted to use a contraceptive but “must carry on her marital intercourse in the usual manner.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In Sanhedrin 76b a blessing is given to the man who marries off his children before they reach the age of puberty, with a contrasting curse on anyone who waits longer. In fact, failure to have married off one’s daughter by the time she is 12-1/2, the Talmud says, is as bad as one who “returns a lost article to a Cuthean” (Gentile) - a deed for which “the Lord will not spare him.” 13 This passage says: “… it is meritorious to marry off one’s children whilst minors.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The mind reels at the damage to the untold numbers of girls who were sexually abused within Judaism during the heyday of pedophilia. Such child abuse, definitely practiced in the second century, continued, at least in Babylon, for another 900 years.

       Yes, and it is well documented and common knowledge.  Not the case with Jews who occupy a false higher moral ground largely because it is taboo to criticize them for fear of being labeled antisemitic.

       Here's an example of what they do to their own dissenters:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yet recently a courageous 18-year-old woman reported to secular authorities her sexual victimization from the age of 12 by a respected Ultra-Orthodox counselor, Nechemya Weberman. The resulting court case has inflamed the Satmar Haredim against her, her husband, and their attorney, resulting in intense pressure. Her husband was offered $500,000 to drop the case and go to Israel. Her attorney had acid thrown into his face, temporarily blinding him. His daughter was shot in the face with a BB gun. Haaretz says that this case "has been rife with violence and intimidation." Yet the Brooklyn Civil Court convicted Weberman of 59 counts of sexual abuse, sentencing him to 103 years in prison."

       You're still going on about this?  Dude you really need to get out of your house and walk around the real world.  You clearly don't know the definitions of well documented or common knowledge.  Especially since almost everything you've said in this thread is complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part about uneducated people is when you read something written by someone uneducated,  and continue their bullshit without actually knowing what you're talking about.  It's people like you that spawn prejudice and racial behavior.  You should be very proud of yourself.

       I never said the Jewish religion didn't contain sick individuals.  They do.  Just like every religion.  But you keep inferring that all Jews are like this.  That they have some kind of Hush hush religion circulating around being a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       You my friend a fucking dumbass.  I couldn't give a fuck about you.  You believe whatever you want.  Sounds to me like you have a personal vendetta against religious Jews.  Did a fucked up rabbi touch you when you were a child Mr "I'm half jew"?  Is that it?  You clearly have made it a personal mission of yours to throw shit on the Jewish people because this is the second post of yours I've seen this week about the exact same topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said. I don't give a fuck about you or your pathetic excuse for logical outcome.  What bothers me is someone who really doesn't know any better is gunna read your anti semetic bullshit and develop the opinion that all Jews are like this.  Just like all Jews bathed in the blood of christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to educate yourself before you recklessly hate-post against an entire religion.

       Heh.  Someone pointed this post out from his history after he was defending his title "More proof that Judaism and Jews are pedophilic. But you can't say anything about it, because, muh 6 million you antisemite..." in the same way which he posted today.  This is apparently all he does and then when people call him on it it's "Saying Jews are pedophiles doesn't mean all Jews are pedophiles".  Good stuff.

       I wouldn't worry too much about that.  Anyone ready to drink that retard Kool-Aid was already indoctrinated up to feel the hatred flowing through them.  I think the bigger danger is that others will lump the conspiracy community as a whole in with bigots.  Even long before the infestation of the last 3 or so years here people tried to cast truthers and /conspiracy in general as antisemites
       <em>

       assholes like this lending credibility to the idea.

       Go back to Stormfront. People of ALL religions molest children and anyone with half a brain knows this. You clearly hate Jews and want to spread anti-Semitism. There's no conspiracy here. I've looked through your post history and you CLEARLY don't understand the difference between criticism and hate speech.

       This is a conspiracy board, NOT a platform for you to spread your hated of Jews. That's why I said go back to Stormfront. Want to criticize Israel and certain aspects of Judaism, ok, I'll join the discussion. If you want to say things like "All Jews are awful people," I'm going to call you out on your agenda to spread anti-semitism. Like I said, return to Stormfront and have your Jew bashing session if it makes you feel better.

       Stormfront is a honeypot probably mostly frequented by fake "anti-semites" like this guy.

       He keeps repeating the "if you want to know who's in power" line because he knows it's from a pedofile antisemite.  It's called muddying the water.  He's playing a character.

       I'm being hyperbolic.  There ARE antisemites and neonazis.  But their existence and numbers are amplified by fear monger groups like ADL and SPLC who want to tie in any criticism to "hate groups".  It's like, yes, there are anarchists, but those stocky black bloc guys with the bandanas on their faces are cops.

       yes, it IS bad.  You are promoting hate speech to prove a twisted and dishonest point.  And there are so many of you guys who do this.    You really think your upvotes are coming from "conspiracy theorists"?  No, they've coming from users like you who share the same ideology as
       <a href="/u/duckvimes">
        /u/duckvimes
       </a>
       and the rest of the paranoid zionists.  You're a contrived character whose vision of "what a conspiracy theorist looks like" is based on the action of other trolls just like yourself-
       <a href="/u/4to6">
        /u/4to6

       ,
       <a href="/u/gasthekikes">

       <a href="/u/semitrix">

       . All of you are the same.  You're all rabid zionists feigning antisemitism to draw out "real antisemitism", but the reality is that you're just preaching to your own troll choir.

       Islam teaches that Mohammed married Aisha at age 6, having sex with her at age 9.  Some people will say older times different ways, when was a child ever not a child? Abrahamic religions are all flawed in that they are all lies, based on barbaric attempts at morality and social engineering.

       I really want to know where Woody Allen fits into this puzzle. I think maybe Woody started molesting his daughter because he had traveled to Isreal to become an "oil anointed soldier" for the cause of circumcision and kid sex touching. This was probably around 1999, because the oil takes 4-6 months to reach the Jew organs inside a Jew body, and before the oil enters the gall bladder he would have only been able to touch her through a hole in a piece of cardboard (don't have a source for that, just intuition). Jews build up ejaculate darts through an enzyme released from the gall bladder, and Woody needed that period to work out the dart from inside his body (called Yog-Sothoth Kuurgh in Hebrew), so he could clear his spiritual and physical desk to begin preparing his plans for 9-11, which happened on September 11th, 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the question is, was known Jew David Cross involved in the planning or actual excretion of the dart? Cross has publicly said (on the Tonight Show) that he's hacked over forty Christian children to death and turned them "into mustard" in his lower east side apartment. Lower East Side? That's right, tons of Jews. Katz's in on Houston, possibly providing an outlet for Cross's "kiddy mustard" to be served to other Jews, stimulating to gall bladder to repeat the specific set of Jew processes necessary to make more darts.
      </p>
      <p>
