<p>This link received wide exposure yesterday, so the situation is not <em>too</em> depressing. From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holy crap. When I first had this idea I thought I might kill some conspiracy theories about the media. What we found is strong evidence of media bias.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another issue I&#39;ve seen is the general population&#39;s ignorance about media bias. If you suggest media bias, people will automatically assign you the term &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot; A claim of bias in favor of Clinton is really just saying the media corporations who financially support Clinton may tweak their programs in favor of their investment. This is obviously not an outrageous claim. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00000019&amp;cycle=Career">Time Warner and 21st Century Fox are both among her top financial backers</a></p>

<p>You will also notice that the financial sector supports Clinton as well. Very often, the financial world is literally one step away from major news outlets. I randomly selected NBC as a possible outlet with a pro-Clinton bias. I looked up who owns NBC- Comcast. Starting from the top of the list on &quot;Comcast NBCUniversal Executive Biographies,&quot;  the second biography is <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/news-information/leadership-overview/stephen-b-burke">Stephen B. Burke, Chief Executive Officer, NBCUniversal and
Senior Executive Vice President, Comcast Corporation.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steve serves on the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time Warner, a Clinton backer, owns CNN. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another good one:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos">George Stephanopoulos rose to early prominence as a communications director for the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign of Bill Clinton, subsequently becoming White House Communications Director, then Senior Advisor for Policy and Strategy before departing in December 1996. Today he is chief anchor and chief political correspondent for ABC News, co-anchor of ABC News&#39; Good Morning America, and host of ABC&#39;s Sunday morning This Week</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there are some at the tail end who missed Obamamania. I&#39;m just saying the majority didn&#39;t. There are no longer any child millennials. The oldest millennials are in their mid-30&#39;s, the youngest are 18-19, and I&#39;m on the younger side of the midway mark at 23 (24 this year). I remember Obamamania and most of my friends my age do too.</p>

<p>LOL yeah I&#39;ve seen this with the more naive of my kind for sure. But honestly, I&#39;ve been surprised at the number of people my age who have zero interest in Bernie or any of the politicians. I assume the older millennials are wiser still. But I&#39;ve been impressed at the political savvy of my peers. By political savvy, I mean they may not understand it all, but they are too disenchanted to want to. </p>

<p>Though the White House says Obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race, there is no doubt that he has long seen Clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy.</p>

<p>this is the only evidence they give- a quote from an unnamed former aid to obama:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think Barack Obama believes that it is incredibly important that Hillary Cinton succeeds him,&quot; said a former close aide to Obama who is still connected with the White House. &quot;The only way that we have an economy where people aren&#39;t losing their health care is if Hillary Clinton becomes president.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit about religion or religious conflict. In the least. I actively avoid religion as much as possible in my day-to-day life, and I am completely and intentionally clueless about Israel, aside from knowing where it is on a map.</p>

<p>Go ahead and search through my history! I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve even typed the word &quot;Israel&quot; until this very post. Some of us have &quot;so much link karma&quot; because we&#39;re active users who post things that people enjoy, as opposed to attacking people in comments with false claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media have made it pretty clear they&#39;re backing Hillary. Of course most of them, being owned by the same few people, aren&#39;t going to cover the opposition.</p>

<p>Reddit is pro-Bernie and the only way the vocal majority of the community could lean any further left would be to get a shovel and start digging. The problem here is that those people aren&#39;t keeping their pro-Bernie propaganda contained to their own boards and are spreading it far and wide across the rest of reddit.</p>

<p>Posts like this one are a prime example of the kind of pro-Sanders posts you see elsewhere, catering to a specific sub&#39;s interests. I&#39;ll break down the argument here a bit so you can see what I mean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so the situation is not too depressing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appeal to emotion. Sanders losing coverage, or being blacked out is &quot;depressing.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>general population&#39;s ignorance about media bias</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appeal to board interest. We enjoy a good conspiracy, and this is a pretty well-documented one, and not easily disproved in this instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A claim of bias in favor of Clinton is really just saying the media corporations who financially support Clinton may tweak their programs in favor of their investment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More appeal to board interest, painting corporations as the bad guys here. We all know they are, so this isn&#39;t really refutable and no one <em>wants</em> to, but that&#39;s the point of putting something like that in a persuasive argument--get the subject agreeing with you early on points they feel strongly about and it&#39;s easier to keep that agreement later. The rest is more of the same, leading to the implication that the media is pro-Clinton and unfairly not giving Bernie a chance, which is where that play to your emotions comes in. It&#39;s not <em>fair</em> and it&#39;s <em>depressing</em> that Bernie&#39;s not being given equal coverage, by networks whose owners support Clinton.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not saying OP is a shill. It&#39;s a decent post with evidence backing it. I am, however, saying that <em>OP&#39;s post looks an awful lot like your typical pro-Bernie propaganda posts</em> that we see all over the place now. And considering there&#39;s a protracted pro-Bernie campaign going on across every board, well...</p>

<p>Walks like a duck...</p>

<p>At times, yes. And <em>there is nothing wrong with that</em>. If reddit demands we not accuse people of shillery because they don&#39;t like <em>name calling</em>, then we simply <em>point out shill-like behavior</em>. It&#39;s the game they&#39;ve demanded we play.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve come to the heart of the matter. I <em>very carefully</em> did not call you a shill. I did, however, accuse you of behaving in the manner of one--which is not against the rules.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you <em>implying</em> that I&#39;m trolling? Name calling on reddit is serious business, you know! But you didn&#39;t name call, you merely pointed out behavior that looks somewhat trollish, even if it wasn&#39;t actually intended to be. I see you too are accomplished at the game of implications. Which would imply, based on your previous statement, that you feel it&#39;s okay for you to do it but not for others to do so. What&#39;s good for the goose is not quite good enough for the gander, eh?</p>

<p>Give it a rest. Who the fuck would these pro-Sanders shills be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see them all day, every day, across multiple subs. Hell, go to the front page and you&#39;re bound to see at least three now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people think that everything under the sun is a lie and there&#39;s always a nefarious conspiracy at play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><a href="/u/BikeBison">/u/BikeBison</a> used Power Word: Conspiracy! It was ineffective.</em></p>

<p>I do get what you&#39;re saying though, and I agree. Too often people scream &quot;conspiracy!&quot; over stupid shit that&#39;s probably not a conspiracy, and it does get tiring, even here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of working class people are passionate about Bernie, and are discussing him on social media like Reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, however, you can hardly deny that there is a large, <em>concerted effort</em> from people who don&#39;t fall under the category of &quot;blue collar working joe&quot; to present Bernie as some sort of socialist hero to the masses.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re right, though. Maybe I should give this one a rest for today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it your contention that there are a significant number of <em>paid</em> shills working for the Sanders campaign (or related superPAC) actively posting on reddit, posing as genuine supporters? </p>

<p>If so, I think I would have to disagree. Being in my 20s, many of my peer group are genuinely enthusiastic about Sanders, and many of that peer group also use social media extensively. I don&#39;t think the Sanders campaign would be actively paying shills to spread their message online because there&#39;s so many people willing and eager to do it for free and, because they genuinely believe the message, do it better.</p>

<p>Now if your argument is that these 20-somethings have been indoctrinated and propagandized from a young age, and for that reason are spreading Sanders&#39; message, you may have a point. But I don&#39;t know that many people would consider that shilling. I think to call that shilling dilutes and cheapens the word beyond all usefulness.</p>

<p>Yes, however, there are also a number of <em>genuine supporters</em> spamming for Bernie as hard as they can, doing essentially the exact same job. Hell, there are probably more of those than legitimate shills. It doesn&#39;t make it any less toxic to communities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I know, most millinneals are, unfortunately. Not enough time spent in the real world and too fresh out of the brainwashing/programming institutions that are high school and college to truly make an informed decision for themselves as opposed to simply either echoing each other or regurgitating what their teachers and professors have said.</p>

<p>This is pretty much my point exactly. And as I said, it&#39;s hard to differentiate shill from true believer.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It is a good argument. Is it shilling, if you&#39;re not being paid for the work? It doesn&#39;t change the fact that there is a concerted effort to post pro-Bernie material, be it from legitimate shills or dumb millennials.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said before, Bernie is reddit&#39;s golden boy lord and savior. Question Bernie and lose imaginary internet points while simultaneously having your opinion suppressed and being subject to harassment from pro-Bernie supporters that they claim isn&#39;t harassment and that <em>you</em> harassed <em>them</em> by questioning Bernie.</p>

<p>He is, but reddit is fooled by anyone waving the flag of &quot;HOPE AND CHANGE&quot; and espousing socialist views.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So, typical politician. I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t also complain along the lines of &quot;well, it just couldn&#39;t be helped, there was nothing we could do to keep that bill from being gutted.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to take eight years of him openly betraying everything he&#39;s promised them for reddit to take up--after all, it&#39;s taken <em>two terms</em> for reddit to wake up to Obama&#39;s bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought. I agree Reddit seems to have a huge <em>boner for Bernie</em>, but it&#39;s pretty similar to the Obama enthusiasm in 2008. I think people just get heavy with promoting a candidate they think will actually change things. </p>

<p>Also, I want to point out that Hillary had a ton of support on Reddit before Sanders became really popular. It seems almost like the Hillary campaign realized they couldn&#39;t hold back the water, so they just let the dam collapse and focused resources elsewhere. </p>
