<blockquote>
<p>The jury needed only three hours to deliberate. But when Simpson was called back into the courtroom for the verdict, he noticed that the crown prosecutor wasn’t in the room. A witness later told him that the prosecutor was seen departing the jury room right before the jury was brought back into the courtroom. It proceeded to find him guilty on all counts. “So I got in touch with the judge, but he wouldn’t do a damn thing. They can tamper with juries, but not us. Then he called me into the side room be- fore sentencing and said, ‘Rick, the truth of the matter is that <strong>the government wants the researchers to bring this out.</strong>’ I looked at him and said, ‘If one of your kids was diagnosed with cancer tomorrow, what would you be looking for?’ And down went his head. So we go back into the courtroom, and he says: ‘In my 34 years in the legal system, I’ve never seen a case like this. There was no criminal intent.’ He admitted the scientific evidence exists to back up what I was doing. Now I was facing 12 years in jail, but he gave me a $2,000 fine and didn’t even put me on probation, because he was get- ting a little bit of conscience. One time I used to be proud to be a Canadian; now that word means nothing to me.”</p>

<p>And now slowly, dragging out as much profit as they can, government researchers are bringing it out.</p>

<p>mycomedicine is going to be a big thing, because even the FDA can&#39;t stop it because people will grow their own medicine, and if they even outlaw that, all you have to do is go outside.  Trametes versicolor is ubiquitous and aggressive so easy to find and fairly easy for lay person to identify</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2009, Stamets said, his mother was diagnosed with late stage breast cancer. She was reticent to visit the doctor’s office, and when she did finally go, after a fearful phone conversation with her son, she was given three months to live.</p>

<p>The doctor prescribed a treatment of chemotherapy and Herceptin and noted a study into turkey tail mushrooms. Perhaps she could take some of those too. On the advice of the doctor (she had to hear it from him) and Stamets—she did.</p>

<p>Five years on she’s cancer free, the only survivor of a group of fifty patients taking Herceptin. According to Stamets, the turkey tail mushroom suppresses inflammatory response, enhances the microbiome, and may be a powerful adjunct cancer therapy. “We think it decloaks cancers for discovery by the immune system,” he said.</p>

<p>These findings show that up to 9 grams/day of a Tv preparation is safe and tolerable in women with breast cancer in the postprimary treatment setting. This Tv preparation may improve immune status in immunocompromised breast cancer patients following standard primary oncologic treatment.</p>

<p>This lead to $5.4m in further studies, of which I have yet to see results from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is in how long they have known and how long they will take to &quot;bring it out&quot;. </p>

<p>The case was a decade ago. Though it is now identified as a cancer killer, it is extremely slowly being made available. </p>

<p>So did they merely know a decade ago, or prior to this? If you had cancer during the last decade and weren&#39;t being pointed to the oil, since anyone could grow a few plants and extract the oil pretty easily, you&#39;d be spending hundreds of thousands on cancer treatment that are not as effective. </p>

<p>Edit: The other problem is that a guy who was helping people at no charge was railroaded by the government and faced 12 years in prison for trying to help people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was saying it behind closed doors, and he did anything but railroad Rick Simpson.</p>

<p>The Crown (our DA), did. He went into the jury deliberation area and told them they must find him guilty.</p>

<p>They did. The judge then had the choice on sentencing. He could have given Rick Simpson 12 years. Instead he gave him the minimum, a fine without probation. He couldn&#39;t have been more lenient since the verdict was already in.</p>

<p>If the judge had any information about them wanting &quot;it in or out&quot;, it would be coming from the government. How would that have gone:</p>

<p>Judge: The people testifying are saying this is legit, wtf?</p>

<p>Gov: The research seems to be leading in that direction, but it&#39;s too early to fully determine and we will release it when we are certain.</p>

<p>Judge: So wtf am I doing judging this guy who made no money off it?</p>

<p>Gov: We can&#39;t let some unknown guy start being a medical leader, think of the havoc it will cause. The info will be released soon, just do your job.</p>

<p>Then, what&#39;s the judge going to do? If they release the data never, the judge has already followed through and they can just BS him every time he ever mentions it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hemp and it&#39;s derivatives can displace many existing industries. </p>

<p>Hemp could allow us to tackle pollution, renewables, medical issues. In many respects, it challenges globalization. It&#39;s very light, weighing approximately 1/8 water. It doesn&#39;t travel well, but can be grown anywhere. Places which can grow nothing else can grow hemp with few inputs. </p>

<p>This sounds like one of those Sovereign Citizen videos on Youtube where they claim to have won their case. It always goes something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;And I told the judge that he had no authority over me because the court was flying a gold fringed admiralty flag. The judge broke down in tears because his charade had been revealed for the entire courtroom to see. He apologized, dismissed my case with prejudice, and awarded me immunity from future prosecution. The entire courtroom, including the bailiffs and judge, gave me a standing ovation as a I left the room.&quot;</p>

<p>Then you actually look into the case and read the transcripts, and it turns out none of that happened.</p>

<p>I really doubt the judge said any of that to him, and there&#39;s no proof that he did except this guy&#39;s word.</p>

<p>So I agree that research indicates marijuana might help with some cancers. </p>

<p>But killing some types of cancer cells is a far cry from being a complete cure for all types of cancer and other problems like diabetes and sclerosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rick Simpson, one of the world’s cannabis icons and activists for legalization of marijuana, has healed more than 5000 people with cannabis oil – after he was diagnosed with the most severe skin cancer in 2002 and <a href="http://phoenixtears.ca/">cured the dreaded disease using hemp oil</a>.</p>

<p>Rick, a self-taught doctor, otherwise a mechanical engineer from Canada, told Telegraf how he conquered the carcinoma and fought against the government and corrupt doctors, as well as <a href="http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/1241708-covek-koji-je-izlecio-5-000-ljudi-od-raka-evo-recepta-za-ulje-od-kanabisa-kojim-sam-bolesne-dizao-iz-mrtvih-foto-uzivo">shared the recipe</a> that kills all types of tumors and a vast variety of serious health issues like diabetes, arteriosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, asthma, and psoriasis – in 90 days.</p>

<p>He recalled:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was 2002. The doctors had given up on me because I’d had more than one unsuccessful operation on three pigmented lesions on my face’s skin. As soon as these were removed, they would reappear even more infected! </p>

<p>Since I had been studying plants as a hobby for years, one day as I was looking at my wounds in the mirror, I remembered a study from the University of Virginia that said that THC, an active component of cannabis could cure cancer. I took some cannabis oil I had prepared beforehand from the cabinet and dripped a few drops directly on the wound.</p>

<p>After four days I removed the bandages and I couldn’t believe my eyes! The wound was no longer there, and my skin was regenerated! I immediately started talking to people about how I had cured skin cancer with cannabis oil… Everyone laughed at me, but then eleven and a half years have passed, and the <a href="http://www.viralalternativenews.com/2015/11/rick-simpson-healed-5000-people-from.html">cancer still hasn’t returned</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From then on, Rick decided to help people in need. Among the thousands of incredible stories about people that he has cured, the last one – about an 80-year-old man who had lung cancer and practically was on his deathbed – stands out. After six weeks of treatment with hemp oil, he needed no insulin, and after three months he was completely cured.</p>

<p>The ride wasn’t easy for Rick. In 2005, he was imprisoned for four days for cultivating, owning and selling marijuana (he claims he never sold weed, only hemp oil). He “pulled through” with a fine of $2,000 even though at one point he was threatened with the punishment of 12 years in prison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The worst thing was the fact that the jurors were people whose loved ones I treated with hemp oil. Even the judge knew it was all a farce. At one point he even said that instead of judging me, he should be rewarding me. Everyone knew and no one could do anything about it. <a href="http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/1246757-man-that-cured-over-5-000-people-of-cancer-heres-the-hemp-oil-i-raised-the-ded-with-video">They didn’t even allow ten patients I cured from cancer to testify.</a> They didn’t allow the doctors to go to the bench, as well as they didn’t let me present a bunch of medical documentation on the effects of my oil.</p>

<p>By what mechanism would a single recipe cure such a wide variety of issues with vastly different causes? Cancers, brain issues, lung issues, skin issues, blood issues, vascular issues... Why would &quot;one neat trick&quot; work for all of those things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Exactly. So I took issue with the title of this article and what it suggests. It makes it sound like all the person did was ingest cannibanoids.
