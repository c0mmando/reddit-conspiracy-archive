       With tensions running high at the Malheur Wildlife Reserve, the Oath Keepers organization is reporting that they have been informed by sources within the U.S. special forces community that special operations assets have been moved into the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was reported on Tuesday that federal authorities are planning to cut the power to the commandeered facility, with hopes that the sub-zero Oregon winter would drive them out without incident, but the potential exists that cutting the power is a simple precursor to laying siege to the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a report by the
       <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/urgent-warning-on-or-standoff-military-special-op-assets-have-been-assigned-for-standoff-get-all-children-out-of-there-immediately/">
        Oath Keepers founder and National President, Stewart Rhodes
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oath Keepers has received very credible information from an active duty source within the special operations community that at least one SOD-X unit under the command of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) has been tasked for this standoff at the Malheur Wildlife Reserve and moved to the area. Given this, we should expect that other special operations assets, such as Delta Force, will also be involved if the Obama Administration decides to give the green light on a military raid/strike.  And we should expect the presence of the infamous FBI HRT (which were present at both Ruby Ridge and Waco).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Numerous major national militia groups, including the Three Percenter movement and the Oath Keepers, have come out to publicly condemn the actions of the Bundys. Many in the community have deemed those involved in the standoff as potential federal agent provocateurs, who in no way represent the militia movement and are instead meant to undermine its legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mike Vanderboegh, founder of the Three Percent movement wrote this on the initial day of the standoff:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I was first apprised of this a few minutes ago by folks on the ground out in Oregon. They report that Payne, Ritzheimer and every other “tiger-talking” fruit, nut and federal provocateur previously identified from the Bundy standoff were now in possession of the building and daring the Feds to do anything about it. My initial reaction was to observe that at least afterward we’ll know who the federal snitches are because they will be the only ones who survive the raid to take back the building. My understanding is that this premeditated action has been condemned by the Oregon Three Percenters and other groups but the fact of the matter is that these people are writing checks that they expect the rest of us to cash in our blood. And the Hammonds themselves are disavowing this action in the strongest terms.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Many of the suspected agent provocateurs were identified as the very same individuals who were reported to have, on numerous occasions, attempted to instigate violence against law enforcement and federal agents during the Bundy Ranch standoff in Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake that this incident will play directly into the ongoing gun control/citizen disarmament movement currently playing out in the United States. The timing of the siege couldn’t have come at a more opportune time for federal authorities to continue to push their narrative about “militia terrorists,” marking a huge propaganda victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below is an official statement from the Oath Keepers organization addressing the Oregon standoff:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Short Oath Keepers Statement on this Standoff
       </p>
       <p>
        I will post a longer statement later, but for now, here is a brief statement on this situation, in general:
       </p>
       <p>
        Oath Keepers adamantly opposes the armed takeover of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. This is not in keeping with the moral imperative of only using force in defense when people’s lives are at stake, as at Bundy Ranch in 2014. In this case, neither the Hammonds nor their neighbors were in imminent threat of being murdered, and neither the Hammonds nor their neighbors asked for any form of armed standoff. In fact, they oppose it. This is being done by outsiders who misled and deceived locals, deceived the Hammonds, and deceived the patriot movement by luring them in with a peaceful rally and then attempting to rope them into a premeditated, manufactured armed standoff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Ammon Bundy and Ryan Payne (who we suspect is an agent provocateur) told the locals in the Committee of Safety, at a public town hall meeting on December 15, that they, the locals on the committee, would be making the decisions on what was to be done, how, and when. That was a lie, as they were already staging their men and supplies in the area to takeover the wildlife refuge, and had already planned out this takeover of the federal facility at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge.
       </p>
       <p>
        By doing this, they have given Obama the best New Years present he could hope for – an example of militia movement/patriot aggression, which gives up the high ground while also having the least credibility and support from the locals possible, after lying to them, and also the least support from the patriot community, who were also blind-sided by Ammon and Ryan Payne.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, as much as we oppose what Ammon Bundy and Ryan Payne have done, we must warn the Obama Administration that it does not have free reign to “Waco” the people in this standoff by using deadly military force, such as an SOD-X, Delta Force, or the FBI HRT to kill them all. The Federal government must respect their right to due process and do all it can to end this standoff peacefully, without loss of life.  It must treat it like the Freeman standoff, not the Waco standoff. There will be no more free Wacos, as Mike Vanderbgh, Founder of the Three Percenter movement puts it.  Treat this with kid gloves or risk a civil war.
       </p>

       The Oath Keepers say "This is not in keeping with the moral imperative of only using force in defense when people’s lives are at stake."  So if officials come to take their guns, are they going to hand them over because their lives are not at stake?  Makes me wonder who the agents are, the Militiamen at the reserve or the Oathkeepers?   The militiamen at the reserve have not hurt anyone or destroyed any property (like the Fergeson protesters).  Oath Keepers can't seem to find any benefit to what their fellow militiamen are doing, and instead harp on how good it is for the feds, but are those words helping?

       PSA - when the media delays in jumping on events like this to brand and label the people, it just means theyre not ready and dont have their pawns in place yet.  Theyre waiting for optimal moment before attempting to slam dunk the opposing group via setting them up and pointing a finger in fear.
      </p>

       All the people who saw this and were baffled by the lack of chatter will get their wish soon.

       Once you see their movements with their obvious goals in mind, its easier to see and almost predict whats going to happen (media wise).  This is helpful in understanding the nature of our current state of affairs.

       Yep, this is exactly what it looks like to me, use a staged fake militia movement to give the Whitehouse emergency powers to legislate a defacto gun ban a la Patriot Act style. It is so shamefully obvious all legitimate militia should publically denounce these agents and ban the members from participating in this pysop. Defeat the beast by now playing into its end game.

       If every time militiamen make a stand they are blamed for being agents and not doing any good when do people think is the right time to make a stand?  How late in the game does it have to be before it is finally time to say no?  It seems to me the ranchers have been dealing with a lot worse from the government than the rest of us and that they are justified in protesting.  Remember they have no hurt anyone or destroyed any property.  I think they deserve our support and help instead of attacking them for what they are doing, even if it isn't what most of us would do.

       I think that's the current plan, it seems they've learned from the PR disaster of Waco and Ruby Ridge.  But they're also doing this other stuff as backup plans

       I wonder what would happen to this country if you had like the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and PETA were waiting behind some trees for the FBI to come in to Waco the Oathkeepers and then run up behind them.... 'Suprise Muthafuckas!" ...and catch them in the crossfire.

       Would this unite the country against the government?

       No?  Oh well.  Makes for a funny populism fantasy.

       Wonder what the outcome of this is going to be. Sounds to me like most of us are eager to express our aggression. Im just not convinced these guys have the best interests of free americans at heart here.

       Am interested in it though, so, I'm open to learn . Ive been trying to learn as much as I can. My gut tells me they don't have the same list of priorities as me. Perhaps I'm wrong though

       For fuck's sake! They should have cut power &amp; water from the beginning. No need for an armed confrontation but these fucktard "militia-men" are nothing more than pathetic GRIFTERS, trying to cash in on the lucrative publicity racket by trying to score attention, online donations, paid interviews, speeches, maybe their own reality show. Like the Palins, Ben Carson, Hillary Clinton, or all the recent so-called religious conservatives discriminating against gays. 
The Bundys want Federal lands that ALREADY belong to all of us, to be privatized so they alone can profit from their exploitation.
You can't claim to uphold the constitution while completely denying the legitimacy of the Federal Government. You can't pledge allegiance to the American flag while simultaneously flying the battle flag of the Confederacy or the fricken NAZI flag.

       These guys are about to learn a valuable lesson the hard way - the militia are basically gun nuts living out their fantasies. They are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       going to risk their lives for what they claim to believe in.
