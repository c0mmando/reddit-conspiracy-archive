Then it was an interest in why Andrea Mitchell (Mrs. Greenspan) also has a never-ending career.  Then I wondered why the daughter of Zbigniew Brzezinski was so successful in the media.  Then it went on and on and on...  That&#39;s when it all started to make a lot of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conversations with my retired naval officer and Freemason father are what made me start to open my eyes. Two stories from his time in the Persian gulf in particular.  After enough time had passed and he was no longer active duty he started slowly revealing things that bothered him during his naval career. Now my dad is a die hard patriot. He is super proud of his 21 years in the navy and did a lot of cool things like under cover counter narcotics sting operations in south america, his adventures under the north pole polar ice cap in submarines, and his education from (and teaching position later on) nuclear power school. He has always regarded the military with fond memories however he did disclose to me that while he was in the Persian gulf during desert storm related conflict he would become enraged watching CNN &quot;live coverage&quot; of the area he was deployed in and seeing reporting of events and situations that were not happening at all. Just bold faced lies. He&#39;d be on the deck of the ship looking out around the area the news was covering and the images and videos of events supposedly currently happening were no where to be seen. He didnt ever get too specific because alot is still classified information however he did drunkely confide one night while we were drinking and discussing politics that the only act in his career that haunts him and guilts him deeply is when he was ordered to carry out a lethal missile launch and killed innocent people in a scapegoat narrative for the sole purpose of distracting media attention from &quot;bill Clinton&#39;s blowjob&quot; as he put it. That was the first time a false flag narrative had been confirmed to me firsthand by someone who was involved in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My school system, teachers (figures of authority and trust) were anything but. I was born with a problem with authority and questioned or distrusted most everything until I learned about it for myself first. My real interest in conspiracy of any kind came from shows like X-Files and Unsolved Mysteries when i was a kid, combined with stories from family. Then the internet and youtube happened. Now I sift through stories daily, and try to put together the real meaning behind events and narratives.</p>
