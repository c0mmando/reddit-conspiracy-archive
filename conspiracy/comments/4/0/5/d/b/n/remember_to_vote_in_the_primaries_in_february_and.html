       Typo Now means Saturday 9th TODAY for many of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Primary dates of voting are here
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2016-presidential-primary-schedule-calendar/">
        http://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2016-presidential-primary-schedule-calendar/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have to be registered 30 or 14 days AHEAD OF THOSE DATES in most states.
      </p>
      <p>
       To find out where to register online or to download forms for your state go here
       <a href="http://www.rockthevote.com/get-informed/elections/voter-registration-deadlines.html">
        http://www.rockthevote.com/get-informed/elections/voter-registration-deadlines.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in most states you cant register as an Independent and then try to vote for either Sanders or Trump . You must register as a Democrat or Republican WHEN YOU REGISTER because it takes too long to add a party change after you register. So MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

        Republican IT guru subpoenaed to testify in an Ohio federal court regarding alleged voter fraud in the 2004 election, was warned at least twice about flying his plane because his plane might be sabotaged, canceled flights because of suspicious problems with his plane, then dies in a plane crash.

       Stephen Spoonamore who was mentioned in that news article was featured on an ABC interview on election fraud which never aired. He has worked for the Secret Service, Pentagon, FBI, and major banks detecting credit card fraud. He flat out states DIEBOLD is stealing elections.

       Yes.
I know about it. Mike Connel. Smarttech.

      <p>
       However if the voter turnout and result is overwhelming it will be harder for them to get away with that again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly if two outsiders Sanders and Trump werent running I wouldnt care about another election because I would beleive there was no point since all the others are pawns.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I beleive these two are a last real chance because I beleive they are truly independent. I may be wrong but its the last  election I'll care about if I am.

       Some neck beard will inevitably yell. "It's all rigged your vote doesn't matter". And it might be right but it also might be wrong just like anything. Might as well go out and vote you lazy bastards. Write in Kermit the frog if you have to.

       no you actually make it worse when you vote because you are giving energy to a system that will take that support and use it against all of us. So you actually make it worse for me and all of the people around you. I dont like to see people put my life in jeopardy so haphazardly without looking at the big picture. Everyone that votes puts my life in danger when you make a decision to vote in federal elections. If you want to vote then keep it in your local community. Dont give the federal government any more power. They just get strong and people get weaker.  Its just like any war, we are at war with a systemic failure in government that is controlled by a very few at the top, you cant change their minds. If you feed it, it will continue to get stronger.

       Its really about choice, your choice. 
Doing what is true for you, if you can sleep at night without any doubts that what you are doing is the right thing to do, then do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, knowing what I know now, I couldn't in good conscience make peoples lives any worse then they are now by supporting tyranny. I'm responsible for every decision I make, and my decisions have consequences.
