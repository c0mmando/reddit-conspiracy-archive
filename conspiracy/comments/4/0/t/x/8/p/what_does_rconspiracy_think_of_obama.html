       A wolf in sheep's clothing, all style and no substance.  Obamacare was a scam, amounting to a federal handout to big pharma / insurance.  By expanding illegal wars overseas, supervising the build out of a terrorist drone program, and overseeing the legitimization of the NSA, he's done more for the military industrial complex than even those that came before him.  Throw in his backing for the TPP and you can make a case for worst president ever.
      </p>

       EDIT: forgot the unabated fracking buildout on his watch, expanding into even our National Parks.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also called "Obamacare," may be the biggest insurance scam in history. The industries that profit from our current health care system wrote the legislation, heavily influenced the regulations and have received waivers exempting them from provisions in the law. This has all been done to protect and enhance their profits.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the meantime, the health care crisis continues. Fewer people, even those with health insurance, can afford the health care they need because of out-of-pocket costs. The ACA continues that trend by pushing skimpy health plans with low coverage and restricted networks.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what happens in a market-based system of health care. People get only the amount of health care they can afford, rather than what they need. The ACA takes our failed market-based system to a whole new level by forcing the uninsured to purchase private health plans and using the government to sell and subsidize them.

       I think Obama's image is clouded by all the charisma and confidence he has. If you look at his conflicts in the Middle East, his reliance on drones, and his increased surveillance on American citizens you'll realize that he's everything that was wrong with Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go even further and look at his cabinet and federal officials that he nominates you'll notice the revolving door of corporate shills or establishment politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's always been a great speaker and I believe that's one of the reasons he was elected. However, just because he can repackage all the bad shit he's done and present it to the American people doesn't mean that we should just accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows? Maybe Obama isn't some evil sociopath with great speaking ability. He might just be extremely arrogant and pragmatic.

       He's owned. He's about to be rich. He's laughing his ass off at the GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: His legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       He made a huge mistake pushing for the ACA to start his first term. There were other things that were more important at the time. But, in the end, he chose ACA and that will far and away be most often considered his legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ACA was a win-win for him. Either it did what he said it would - get more people insured at an overall reduced cost nationwide - or it would fail miserably and all but force single payer. Either way, America closes the gap between itself and the rest of the civilized world, a world in which getting sick shouldn't bankrupt your family.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though he focused on something other than what I think he should have right out of the gate, and that caused no end of battles for him later on, I think he was still quite successful in achieving his goal.

       The huge mistake I always felt was going to the Republicans and thinking they'd actually respond to reason on this particular subject and make pushing improvements to healthcare as a bipartisan effort.

       used to think he was a politician, but since Sandy Hoax and his doing of it or sanctioning of it, hes just a cheap bad actor for hire.

       the fake SSN and the bathhouse aspect don't really matter, Obama could have been wearing a dress in the Whitehouse, if he had been a good POTUS, thats his/their business.

       It has been interesting. Obviously most of reddit think he is the greatest president in modern history. I was hoping this sub has a more realistic view on things. I was right.

       I personally believe that the president has no real role in politics. He's just a smiling face. A puppet. All the decisions made that have anything to do with this country are set in stone long before they are made, and the president is just like a speaker. I have nothing against Mr. Obama, just the bastards that give him his makeup and script and operate the cameras and tell him what to do.

       A pawn that announces the next part of the adjenda by manipulation and pretending to ask permission.
He talks like he respects the government's structure. He's also being tooled to test the waters regarding getting away with writing law without congress. It's all illegal, and they're not really our government because they don't act in the interests of or represent the people.
