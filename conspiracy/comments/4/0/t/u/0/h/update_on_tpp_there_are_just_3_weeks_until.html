        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last Night, I watched President Obama give his final State of the Union address. I expected him to talk at length about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Instead, the President said just 67 words about the deal because he knows it’s become hugely unpopular with people from across the political spectrum.</p>

<p>We have the momentum to stop this -- but corporations and special interests will be pouring money and influence into DC to get it passed any way they can.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fightthetpp.org/?can_id=480f4ce14e485fe33fb382a6624eb901&amp;source=email-the-tpp-2&amp;email_referrer=the-tpp-2&amp;email_subject=the-tpp&amp;link_id=0">Click here</a> to take action now before Congress votes on the TPP. Tell your lawmakers not to sell out the Internet and demand they vote NO on the TPP</p>

<p>There are just 3 weeks until President Obama intends to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). After that, Congress can ratify the treaty at any time.</p>

<p>The good news is that last night’s State of the Union address was the clearest sign yet that we have the power to stop the TPP. During the speech, President Obama talked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership for just 28 seconds. He said all of 67 words. And when he was done, only his cabinet stood to clap.</p>

<p>The lackluster response underscores what we’ve been hearing from allies in Washington, DC: right now there just aren’t enough votes to pass the TPP.</p>

<p>But the bad news is that the the State of the Union was just the beginning of the final push to approve the TPP. Soon, the MPAA, the Chamber of Commerce, and other powerful special interest groups will be pouring money into lobbying efforts to undermine our the democratic process and push the TPP through however they can.</p>

<p>We need to act now to get as many members of Congress on the record opposing the TPP as possible before the lobbyists and campaign contributions tip the scales.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fightthetpp.org/?can_id=480f4ce14e485fe33fb382a6624eb901&amp;source=email-the-tpp-2&amp;email_referrer=the-tpp-2&amp;email_subject=the-tpp&amp;link_id=1">Tell Congress: The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a sinking ship — vote against Internet censorship and vote NO on the TPP</a></p>

<p>In November, we finally got to read the full text of the TPP, and it is worse than we thought. It reads like a wish list for the most powerful companies — giving Facebook, Comcast, Wal-Mart, and Monsanto the policies they’ve always wanted.</p>

<p>It contains extreme copyright provisions that will lead to a more restricted, expensive, and censored Internet.<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151229/06561133182/tpps-forgotten-danger-stronger-trade-secrets-protection-with-criminal-penalties-infringement.shtml?can_id=480f4ce14e485fe33fb382a6624eb901&amp;source=email-the-tpp-2&amp;email_referrer=the-tpp-2&amp;email_subject=the-tpp&amp;link_id=4">1</a> It threatens democracy and national sovereignty by letting corporations sue governments in secret tribunals to undermine our basic rights.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/business/trans-pacific-partnership-seen-as-door-for-foreign-suits-against-us.html?_r=1&amp;can_id=480f4ce14e485fe33fb382a6624eb901&amp;source=email-the-tpp-2&amp;email_referrer=the-tpp-2&amp;email_subject=the-tpp&amp;link_id=5">2</a></p>

<p>The fact that members of Congress didn’t stand up to applaud when President Obama spoke about the TPP last night speaks volumes. It says that right now, Congress is on the fence — which means all the activism, the calls, emails, and protests, have been making an impact. Activism is the reason that this morning Senator John Thune, said the TPP is, &quot;on life support.&quot;</p>

<p>But we know that can change all too quickly. Remember how much momentum we had against CISA? We’ve learned to always go big or go home, and that every single call and email matters.</p>

<p>We CAN stop the TPP — but we’re going to need to step it up in the coming weeks to stave off the White House’s renewed push. So take action and send an email today, and most importantly forward this email to your friends and family and share on social media to sound the alarm.</p>
