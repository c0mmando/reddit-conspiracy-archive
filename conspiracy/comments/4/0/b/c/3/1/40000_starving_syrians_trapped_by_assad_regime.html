<p>Really, one of the dodgiest election results of all time giving a despot, psychopathic murderer almost 90% of the vote? </p>

<p>From your article: &quot;The election was boycotted by the opposition, and ignored and even ridiculed in rebel-held areas where fighting continues. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was among those in the West who denounced the balloting, calling it &quot;a great big zero.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source for that is a world tribune article which no longer exists and was debunked when it did, because it had no real sources. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A brief look quickly reveals the nature of its content and its lack of substantiation. It starts off wrong with the title, as “Nato data” does not imply data “compiled by Western-sponsored activists and organizations …relayed to NATO“, but data actually belonging to the organisation. Moreover, if this is followed with the main claim that “Assad is winning…” it does not imply that Nato merely “has been studying data …” but rather that it concluded something from this study.</p>

<p>The article refers to Middle East Newsline, no specific reference is given but the particular article Syrian Support for Assad Skyrockets linked here is the most likely one to have been used as the source; it’s the same topic and came out the same day. Since it remains unavailable, to me at least as I’m not going to spend a dime on purchasing it, any claims made about any data and its source being “a range of activists and independent organizations that were working in Syria, particularly in relief efforts” along with the identity of the “Western source familiar with the data” who is quoted, cannot be verified. It seems that this “Western source” is someone who bought the article, because the author is apparently not familiar with the data supposedly in it. So what we have here is an unnamed person being familiar with certain data that other unnamed people have given to Nato, which they have apparently looked at. In other words, there is no news.
