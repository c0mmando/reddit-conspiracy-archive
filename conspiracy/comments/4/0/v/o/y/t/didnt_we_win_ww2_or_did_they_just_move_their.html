    <div class="md"><p>My take is that the 1% (Basically rich Capitalists and Bankers in the UK and US) used Germany to attack Russia/USSR. So, under this interpretation, the Nazis and the UK and some rich Americans were on the same side. As you can see from the fact that Capitalist US companies help the Chinese Communist Party suppress their own people, there is no real difference between Capitalist and Communist, or Nazi and American. The real split is between the controllers and the slaves. </p>

<p>The UK used the US to control the Russians after the failure of the Germans. This was the Cold War. This ended in the defeat of the Russians, and the empovershment of the Americans. Note how the EU has become richer than the US, while largely under the control of the City in London. </p>

<p>Worth bearing in mind that there is a huge difference between Bolshevism/&quot;Marxist-Leninism&quot; and Marxism. Marx had a vision of a Communist omega-civilization once the means of production exist to produce abundance. That dream was used to excuse genocide and tyranny as a method of spreading state-capitalism as Lenin so eloquently puts it in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm">this letter</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USSR fought 80% of Germany&#39;s forces, while the USA and the UK fought 20%. Interestingly the timing of the USA-UK involvement was just about when the USSR was marching in Germany. It was as though they wanted salvage Germany and as such salvage their investments. Key Wall Street, industrialist and royal figures financed and supported the German fascists. Standard Oil and other big-big business as well as capital were in Germany. Mind you fascist ideas like eugenics just prior to the 3rd Reich (3rd Empire) were circulated, for example Madison Grant&#39;s map of &quot;European races&quot; and Darwinism. So supposing that you have been attending the forum and other topics for a while Germany was supposed to be a &quot;model citizen of the world&quot; for NWO. At the same time the 3rd German Empire was a buffer for the royal families, industrialists and financiers towards the USSR. That is to say big time meddlers. It could be that Japan was made to be like so from the USSR&#39;s Eastern boarder. Germany at the time with Hitler were hunting for liberals, socialists and communists. That activity predates the known McCarthyism of the post WW2 period. While on post WW2 period and salvaging &quot;investments&quot; lets also consider operation paperclip. </p>

<p>During the war the Germans rounded up a wide range of people to work as slaves in the factories so that the royals, industrialists and financiers could make profit that way. </p>

<p>It may be questionable as to the reasons and motives for the NWO to be against the USSR when its generally known that the same lot caused the revolution in Russia and culminated the USSR.  Maybe the USSR cleansed itself from that influence, maybe at the final moments of the revolution they got their own people that hijacked the revolution, maybe the founders of the USSR were not lackeys. One documentary that seems to explain that well is called Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Game. I disagree with the homosexual practices that were adopted from Ancient Greece since severe and lethal punishment was dealt to homosexuals at the time and the warriors of the day were very far from being pansies, they were really courageous and honourable men.  </p>

<p>The USA and UK launched their own campaign to get some of the WW2 limelight and in France for <a href="http://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sondage-nation-contribue-defaite-nazis-1.jpg">example</a> it was popularised that the USA and UK were the victors of WW2.</p>

<p>I recommend the documentary called Soviet Storm, it is 18 parts and each part is about 45 minutes. What the USSR went through to fight Germany was incredible. And it was the USSR that won WW2. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. . . . After World War II, the Amer­i­can peo­ple thought that Nazi Ger­many had been defeated and the “war” was over; this book demon­strates that it never was.  Instead, we were told that Com­mu­nism was the new threat and we had to pull out all the stops to pre­vent a Com­mu­nist takeover of the coun­try.  And so our mil­i­tary and our intel­li­gence agen­cies col­lab­o­rated with sur­viv­ing Nazis to go after Com­mu­nists.  We refused to pur­sue world­wide right-wing ter­ror groups and assas­sins.  After all, they were killing Com­mu­nists and left­ists; they were doing us a ser­vice.  Like Hoover and the Mafia, the CIA refused to acknowledge a Nazi Under­ground existed even as they col­lab­o­rated with it (via the Gehlen Orga­ni­za­tion and the like).  Amer­i­can lead­ers in busi­ness, finance, media, intelligence and pol­i­tics col­lab­o­rated with Nazis before, dur­ing, and after the war. </p>

<p>There are Nazi connections to every major Deep State event in the U.S. including the JFK assassination, Oklahoma City &amp; even <a href="http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-456-compendium-on-nazi-and-fascist-connections-to-911/">9/11</a> -- including the date of 9/11 itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(42) It is worth not­ing that The Turner Diaries (1993) fea­tures the cli­mac­tic attack on the Pen­ta­gon as occur­ring on Novem­ber 9th.  That date had great sig­nif­i­cance for the Nazis.  The Ger­man sailors’ rebel­lion that pre­cip­i­tated the advent of the Weimar Repub­lic so hated by the Nazis began on 11/9.  Attempt­ing to roll back the Weimar rev­o­lu­tion, the Nazis launched the ill-fated Beer Hall Putsch on that date, as well. Die Krys­tall­nacht (the Night of Glass pogrom) of 1938 was launched on that date also.  Inter­est­ingly, the Berlin Wall came down on Novem­ber 9.  A Ger­man (or other Euro­pean) would write the date &quot;9 November&quot; as ... &quot;9/11&quot;! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting point to note is that the Nazi party was as anti-Bolshevik as it was anti-semitic. In the latter days of the war the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werwolf">Werwolf</a> force was established on Hitler&#39;s orders to ensure a chain of command would exist following the collapse of the state which could continue the fight. This was rather similar in principle to the British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Units">Auxiliary Units</a>. As the Auxiliary Units are thought to have later been adopted into the NATO stay-behind operations which have been associated with numerous terrorist attacks which were then blamed on radical left-wing groups to discredit Communist movements and maintain the strategy of tension, it doesn&#39;t surprise me in the slightest that many former <a href="http://operation-gladio.net/persons">Nazi soldiers</a> were involved in this organization which had direct ties to the CIA and US deep-state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plato said that all democracy eventually devolves into tyranny. It is interesting to see that play out in the present. Unfortunately it probably means the world is in for yet another Dark Age.</p>

<p>If I could have but one wish, it would be that I was born during the Second Enlightenment (which is bound to happen assuming we don&#39;t completely wipe ourselves out first or the robots don&#39;t take over).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, according to Corey Goode, the Nazis did not suffer such a complete defeat as is written in the history books. A small, but powerful group of them escaped to South America and Antarctica where they set up bases and further developed highly advanced technologies, including space travel.</p>

<p>You could say the final battle of WW2 was actually &quot;Operation Highjump&quot; in 1947 during which a US aircraft carrier fleet went to Antarctica to possibly attack their bases there. They were soundly beaten though by advanced German flying discs and had to leave shortly after arriving.</p>

<p>The UFO flap of 1950s over the US was actually mainly the Germans flying their advanced vehicles over US airspace and intended to intimidate the US. This culminated in 1952 in a UFO flyover over the capitol building in Washington DC.</p>

<p>After that the US administration caved in to the Nazi continuum demands and allowed them to secretly join the US military-industrial-complex (part of this was &quot;Operation Paperclip&quot;). The US administration hoped they could infiltrate and neutralize the Nazi continuum but what happened was actually the over way around.</p>

<p>The US MIC (until a few years ago) was completely taken over by Nazis and Nazi ideology. This is pretty evident IMHO in the makings of the Bush administration. Thankfully it appears the tide has turned and many people in the US military at least have figured what is actually going on and now are actively working to take them down.</p>
