       Couple nights ago I was watching the Late Night show with Seth Meyers, and he had Samuel L Jackson on as a guest. Jackson told a rather interesting story about being invited to play golf with Trump, who was hanging out with none other than Bill Clinton! The 3 of them played a round of golf.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2xnbaI3Ds">
        (Interview Here)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are Bill Clinton and Donald Trump hanging out? Because they've been friends for a long time. Bill and Hillary went to Trumps most recent wedding about 10 years ago.
       <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/16/hillary-clinton-had-a-front-row-seat-at-donald-trumps-most-recent-wedding/">
        (Source)
       </a>
       They're buddies!
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the Clintons and Trumps are friends, what does this mean for the current political situation? It means that Trump's job is to make the Republican party look like such a batshit-insane choice that they'll be forced to vote for Hillary. Seeing as how Bernie is unlikely to win the Democratic primary because he doesn't have corporate backing and funding, Hillary seems almost inevitable. She's almost certainly made Trump promises about what she can do for him once elected. Billionaires are rarely motivated by anything other than money and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       When/if Hillary wins, we'll see the same policies as we did under her husband. Things like NAFTA that allow corporations to outsource jobs, bring in more H1B visas, and lower the cost of wages through global wage arbitration. Starting of international wars under false pretenses, as a handout to the military-industrial complex and banking monopolies. This is the end of the American middle class, for the profit of company-owning billionaires. We are being played. Played like fools. Unless a bunch of people wake up to the truth real quick the 2016 election is already over. Billionaires win.

       I don't know if I'm alone in this, but I think the next election is going to be an election of the ages and its going to determine a lot of things for our future. I'm incredibly scared, honestly. Where do we go if somebody like Trump or Carson or Hillary wins this election? I'm 21, I want to have a family and grow up and provide for my family but the state we're currently in isn't really a good one and we seem to be on a straight decline. I might just be overdramatic, please prove me wrong if you can haha.

       No, I'm worried too. Our government is seriously owned by corporations and billionaires, and the way they control the elections like this... it doesn't give us very much of a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think the most important thing you can do (even more important than voting or whatever) is to inform people about these types of issues so they stop falling for the tricks of the billionaires. Only when we have a culture resistant against being tricked, can we stop falling for tricks. And they sure as shit aren't going to teach this stuff in school or in the media, so it's up to us to wake everyone up. We stay quiet, humanity keeps falling for these tricks. We speak up, maybe we can have a shot at waking up enough people that they can't drag the masses along for their bullshit any longer. Wouldn't that be the day? Work towards that. I see no better way to spend my time as a human than this.

       The problem is that many other people think they ARE informed and that every ELSE is misguided or fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take something like climate change, for example. Okay, sure, I can still be open to the idea that nothing humans do can lower temperatures, end droughts and cause the sea levels to go back down. But there's a difference between a stance like that and the propaganda funded by Koch industries that suggests that we should change nothing and that we should just keep consuming fossil fuels.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be enough to just say we want clean air and water and that we don't all want to end up like Beijing, but everything has to revolve around climate change now. It's almost like you HAVE to believe in climate change in order to want renewable energy. I just simply don't want to keep giving money to giant corporations who've hijacked our democracy and I want to be able to eat the fish that I catch locally.

       I saw the new StarWars film over Xmas. The trailer for the new Independence day came on; Holy Sweet fuck George Orwell himself would never have imagined more effective propaganda in 2 minutes. "Protect the homeland from the evil invaders who want to take our freedom away".

       Dude! I live in the oldest city in North America. We settled here over 500 years ago because of the massive fish stocks. It's the reason we're here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I go catch a cod right now to feed my children? Nope! I'll be arrested and charged and jailed and shamed. Our Government allowed  big corporations to literally vacuum up our fish, with almost no benefit to us, the stewards of the fishery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now we're about to sell our largest locally owned seafood company to a giant Corporation. A Danish company will soon control the bulk of the Newfoundland fishery.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a danish Corporation is allowed to catch cod off Newfoundland to sell to anybody they want, but a Newfoundlander who was born here isn't allowed to catch ONE cod to EAT. Nothing against the Danes, btw, it could have been anyone.
      </p>

       Cheers.

       there is much more to the elections than ideologies, I'm afraid. Here in mexico, around the election's time, one party (PRI) would give out food stamps with $50 bucks (700 pesos more or so) in exchange for the person's vote. I know entire families who did this. I really hope your case is not THAT rigged up

       AKA it's worse.  The implication of the other guy's comment is that the peoples' votes actually matter, and thus it's worth it to bribe them to vote a certain way.  None of that is even necessary in the US, our candidates are chosen for us and the votes don't matter.

       But look at the enormous wealth he and his family had. Had he lived, would have inherited a fortune from his father estimated at $1 billion. Joseph P. Kennedy, a razor-sharp investor who pulled out of stocks just before the 1929 crash, was one of America’s richest men; JFK’s wife, Jacqueline, a habitué of Park Avenue and the Hamptons, was an oil heiress.

       voting may not be 100% effective but it has some effect, and to just completely throw your hands into the air and ditch anything that has some effect is very, very foolish.

       Voting in local elections is much more important than national ones for much of the Country. Here in California our votes don't really count in the presidential election because not only is California safely guaranteed to go democrat but the gap between the voters who vote democrat over republican has been widening in every election since the early 90's.

       that time voting (not to mention campaigning in any way) is one more hour in which i could be having conversations that change people's minds for the better. that does more than pulling a lever in the political casino. it's rigged, and the house always wins in the end.

       also, majority vote forces the minority to comply. that is fascism and it is wrong.

       We can change with our choices.   We support these fucks every day with our lazy ass choices.  Other cultures hate us because of our leaders choices.  And they do everything in our names and we allow it!!  What are we to expect but exactly what you feel the future is to be.  You are right and it is scary shit.  Just be prepared for a very controlled future of mass pollution and debt slavery.  I am an optimistic person, but these things are not hard to see if people were to put distractions aside and open their eyes.  Once we start holding those in power accountable for their actions, change can come.  Until then, this ship is sinking slowly but surely.

       People need to get perspective. At no point in the history of the world have so many people been so well off. For the most part you can say or do anything you want in this country. You can get on a plane and travel to a beach paradise. If you want a job you can get one. Sure you might be flipping burgers but its a real job. We have medicine, food, shelter, and leisure time that someone from even 100 years ago could not even imagine. Sure our government is corrupt and the super rich run everything but our lives could be much much worse.

       I agree with a lot of what you are saying. I want to note that I am 25, and 4 years ago was convinced that the 2012 election would be "an election of the ages and its going to determine a lot of things for our future". Now that you are more of an adult with long term plans, such as you mentioned, the elections carry more weight. Just my two cents: every 4 years this fervor and intensity may/will come up.

       It doesn't matter too much who wins because the establishment will still be in control. It doesn't matter what a candidate says, he still must succumb to the will of the establishment. The world isn't going to end and the sky is not falling. If Hillary wins, it will be identical to Obama's reign. I'm not even sure why you bring up Carson.. he had his flash in the pan and has crumbling ever since. If Cruz win it will just make our Government even more dysfunctional because of the unwillingness to compromise. If Trump wins it will be more functional than if Cruz had, but not by much. I would expect a Trump presidency to be similar to Reagan's in that he is very charismatic and will put on the image that he isn't controlled yet will push the core conservative republican agenda.

       edit - DOOOOOOM!! or maybe just more of the same doom narrative to make the peasants afraid and concerned into supporting the push of the same agenda that's been being bottle fed to us for a long time now.

       They're outside candidates, look at how the DNC is holding back Sanders. Jimmy Carter is a good example of an outsider, and I'm sure on here you can find some people that will have evidence that the gov and corporations ruined his run and took those hostages in Iran to get him out.

       Jimmy Carter was not an outsider, LOL.  He was hand-picked by David Rockefeller and Zbig Breznezski's Trilateral Commission to be the Democratic nominee.  He's since demonstrated the growth of a fairly impressive social conscience (getting October Surprised probably has a way of disillusioning a man with his benefactors) but he was definitely a made company man while he was in office.

       The reason we have the current "War on Terruh" is because Bush and his buddies were
       <em>
        selected
       </em>
       in 2000.  I don't know what we would have today if there had been a President Gore, but it is fun to imagine.  Maybe the "War on CO2".

       It kind of does matter, actually.. The party that wins gets to appoint supreme court judges as well as hold the power of veto. I agree that the figure head is still controlled by the establishment but we don't want supreme court judges who, for instance, don't believe in evolution or don't believe believe in the separation of church from state.

       Of course he would
       <em>
        prefer

       to win, but he's not going to because he doesn't have a big enough fan base. So his plan B is to help Hillary win, so she will give him benefits. Maybe he will try again next election and have a better chance.

       I live in California and have many, many liberal friends. I would say about half are Bernie supporters and the other half have a blind love of Hillary. literally all of the Bernie supporters I ask say they will vote for Hillary in a heart beat over any republican candidate. You underestimate the liberals hate towards republican ideology and how many people actually support the Clintons. Sometimes when we are surrounded by peers that share our views, we begin to think that that's how everyone thinks. I try to have friends on both sides off the isle but still need to constantly remind myself to try to look at opinions from all possible angles.

       I don't know. I certainly wouldn't rule out Trump, but every liberal female I know will vote for Hillary no matter what. It's not even a question. A lot of conservative women would too, just because she's female. That's a lot of guaranteed votes.

       This was the theory from the beginning. Interestingly enough, Perot was more of a wedge, because he only needed to steal enough votes to tip the scales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is not a third party candidate, at least not yet. Hillary needs not just a voting block edge, but an entire political smoke screen to pull it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is exactly why the media covers Trump and not Hillary.

       I've been saying for a long time that there was only one reason and one reason Trump ran... and that was to stop Rand from becoming the nominee and beating Clitton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember up until Trump entered the race Rand was the frontrunner along with Bush, even in the TPTB's handpicked polls.  That is why he is not running third party yet. If Rand wins Iowa and New Hampshire and gains a bunch of momentum, Trump will drop out of the republican race and run independent to destroy Rand.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are so scared of him it'd be pathetic and even a little bit funny. But it's working and nothing looks like it can stop Trump. I pray every day that someone does...

       Dude, Rand doesn't stand a chance even without Trump in the race. There's like 6 candidates with degrees of crazy only slightly less than Trump before you get to Rand Paul. Marco Rubio wants college kids to become indentured servants to the wealthy and he's in 2nd place.

       Wow!  I had never even thought of that....what a revelation!  I had always felt that Palin was the reason McCain lost, that is pretty evident.  However, it never occurred to me how conveniently she, and her ilk, took over the one political party in the past century that was strong enough to shake up the status quo.
       <br/>
       Seriously, before her, Ron Paul and the Tea Party were a bit of a force to be reckoned with, and were scaring the big two.  The Tea Party was once bold, intelligent, and downright getting powerful. Now, most people see it as nothing more than a gathering of rednecks, far right Christian's, etc., a bit of a joke really to some.  Ron Paul's version was certainly not at all like that.  But I digress.  Thanks for pointing that out, very insightful of you.

       Yeah, the Koch bro's do have their hands in a lot of jars.  It is the equivalent of George "I own the DNC" Soros in the way he has taken them over.  Two sides of the same coin, and we're pretty fucked either way.  To think, if Rand Paul had the backing of the "old" Tea Party, he'd have been almost impossible to beat.  Now, with him seeing that his father's party has been taken over by idiots (for the most part), it is forcing him to run in the Republican party, and that does not fit him in the least.  It has, in my opinion, hurt him considerably in his bid.

       Are people really still flocking to him, or is the media just giving the impression he is popular? I honestly don't know which is driving which, at this point. It's pretty weird. People watch Fox News and get very misled, I guess.

       It's all so obviously theater that I can't even fathom how people are still so invested in it all.  I guess it's comforting to think, "If we elect this guy we can just sit back and relax and he'll fix everything."  Sorry but that's not how the world works.

       I think people are a combination of tired from work and society, in a mental fog from drugs and prescriptions, and apathetic toward a system that's obviously more powerful than they are. Not to mention wading through American media is like swimming in propaganda and advertisements. American culture is mostly Corporate culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only tool left to the American is denial, and it has "worked" for about 40 years now, so we're just going to keep doing it. Ignore it and it'll go away, that's the American mentality on serious matters that don't jive with their existing ideology (which is often programmed in to them by their allegiance to an authority).
      </p>
      <p>
       So to avoid social awkwardness (and the potential negative implications for their professional lives as well), people put on the blinders. That's America, hundreds of millions of people pretending very hard not to see what is right in front of them, aided by the media and a fear of losing what little they have.

       I was posting this around,  and someone asked "Why would Trump do this? If elected, clinton will still have to get any legislation past congress, which is difficult." which is a legitimate question that I'd  like to address.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more ways beyond passing standard congressional legislation by which Hillary can say "Thank you" to Trump for helping her get elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, she can pass an executive order that helps Trump or his companies. Or it can be in the form of appointments of people to important positions, so Trump is more likely to get what he wants and the government moves in a Trump-like direction (aka in the direction of authoritarian billionaires). Could also take the form of granting government contracts to Trump's companies. They can create stringent and oddly specific requirements for buildings that only Trump's companies are prepared to meet in the short timeline demanded, so they always get the contracts. There's tons of ways to do it rather than just passing standard congressional legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, even though Trump has spent a lot of money, he has the potential to make himself rich through this. The media exposure has increased his celebrity to a point where he can ask for huge fees to speak and advise companies and so on. This makes him wealthy, in addition to any hand-outs given by Hillary after she's elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all this, it's possible (even likely) that Trump isn't even paying that much for this election. Other people and organizations are fronting him. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Zionist connection funding Trump, since such connections are already known for the Clintons. It sure is enough to make me stop and think.

       Thinking about all the different ways Trump can be compensated for his troubles without any kind of legislation being passed.  Now that I'm thinking about it, he probably would prefer NOT to have legislation passed. Why go through all the publicity and bullshit required to do so when you can fly under the radar with back room deals?

       True. GOP voters have always been the biggest pawns in the game though. They get tricked by Fox News in to voting against their own interests and don't even realize it. The temporarily embarrassed millionaire, low-compassion "fuck you ive got mine" types. So easily manipulated through fear of their wallet or security being impacted. Low-compassion voters are the reason our country is so comfortable supporting so many aggressive wars.

       Trump is a showman.  He loves attention, and they've been friends for some time.  I think his main purpose was to knock Bush off the ticket though, which worked perfectly.  Bush may as well be crying in a corner somewhere.

       In Dan Carlin's latest podcast, he mentions all the GOP establishment's contempt for Trump and how they potentially could use the super delegates (which make up 20% of the votes) to sway the nomination for Rubio. If he then decides to run as an Independent, he'll spoil the vote.

       If trump only has 10% support, they can't fake him winning the election. It has to match exit polls relatively closely, which match public polling before that. Those can all be faked too, but it's hard to fake the numbers too far, it's easy to fudge them a little though.

        Trump has given between $100,0001 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to the nonprofit's records. On four separate occasions, Trump has donated to Hillary Clinton, in 2002, 2005, 2006 and in 2007.

       Can confirm. Believe me or not, that I don't care, but my close buddy caddied at one of Trump's courses recently. When he asked who the most famous member was, his boss responded with, "Oh easily the Clintons".  Blew my mind.

       I think there are simple-ish ways to avoid this. Vote, get your friends to vote, family, everyone who actually cares about their future and the potential future of the planet to vote. Make them wake up, show them the truth, do everything in your power you can this is the election that will decide whether or not ww3 will happen, we as the people MUST SPEAK OUR MINDS NOW OR NEVER. Either that or we just might have to go to war with ourselves.
Edit: Once I posted this I realized its not that simple

       He can be in it to win it, but have Hillary winning as an exit strategy in case things don't work out. Agreed, on that last sentence, although there is a bit of wiggle room still in which a president can act.

       He scares the Republican party, but the puppeteers are the deep state. He's exactly what they want. He will let them do anything, which means take over control of the country. Which is why he will probably win. The military-industrial complex selects the President, period. Even if people don't think Trump is fascist, his administration would be.

       i recall reading that Trump had a phone conversation with Clinton. the Donald mentioned that he was considering running for POTUS, Clinton's response was to go for it; &amp; he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aug 2015
       <br/>
       "Former president Bill Clinton had a private telephone conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor and reality-television star was nearing a decision to run for the White House, according to associates of both men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that Clinton encouraged Trump’s efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and offered his own views of the political landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton’s personal office in New York confirmed that the call occurred in late May, but an aide to Clinton said the 2016 race was never specifically discussed and that it was only a casual chat."

       He's actually going to try to get elected and do a u-turn on the people that voted for him. He's on record saying if he ever ran for office, he'd run as a republican because they are the easiest to fool. Down vote if you must, but I'm sticking to my theory.

       It's possible. It's possible she'll quit, it's possible Sanders will win the Democratic primary. It's possible Trump will win. I have no idea what will happen, but certain scenarios do seem more likely than others at the present time given what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time she bowed out because Obama was a good candidate. This time, Sanders is the next-up, and the establishment power doesn't really like him as much. So Hillary it is, I think the DNC considers this her election, unlike the last one. Just my 2 cents

       Hmmm....you really think that Hillary won't make the primary (and win it) over everyone else?  Look around, it's fairly obvious she will.  Sanders came in like a storm, and all the Dem's I know, and all the stuff I have been reading seems to be supporting him.  However, Clinton is leading in the polls.  How is this?  Seriously, with all the crap she has had going against her, and despite the fact that Sanders seems to be way more popular (especially with the younger voters), it seems unlikely she would even be in the running still.   Yet she is.  And as much as I hope I am wrong, and makes me sick to think about, I believe she will win.  I think it is already almost a done deal and has been in the works since she lost to Obama the first time.  She has money, she more than likely has
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       dirt on so many people, and she is ruthless to boot.  Very scary all around.  Oh, and I forgot to add to this the fact that she has how many people running against her?  Lowest candidate pool for any party in a presidential election I have ever seen.  Also, I have been saying for a long while that Trumps campaign feels all to familiar in the fact that he is a LOT like Ross Perot in many ways.  Hell, Romney all but had the last election locked leading in to election day.  He seemed like he should have been the clear cut winner based on a lot of polls.  It should have at least been a lot closer race by all means.  But no, Obama won very easily.  If the game isn't rigged, I do not know what it is.  Rant over, I feel like I want to throw up.

       It fucking sucks that out of 300,000,000+ people we only have these fucking clowns as choices*. sHillary winning is far from a forgone conclusion. She isn't even remotely a viable candidate. That is why the democrats are trying to get Biden to run. Sanders could lose against Trump, even though it would be easier to vote for Sanders over trump. sHillary would be destroyed by Trump. He's got the dirt...That's if it's even a real contest.

       I agree with this completely.  I believe that Clinton somehow, probably through Obama, got Biden out of the race as he would probably be her only
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       competition in the sense of the word.
       <br/>
       In all seriousness, look at what went down.  Biden was pretty much 100% guaranteed to be running this cycle as far back as halfway thru Obama's term (this one).  It seemed to be almost a given fact that it would happen.  Then, months before the campaigning really kicked of, his son died.  I am not saying either way if I think it was connected, but considering how many people have died from crossing the Clinton's who knows? But, I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even after that, he still seemed to be intending to run, albeit a little less sure of it.  Even his wife indicated she would support it, and made it seem Joe was leaning that way.  The fact that he waited so long into the campaign to bow out says a lot as well; because what was really holding him back from saying he is not running way earlier?  I think, IMHO, that a little bug was put into his ear by someone higher up the "food chain" in the DNC telling him that he "shouldn't bother" as in "just don't if you know what's good for you and your career (life maybe?)".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is for two reasons.  Number One is that despite the fact he is a moron he is actually, bewilderingly so I might add, popular enough as Obama's VP and with people he meets (Dem's obviously) that he would very much be a legit contender to Hilary.  Due to of all her legal issues, lying, and everything else, she would have almost surely taken a hit in votes from Biden and his fairly clean cut persona/no drama image and such compared to her.  He quite conceivably could have "stolen" the nomination from her as well.  Winning however, is another issue.  He would have been able to keep the Dem's votes, but anybody on the line would probably chose whoever ran against him.  In other words, the race would have been a LOT tighter, and may have been lost if he had gotten that far.  To close for their comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       In no way, shape or form would Hilary have any real competition.  She is still bitter about the loss to Obama as well.  I think she honestly believes that she is destined to be the first woman president and that thinks she is entitled to win the nomination and election as well.  Their whole clan seems to be that narcissistic and self-entitled.  I would bet that she was like J. Edgar Hoover during all those years in the senate and as Obama's S.O.S. (Bill too, and probably for a lot longer).  She snooped and gathered dirt on every fucking person she needed too to make sure the campaign falls in her lap and perhaps  to even win it all (subversively and illegally at that).  It's not at all inconceivable or to hard to see if you think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just you saying "She isn't even remotely a viable candidate" says all you should know too.  She is still running and leading polls among her competition (somehow) despite being known as a liar, fraud, thief etc. etc. and having all these legal issues/political issues.  I mean really, how is that possible that she is able to do so, despite overwhelming evidence that says she should be a has been politically and/or in jail?  I can almost guarantee that this is by design somehow.  Who is heading it up?  I would bet that George "The DNC is my bitch and it's followers my slaves" Soros has a hand in it, and all the higher ups in the party (because George says so).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump beating Clinton?  It may be close, but as I stated elsewhere, I do think Trump is in cahoots somehow with Clinton.  Like Perot most likely was when Bill ran.  Even with all the things you cited, she is still viable.  Again, the fact that she has managed to stay in the race, as well as the fact that she is leading most polls against her competitors is a testimony to it.  It screams set-up because anyone else would have been arrested and/or given up because of the damage those things would have done to most people.

       This is a ridiculous conspiracy theory with very little sustenance. Trump has been bashing the Clintons for the past 3 weeks relentlessly, made a laughing stock of Jeb Bush, world class murderer, and the media has been disparaging Trump every since his announcement speech. What more do you need to be convinced he's not a plant. Or are you going to go by your gut instinct which we know is totally infallible.

       Perhaps. I read Hillarys cards last night and her outcome was the dreaded 10 of swords, which is the deepest card for utter defeat, she will be put under hard, and for her means she will be devastated. I mean she will want to die for she will not be accepted and for her, this will be a major revelation. As her handlers will shun her.
 I cannot accept that we will be as a nation put down to her level.(radioactive, chemtrail nation) So perhaps it has a dual meaning, I hope she is defeated and we can rise up as a  forgiving nation in peace. We have to think about how much the real ppl have expressed that we do not want this war, we want to be in peace as a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to pay taxes to support all this bullshit and the cards tell me she isn't going to win. No more war mongers, thanks.

       But to do this that would require knowing that the GOP would openly support someone who is batshit insane. Carson is also batshit insane and he is plummeting fast. By all accounts Trump should have been done after making his "rapist and murderers" statement re: Mexicans. I'm not saying there isn't someone so tapped into the middle of the country that they could weigh the good vs the bad of Trump and see this coming, but if this were the plan a better course would be to get a Glenn Beck or Sarah Palin or similar ilk to run. Trump is so unlikely a candidate to do this well that if the shadow govt has that depth of understanding of the country I'm kinda okay with them being in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely than not Trump and Clinton know each other well because they run in a small circle of super wealthy and powerful people. They may like each other personally but loath each other proffessionally.

       Interesting point to consider. However does the GOP actually support Trump, or is it just the media? The GOP can't just get rid of candidates they don't like, right? So it doesn't really matter how outrageous they think what Trump said was, because he has media support (probably purchased) and tons of money to continue presenting a social image of being well-supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the GOP is 100% on board with the Trump candidacy because it's making their party look ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, to me, is just more evidence that Trump is in cahoots with the Clintons. Trump is going over the GOP's head, to benefit Hillary and the democrats.

       I can see how I was confusing. I meant that GOP voters would openly support someone who is batshit insane. I don't think GOP establishment is involved at all. And I'm also not saying it's impossible that a strategist looked at conservative voters and said "I think they are done with the implied racism and poverty shaming. They want someone who is going to be openly pro-white and un PC."
I think it easier to see how well trump is doing and work back to the Clinton rather than looking at someone having to plan Trump's rise. Rudy Giuliani was mayor during 9/11 and cleaned up NYC and he fizzled in the polls because of multiple mairrages and lost the South. Trump on paper is a terrible spoiler. The fact that his campaign survived the first few weeks let alone the first debate is astonishing. However, the flip side is that Howard Stern once ran for mayor of NYC (IIRC) and he had to bow out of the race because he got too much support and really didn't want to be mayor. I'm wondering if Trump didn't start his campaign to get notoriety and with his gaining support is staying in the race to be a spoiler. I don't believe he really wants to lead the country because it's hard work and  he'd be impeached within a few months, but I can't speculate on his motives any more than that.

       Probably, but it helps lock it down. I think Trump is getting more traction than they expected though. That'll die down though, come actual election time.

       But it was never a certainty that Jeb wouldn't be a major player.  Not at first anyway.  He certainly had enough money on his side.  Trump made him look stupid a number of times, then it was crickets from the right for Jeb.  If there's one thing the right likes, it's a swaggering loudmouth, not a meek intellectual who can't stand up to someone like Trump effectively.

       Yes, Bernie is probably the best candidate. But, let's be real here, most voting machines in the US have no paper trail and are owned by one company that has no oversight, Diebold. It would be easy for the election to be rigged, logistically speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to say that voting isn't worth it, it's good to send a clear signal about what you want. But only voting isn't going to cut it. We have to influence the world more often than once every year or two, especially when that action can be so easily made to not count. That's why I think spreading truths to others about how we're being manipulated, so we can wake up to the reality of things and start making effectual changes that actually matter. To me, this is a million times more important than voting, and you have the option to do it many times a day instead of just once every few years. We "vote" with our voice by influencing our culture with our words. This "vote" is our real vote in this world, our real way to effect change, imo.

       I've been saying for a long time that there was only one reason and one reason Trump ran... and that was to stop Rand from becoming the nominee and beating Clitton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember up until Trump entered the race Rand was the frontrunner along with Bush, even in the TPTB's handpicked polls.  That is why he is not running third party yet. If Rand wins Iowa and New Hampshire and gains a bunch of momentum, Trump will drop out of the republican race and run independent to destroy Rand.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are so scared of him it'd be pathetic and even a little bit funny. But it's working and nothing looks like it can stop Trump. I pray every day that someone does...
