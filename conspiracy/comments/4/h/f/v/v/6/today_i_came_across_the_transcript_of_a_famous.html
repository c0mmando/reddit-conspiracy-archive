       One of those things I believe and disbelieve simultaneously without being too upset about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was someone a few years ago here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , claimed to be the boyfriend of an elite/insider family member. Next day, deleted everything. Hard to tell if it's real, or if he was just influenced by these "Insider posts," but some of his predictions were correct (like "Nothing's going to happen to North Korea, it's where the elite hang out.").
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like this, for me, is like a belief in God. I can believe it is true and be a skeptic simultaneously, doesn't hurt me or anyone else either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one thing about it, though - there's this one, I think another one, and then the one that was placed here and deleted - and all sort of leave you with the same feeling. Or me, anyway. As if you're being lulled to sleep, everything's going to be alright...and I'm not sure that's a good thing
       <em>
        at all.

       At the time, the US and North Korea were sabre-rattling and there was a lot of talk about going to war. He said "That'll never happen, North Korea's the elite's playground" or something to that effect.

       Might be legit, might not be. Regardless, much of the info rings true, whether from a family or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone please also consider this: all the people involved in the cults, programs and projects of the bloodline families, Illuminati, or whatever name you want to stick on it, have also been lied too.  They are all being lied to just as we are.  They are told the "truth", when really its just a version of the truth.  Its part of the compartmentalization and serves many purposes. One of which is leaks and insiders going public.  Ever notice how so many whistle blowers have real, solid info that also contradicts other insider info?  That's why, they all are telling they're version of the truth while completely convinced they are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently, as the control structure falls apart, more of these insiders are realizing they've not been told the whole story.  Some of them started to talk and ask questions of a certain " keeper of secrets".  He decided to write them a blog.  It was not meant for the public, but the public found it and started to follow it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good stuff, but if you choose to read it, I strongly suggest you start at the very beginning, don't skip ahead, and don't skip the comments section on each entry. Its a sequential learning format, like how you gotta learn algebra before calculus will make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final warning, this is some serious red pill shit. Or, its just a creative writing exercise :)

       I dont think red pill accurately describes that.  If what is said there is true, then red pill/blue pill analogy is a choice between two false realities still.  Im having a hard time wrapping my head around it TBH.

       Nah, keep it simple.  By the time you get to the end of the blog, you'd have some serious truths to consider.  Nothing more, nothing less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I got some really high level shit figured out from that blog.  Some of the deepest concepts I've ever considered were addressed and I've grow quite a bit because of it.

       I agree that there is a lot to consider.  I have grown so skeptical about
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       that even when I read something that "rings true" to my soul, I have a hard time believing it.

       I

       A well written piece of dis info. Similar to Corey/GoodET, The Hidden Hand, Ra material and many others. They all seem to pull info from "The Law of One" and put their own spin on it. Look up the 3 authors that 'channeled' The Law of One. Whenever someone is trying to 'deliver' the truth or blow a whistle I become skeptical. I often believe that the "New Age" phenomenon has been co-opted by TPTB. It is covering the same topics as other religious cannon but without the personified, humanistic "Gods".
      </p>
      <p>
       Be a good sheep and be nice to the people who shit on you everyday. Your reward will come when you die aka 'graduate' to the next soul level.. I thought when I die I was getting virgins? Or maybe it was the promise of Heaven? Sounds familiar, eh? Always telling you to ignore this world for the next, I don't buy that. They tell you that you were born with sin or you have karma that you have to work off. There is always a problem or issue with YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't trust the gate keepers(priests). Trust yourself.

       lol DIVINE LAW? Do you mean unity and duality? The power of Yin? I'm lost here, because it seems like they either have no clue what they are talking about, or are just leading sheep, again. EDIT: Further reading he states we have more power than we realize, finally a correct statement. Second Edit: A religion created by them? so they are a part of one massive external merkaba? Third Edit: Realm's? Do you mean dimensions? FOURTH EDIT: Q: 
The "higher beings who govern this realm", do you serve them? By what names do you call them? Have you ever seen them? Where do they reside? 
A: 
They penetrate everything and they are benevolent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that because they are at a different dimensional frequencies?
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I read this, it seems that they have ascended, which is wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bloodline of control seems to stem from when we were listening to those other dimensional beings, and then a bunch of random beings from mars came and made a fake merkaba and it failed crashing into the ocean and stuff, doesn't seem like they are a part of our future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another Edit: Q: 
What is the reason that your people came to this planet? 
A: 
Almost the same reason you came.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALMOST? almost the same reason huh...
      </p>
      <p>
       ANOTHER EDIT: Jesus mastered the game huh? Jesus was here to show us how to ascend, still confused on the be ripped apart and put back together thing, but this kinda proved that this may be an ascended individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another Edit: Ya, the third dimension is like a spiritual prison. This person is legit I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy SHIT HE TALKS ABOUT BLACK NOBILITY? Those are... nvm. :D

       ive been saying some of the same things as this guy for a while.  even some of my past posts i have stated that this earth is a prison.  we're all here because we did -something- and some day we will return to what a true human is supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       if my understanding is correct, and the person writing this were the real deal, he is essentially our "jailer", or at least one of them.  also confined here, but in a different sense.  taking no joy in his job.
      </p>
      <p>
       ive understood this for a while now, but even i was educated by a lot of this.  i truly enjoyed reading it.

       Maybe prison is the wrong term?  Instead of a prison, could this be a rehab planet? It sounds like there is the potential to rehabilitate and then be allowed to leave.  We just have to learn how?  So many questions.

       This realm is more of a loop, or rut, that we're stuck in. That's what the term prison is trying to convey.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are stuck here, in these physical forms, but trapped under our own power.
This will be, until we "escape" or ascend to a higher realm as individuals. Finishing what is required here, and using our own decision and strength to leave. Although the leaving is more of a point you achieve and it occurs, rather than a choice we make once the person knows enough.

       Wow what A mindgame.  Sounds like the devil trying to convince us that God is the true devil to confuse us.  All that stuff about never escaping if you believe to the contrary seems like a scare tactic to manipulate your brain.  If these "bloodlines" families,really believe they are following the One true God by allowing and provoking nurder, rape, thievery and other such terrible acts they are even more overconfident and ignorant than I thought.  They have been at the top being fed bullshit by their peers for far too long.  I am a slave.  But I'm not following the devil.  For him/her to insinuate that is just a mindfuck.

       I'm fairly certain they're referencing enacting your vision of a life you want. Multiple references to 'plans'. What really stuck out was the Nikolai Tesla bit. Nikolai Tesla was close to achieving his plans/goals/desires, molding the planet to his will. I believe everyone is capable of some of this but none of us ever try, let alone succeed.
