       Ok, I might just be stupid, but I don't understand this. In r/politics, it's Sanders. Sanders everywhere. Articles about Sanders from all kinds of shitty sources. But, I have not seen many pro-sanders comments in those threads. It's all bitching and calling out Sanders supporters.  And then, in subs like r/enoughsandersspam, users (like u/haripotter) are circlejerking the hate, but are posting the very same links that people are angry about.
       <br/>
       What I'm getting at is why are so many Bernie articles being posted and upvoted while everyone in the comments bitches about them, and whats up with the trolls that are hating them but posting them as well? Are these just good old karma whores or are these shills in disguse? And obviously the mods are supporting it; are they shills trying to use the spam to get rid of the Sanders supporters?
       <br/>
       Sorry I'd post more links to usernames but  I'm at work and can't really witch-hunt at the moment.

       Disinformation is more powerful than information. I believe they are just trying to use the old "cluster fuck until people are sick and close their mind to it". A long term strategy to get people sick of Sanders and slowly hint at their agenda agent, Hillary. It keeps people from doing research and investigating. The same method climate change doubters use. Just annoy the shit out of people with disinformation so information looks just as annoying, and then it gets put on the shelf.

       The majority of people on r/politics are Sanders supporters, hence the imbalance in posts. In terms of comments, I think the supporters are tired of making the same comments over and over (I know I am), and are creating a vacuum for shills, Clinton supporters, and antijerkers. From there you see downvotes demoralizing Sanders supporters as well as Agnew-esque rhetoric: "they're unemployed, don't vote, are young, naive, etc." suffocating the majority.

       That's not enough to explain the amount of upvotes some pro-Clinton/anti-Sanders posts get. I sort by top and the amount of times straight Clinton talking points dominate the comments disturbs me. Doesn't confuse me though, I mean a pro hillary super pac

       it does hire shills to post on reddit. Even before that it was super duper painfully obvious(I made a couple posts on this subreddit like this one before the article was posted).

       Ya the comments in r/politics are fully fucking owned by hillary shills. They are also very active in this subreddit(and many others including super duper active in

       Much of the sanders spam has been natural, he appeals to a sizeable part of the reddit demographic just like Trump does. But it has been encouraged, until very recently, so that the planned Clinton pushback will look like an organic response. ItS happening in the comment section already, though it hasn't garnered enough momentum (shills, AI development) to affect the balance of posted content. It will soon...

       I agree there was some astroturffing for Sanders, it did create a lot of additional traffic and talk about reddit itself,  and that it is now gone and there are still lots of Sanders supporters in r politics, but are seriously challenged by the Hillary tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump supporters in actual comments have also vanished, that was also partly astroturffing.

       I came to this subreddit to find conversation about what's going on on reddit - because this election cycle we've seen a massive influx of fake posters and chat/forum-bots - that whole subreddit for trump is almost totally comprised of bots posting catchphrases like "high energy", "wew lad", "cuck cuck cuck", "can't stump the trump".
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks to me like they hired "people who know the internet", eg 4chan users/programmers who think that's the cool way to handle online interactions, to write the scripts the bots are using. The mods ban anyone who isn't parroting that - go there and try to ask them about trump being a clinton family friend and campaign donor who's now being set up to "
       <em>
        run against
       </em>
       " a Clinton, and you'll be banned immediately.
      </p>

       the subreddits surrounding politics as well as
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       are FULL of chat bots posting from a word and phrase list or being run by techs sitting in an office somewhere.
