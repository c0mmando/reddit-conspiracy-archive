       I don't know if that is has been asked or discussed on this sub or not. I understand that this may be the wrong time to ask this, but just curious what this subs opinion of Trump is as a whole and if he can be trusted? Or more trusted then previous presidential candidates?

       Have you ever known someone to say they are going to do something just to get attention? I think the campaign started just like that. Then he got "backed into a corner" by his success. And wasn't able to back out like he intended. He did something simular in the 2000 election.

       Trump’s VP will be someone more radical than he is so that they can’t kill him.

       Though I’d prefer her for Secretary of the Interior, if he picked Ann Coulter and they killed Trump, she would respond by revoking female franchise, demolishing the UN building, burning the Federal Reserve to the ground, and blockading Israel into starvation.

       I believe he entered the election to help get Hillary elected. Gives everyone a common enemy to rally on, with the plus that he isn't the elites choice for president (hillary is). everyone is so busy worried about what trump might do in the future, most of america still doesn't realize what all Hillary already has done in the past decades. it's no wonder trump dominates headlines at all the news stations, all eyes need to stay on trump for hillary's sake.

       Nobody knows man and there are so many conflicting theories you decide which you want to believe

       personally i am little skeptic because i don't believe anyone especially not a billionaire claiming he will ... i don't even know what he's claiming because i don't follow this shitshow, but fight against the elite? bring money to the people? lift minimum wage? those are all policies AGAINST HIM i just don't get why would he do that...
      </p>
      <p>
       so he's made billions in this capitalist system which exploits the poor for their own personal gain and now we are to believe he went all mother Theresa on us and will give out his billions to the poorest? yeah, no... maybe next term if he really proves me wrong

       He's a mason, just like Bill Clinton and likely eastern star (or worse) Hillary.  They all are, except we don't know if Bernie is.  The best I can do to put him with freemasonry is that he had a campaign office in the same commercial building as a masonic lodge, and that's honestly a nothingburger of an association.  I don't want a freemason or cryptojesuit in office.  Sorry that's just a no go for me.

       Trump has done ads for Likud, his son and his daughter are Jewish Zionists, and his grandchildren are all Jews growing up in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, Trump has spent the last DECADE shilling for the foreign Israeli regime, harping on the stupid "birther" thing (an anti-Obama campaign meant to smear Obama for not sucking Netanyahu's dick) as well as taking up Likud's cause, the Iran deal.
