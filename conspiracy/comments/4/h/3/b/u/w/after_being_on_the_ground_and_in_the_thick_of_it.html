        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The tried and true old tactic of the agent provocateur is still alive and well. <em>But it wasn&#39;t the Trump camp who infiltrated protesters to instigate violence, Trump supporters are innocent... it was the Hillary camp.</em> </p>

<p>Her best tactic for victory right now is setting Sanders and Trump supporters against each other as much as possible. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/29/politics/donald-trump-bernie-sanders/">Trump isn&#39;t falling for it</a>, but the media obviously is following suit. That&#39;s why they&#39;re happy to make the protesters look like thugs, but still have this weird slightly Anti-Trump bias, like when Trumps press lady was on Fox and the Fox reporter, in the same breath as talking about how that one Trump kid got assaulted and bloodied up, in the same breath, tried to suggest maybe it was his fault! It&#39;s baffling, unless you look at this in the real and obvious context.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a pro-Sanders or a pro-Trump post. Just an Anti-Hillary warning from what I have observed. She&#39;s the establishment&#39;s best hope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may very well be right, I sort of think that too. I mean Hillary and Trump share tax-evading property and she was at his wedding, and Bernie, besides Iraq, has the same voting record relating to blowing up other countries that Hillary or anyone else does and he&#39;s very pro-Israel, although he&#39;s trying to be low-key about that right now to get that far-left conspiracy vote. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s how I see it, we <strong>KNOW</strong> Hillary is an establishment pig. There&#39;s a slight <em>chance</em> with Sanders or maybe even Trump (<em>MAYBE</em>) that these guys are legit and doing their own thing. I&#39;d rather encourage their voters than Hillary voters. These two groups might disagree on tons of policies, but they both know one thing for damn sure, the political system right now is bullshit and politicians are full of crap and it doesn&#39;t let this country move anywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know if I would go as far as any type of panel or committee.  I have a feeling that such a thing might itself be at risk for cointelpro and infiltration.  I was thinking more along the lines of what people like Malcolm X did.  His revolution wasn&#39;t one that advocated the initiation of violence...but it certainly wasn&#39;t one that was afraid to fight for its rights &quot;by any means necessary&quot;.</p>

<p>Be cool.  Be nice.  Be calm.  Be peaceful.</p>

<p>...until it&#39;s time to <em>not</em> be cool, nice, calm, and peaceful.</p>

<p>Ideally the revolution would <em>never</em> have to get violent.  Be willing to negotiate peacefully.  However, also be willing to fight and kill and die for what you/we want.  We need to have that sort of conviction as well.</p>
