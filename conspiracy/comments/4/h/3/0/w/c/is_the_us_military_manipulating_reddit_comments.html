       I've came across this piece of news:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of this post, the top comments are:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/d2m5s8p">
        "My freedom boner is intensifying"
       </a>
       by /u/Throwawayfd166 (a 19 day old account). Top reply to it is made by /u/human_michael, which is an even younger 3 day old account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second top-level comment is a gilded one -
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/d2m6hf5">
        "Good, i hate those guys"
       </a>
       and was made by /u/SaaVaaG_CarrieZ. It's a 1 year old account... except his last post immediately before that one was made on
       <em>
        June 20, 2014
       </em>
       , with a sudden influx of activity to try to bury it afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third top-level comment was made by /u/Testiclese. -
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/d2m6xx7">
        "May they kill 40,000 more."
       </a>
       . 5 year old account, recent submission history looks reasonably normal despite the user only having submitted 5 links during all this time with the last one being 10 months old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth top-level comment? /u/Spin_Me says
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/d2m79kf">
        "My Tax dollars - well spent!"
       </a>
       . It's not a very active account but also appears to be a normal user.
      </p>
      <p>
       5th top-level comment?
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/d2m6vrf">
        "Way to go fellas. Stack 'em up like cord-wood."
       </a>
       by /u/NIghtPutting84. 1 year old account, at the time of this post has 213 comment karma with 200 of it being made on that thread alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       7th top-level comment was created by /u/m3s3dup, who
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4gzv4j/us_special_ops_kill_40_isis_operatives/d2mbzz0">
        congratulates unpraised groundwork and mentions being related to a special forces member
       </a>
       .  It appears to be a seemingly normal account, but it has recently returned from a 7 month hiatus with a few relatively low effort posts. It's possible that account was sold, but i can't confirm or deny this.

       Perhaps not personally reveling in it, but constructing the illusion that reveling in such is a completely normal, common, acceptable thing.

       Indeed. Propaganda has reached new levels where its not just the article itself that is the subject of propaganda, but now the responses in the comment section are as well. In doing so, they are implanting suggestions, so when you are later asked how you feel about this event, having no real strong feelings about it; you wrack your mind and the first thing to come up is the comments you read at the bottom of this Reddit post.

        <strong>
         Operation Earnest Voice is an astroturfing campaign by the US government. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking sites
        </strong>
        based outside of the US to "counter extremist ideology and propaganda and to ensure that credible voices in the region [Middle East] are heard". According to the United States Military Central Command (CENTCOM), which covers the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, the US-based Facebook and Twitter networks are not targeted by the program because US laws prohibit US state agencies from spreading propaganda among US citizens as according to the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. However, Isaac R. Porche, a researcher at the RAND corporation,
        <strong>
         claims it would not be easy to exclude US audiences when dealing with internet communications.

       I've talked to many vets. I've seen the thousand yard stare. I've known cats that went in all America-Fuck-Yea and came back with PTSD or
       <em>
        worse
       </em>
       .... those battles are still being fought today, and they have casualties stateside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the other side. The Asymmetrical part. Battles where our side kills thousands to one. The

       </em>
       damage.

       Humanity makes that judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certain people (tyrants, serial killers, and other monsters) who deserved death. If your actions and inability to act like a civilized human being are detrimental to the lives and well being of others, then you deserve to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're appealing to emotion, which is a losing argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chop off heads and set people on fire because they don't subscribe to your religious beliefs? Then yes, that person deserves to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases, there is no compelling argument in favor of someone being allowed to live. Once you resort to emotion, you admit you've already lost the debate .

       It is solved by violence because it stops them from commuting said acts. If they are dead, they can't behead people or burn a Jordanian pilot alive. Personally think the whole Middle East should be nuked to hell. The whole area is backwards, filled with terrorism, treat women like objects, and are stuck in the Stone Age.

       But the capitalists make more money off of slow war, and have opium and oil interests in the area.

       Hitlers plan was to wipe the area into oblivion and turn it into vacation land. Shame, it was a good idea and it's a beautiful land. Just a backward people that inhabit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say, drop 10-12 nukes all over the area. Obliterate it. Demolish it. Problem solved. Ban Islam. 10-12 nukes ought do the job. Would also do good to test the us arsenal of nukes and make sure they are functioning properly and flex our arm, so to say.

       These aren't people they're animals. And they are not incentive, they harbor this type of behavior in their back yard. If they had morals, they'd of eradicated it years ago. Drop some freedom on them, as they say.

       Having thought about this a bit longer, I'd say that this qualifies as a genuine emotional reaction on this user's part. This user isn't mad at me per se, but rather at the cognitive dissonance* that my interpretation presented. The user attempts to resolve this cognitive bias by justifying the murders of an occupying force by claiming that the people being murdered are terrorists. Nothing other than the statements of the occupying force supports this belief. The user then presents three other beliefs to support the primary justification.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cognitive dissonance* is in the realization that these actions are in fact tantamount to murder, and this is probably in serious conflict with the sort of bloodthirsty satisfaction that goes with seeing your enemies driven before you and hearing the lamentations of their women. This user may have been in that thread, upvoting and laughing at the continuing blight on humanity known as "the war on terrorism".

       Thank you for attempting to understand, but I do not appreciate being looked at as a 'subject' as I feel your reply seems to be doing. I did not participate in the said thread, but it was to my understanding that the 40 people killed /were/ terrorists. I get no satisfaction from the 'blood of my enemies' or the 'lamentations of their women.' I only fear for the safety of myself and my people, you included. I understand that the war on terror is a perpetual war funded by our government, but I don't know the full story and perhaps I may have made an error based on information I missed. I hope you didn't feel as if my comment was supposed to be an attack on you, but rather on a statement that did not appear to make logical sense to me. If I am missing information in my justification of the attack, I am open to reading and understanding. I feel that it only makes sense to end 40 lives if each one of those would end countless more lives of innocents. The reason my comment is near the top is because the one I responded to was at the top, so it's the first one I saw.

       You don't kill based on what people could do, you kill based on what they are doing and have already done. Once someone proves they cannot exist without harming others, they become deserving of death. Then, and only then, do you end their life.

       Yes I think I'm a moral person. It's not for what they 'could potentially do' it's for what they WILL do. It is their job to kill people, is it not? I understand that death is not a good thing, but I feel that it only makes sense to kill these people before they can kill countless others.

       I don't think you are a moral person. A moral person doesn't justify murder. An occupying army is telling you the people of the land it occupies,
       <em>
        that it kills
       </em>
       are terrorists. You think it's OK to kill them because
       <em>
        they might
       </em>
       be terrorists? The only "countless others" that are being killed
       <strong>

       Morality is subjective.  Not arguing your point about this particular situation, but to say a moral person is always against murder is naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very moral, I absolutely will not do things I believe to be wrong, I've never deliberately harmed anyone.  Put me in a situation where I decide the fate of a child molester or a serial killer, that mother fucker is getting murdered.  It's just practical, when you kill a predator you save all his future prey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it immoral to allow someone who regularly harms others to continue.  It's not about vengeance, if I can kill a suicide bomber before he or she hurts anyone, it would be immoral for me to choose not to just because I don't want to take on that responsibility.

       Maybe we should actually address the root of the problem rather than cheer-lead for death and waste, which is that those "TERRORISTS" are a proxy-army funded and trained by Western intelligence operations in order to further long term goals (takeover of the region, in part

       Critical thinking still helps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important question to ask, and one for which the answer is still almost always available, is who benefits from what you are seeing?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch Alex Jones, for example, he might try and claim that he's just a nice guy who is passionate about making sure people get the truth.  While to a certain extent that might even be true, it's almost certainly not the whole story; if for no other reason than because Alex has the same needs I do.  He needs to eat and drink and wipe his backside, and doing so costs money.  He probably also wants to eat well, and when wiping his backside, not have to use sand paper.  So he's still selling DVDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably get the idea.  Follow the money.

       I don't believe that paid, on-the-clock shillery is as common as is believed, but it does happen.  Mind you, it doesn't really need to happen all that much anyway.  If there is a more chronically brainwashed group of people in existence than the American military, then I don't know about it.  Veterans willingly join the chorus about fighting for freedom, because the alternative is confronting the idea that they actually did the exact opposite.  Contrary to the common refrain, it generally isn't the civilian population, who can't handle the truth.

       Political shill bots or social media bots have already been released. The only thing preventing the internet from turning into a tyrant's wet dream was the amount of personnel one had to hire to force a narrative. Until recently, these propagandists had to actually hire a bunch of people to perform the labor. Now, it's automated, and probably much worse than even I can imagine because all I know is what is on public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until recently, the  more popular argument was simply that shills don't exist. This was coupled with what appeared to be a deliberate hoax shill confession that was really high up on the google ranks, along with the majority of the actual information on shills buried beyond the first page where most people don't look. With the public slowly becoming aware that shills actually exist, they had to switch tactics and try to claim the problem isn't really much of a problem at all, and you fell for it, along with countless others.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/3uoxpl/internet_shills_101/">
        There is a lot of info out there, but never front page headlines on shills.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the extreme ignorance of the general public on the existence of shill bots, I think the question of how many shills there are is the wrong question. I would ask how common they are in certain areas of the internet, like a high traffic post on Reddit for example. Let's say that a single post is going to receive 80 thousand views over the course of a day (pretty common for top posts). And let's also say that post is very damaging to the reputation of a major corporation. How long do you honestly think it will be before the corporation is alerted to a few keywords? There are keyword alert services available like trackreddit.com. I would say within minutes, some guy in a dark room is reading the email. It is misleading to say "They aren't that common" when billboards aren't all that common either, but they work. I don't see a billboard in my bathroom or when I hike in the woods, but they are conveniently located in areas with a high traffic volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you peruse the link above, you will also notice that there are a large amount of entities which hire shills. The more entities that hire shills, the more likely it is that you will see their content. Will they follow you down a low traffic, buried section of a Reddit post? Probably not. But they do get alerts for certain key words, and they certainly pay attention to the higher traffic areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       On slow days, perhaps they dip into lower traffic areas. What else are they going to do? Even if a post is only going to be seen by a thousand people, it will still be worth it to pay a guy for that 10 minutes it takes to throw a comment in.

       I wouldn't be surprised, what's makes me cringe the most is seeing posts about some "troop" who is arriving at the airport finishing their "term of duty"... It appears on reddit highly ranked (usually front page, or several pages from it) encouraging the soppy "i've returned from the battlefield" rubbish. I don't see how it is seen as a good thing, as this is someone who's been out getting paid for killing people, and ironically, most of the people they've demoralized are innocent villagers residing in the middle east. Propaganda or not, i imagine there are some bots upvoting that crap to put the military industrial complex on a higher level, so to speak. The majority of deaths throughout the middle-east have been innocent lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the Snowden revelations, we can already point to tactics involving social manipulation involving PR for military/government alike. I have no doubts they are still fiddling their way by manipulating reddit/facebook/twitter etc.

       Corporations do it, you should have seen this thread "Why do people hate Monsanto" the other day... you would have thought they were the greatest company on earth after reading that thread (that got downvoted immediately)... so I can only imagine what the US military is capable of doing, seeing as they have many more resources and a "good" reason to "persuade" people.

       A link from facebook, probably. They probably hadn't been to reddit in years and then got some facebook link to the story (not hard to imagine this kind of story circulating in facebook circles. 'LETS GET 10000 LIKEPOKES FOR THUH TROOPS!")
      </p>

       seeing the raucous celebration of death made them want to join in and leave their own very generic comments about how great these deaths were.
