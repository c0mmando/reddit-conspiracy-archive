<p>Wow!  Noam Chomsky is on <strong>our side</strong> again!  Finally!  I guess we can forgive him for the 9/11 and JFK gatekeeperism.  Yes.  He&#39;s saying things I like to hear...stuff that&#39;s bad about Israel, stuff that supports poor students being raped in the wallet, stuff that looks anti-hillary and anti-establishment.  I am being pandered to, and I&#39;m loving it.  Let&#39;s listen to him and ignore any vicious, counterculture-subverting trojan horse statements he might slipstream into his political mumblings</p>

<hr/>

<p>My point here is though he may be correct and your&#39;e entitled to listen to whomever you want, always remember that Chomsky is a gatekeeper for the elite cabal.  This is irrefutable.</p>

<p><strong>Gatekeeperism Explained</strong></p>

<p>After years of exposing the covert activities of the CIA in deposing leaders, inciting coups, interfering with elections, shaping perceptions through interference with the media, installing provocateurs in political groups to undermine movements, and supporting anarcho-syndicalism (free market where unions own industries; workers fractionally own industries and they work autonomously--no government intervention whatsoever), Chomsky suddenly and quite noticeably betrayed ALL of 9/11 truth and ALL of the JFK truth movement  in an act of hypocrisy that has no known equivalent in terms of intensity and impact </p>

<ul>
<li>AE911 movement ,is &#39;miniscule&#39; (2500 architects and engineers, over 75k more, over 300k collectively in other 911 truth movements, possibly much larger)</li>
<li>They aren&#39;t doing what they should do (they published several science articles that universities and the media refuse to acknowledge, 10 scientists, some prof emeriti in chemistry; peer-reviewed 3 times)</li>
<li>Noam is not a scientist.  He has a phd in linguistics, which is not a hard science like chemistry or physics.  He has no credentials as a political scientist other than experience talking.  He makes comments to discredit scientists and has no authority to do so.</li>
<li>&quot;I dont&#39; know what nanothermite is and neither do you&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;They spend an hour on the internet and think they are experts&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;They post online criticizing the government, how very <em>brave</em> of them&quot;</li>
<li>A <strong><em>miniscule</em></strong> amount of support</li>
<li>JFK was just one person.  Lots of people die all the time. Who cares?</li>
<li>9/11 was 15 yrs ago.  Who cares?</li>
<li><p>Why would Bush need 9/11 to go to war with Iraq?  He could have done it anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEDf7OkRCxk&amp;ab_channel=corbettreport">Meet Noam Chomsky, Academic Gatekeeper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ekffe/reflections_on_the_exposed_gatekeeper_noam/?ref=search_posts">Reflections on the Exposed Gatekeeper: Noam Chomsky [and the very interesting group who tirelessly &quot;support&quot; him on Reddit]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4hffa8/chomsky_on_guns_its_clear_that_taken_literally/">&quot;Chomsky on Guns: &quot;It&#39;s clear that, taken literally, the 2nd Amendment doesn&#39;t permit people to have guns. After decades of business propaganda, people feel that the gov is some kind of enemy and that they have to defend themselves from.&quot; HOLY FUCK. HOW IS THIS GUY TAKEN AS A SERIOUS INTELLECTUAL?&quot;</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So you see, there are plenty of quotes that Chomsky is using disinfo and hateful propaganda to discredit the 9/11 movement.  Yet these postive posts of Chomsky are suddenly showing up.</p>

<p>I believe posts like this one and others pointing out Chomsky&#39;s gatekeeperism are getting under someones&#39; skin.  They didn&#39;t like it when I said we would remember Chomsky after his death as a hypocrite and we&#39;d assure that his name was tarnished forever.  Because of this, I suggest that they decided to salvage Chomsky&#39;s name.  I think that because it is clear to me someone is trying to promote him and his analysis (like we care anymore), out of the blue.  They are also downvoting things that were previously upvoted.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, it&#39;s possible to agree with Chomsky and I do, on many things.  But I&#39;m pointing out why suddenly we&#39;re listening to him anymore.  Listening to him was such a pre-gatekeeper thing to do, did we miss the memo?</p>

<p>Look at the karma of my comments on chomsky being a gatekeeper.  I can assure you months ago, these comments would likely get 10-30 upvotes, suggesting the most on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> agreed with me <em>then</em> but what?  changed their minds overnight?  I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>My bile filled comments: </p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Now it&#39;s possible someone posting Chomsky stuff is just uninformed, or they are a true critical thinker who is afforded the ability to listen to an enemy and derive the true statements from it, like a police detective.</p>

<p>Or it&#39;s possible we mistake sometimes of thinking someone posting positive stories about an outed enemy is a shill, when in fact, they are just ignorant.  I&#39;ll allow a concession for this starting now.  Ok?  </p>

<p>So here&#39;s what we maybe shouldn&#39;t do: go back in time and dredge up old Chomsky stuff that says things anti-establishment, make cute memes out of them.</p>

<p>Because that makes Chomsky look like he&#39;s on our side, when we know he&#39;s not.  And that will confuse newcomers to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> who are just now &#39;waking up&#39; to the truth.</p>

<p>I mean, you&#39;re welcome to read or re-read chomsky&#39;s stuff, but maybe keep it to yourself! (hah)</p>

<p>Because if you ignore his recent gatekeeperism, then you&#39;re willingly deciding to ignore the bad parts that say so much...and you&#39;re willingly being mocked, to your face and you should know this.  Maybe you aren&#39;t into being mocked or perhaps your&#39;e a reality denier, so you bury your head in the sand and pretend that your ass wasn&#39;t just kicked or that your friend stabbed you in the back.</p>

<p>Anyway, your&#39;e welcome to have whatever perspective you have, this is America, where you&#39;re entitled to be stupid.  I&#39;m just not going to respect you and whenever you post something postiive about Chomsky while ignoring the gatekeeperism, I&#39;m telling you now I&#39;m committed to inform you in the most unpleasantly confrontational way I can because it will be clear you&#39;re not giving up your buried-head-ism / shillhood, and nor will I stop gatekeeper reminding you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what&#39;s happening.  I&#39;ve listened to him and agreed with him for years.  Now I&#39;m saying, &quot;it&#39;s wise to stop listening to him&quot; or &quot;if you listen to him, know that he&#39;s going to try to sneak poison into your mind&quot;.  You&#39;re welcome to do as you will, however I won&#39;t accept anything from chomsky anymore, and I&#39;d appreciate if others stopped posting chomsky crap.  I won&#39;t even listen to him personally.</p>

<p>(Do you agree with things ann coulter says?  I do.  Do I have to actually listen to her anymore? No.  She ends up creeping her way in somehow, but I am not going after it.  I think she&#39;s a nasty human being.)</p>

<p>Why stop listening to Chomsky?  First, he&#39;s said the same things for the last 40 yrs, except when he talked about 9/11.  Red flag.  Secondly, because he actually is just a celebrity and has no more authority than you or me.  Seriously.  Do you read?  Ok, then, you&#39;ve got the same authority as Chomsky.  He&#39;s a political analyst because he talks about politics and people are willing to listen.  If you stop listening, he ceases to be a political analyst and then becomes just like you and me, &quot;cowardly bloggers who <em>oh so bravely</em> post vicious attacks on the government, on online forums like reddit or something&quot;, except he&#39;ll go back to being &#39;just a linguist&#39;.  Yet he&#39;ll always have Nim chimpsky the delightful monkey that learned rudimentary human langauge in his name.  So there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Why does he have no authority?  Because he is actually not a political scientist, he&#39;s a linguistics professor from MIT who speaks well and has authored books.  In politics, however, at the end of the day, he&#39;s blogger with a <strong><em>miniscule</em></strong> amount of authority. He reads a couple of books and thinks he knows geopolitics.  It&#39;s very brave of him to go onto a podium in a ratty sweater with messed up hair and the abject inability to speak clearly even though it&#39;s his career to be heard and 40 yrs of practice--forcing everyone to try very hard to make out what he&#39;s saying, as if they are listening to someone from russia with a thick accent.  Everything he says about Israel is incorrect, they don&#39;t have to fight palestine, they have no motivation to fight them.  See what I just did?  I just pulled a chomsky.</p>

<p>Chomsky is either an agent or a coward who was emasculated by occupy NYC when they asked him to talk and no one could understand him.  Human microphone failed because he&#39;s a gravelmouthed loser who misread the room.  So then I guess it broke his brain and he switched sides.  So, yeah, fuck him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer.  That&#39;s what is at the heart of this post.  Trust.  When someone betrays it so completely, you can never ever listen to them again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like what Thomas Sheridan says of psychopaths.  Once you&#39;re identified someone without any doubt that they are psychopath and in your life, you must <em>never contact again</em>.  This is good advice.  </p>

<p>You see, psychopaths don&#39;t have any feelings, thats&#39; why it&#39;s moral to do that.  If you did that to a normal person it would be crushing, callous and cruel.  And also, unforgiveness hurts the unforgiver more than the unforgiven.  Psychopaths never ask for forgiveness, so you&#39;re not required to give it; you&#39;re just required to run as fast as you fucking can.</p>

<p>Chomsky is a psychopath.  Anyone going along with the 9/11 lie on purpose is a fucking psychopath.  I personally believe he should be destroyed like a faulty television set.  Give him back to the archons kind of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;it doesn&#39;t matter&quot; and &quot;who cares&quot; mean two different things.  The latter is an insult to culture in its implication that there is (and should rightly be) an overwhelming majority that think it is not important.  This is not true about truthers or falsers, everyone thinks 9/11 is important.</p>

<p>&quot;it doesn&#39;t matter&quot; doesn&#39;t carry the same insulting connotation and is more ambiguous.  It is not neutral language, but it&#39;s more neutral than &#39;who cares&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a great post -- the whole point of his existence is to gain credit on matters of lesser importance, and on the matters that really are significant, the very few super-important matters, such as 9/11 and JFK, these are the ones where he shows his true colors. &quot;9/11 was 15 years ago, who cares&quot;, is he fucking serious? I couldn&#39;t shill worse if I tried, how can anyone take that man seriously. 9/11 is the litmus test, our entire society changed that day. How in the bloody fuck can he try to say that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s not so much what he said is how he said it. In listening to Chomsky for years, I&#39;ve never heard him get more nasty and angry than talking about 9/11.  If he were talking about the facts about it (which he expressly avoids), it would be one thing.  But with him, it&#39;s clear that 9/11 goes into some kind of  chomsky triggering meta area that we&#39;re not privy to.  Like &quot;Chomsky if you talk about 9/11 we&#39;ll shoot your dog, your wife, and the rest of your family...so get angry when asked, put on a show, or else.  yours truly, donald rumsfeld&quot;  or &quot;listen you need to get mad at truthers, otherwise we won&#39;t be able to cap the pyramid next year as it gets out of control.  yours truly, brother thomas of knights of malta baltimore chapter&quot;</p>

<p>Also I hate it when his rabid fans try to justify some of his more outlandish statements by pointing to his linguistic work. He could be the most brilliant linguist in the world, but that says nothing about whether his political theories are valid or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Thank you,</em>  sir!  Exactly <em>this</em>.  </p>

<p>Also, most people don&#39;t even understand what he&#39;s contributed to linguistics, because even linguistics people don&#39;t understand linquistics.  I had a friend in a masters in linguistics program and he and his classmate couldn&#39;t explain it to my satisfaction (specifcally chomsky also) and I&#39;m of at least avg intelligence.  So I think it&#39;s stupid.  It&#39;s probably not though.  I think if you can&#39;t explain it then it&#39;s not realworld, and so why if you deal with etheric nonsense do you have authority in real world applications?  Answer: you don&#39;t--if you live and breathe in etheric, you think etherically. Unless you&#39;re scripted, which Chomsky clearly is.  At least he is <em>now</em>, maybe not pre-911.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While he may be a gatekeeper, he is a LOT better than many other sources. He is not perfect. Nobody is. But, he has a lot of good information and he has been on the right side of things in many cases. </p>

<p>I think that JFK and 9/11 are major inflection points and are therefore very important. So, I do not think that we should forget or dismiss them. But, I also sorta get why Chomsky says &quot;Who cares?&quot;. It is in the past and it is already finished. Although I do not know exactly what happened on 9/11, I know that the attack was used to justify an attack on Iraq that was planned before 9/11 even happened. 9/11 was used to take away even more of our rights.</p>

<p>The point is that the war now is in Syria and the Ukraine. It is in the budget and the college loans. We need to stay focused on the present rather than the past so that we can prevent another 9/11 even if it only happens inside of some bill that passes congress.</p>

<p>This is not to say that studying the past events is meaningless or that we should not do it. It is a matter of relative focus.</p>
