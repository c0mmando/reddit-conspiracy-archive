       I remember that night in the summer of 2005 like it was yesterday. I was a sophomore at the University of Oregon, living on my own, and thoroughly enjoying this awesome new site on the web: youtube.com. Oh, this other great site had just popped up a couple months earlier as well: reddit.com. Was I in heaven, or what? I have always considered myself an information junkie, devouring books, articles, movies, music, anything I could get my hands on – nothing was off limits because I wanted to know it all. The sudden arrival of these two godsends was, by all accounts, exploited to the max.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what was so special about that night? In short, I learned a very important truth. One that changed my beliefs, my worldview, my whole life, really. It was something I could not look away from, ignore, dismiss, or explain away, because the obvious truth was, well, obvious. That obvious truth was the footage I saw, for the very first time, there in my one bedroom apartment in Eugene, drunk on cheap whiskey, of WTC 7 collapsing at freefall speed in New York City. My jaw hit the floor. Not only did I not know a third building collapsed that day – I did not know that it collapsed the way it did. Everything I thought I knew about the world, my country, politics, the media, everything really, was shattered, right then and there. To be fair, the first time I heard 9/11 was an inside job was actually on the day itself. My cousin, 10 years older than I was at the time, said, “It’s the CIA. It’s the Mossad. It’s all a lie and there’s gonna be a war.” He was promptly told to fuck off. A few years later, someone in my college dorms showed me a video alleging the Pentagon strike could not have been by a plane. “Do you mean to tell me the government, the politicians, the military, the intelligence agencies, the media, are all in on it?” I asked. He responded affirmatively and was promptly told to fuck off. But somewhere deep inside, I suppose the question remained. A seed had been planted. Besides, hadn’t I watched Oliver Stone’s JFK in high school? Didn’t I remember the headspace that movie put me in? The thought that my textbooks were lying, knowingly, about the complete absurdity of one shooter named Oswald? Governments could, and did, lie. I knew that. It troubled me then, but I was 16 and cared almost exclusively about, well, other things, so the thoughts were pushed away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to that night in Eugene. I went down the rabbit hole. It was a dark period. I’m sure a lot of you can relate. I had a tiger by the tail, and all this information was becoming available to me. I tried to tell my friends and family. I sounded crazy, I’m sure. Later on, I started a website where I tried to share some of this new information I was coming across. Hey, it even had a visitor tracker! Wait, why was I getting a steady supply of hits from people in Langley, Virginia? I didn’t know anyone there, did I? Enter paranoia. I smoked a lot of weed to cope. I drank too much. I was in a hole, and I could not relate to anyone. If it wasn’t for my bike, which I rode for hours and hours day or night, just to get away from that damn laptop, connected to that damn internet, connected to those damn sites that were really starting to make me wonder if we weren’t ruled by reptilian overlords… I might have lost it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next few years were an absolute blur. I continued to drink. I made a lot of bad decisions. I graduated, somehow. But I was jaded. And pissed off. I knew what was up, and everyone else was lost. Everyone except for folks on a few online forums. Infowars.com was my church, Alex Jones my preacher. Until one day I woke up and saw him for what he really was. I won’t go into that anymore than I have to, but I think a lot of you will understand. I have to give credit where it is due – Jones played a large role in a lot of people’s awakenings, and that was important for a lot of people, including me, but… I don’t think I need to say more. If you know, you know, and if you don’t, you’ll figure it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2008 I left the U.S. and moved halfway around the world. I stopped my daily rituals. No more hours every day spent reading, reading, reading… About what, exactly? Bullshit. So much bullshit. Websites with black backgrounds and bright blue or yellow text. You might remember the ones. Who could separate the bullshit from the truth? I suppose it was my fault. Maybe I wasn’t looking hard enough. I wasn’t doing enough homework, or I wasn’t doing it right, at least. At any rate, I stopped – I had to, for my sanity and for my health. But it’s kind of a shame that I did, because it was around that time that James Corbett was really getting started, and I wish I could have been there from day one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Welcome my friends, welcome…

       OK, so I lied. I’m an addict through and through and I never really stopped. I still frequented
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Every once in a while I would come across something by a James Corbett. Mostly links to podcasts, which, to my detriment, I wasn’t into. In fact, I never really gave them a chance, but when I did, oh boy. I kicked myself for waiting too long. That was in 2011. Here was a man who was articulate in presentation, was obviously intelligent - as evidenced by the subject content he chose and the way in which he approached it - and most impressively, I don’t think I’ve ever heard this guy interject a sentence with an “um,” “ah,” or dreaded “uhhhhh.” This dude had thoughts in his head and goddamnit, he could lay them down thick and hard and without compromise. He knew what he wanted to say and he said it. He was damn good at it, and I really appreciated him for it. So, I continued to listen and I learned that many of the topics he addressed on the Corbett Report were ones I was familiar with – but he had done something so much more with the information. He had done his homework, and he spoke to people in the alternative news community, he spoke to whistle blowers (some real ones actually exist!), he did his research, and he cited it all and organized it in a way that was comprehendible. And he never talked bullshit. There has never been outlandish conjecture. There have never been wild claims. Nothing is unsubstantiated. He’s so sane and reasonable, it’s almost painful.

       If James Brown was the hardest working man in show business, James Corbett is the hardest working man in the news business, period. Mainstream, alternative, whatever, it doesn’t matter, when it comes to content, I can’t think of anyone anywhere who has James beat. And he does it, for the most part, by himself. For his consistency, his attention to detail, and his honest, heartfelt quest to just get down to the truth, James is unparalleled. That isn’t to say there aren’t others who are working just as hard, but to me, James represents the absolute best of what the alternative news community stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I a little sad that the weekly podcasts of years previous have given way to the less frequent docupodcasts of late? No. Those 300+ pieces of work are still there, and guess what, they hold up just as strong as ever, and I still go back and listen to them, and I always learn something new. Besides, James has great guests, and the work he does with James Evan Pilato from Media Monarchy is superb, and he always has something in the pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, thank God for James Corbett. I can’t imagine this world without him. I see a lot of new people on

       IMHO James Corbett is the single best source for alternative media out there right now and for the last 4 or 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2l7wge/hi_james_corbett_of_corbettreportcom_here_ama/">
        That's why we wanted him to do an AMA here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the best AMA we ever had. James recorded
       <em>
        video answers
       </em>
       to the questions he answered for the AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professional, concise, level-headed and always constantly citing his sources, to say that we don't have enough people like him in the alternative media would be a massive understatement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It kills me that places like CNN portray Alex Jones as being the face "conspiracy theories" on the Internet. James Corbett should be what people think about, when they think about what a "conspiracy theorist" is. Level-headed, suspicious of powerful corporations and the government, looking for proof to back up their statement, someone who wants to preserve their individual rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just someone who spends his time ranting and raving, and talking about how he's going to fight the government to the death using his guns, a la Alex Jones. This does nothing for the cause, it only alienates people that are more or less still stuck in the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, that's

       I wonder if anyone has asked James about what he currently makes of Alex Jones. I know that in the beginning, he cited Jones as actually being the inspiration behind the formation of The Corbett Report. I wonder if, and when, Corbett became totally disillusioned with Jones' self-defeating antics and outright hostility toward the suggestion of Mossad/Zionist/Israeli involvement in 9/11 and other events. At any rate, his name never comes up in the Corbett Report anymore, and that's probably a good thing.

       I have done this several times. It's bit ironic that religious and occult influence seem to be the bit that he avoids speaking about. 
His take seems to be that God/gods/religion/occult have always been about deception to control the masses. I wonder when he made up his mind in regards to these things, and if he were to revisit them with fresh eyes, how differently would he view them?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, those elements are integral to understanding the motives of those who control the deep state. Power is their game and one of their favorite passtimes seems to be committing atrocities under a false religious flag. Look what they have done with the "great christian nation" that was founded by men steeped in occult and ancient mystery schools.

       Thank you for replying. I didn't think it would get a response, to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think James has said in passing that occult influences play a large role in how some actors within the deep state operate. He's definitely acknowledged that, I think. He often cites Quigley and the influence of Yale, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest question though: How can any of us (assuming we are outsiders and uninitiated in the various mystery schools, secret societies, etc.), know what they
       <strong>
        really
       </strong>
       believe? How do we even know who
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       really are? I think this relates to why I like James so much - he doesn't purport to know what he does not know, but rather comment on the overt move toward various policies, regulations, and moves that are occurring - with great intention - around the world. Those moves and trends are noticeable and apparent. Unless we hear it from the horse's mouth, we can really only imagine what the reasoning behind a decision to say, add BPA to plastics, is, to take one example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if James' take is that God and religion has always been about deception and control. I'm sure he believes that there are people who use God and religion for their advantage - that much is obvious. However, I'm sure he recognizes there are plenty of good people who believe in God or are spiritual, and who is he to tell them they're wrong? Besides, we can't prove God exists and we can't prove that he doesn't exist either - so this is all just faith, plain and simple. Faith in God, in Satan, in magic, in things imaginary, real, or whatever, is strong. Regardless if it is real or fake. To what end that faith is used is another story. But it is definitely powerful. It has the power for good and evil. I do, however, agree with you. I think it's pretty apparent deep state actors are obsessed with power and despise everyone else (they probably despise themselves as well), and they will use whatever means available to consolidate that power. I don't think they lose any sleep over corrupting religions, our health, etc.

       His open source investigations are always good, and his comment sections are pretty sparse considering the thousands of page views he must receive, so I wonder if he'd appreciate more participation there. I honestly think a forum at the Corbett Report would attract some pretty good minds. You can always buy his DVDs or donate as well.

       Good post, I've been subbed to James for a long time and I respect his work but I've also learned that nobody in this realm is always right. I'm sure he does more fact checking than most but it seems he made a judgement call on staged events without doing the research.  I hope he comes around on that some day.

       You're totally right. Nobody is ever right 100% of the time. However, James strikes me as the kind of guy who would gladly admit he was wrong about something, correct himself, and work harder to make sure he got it right the next time (I hope).
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of staged events... Can you really blame him for not really wanting to address those things at length? I assume you mean things like Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston, etc., which are are so wrapped in misinformation and disinformation and dead ends and traps that it is so difficult to even begin to try to make sense of what really happened - especially when the only supply of that information is coming from the mainstream media. Staged events obviously happen, but the evidence always seems, to me at least, so convoluted that it feels like it's almost pointless to even try. I've seen very little irrefutable evidence when it comes to those events, and I imagine that's by design. I'm open to anything that has basis in fact, so if there are good resources with reliable information that you know about, please share them.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, James has discussed staged events - for example, the Columbine shooting in episode 84 of the podcast. That was the first time I heard about one of the students who helped produce a 1997 video that was similar to the Columbine shooting...  Who happened to be the son of the FBI’s lead agent in the investigation.

       Yeah there is a lot of disinfo and many mistakes made by those trying to expose them but I think they are worth analyzing.  I believe there has been irrefutable evidence when looking at events in their entirety and would be admissible in court as such but almost every individual talking point can be explained away somehow.  Even where we saw blood appear on a couple in Boston long after the event, people will say something like they are the only ones faking - to get compensation.  I'm not sure how they would explain the dummies used as victim and perp in the LAX shooting but I bet they could find a way.

       I'm fairly certain Corbett has talked at length about the Israeli "art students" coming by the homes of DEA and FBI agents. And he has talked about the Israeli "art students" filming the attacks. I'm also fairly certain that he played an interview with the officer who arrested those individuals on 9/11. Maybe someone can correct me on this or find the episode/interview I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, how could he pin it on the Mossad if the incontrovertible evidence is not available to us? Sure, we know they were in on it. We know intelligence agencies, or elements within those agencies, from at least two other countries were also involved. How can we prove it, though?
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, there's no proof for this that I know of - but rigging a building for demo seems like it'd be right up Mossad's alley. They surely played a major role in the technical aspects of the operation. Again, this is all conjecture, which is probably why Corbett doesn't go into it at length, but we know it to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read By Way of Deception? It was written by Viktor Ostrovsky, a former Mossad agent, and published in 1990. There is a particularly interesting passage in the book where he discusses how Mossad agents would visit construction sites in the 1970s and '80s in Iraq and embed explosives into the foundations of buildings and bridges for demolition... You know, just in case for a later date. Wild. Try to read the book if you can, it's a real treat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer your question, I still see that cousin from time to time.

       If Corbett talked half as much about Rothschild as he'd did Rockefeller I would have more respect for him.  Have you ever researched how Corbett got started?  There are about five videos of him ignorantly eating up everything Alex Jones says on AJ's show.  I think there is some religious aspect to his philosophy.  I think he is Christian and plays with kid gloves when it comes to the Jews because he sees them as the "chosen" people.

       He's certainly tackled banking and media bias/outright disinfo before. I don't know that actually going after Jewish control would be helpful. I think it matters less who is pulling the strings than that they are being pulled and how, and he's excellent at going after the how.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the SJW and immigration topics, he's a Canadian expat living in Japan, so it's likely not as perceptible to him. I think these topics, while important to an extent, are used more as wedge issues to divide people and distract them from the conspiracies which directly impact us all. Engaging these issues, even if only to dismiss them, often does more harm than good.

       Maybe he's unsure how he feels about those issues as well?

       I think most Corbett Report listeners understand there is a major issue with how much influence the Israel lobby has over US politics. I think they also understand there is a huge imbalance regarding Jewish representation in media and banking. Read
       <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19">
        this.

      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the question is, how can a topic like that be discussed without falling into a trap where your entire body of work can be blasted by those screaming racism? What can he say about it? How would you say it? "Oh, by the way, it's Jews at the top of those industries." Well, yeah... We know that... But can we find actual connections to Mossad, Israel, or whatever? Many times we can (See Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and the interesting history that guy has) but many times we can't. Those who work in intelligence are pretty good at covering their tracks. They're also really good at going after their detractors, which is something else to keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're entirely right though. It's important to go after all the topics, especially if they're uncomfortable.

       It's interesting that certain people such as Stefan Molyneux who engage with the aforementioned topics are clueless about 9/11. Corbett does good work with regard to classic conspiracies.
