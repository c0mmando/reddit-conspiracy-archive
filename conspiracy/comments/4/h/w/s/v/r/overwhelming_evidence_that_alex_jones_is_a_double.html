    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think that Jones even reaches to the level of &quot;shill.&quot; He&#39;s strictly for entertainment purposes, basically, a shock jock like Howard Stern, except his shtick is conspiracies instead of sex.</p>

<p>He&#39;s basically a professional wrestler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your assessment.  He&#39;s simply entertainment, yet I find his films are interesting, and once in a while, he drops the schtick and sounds like a reasonable, knowledgeable person (blind squirrel finding a nut, perhaps?) But, then again, being reasonable and knowledgeable doesn&#39;t sell vitamins and tangy tangerine.</p>

<p>I listen to the show, and I like it.  I just don&#39;t take it for more than what it is, which is an INFOmercial for his products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been granted a reprieve from listening to Alex Jones. Here&#39;s why: Do you remember Miami Vice with Sonny played by Don Johnson? I could never get over the impression he was effecting a gravelly voice by holding a little ball of phlegm or spittle in his throat. The &quot;growling&quot; was imitated by bare foot loafer wearing wannabes the world over. Many think it was manly and sounded rough and ready, urgent with (I hate this word) gravitas.</p>

<p>I hate it! It gets under my skin, it acts as a Alex Jones Screen preventing me from EVER hearing him complete a sentence. To me he sounds like a wide shovel scraping sand off a concrete driveway.</p>

<p>The only other people who irritate me with their voices was, of course, the Creep Cruse, and those people who put &quot;th&quot; in their words to sound &quot;sofi<strong>th</strong>icated&quot; which you heard with Shirley Chism (God rest her sole) and occasionally Opra.</p>

<p>So good for me, bad for you if you can stand Jone&#39;s voice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The phlegm-wad speech is brutal to listen to. A lot of people don&#39;t like it and tune out for that reason alone.

    <div class="md"><p>If you listen to Alex in his earlier career, he doesn&#39;t have the gruff tone in his voice. I think he totally fakes it. Also, he uses a couple of audio tricks to hype his voice (speaking closely to a condenser microphone causes proximity effect which makes his voice sound artificially deep and boomy, as well as loads of compression to make his voice always sound &quot;loud&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that Jewish Bolsheviks, at times, shouted anti-Jewish slogans in Russian streets to corral legitimate dissenters, only to later intern or murder them. This is why Alex Jones is also known as Judas Goat Jones. Jones talks about the ADL today, but tomorrow he is back to talking ad nauseum about Hitler, the Holocaust, poor Israel, Germanic Death Cults, and the Arabs owning Hollywood.</p>

<p>Charlie Sheen probably got close to Alex Jones to undermine him by associating the &#39;trainwreck of himself&#39; with Jones.  He also probably did the same to undermine the 9/11 truth movement.  Think about it.  Charlie seems like a rational guy asking genuine questions of 9/11.  Then, he&#39;s a bile spouting lunatic madman on katie couric (&#39;tiger blood&#39;, &#39;rockstar from mars&#39;).  Then, miraculously, he&#39;s still a thing and gets another show that is successful, then he&#39;s a madman again, doing drugs, waving guns around, doing weird stuff, then he&#39;s got HIV.  Then he&#39;s got a quack doctor who injects himself with charlies blood to prove his thing works.  Charlie endorses this guy.    Dr. Oz has a big spectacle.  Weeks later the doctor is outed as a fraud, after going on Bill Maher&#39;s show.  Charlie betrays everything he said before about the doctor.  Then this big sympathy thing and Charlie looks like a little, helpless, pitiful child that has no hold on reality, being tossed from &#39;helper to helper&#39; but not being served.  A living metaphor for the aids-infected-everyperson, except he&#39;s also a drug addicted lunatic narcissist celebritard.</p>

<p>Sheen is a trainwreck.  I personally like him, despite my characterization, I have to be honest.  I do think he&#39;s an illuminati agent, and a kind of culturally transcendental hit man.</p>

<p>And I think Jones is a takedown for him.  Jones strikes me as being a kind of guy who has been an outsider for so long that when a celebritard comes along, he puts all his critical thinking aside and goes along for the ride.  I can&#39;t say I blame him.  It&#39;s nice to get the sense of &#39;belonging&#39; and &#39;acceptance&#39; from a known, well-liked celebrity.</p>

<p>Lately Jones has been hanging out with Smashing Pumpkins&#39; lead singer Billy Corgan.  I really like Corgan&#39;s interviews.  Billy Corgan seems like a legit friend of Alex&#39;s but I&#39;m afraid he might be doing the same thing in a different way.  I would hate to find that is so, but I&#39;m watching carefully and being critical of this relationship.  It just seems like Corgan is so much smarter than everyone else...to a scary degree even.  And he says he&#39;s an insider--that he knows super rich people so clearly he knows what they are up to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like you&#39;re the one obsessed with him, Mr. INFOWARS. He&#39;s clearly an agent. I mean Jesus, the guy flashes handsigns nonstop, he admits his family is heavily masonic, he tries to use NLP in basically every show whether or not you happen to be aware of it, he definitely practices Neuro-linguistic programming. Oh, and he&#39;s surrounded by jews. Might be why he never mentions how the new world order he loves crowing on about is a Zionist faction. In fact -- he&#39;ll talk about anything and everything with a nothing is sacred attitude besides the Jewish hegemony. Someone brings that up and he goes full &#39;6 million&#39; on you. Oh, and he also talks about the Nazis non-stop, which is really fascinating because you would think as a conspiracy theorist guru that he might just have looked into the Holocaust, with all of its glaring inconsistencies like the fact that the 6 million figure has shown up in the New York times over 25 times from 1910-1940, decades before Hitler was even a prominent political figure in Germany. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that Jewish Bolsheviks, at times, shouted anti-Jewish slogans in Russian streets to corral legitimate dissenters, only to later intern or murder them. This is why Alex Jones is also known as Judas Goat Jones. Jones talks about the ADL today, but tomorrow he is back to talking ad nauseum about Hitler, the Holocaust, poor Israel, Germanic Death Cults, and the Arabs owning Hollywood.</p>
