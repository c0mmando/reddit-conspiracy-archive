<p>Didn&#39;t get that vibe at all, she wasn&#39;t even there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That seemed more like an endorsement. Also, why the fuck was he there but not Hillary. I thought he was an &quot;outsider&quot;?</p>

<p>All and all, just kabuki theatre. Shit is surreal...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still wanna know why Bernie &quot;outsider&quot; Sanders was there. Trump wasn&#39;t nor was Hillary. That shit was an endorsement. You can tell from the tongue in cheek commentary. Riddle me this people :). They all suck in my mind, not a supporter of any, but why was he there? Seems organized....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A non-nefarious reason would be that he has more to gain from being there. I don&#39;t know how invitations for the dinner work, but I imagine both were invited. I&#39;ve seen senators there in the past, and he&#39;s a candidate as well. It makes sense that he&#39;d want to be there, as it would get him some press. </p>

<p>Clinton on the other hand would not want to be there if Obama might make jokes about her, which I believe he made a couple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean, he literally says: &quot;Next year someone else will be standing in this very spot, and it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess who she will be..&quot; many of his jokes were not obvious unless you were listening carefully.</p>

<p>He also compares and mocks young Bernie supporters with this statement like establishment is not going to let you have that young dream of voting out of our grip: </p>

<p>&quot;A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people. But not me, I get it. Just recently, a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year&quot; </p>

<p>There was no endorsement here
 Just making sure you realize Bernie is pipe dream. Infact he  begins by calling raving about celebrities like kendall jenner first before he mocks Bernie.</p>
