        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty than that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all powers legislative, executive and judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, self appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” </p>

<p>-James Madison<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>“But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it.”</p>

<p>I decided after following a particular thread of related stories over the past week that the only solution to my woe is to produce some OC that is both entertaining and educational, as well as inspirational and informative. I am mindful that some of the material I and others have posted on your journey to this sub (and post) have been partly the Two E’s or the Two I’s – but they need not be mutually exclusive. Let’s examine the content here and the implications – and then instead of upvoting each other and musing on our open-mindedness (which is all well and good, truly) – let’s see if we can do something about it. Maybe that doing is just spreading awareness. That’s a small, incremental and achievable goal. And it’s a solid place to start. Without further rambling – here we go.</p>

<p>Our story begins with a decision by federal judge William G. Young of Massachusetts in USA. vs Alex Levin, filed on 4/20/16 which ultimately involved the jurisdiction and authority of local magistrate judges authorizing Network Investigative Techniques and other practices involving the child pornography website called ‘Playpen.’ In sum – the website (which supposedly accessed and hidden via TOR) was not shut down but run by the FBI in order to honeypot other users who accessed the site.</p>

<p>Judge Young <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/04/20/nitcasemotiontosuppress.pdf">concluded</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the forgoing analysis, the Court concludes that the NIT warrant was issued <em>without jurisdiction</em> and thus was void ab initio. It follows that the resulting search was conducted as though there were no warrant at all. Since warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable, and the good-faith exception is inapplicable, the evidence must be excluded. Accordingly, Levin’s motion to suppress, ECF No. 44, is GRANTED.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, besides rustling the jimmies of the DOJ and others working on the case itself – this causes a problem for ongoing and future cases of the DOJ and other federal entities remotely accessing a target’s data (via computer, mobile device, et cetera).</p>

<p>Keeping this jurisdictional ruling in mind – let’s switch gears a bit and note what is referenced in the above decision on page 1 – specifically Rule 41b of the Federal Rules for Criminal Procedure. It is as follows <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_41">as of December of 2015</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rule 41</p>

<p>(b) Authority to Issue a Warrant. At the request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) a magistrate judge with authority in the district—or if none is reasonably available, a judge of a state court of record in the district—has authority to issue a warrant to search for and seize a person or property located within the district;
(2) a magistrate judge with authority in the district has authority to issue a warrant for a person or property outside the district if the person or property is located within the district when the warrant is issued but might move or be moved outside the district before the warrant is executed;
(3) a magistrate judge—in an investigation of domestic terrorism or international terrorism—with authority in any district in which activities related to the terrorism may have occurred has authority to issue a warrant for a person or property within or outside that district;
(4) a magistrate judge with authority in the district has authority to issue a warrant to install within the district a tracking device; the warrant may authorize use of the device to track the movement of a person or property located within
the district, outside the district, or both; and 
(5) a magistrate judge having authority in any district where activities related to the crime may have occurred, or in the District of Columbia, may issue a warrant for property that is located outside the jurisdiction of any state or district, but within any of the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(A) a United States territory, possession, or commonwealth;
(B) the premises—no matter who owns them—of a United States diplomatic or consular mission in a foreign state, including any appurtenant building, or part of a building used for the mission’s purposes; or
(C) a residence and any appurtenant land owned or leased by the United States and used by United States personnel assigned to a United States diplomatic or consular mission in a foreign state.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>With me so far? Now – let’s add in one of the final pieces of the puzzle – the Email Privacy Act, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr699/BILLS-114hr699eh.pdf">HR699</a> recently passed <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2016/roll167.xml">unanimously</a> (one of my triggers) by the US House of Representatives 419-0. Yes, this means that if you are an American citizen – your representative likely voted for this.</p>

<p>First – this is what <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-email-idUSKCN0XO1J7">Reuters</a> reported it as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under the Email Privacy Act, which updates a decades-old law, authorities would have to get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications more than 180 days old. At present, agencies such as the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission only need a subpoena to seek such data from a service provider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, but it does so much more! Even the title of the legislation itself lets you know what’s going on if you’re actually paying attention:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To amend <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18">title 18, United States Code</a>, to update the privacy protections for electronic communications information that is stored by third-party service providers <strong>in order to protect consumer privacy interests</strong> while meeting law enforcement needs, and for other purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember – a <strong>consumer</strong> is one who purchases goods or services. All of you saps using free email/facebook/etc – <strong>this does not apply to you</strong>. If you’re not paying for the product – you are the product. This also, unfortunately, includes reddit.</p>

<p>Section 2 amends <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2702">Section 2702 of Title 18 of United States Code</a> by changing some terminology (divulge is changed into disclosed) and updating the definitions of the electronic communication services to include that instead of “store” your electronic communications to include that which is “otherwise stored, held, or maintained.”</p>

<p>Section 3 amends <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703">Section 2703 of Title 18, United States Code</a>, which is the most important (IMO). It strikes and adds the following sections to the above-mentioned code:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘(a) CONTENTS OF WIRE OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN ELECTRONIC STORAGE.—Except as provided in subsections (i) and (j), a governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that is in electronic storage with or otherwise stored, held, or maintained by that service only if the governmental entity obtains a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) that—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘(1) is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; and
‘‘(2) may indicate the date by which the provider must make the disclosure to the governmental entity. In the absence of a date on the warrant indicating the date by which the provider must make disclosure to the governmental entity, the provider shall promptly respond to the warrant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘‘(b) CONTENTS OF WIRE OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN A REMOTE COMPUTING SERVICE.—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subsections (i) and (j), a governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of remote computing service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that is stored, held, or maintained by that service only if the governmental entity obtains a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) that—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘(A) is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; and
‘‘(B) may indicate the date by which the provider must make the disclosure to the governmental entity. In the absence of a date on the warrant indicating the date by which the provider must make disclosure to the governmental entity, the provider shall promptly respond to the warrant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘‘(2) APPLICABILITY.—Paragraph (1) is applicable with respect to any wire or electronic communication that is stored, held, or maintained by the
provider—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘(A) on behalf of, and received by means of electronic transmission from (or created by means of computer processing of communication received by means of electronic transmission from), a subscriber or customer of such remote computing service; and
‘‘(B) solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services to such subscriber or customer, if the provider is not authorized to access the contents of any such communications for purposes of providing any services other than storage or computer processing.
‘‘(c) RECORDS CONCERNING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SERVICE OR REMOTE COMPUTING SERVICE.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subsections (i) and (j), a governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service of a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service (not including the contents of wire or electronic communications), only—
‘‘<strong>(A) if a governmental entity obtains a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</strong> (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant procedures) that—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘(i) is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction directing the disclosure; and
‘‘(ii) may indicate the date by which the provider must make the disclosure to the governmental entity;
‘‘(B) if a governmental entity obtains a court order directing the disclosure under subsection (d);
‘‘(C) with the lawful consent of the subscriber or customer; or
‘‘(D) as otherwise authorized in paragraph (2).
‘‘(2) SUBSCRIBER OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION.—A provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service shall, in response to an administrative subpoena authorized by Federal or State statute, a grand jury, trial, or civil discovery subpoena, or any means available under paragraph (1), disclose to a governmental entity the—
‘‘(A) name;
‘‘(B) address;
‘‘(C) local and long distance telephone connection records, or records of session times and durations;
‘‘(D) length of service (including start date) and types of service used;
‘‘(E) telephone or instrument number or other subscriber or customer number or identity, including any temporarily assigned net16
work address; and 
‘‘(F) means and source of payment for such service (including any credit card or bank account number); of a subscriber or customer of such service.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>‘‘(3) NOTICE NOT REQUIRED.—A governmental entity that receives records or information under this subsection is not required to provide notice to a subscriber or customer.’’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But don’t take my word for it – Microsoft (of all companies) itself is pretty annoyed at the current legal situation involving government surveillance and the notice not required clauses – considering <a href="https://mscorpmedia.azureedge.net/mscorpmedia/2016/04/ECPA-Complaint.pdf">this complaint</a> filed on April 14th of this year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft brings this case because its customers have a right to know when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails, and because Microsoft has a right to tell them. Yet the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (“ECPA”) allows courts to order Microsoft to keep its customers in the dark when the government seeks their email content or other private information, based solely on a “reason to believe” that disclosure might hinder an investigation. Nothing in the statute requires that the “reason to believe” be grounded in the facts of the particular investigation, and the statute contains no limit on the length of time such secrecy orders may be kept in place.
Now, for our final piece – take a peek at the communication from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/frcr16_8mad.pdf">the day after the vote for HR 466</a>. It adds one final section to Rule 41b. This is a letter that according to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2075">Section 2075 of Title 28 USC</a> is required to be transmitted to Congress. It amends Rule 41b to add subsection (6):</p>

<p>(6) a magistrate judge with authority in any district where activities related to a crime may have occurred has authority to issue a warrant to use remote access to search electronic storage media and to seize or copy electronically stored information located within or outside that district if: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(A) the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means; or 
(B) in an investigation of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5), the media are protected computers that have been damaged without authorization and are located in five or more districts. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess who can’t rule the way he did anymore regarding NIT warrants and other electronic surveillance techniques on a count that it is no longer in the correct jurisdiction (if this legislation passes and the amended rules fall by the way-side and nobody contests them)? Judge William G. Young. And anyone else.</p>

<p>As long as they abide by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended by the Supreme Court, and sanctioned (at this point) by ½ of our bicameral legislature (the House). All that is left is the upper house, the Senate, to sign off on this. </p>

<p>I will be branching out for this endeavor using more than just reddit – which at this point will include writing to the local and large newspapers in my State to hopefully connect with the older generation that still reads newspapers (and specifically call out both of my Senators) and I urge everyone here to do the same. I’ll be exploring the idea of heading to Twitter as well – and the mods here are in discussions about possibly expanding our reach to that social media genre as well. If anyone has any podcasts or shows that you think would be interested in this story (that I haven’t really seen <em>anywhere</em> on the net) – please feel free to forward it to them (and have them PM me if they want more information or anything else from me to give this some legs). I have already sent a copy of this to the No Agenda show (which features content I submit to them at least a few times a month). </p>

<p>Would anyone be interested in helping me put together a succinct letter for the newspapers? If so - please direct your attention to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4h4crc/connecting_dots_a_network_investigative_technique/">this post</a> to try and crowd-source something.</p>

<p>As always, </p>

<p>Long days and pleasant nights and <em>vincit veritas</em>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Federalist #47, January 30th, 1788</p></li>
<li><p>No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority</p></li>
</ol>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>This is why we&#39;re in the trouble we&#39;re in - because not enough people read things. I strongly encourage you all to read through the above, download and archive the sources, and consume this on your time and at your level of understanding. With that being said - </p>

<p>The Email Privacy Act specifically cites the Federal Rules for Criminal Procedure, which, by statute, must be amended and updated via the Supreme Court by the first of May. The House of Representatives know this - and if they don&#39;t they aren&#39;t doing their job (because I know it and am not a member of this club). After the vote on HR699 - the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court messaged the legislature with their amended changes, which include altering Rule 41, subsection b, to allow for magistrate judges to have the legal authority to authorize electronic searches of material not in their jurisdiction. Which means the DOJ can ask a local DC magistrate for a warrant to <em>hack</em> into anyone&#39;s computer (or cloud, or whatever), conceivably, and go through it. And any company storing or responsible for transmitting your electronic communications and the content of your <em>online sessions</em> is not allowed to tell you about this surveillance - which can be renewed indefinitely.</p>

<p>But, because it&#39;s so cleverly worded, all of the corporate news and newspress can report that it reforms existing law in a meaningful way. It shows how all three branches of the federal government can work together (willingly or unwillingly), to whittle away at whatever fourth amendment guarantees you have left. And the only thing stopping this from becoming law is having 51 Senators veto it.</p>

<p>Posts are stickied for visibility.</p>

<p>Why else would they be?</p>

<p>[–]trinsic-paridiom 5 points 2 days ago* </p>

<p>maybe I am mis-understanding the situation, your posts are already visible. Why would you need to set your posts apart from others? Have we come to a consensus that what you say is more important that what we say? I have seen you sticky a few of your own posts and so far, it seems like you have some kind of personal reason to promote your posts over others and im trying to understand your logic behind that.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a good suggestion and we&#39;ll discuss it internally.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t ask for much here. Just abide by the One Rule (which almost everyone does all the time) and a little bit of trust.</p>

I&#39;ve got the feeling something is going on and it&#39;s affecting how everyone is communicating in c_s_t and I don&#39;t like it. That&#39;s not how got to know this sub, nor you. Love and light.</p>

<p>Edit: I haven&#39;t forgotten about the great input you gave me a few months ago, when I came here and presented my idea for a 10 minute short. Things turned out a little different as planned. But we finished shooting and I never thanked you for your insights, as I&#39;ve been ridiculously busy. So: Thank you, Jim.</p>

<p>As in C_S_T some here felt the same <em>vibe</em>, yet you went on over there and did the same!</p>

<p>While the message might be important, even imperative, your approach is/was very off-putting. </p>

<p>This world is full of liars and fools!</p>

<p>The first thing you did in here was lie, rather than explain your <em>urgency</em> to the community! Then you played the subscribers as fools to boot!</p>

<p>My post was long after others had made comment. I brought nobody here. As I said, this was internal, had nothing to do with Bots or Brigades. You and the mods pissed off some people! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here quite a long time. Seen plenty. When the exodus happened in Dec-Jan my resolve was to be the one to turn out the lights. </p>

<p>Oddly, I&#39;ve supported and defended this sub quietly in the back ground and I upvote threads more often than you will ever know. I report more than I like but I&#39;ll not tolerate abuse of the mods, the members or most of the <em>Rules</em>.</p>

<p>IMHO, you lack integrity, maturity and confidence. </p>

<p>There are some really great subscribers in here that do excellent work! I&#39;ve yet to see you support their work in here...if you have and I missed it, then the mods need to better sort out the repeat posts and you should be alerting the mods of great posts that you see!</p>

<p>TLDNR: You see yourself as a special snowflake...the community wanted to know why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough but he did post it as a self post originally and it got downvoted before ever making the front page and had 0 comments before we stickied it.  There&#39;s also no rule regarding stickies, anyone can submit a request to modmail for a sticky and that includes fellow mods.  We hadn&#39;t had a sticky in a while and this post seemed to be on a relevant and timely topic.  I was the one who stickied it myself after a couple of other mods weighed in and agreed, JCP had nothing to do with it other than sending the initial message asking for consideration.  So I don&#39;t think he lied in this thread (assuming that&#39;s the lie you were referring to).</p>

<p>Do you want to tell the others in here why nearly every post of late has zero comments? Why reposts and shit posts are making it to the front page? </p>

<p>Lets start with, the often times, thankless job of being a Mod. Some of us get that. What we&#39;re not getting is enough Mods modding and then (JCP is a <em>special snowflake</em>!) you punch us in the face!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can I tell you why posts aren&#39;t getting any comments?  As far as why shitposts make the front page, I think it&#39;s obvious at this point that the votes on reddit aren&#39;t to be trusted.  Good posts get buried, shitposts get brigaded to the top with few exceptions.  It&#39;s becoming worse so people are starting to notice more but it&#39;s been that way for the last couple years at least.  Unfortunately being a mod doesn&#39;t grant any special powers to influence the voting or even to see who it is doing the voting - that&#39;s why it&#39;s so easy to spread propaganda on reddit these days.  Stickying posts is one of the few things a mod actually <em>can</em> do.</p>

<p>And what do you mean by not enough modding?  We&#39;ve banned more trolls in the last few months than at any other time I can remember since I became a mod a year or year and a half ago.  Regardless I don&#39;t think JCP is getting any special treatment but you&#39;re free to disagree, I was just trying to see where you were coming from.  And we did just sticky a second post from a (non-mod) user as well.</p>

<p>The letter of the law doesn&#39;t matter anymore, and TPTB have demonstrated this fact repeatedly, especially with regards to data collection, hacking personal computers, mining personal data, etc. – with a court order or without. Most of the judges are in line; occasionally one fucks up due to a preponderance of evidence or some other dumb luck and sets an undesirable precedent, but that doesn&#39;t last.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it situationally, the DOJ or whoever else can always coerce a municipal PD or government with the &quot;terrorism&quot; threat, if nothing else works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the top of OP&#39;s post:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>“But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that <strong>it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it.</strong>”</p></li>
<li><p>Lysander Spooner</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the question would be, from whence in the Constitution, OR in its subsequent legitimate Amendments, do the Feds <strong>PRETEND</strong> to claim this power and authority?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text"><strong>The 10th Amendment reads as follows</strong>:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution</strong>, nor prohibited by it to the States, <strong>are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if the Constitution does not SPECIFICALLY GIVE the Feds a Power, <strong>they have no such power.</strong></p>

<p>Would someone kindly point me to that section of the Constitution that authorizes this tyrannical activity?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should Amendment #10 fail, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text">refer to Amendment #1</a></strong>;</p></li>
<li><p>Should Amendment #1 fail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text"><strong>refer to Amendment #2</strong></a></p></li>
<li><p>Should Amendment #2 fail, refer to the <strong><a href="http://images1.fanpop.com/images/quiz/29859_1215613217452_493_300.jpg">Signpost from Dante&#39;s Inferno.</a></strong></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why everyone&#39;s up in arms over this post or it being stickied.</p>

<p>I myself saw that the House approved unanimously an update to ECPA that was more stringent (180 days vs 90! Warrants vs 2703(d)-compliant subpoenas!) and was shocked and surprised and elated. Even EFF is stoked about this pro-privacy development! I mean, I figured it was only a matter of time until they gutted ECPA. It&#39;s treated as a joke already with things like NSLs.</p>

<p>And I wondered why. Why? Why would they unanimously approve something good for privacy - why wouldn&#39;t LE be whining all the way back to Congress? Why wouldn&#39;t there be <em>some</em> dissension in the ranks?</p>

<p>And JCP found a reason. A buried reason. Something I know I wouldn&#39;t have figured out on my own and it solved something that had been bugging me. Still bugs me, though, as it should all of us.</p>

<p>(Another problem with it - location and account data don&#39;t seem to fall within the warrant-required section of the ECPA, which is garbage. Location data can be more important than the content of your messages anyway.)</p>

<p>So, thanks JCP and thanks mods for stickying.</p>

<p>Everyone whining about it, do a little self-inspection. Why does this piss you off so much? It&#39;s actually pretty fucking relevant to your use of Reddit.</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>(Also, I found it oddly telling that I could find zero discussion of the ECPA updates over on <a href="/r/privacy">/r/privacy</a> or <a href="/r/legalnews">/r/legalnews</a>. Whatta joke that the most substantive conversation is here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.)</p>

<p>That&#39;s a great source of disparity though.  A candidate can campaign on any platform they want to but it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to govern on that platform.  IIRC, Congress has below a 10% approval rating.  Many Americans don&#39;t believe that our votes matter anyway because we keep seeing fraudulent election practices.  I just hope people aren&#39;t holding their breath on this &quot;solution&quot; because it isn&#39;t a solution, it is an idealistic pipedream.</p>

<p>Stop imagining the senario like a Spielberg flick. This is not <em>how reality</em> works. All of those protests were great but like you said - those fuckers got coopted by the drug/hippie scene and clobbered (and we know now that Intelligence had a lot to do wi that) and the same thing is happening now with the legalization movement (IMHO of course). Use that brain of yours. You&#39;ve come this far. Why not a bit more?</p>

<p>It&#39;s great sales for Lockheed and the various <em>bad guys</em> in the <em>region</em>. And. It&#39;s apparently legal (so fuck it). This is how we do right now. Just because Nazi Germany <em>lost</em> WWII didn&#39;t mean the Allies didn&#39;t <em>win</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s over 100 years of compulsory education. We&#39;re (most likely) the grand children of humans who got snookered into WWII in the first place. Shit didn&#39;t get that much better for that many people (globally) if you think about it.</p>

<p>To me, that means abandoning hope and idealism with facts and objectivity.  Electing the right officials isn&#39;t going to fix what&#39;s wrong with us.  The truly systemic problem, IMO, is us.  We&#39;re imperfect creatures.  We can know the truth of something but disregard it because it isn&#39;t convenient, or appealing or is too difficult.  We&#39;re the generation clamoring for <em>something more</em>.  Many are optimistic that it will be revolutionary, and it probably will, but not likely the way our dreams picture it as.</p>

<p>That&#39;s simply not a plausible solution.</p>

<p>The old adage, &quot;knowledge is power&quot; is true. But nobody can know everything. And worst, nobody can know what they do not know. This pursuit could consume an entire lifetime, and that life would still be a poor summary of knowledge.</p>

<p>Add to that the points of <a href="/u/Jango139">/u/Jango139</a>, and you&#39;re still left with the policing the politician pushing the policy.</p>

<p>The obvious solution is a much smaller government with fewer laws. </p>

<p>I should not be required to pass the Bar Exam to understand the binding responsibility of my situation moment to moment.</p>

<p>If a law cannot be worded succinctly and in plain terms, then it should not be a law.</p>

<p>What we need is a standard by which laws are written - and passed, and enforced - and any that do not conform to the simple standard should be repealed and dishonored. And anyone who does not conform to these standards or steps outside of them, should be dealt with harshly. Presidents should be dealt with most harshly, and it should trickle down to law enforcement, and finally the common citizen.</p>

<p>A little side tangent: Those we entrust with authority should be held to severe standards, matched by severe punishments (including death) for betraying such trust.</p>

<p>It should not be that only lawyers and judges are the keyholders locking away the regulations of society.</p>

<p>Transparency is key and so much is concealed behind vocabulary and PURPOSELY vague terms and conditions vulnerable to interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a message for you commietards. The &quot;communism&quot; you dream about will never happen.</p>

<p>I will tell you waht will happen if a socialist revolution aka wealth redistribution will occur. </p>

<p>Who do you think this proletariat and &quot;oppressed&quot; people are? You? No. You hipster cunts may lead the revolution at the initial stage, but others will be the revolutionaries and they will hate you with the strongest class hate because of your fancy college education and iphones. Southern rednecks are more likely to form a common bond with the ghetto gangs than with &quot;intellectuals&quot;. It has been proven many times in many lands where communis was forced. When class warfare begins teh races and nations forget the hate and unite. </p>

<p>This is what is going to happen. Someone will knock at the door of your house in your nice middle class community. When you will open the  door you will find commissar Cletus and commissar Jamal. They will tell your having such a big house for yourself is not what a true communist does and two poor families  are moving in with you. You will be allowed to have 1 room, 1 bed and necessary personal belongings. Everything else in the house will be shared.</p>

<p>The rich guys who&#39;s money you were about to redistribute left teh country and suddenly you realise that tehy and their money in their Swiss bank accounts are unreachable and there is nothing to redistribute. The corporations go bankrupt collapsing the DOW index, which make the currency just a fancy green paper worth nothing. Then you realise US was importing food because there wasn&#39;t enough produced to support 300 millions of people. Importing by paying with $, which is now worth nothing.Then comes the hunger. To suppress the hungry  angry mob, who doesn&#39;t give a fuck about high Marxist ideals and just wants to make everything like it was before, Red Terror starts. With the new NKVD and purges. Eventually commissar Cletus and Commissar Jamal will put you on your knees and shoot you at the back of your stupid head for not being dedicated enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are they going to handle all that newcrime?</p>

<p>Or is this just going to be another means to the selective interpretation that will allow them to silence the troublemakers?</p>

<p>So essentially any service that has my information online <em>that I didn&#39;t pay for</em>, is usable by law enforcement as long as it has approval by some rubberstamping local magistrate?</p>

<p>oh... and we&#39;ve got what like less than 24 hours to stop it?</p>

<p>Do I actually have anything to protect me from unreasonable search and seizure anymore? I guess I should start carrying my <em>papers</em> around...</p>

<p>The folks that used to frequent this sub know that you are describing standard procedure, we know this for a fact at least since the nineties with Echelon and there are lots of pointers hinting towards this practice decades before.</p>

<p>Why is this post still stickied, it gets ignored big time, claims about brigading notwithstanding. </p>
