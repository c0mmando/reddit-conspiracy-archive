        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Thomas Sheridan discusses in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAH4-gFIHvk&amp;ab_channel=ThomasSheridan">&quot;Classic British Horror and Sci-Fi - Whistle Blowing on a Massive Scale&quot;</a> how british sci fi and horror in the 50s-70s was an attempt to blow the whistle on aristocrats and black magic, similar to Kubrick&#39;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, because these movies mixed monsters with authentic occult ritual, so as &#39;to fly under the radar&#39;.  </p>

<p>He kept saying &#39;the aristocrats&#39;, &#39;the aristocrats&#39; and suddenly, it clicked.</p>

<p>Remember the comedy documentary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats_(film)">&quot;The Aristocrats&quot;</a>?  It was about a poor-taste joke whose setup was shocking, taboo behavior, involving</p>

<blockquote>
<p>incest, group sex, graphic violence, defecation, coprophilia, necrophilia, bestiality, child sexual abuse, and various other taboo behaviors.  The joke ends with the agent, shocked but often impressed, asking &quot;And what do you call the act?&quot; The punchline of the joke is then given: &quot;&#39;The Aristocrats&#39;&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The punchline was &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;.  Most people don&#39;t get it.  The joke is whisleblowing that that&#39;s what they are up to.  It&#39;s so shocking and unbelievable that you either laugh or fall silent like it&#39;s an inside joke and you&#39;re frozen out in an outgroup of the non-comprehending.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s not a joke.  It&#39;s a expose.  They say comedy is sometimes a collective means to acknowledge uncomfortable truths.</p>

<p>When I got older and realized who runs the world and what they&#39;re actually like in their private lives, the &quot;joke&quot; took on much greater, and far more chilling, resonance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was what?  Around the time of &#39;the secret&#39; and &#39;what the bleep?&#39;  Isnt&#39; that interesting.  It&#39;s like at that time gnostic was the new gay and trying to come out of the closet.  But didn&#39;t quite make it.  Or it&#39;s mockery and the extent of their control is mind blowing.  People don&#39;t even know what they are up against. You could show them a million pieces of evidence like a detective on a corkboard and they&#39;d be like, &#39;um this is a christian nation, and occult stuff is for goth weirdos in high school&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, that&#39;s the one.  I think anyone can tell it, but they probably have to understand what they are doing or else it doesn&#39;t work.  Namely, they have to have been to the movie producers&#39; mansion parties, then have been invited to do coke in the basement where the live rape-sacrifice of a captive child or something is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comedians love this joke because it&#39;s open ended and you can be as creative with it as you like. </p>

<p>It&#39;s capped off with the ridiculous juxtaposition of this totally disgusting act with the term aristocrats, which gives the impression that it contains a level of sophistication that obviously isn&#39;t in the material. It&#39;s a joke that gives you carte blanche to be disgusting, then ends with an absurdity. I really don&#39;t think there&#39;s more to it than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this was the origin. Then again, I&#39;m sure plenty of people have run with it more blindly, which is a double edged sword. On one hand, the plausible deniability just further helps to protect whistleblowers. On the other hand, that&#39;s because you don&#39;t always know whether an aristocrats joke is based on actual aristocrats, or just a new spin on an old joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be that only a few comedians were witness to the satanic pedo rituals of Dracula (michael bay, for example), but since the others were just going along it became a buffer of plausible deniability.  In other words its an inside-inside joke</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t seen the movie. But the joke could be misleading. I think it&#39;s a very gross joke. The humor was a bit too dark, and a potential tool to initiate comedians into a secret society.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like that I&#39;m a saint or something who won&#39;t do any of the dirty and perveted things. TBH I sometimes have crazy imaginations. Some of them quite bizarre.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying the joke is a little off.</p>
