       Thomas Sheridan discusses in
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAH4-gFIHvk&amp;ab_channel=ThomasSheridan">
        "Classic British Horror and Sci-Fi - Whistle Blowing on a Massive Scale"
       </a>
       how british sci fi and horror in the 50s-70s was an attempt to blow the whistle on aristocrats and black magic, similar to Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut", because these movies mixed monsters with authentic occult ritual, so as 'to fly under the radar'.
      </p>
      <p>
       He kept saying 'the aristocrats', 'the aristocrats' and suddenly, it clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the comedy documentary,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats_(film)">
        "The Aristocrats"
       </a>
       ?  It was about a poor-taste joke whose setup was shocking, taboo behavior, involving
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        incest, group sex, graphic violence, defecation, coprophilia, necrophilia, bestiality, child sexual abuse, and various other taboo behaviors.  The joke ends with the agent, shocked but often impressed, asking "And what do you call the act?" The punchline of the joke is then given: "'The Aristocrats'".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The punchline was "The Aristocrats".  Most people don't get it.  The joke is whisleblowing that that's what they are up to.  It's so shocking and unbelievable that you either laugh or fall silent like it's an inside joke and you're frozen out in an outgroup of the non-comprehending.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's because it's not a joke.  It's a expose.  They say comedy is sometimes a collective means to acknowledge uncomfortable truths.

       I'm glad to have read this. When I was younger, I never thought this joke was funny. I never understood why it was so legendary, why they made an entire movie about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I got older and realized who runs the world and what they're actually like in their private lives, the "joke" took on much greater, and far more chilling, resonance.

       This was what?  Around the time of 'the secret' and 'what the bleep?'  Isnt' that interesting.  It's like at that time gnostic was the new gay and trying to come out of the closet.  But didn't quite make it.  Or it's mockery and the extent of their control is mind blowing.  People don't even know what they are up against. You could show them a million pieces of evidence like a detective on a corkboard and they'd be like, 'um this is a christian nation, and occult stuff is for goth weirdos in high school"

       Yep, that's the one.  I think anyone can tell it, but they probably have to understand what they are doing or else it doesn't work.  Namely, they have to have been to the movie producers' mansion parties, then have been invited to do coke in the basement where the live rape-sacrifice of a captive child or something is happening.

       I think you have missed the point of why professional comedians tell this joke to one another when they get together &amp; why it is never told to a general audience.
Anyone who needs an explanation of this is unlikely to understand that explanation.

       Comedians love this joke because it's open ended and you can be as creative with it as you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's capped off with the ridiculous juxtaposition of this totally disgusting act with the term aristocrats, which gives the impression that it contains a level of sophistication that obviously isn't in the material. It's a joke that gives you carte blanche to be disgusting, then ends with an absurdity. I really don't think there's more to it than that.

       I thought the movie was funny and while I never really took interpretation of the joke as literal, this certainly adds a new level.

       I wouldn't be surprised if this was the origin. Then again, I'm sure plenty of people have run with it more blindly, which is a double edged sword. On one hand, the plausible deniability just further helps to protect whistleblowers. On the other hand, that's because you don't always know whether an aristocrats joke is based on actual aristocrats, or just a new spin on an old joke.

       It could be that only a few comedians were witness to the satanic pedo rituals of Dracula (michael bay, for example), but since the others were just going along it became a buffer of plausible deniability.  In other words its an inside-inside joke

       comedy is sometimes a collective means to acknowledge uncomfortable truths

       George Carlin was a master at this. He thumbed his nose at the NWO, and people laffed, probably in ignorance.

       Interesting interpretation. Never thought of that before.

       Haven't seen the movie. But the joke could be misleading. I think it's a very gross joke. The humor was a bit too dark, and a potential tool to initiate comedians into a secret society.

       It's not like that I'm a saint or something who won't do any of the dirty and perveted things. TBH I sometimes have crazy imaginations. Some of them quite bizarre.

       I'm just saying the joke is a little off.
