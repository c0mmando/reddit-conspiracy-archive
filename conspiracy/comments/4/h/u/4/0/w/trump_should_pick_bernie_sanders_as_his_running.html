    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what the Patriot Act covers. Considering Hillary and Trump both support it it&#39;s ok to leave it out of the picture when comparing the two. But as for evaluating the man himself, really all there is to it is his motive. His motive for supporting the Patriot Act is consistent and makes sense (it is purely to protect the American people), which are two traits that seem to be lacking in American politics. I&#39;m not downplaying the atrocities of the Patriot Act, but some people can support it and not be crooked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He said he wants to water-board but thinks we also need to go further than waterboarding.  And the Patriot Act says nothing about committing the war crime of intentionally targeting the family members of suspected terrorists for drone strikes.  Targeting a suspected terrorist without demonstrating guilt or evidence is one thing... targeting their family members is a whole different level of brutality.  That is a war crime.  Also there is nothing in the Patriot Act about opening up libel laws to stifle journalism.  That is just authoritarian self-interests that Trump dreamt up on his own because he was upset that the news was reporting stuff that he said that didn&#39;t sound good.  </p>

<p>All that being said, I still would prefer him over Hillary (as it appears those will be the options) because at least Trump is a Wild Card who might surprise me and not be terrible as compared to Hillary who I know is a piece of shit.  </p>

<p>There is absolutely no mention of death or drone strikes in his original quote, and he reiterated multiple times that he <em>did not</em> wish to kill the family members of terrorists. He said we need to go after them because they have information. We know he did not mean that we should kill them because he mentions how they have information. Instead, he wants to be able to interrogate (not torture) them and ask them questions because we all know they have information.</p>

<p>Your association that this is in his own self interest and he&#39;s just trying to make himself look good is unfounded and based only on the persona of him that the media has fed us. If you&#39;re going to stand here and contest the fact that the United States media is pure propoganda then I&#39;d like to suggest to you a different subreddit. But if you do agree that the media is propoganda, which many people here do agree, why would you be opposed to Trump&#39;s plan to end the lies that they perpetuate? And let it also be known that Trump specifically wants to make it easier to sue the media for blatantly false reports (these are the words from the man himself). That means it&#39;s easier for you and me to do it, not just Trump. So Trump would not have full control of this libel lawsuit, which means he is not enacting it for his own self interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is already libel laws in place for when the media knowingly lies.  Him wanting to &quot;open up the libel laws&quot; is a very clear slippery slope that can very well lead to stifling free speech everywhere.  It starts with Trump saying that a journalist lied about him (even unknowingly.. maybe a journalist reported something that a Trump staffer told him but it turns out to be unsubstantiated) and then that moves to libel laws being enforced on &quot;alternate news journalists&quot; who report stuff online that he decides is untrue, etc.  The libel laws are made the way they are for good reason.  You can&#39;t have a free press if the press is afraid of being sued or restricted by the government for reporting negatively about the people in power.</p>

<p>And that is very clearly in his own self interests.  He had no problem with libel laws when the National Enquirer was reporting that Ted Cruz cheated on his wife.  His campaign was tweeting links.  He had no problem with libel laws when he was saying that Obama wasn&#39;t born in America and he &quot;sent a team&quot; to Hawaii to dig up the truth (which he said they found bombshell information that never got released.. probably because it didn&#39;t exist).  He only gave a shit when the media reported shit that he said.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the disconnect you&#39;re having here is that Trump&#39;s proposed libel laws will allow and make it easier for <em>anyone</em> to use them, not just Trump or the government. I can&#39;t see how he could be doing it in his own self interest if he is enabling everyone to use it. What part of that is totalitarian? If anything, it&#39;s pushing us away from a totalitarian government because it&#39;s putting the power into the hands of the people (or really, the people who have the money to drop on a lawsuit). Sure, if only the government could do it then I would be totally opposed to it, because that&#39;s definitely on the verge of totalitarianism. But that&#39;s not Trump&#39;s proposal. Although, I highly doubt either of these proposals will pass congress ever.</p>

<p>Your worry that the press will be silenced in fear of being pressed by lawsuits is warranted though, but it&#39;s very hard to gauge how far the libel laws must go to reach this point. So far, with the amount of propoganda running about I believe the libel laws are too strict, but I guess this really boils down to where you lie on the political spectrum, which is a zone of debating that I do not want to get into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that Trump is saying ONLY he can use his libel laws.  I&#39;m saying that he had no interest or care about these laws until he got pissed that stuff he said was being used against him in the press.  When it was him making claims about Obama&#39;s birthplace without any substantiation he was taking advantage of the free press under our current laws which allow him to go on the news and say what he wants as an opinion.  Under new laws something like that may be restricted.  That is the problem.  He doesn&#39;t see a problem with the media until the media says shit about him.  He doesn&#39;t seem principled or genuine when he will tweet out National Enquirer stories (that are completely unsubstantiated) about Ted Cruz cheating on his wife but then say we need stricter libel laws when CNN runs a story where they literally show a clip of him saying something but he says it was out of context because if you ran the clip 10 seconds more it would make more sense.  We don&#39;t need to &quot;open up the libel laws.&quot;  That&#39;s the last thing we need.  </p>

<p>i.e. If you work for the state, you have full constitutional rights because the state is party to the constitution. Try exercising your rights at a private corporation in a right to hire state, actually don&#39;t... but you get the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Key words are &quot;he lives&quot;.
I mean I&#39;m quite surprised by this &quot;free thinking&quot; sub.
Let&#39;s see...</p>

<p>1) 99% of media outlets have done nothing but attack and miss quite him. (When this happened to Ron Paul, it was bullshit, now it&#39;s true?, double standard much?)</p>

<p>2) George Soros has spent a shit-ton on money fighting Trump, buying protesters etc.</p>

<p>3) Russians and Putin have backed up his foreign policy speech. (<a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech">https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-foreign-policy-speech</a>)</p>

<p>4) illegal immigration is costing America BILLIONS, while kids and vets are homeless on American streets.</p>

<p>5) He is sexist and racist. Look into his history, since the 80&#39;s he was one of the first to put women and other nationalities at the head of his projects, the man is not racist nor sexist, that&#39;s what the media wants you to think, which I find hilarious, because everyone here jumps up and calls bs on the media when they praise Hillary, but when they shit on Trump, &quot;ohh that be there truth there&quot;, mkay guys</p>

<p>There more, he said it best himself, &quot;I&#39;ve had a great life, I don&#39;t need this, I&#39;m doing this for you&quot;, now there&#39;s some bullshit in there, because obviously someone who feeds off power will always want more, but he is putting a big bullseye on himself by doing this, when TPTB are all opposed to him, he is not their puppet, he is American and a patriot. </p>

<p>Gore, not much to say except profited millions off of spreading his global warming campaign. </p>

<p>Bush, director of the CIA at one point, huge connections to Iran/Contra... which would at least later be ran out of Mena, Arkansas. Who was the governor of that state again?</p>

<p>Cheney, profited to the tune of billions along with Condi Rice and Donny Rumsfield under their Project for a New American century which would lead to a new war in the middle east. Who owned major shares in groups like Blackwater and Haliburton again?</p>

<p>Biden... he&#39;s just impeachment/assassination insurance imo. </p>

<p>Considering what he has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/48ep6a/sticky_request_a_compilation_of_donald_trumps/">done for the average American</a>, yes. <a href="https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/donald-trump">Look at his donations page.</a> <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/01/flashback-trump-saved-ny-veterans-day-parade/">Look at how he saved the Veteran&#39;s Day parade.</a> <a href="http://www.hngn.com/articles/121978/20150822/trump-sent-marine-jailed-mexico-25-000-check-obama-ignored.htm">See how he gave this American who was incarcerated in Mexico $25,000 to get back on his feet.</a></p>

<p>Now I know you may be thinking, &quot;anyone can donate and give if they have billions just to look good/get more votes&quot;. But ask yourself why you haven&#39;t heard of these acts of kindness until now. It&#39;s because nobody in the media or in the presidential race, not even Trump, is talking about them. You&#39;d think if he did all these things just to get people to like him that he would talk about them more often. Instead, they flew under the radar and Trump most likely forgot about them by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone please explain to me why posts that encourage one political candidate over another even appear on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  Im not saying the mods should remove or censor them, my mind is just boggled that there are people on this sub that still hold out any hope that candidates matter, that the process isnt completely rigged and that their vote actually matters.</p>

<p>Rise above politics.  Rise above needing someone to fight for you, solve your problems and do the dirty work of making the world a better place.  Do that yourself.  Live in such a way that government matters very little to you.  I think worrying about politics attracts negativity and negative energy.  It creates anger and worry.  Free yourself from such negative things.  Does the light care about the dark?  Be the light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like the discussion has fizzled out here. Anyway, If Trump picks someone that makes the GOP uncomfortable delegates will give him a hard time at the convention. On top of that Bernie would have to accept in order to become Trump&#39;s VP. That wouldn&#39;t happen either. So Trump will pick a well respected moderate that strikes good balance between his agenda and the GOP agenda. A moderate enough VP would help him gain fringe dem support. The establishment would prefer Cruz or Rubio be the VP, but I don&#39;t think Rubio would help Trump much (after Trump trashed him so badly) and Cruz isn&#39;t interested (yet). I am a liberal, and I don&#39;t remember how I got here, but I&#39;m glad I came for a visit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see you are emotionally triggered by Trump, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that. But let me ask you this:
what if he did accomplish many good things and was overall liked after a couple of years? Hypothetically, would you still think he is a joke? Also, don&#39;t you think Hillary is a joke? I pay you the respect of assuming you&#39;ve done your homework and know her background and some of the corrupt deals she has been involved in.</p>

<p>If you made me choose between Hillary and Trump I would choose the silent 3rd option to not vote, because they are equally terrifying presidential candidates for different but equally valid reasons.</p>

<p>There is no option but Bernie to me. Which, given the DNC&#39;s actions recently, makes it seem like there is no option for me sadly.</p>

<p>But fuck it, I&#39;ll bite. In a hypothetical situation in which Trump becomes the president and somehow against ALL ODDS does not do a horrible job, then I would have to treat him the way I treat all people whom I have judged wrongly (in this purely hypothetical and EXTREMELY factually unlikely situation)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask a valueless question, get a snarky answer.</p>

<p>If you support Trump, you are either stupid enough to believe he can fight the united nations and make mexico build a useless wall, or you are so tired of politics as usual that you are willing to take an EXTREME risk by voting for him.</p>

<p>I can understand frustration with the status quo, why else would you be here?</p>

<p>But to vote for someone who is so clearly unqualified and says such ridiculous things is just crazy.</p>

<p>Nevermind the fact that he has been a friend to the Clinton dynasty since they were still in Arkansas.</p>

<p>Edit: to be clear, I have known since day 1 that Bernie&#39;s chances were slim-to-none considering corruption outnumbers justice in America and he is openly against the corruption. I support him because he is the best candidate I&#39;ve seen in a very long time, but on alt accounts I always said he would get pushed out by the money machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was planning on voting for Sanders from last July until last month... he was my bet. But I see now that he is a weak candidate, and would never possess the ability to unite the parties and be the leader we need. He appears to be a wonderful person, and I admire him for not taking any money from super pacs or wall street, but he is done for at this point.</p>

<p>I agree that Trump is an extreme risk, but he is a risk I am willing to take in order to avoid electing Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard it argued that while he considers himself conservative, Trump has no skin the the whole &quot;wall street Super Pac&quot; game because he is a billionaire already and doesn&#39;t <em>really need</em> their support (even though he does take campaign donations). If it&#39;s true that he says what he wants and will do what he pleases, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he decided to take some liberal positions in the long run. I don&#39;t expect Trump to do everything 100% conservative and ultra right wing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is already libel laws in place for when the media knowingly lies.  Him wanting to &quot;open up the libel laws&quot; is a very clear slippery slope that can very well lead to stifling free speech everywhere.  It starts with Trump saying that a journalist lied about him (even unknowingly.. maybe a journalist reported something that a Trump staffer told him but it turns out to be unsubstantiated) and then that moves to libel laws being enforced on &quot;alternate news journalists&quot; who report stuff online that he decides is untrue, etc.  The libel laws are made the way they are for good reason.  You can&#39;t have a free press if the press is afraid of being sued or restricted by the government for reporting negatively about the people in power.</p>

<p>And that is very clearly in his own self interests.  He had no problem with libel laws when the National Enquirer was reporting that Ted Cruz cheated on his wife.  His campaign was tweeting links.  He had no problem with libel laws when he was saying that Obama wasn&#39;t born in America and he &quot;sent a team&quot; to Hawaii to dig up the truth (which he said they found bombshell information that never got released.. probably because it didn&#39;t exist).  He only gave a shit when the media reported shit that he said.  </p>
