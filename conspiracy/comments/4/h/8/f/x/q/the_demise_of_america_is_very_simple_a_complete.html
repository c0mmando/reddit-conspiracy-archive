        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">87</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-05-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/yardley7.html">yardley7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>hen Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act, a completely Unconstitutional piece of legislation that gives a very small group of people an exclusive monopoly on printing/creating/lending the all the money into the money supply, since all the money in it comes from borrowing it from this very small group of individuals who happen to be Jews loyal to Israel.</p>

<p>This small group then used the fake-worth paper money being paid back to them with interest to expand worldwide by creating other more of their central banks in every other country in the world, and also to buy all the things of real wealth like gold, because they knew that their fake-worth money would eventually be seen for what it really is, basically toilet paper, and then the People would demand a backed currency, and they would try to trick the People into accepting a gold backed currency, where they own all the gold. </p>

<p>If the money was backed by gold, these International Oligarchs would still have complete control over all the money, because if a currency is being backed by gold then really the gold is the actual money, and the International Oligarchs own almost all the gold there is. Other countries have some of it, but 90% is owned by the International Oligarchs.</p>

<p>Never use a gold backed paper money since such a money supply would be completely owned and controlled by the International Oligarchs, just the same as the current money supply is owned and controlled by the International Oligarchs right now.</p>

<p>It is time to take the printing/creating/lending of fiat money back to Congress so that the government can lend it to banks and use the interest to pay for infrastructure and social security, and this would be debt free because the government would be printing/creating it NOT borrowing it from the International Oligarchs. This government money would be backed by the Power Of The Work Of The People, which means that since the money is legal tender for the payment of work, it has worth. There is no need to back it with gold.</p>

<p>Some regular people, like Ron Paul, want gold to back the money because they have some gold and think that they will become rich if that happens, however, if the money were to be gold backed that would be the continued demise of America, because the International Oligarchs would STILL own and control the entire money supply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you propose we go about doing these things, Captain?  We all know that drastic changes need to happen in America, and the world, but the problem lies with getting traction.  We need to wake the people up.  Sure, the 1% have all of the power and the weapons, but we have the population to take them down...even if it&#39;s only 10 million (that&#39;s a low number, we could probably rise at a number of 50 million if we really wanted to).  We need motivation...and I&#39;m afraid it will take a economic depression to do just that.  Perhaps we will look up from our iphones when we hear reality knocking on our doorsteps.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, while I don&#39;t forgive Woodrow Wilson, he wrote the following in a letter:</p>

<p>“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and vote of majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.”</p>

<ul>
<li>President Woodrow Wilson (regretting signing into law the Federal Reserve Act)</li>
</ul>

<p>You are right about a few other things, but you misunderstand how currency works, especially the differences between asset-backed and fiat currencies.</p>

<p>If you have a gold-backed currency, you own that value of gold the currency denomination represents. Having a gold-backed currency was the biggest obstacle to government borrowing and spending, or in other words, fiat currency allows <strong>debt</strong> to be taken on far more easily. [In fact we ended Bretton Woods because of the spending we did in Vietnam and on Johnson&#39;s Great Society...as our debt grew, other countries which held dollars wanted to exchange them for the fixed amount of gold BW allowed as they became concerned that the debt would devalue the dollar...in a panic, Nixon closed the Gold Window in 1971, taking us off of a form of a gold standard for the first time....inflation ensued until the prtrodollar was born.]</p>

<p>The oligarchs own us because they own our debt. Why do you think Rothschild wanted control of the currency?...and not merely be the richest man through ownership of all the gold??? Because he could manipulate the value of that currency—the first step of which is removing a strict gold-backed currency. If you are saying, &quot;but he can manipulate the value of gold&quot;, you are right, but it&#39;s much more difficult and takes much longer doing it that way, and the currency will never be worthless.</p>

<p>Why do you think things are so bad right now that they have to institute negative interest rates? It&#39;s because the U.S. can longer borrow any more (through QE, i.e., the creation of debt), and debt increases money supply and money velocity, and should create growth, but if it doesn&#39;t, you merely have the illusion of a healthy economy.  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want saving (saying decreases money velocity)...they want spending and more debt.  As said, this will also keep the illusion of a healthy economy continuing.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t <em>need</em> gold backed currency, but it should be tied in some way to something of recognized value, so the institution that is printing it will not print it to prop up the economy. This prevents inflation and manipulation by the banks or by a corrupt government. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I wanted to add that an the alternative to asset-backed currency is bitcoin and similar digital currencies. In this case, their value depends on their own supply, and on the demand for them as mediums of exchange. In other words, since bitcoin has a finite supply and people are willing to use them to exchange for goods, they are given a value by its users, and that value cannot be changed through manipulation of its supply.</p>

<p>Jefferson&#39;s comments:</p>

<p>&quot;If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can babble on and preach all you want, but is it going to stop? Absolutely not. </p>

<p>You wanna talk about real, vilified power and how much the Fed is running over us all the time and everyone whines about it day in and day out but no one will EVER do anything about it at this point. They&#39;ve already won, just come to accept it. </p>

<p>And even if someone DID do something about it, what is the alternative? The monetary system pre-Fed wasn&#39;t really all that stable and if we went back to bartering those that have nothing to call their own would probably become indentured servants BUT OH WAIT human rights laws and what not, can&#39;t do that! </p>

<p>And why does backing a currency by gold even matter at this point? </p>

<p>What&#39;s so special about? Seriously? Can anyone explain that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree.  Look at who is making decisions now for example.  Brainard is on almost all the fed reserve committees, and she has a PhD in economics from Harvard, was a professor for a while, has represented the USA in the G-20, blah blah.  A really superbly intelligent and thoughtful human being, who has been doing nothing but economics for her entire adult life.  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/brainard.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/brainard.htm</a></p>

<p>Now look at one of my personal Congressman.  Someone who has never had a sniff of Ivy League level education or practice, a lawyer who owned a practice in a backwater before becoming a politician  (<a href="https://labrador.house.gov/biography/">https://labrador.house.gov/biography/</a>), and is now paid for and owned by lawyers, ranchers, and the finance industry  <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00031377&amp;amp;cycle=2016#cont">https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00031377&amp;amp;cycle=2016#cont</a>.</p>

<p>Who do I want to be in charge of America&#39;s financial future?  I&#39;ll give you ONE guess.</p>

<p>Besides which, I have a feeling you have more a problem with the practices of the MEMBER banks, which do not have the stringent non-profit, good-for-the-many regulations put on the reserve and the RESERVE banks.  Like, it was INVESTMENT banks that f**ked us in the recession.  For example, look at the Lehman Bros history - the federal reserve isn&#39;t mentioned once in that mess.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers#Under_the_Lehman_family_.281850.E2.80.931969.29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers#Under_the_Lehman_family_.281850.E2.80.931969.29</a></p>

<p>I think what would make more of a difference in improving our lot is not to repeal the federal reserve, but to beef up and make more powerful and well-financed the SEC and other consumer protection agencies.  Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one who is mistaken. 1913 is the year we let a foreign entity take over the governments ability to create currency for its own nation. At that exact day in history, we went from sovereign citizens to debt slaves. From masters of our own domain to laborers working off a literally insurmountable debt. This has nothing to do with which bank, it has to do with the Federal Reserve currency, the minute a dollar is printed off the press, another x dollars is owed. X happens to be bigger than the amount of money ever created though, which means it is literally impossible to ever not be in debt. This makes us slaves, forever working off our debt. It is the original sin of our country, and one we will never outgrow until we rid ourselves of our financial overlords. They need to be hung from the rafters. You need to read some more about the federal reserve. It was a conspiracy from the very start, quite possibly the most sinister conspiracy ever hatched. The Warburgs, Morgans, Rockefellers and the other magnates surreptitiously met, using aliases, and schemed to take over the United States by implementing a central bank, and that they did. G. Edward Griffin talks about it in the creature from Jekyll Island</p>

<p>edit: Your question inspired me to refresh myself on the history of Andrew Jackson. I came across this video which goes discusses the historical significance of Andrew Jackson&#39;s fight against the Central banks. Jackson&#39;s resilience against the central bankers alone allowed the United States to be free from the plague of central banking at least until 1913. He was truly an inspirational and heroic American figure, and this gives us some really discerning insight as to why he is being taken off the 20 dollar bill, and swapped for an abolitionist. They do not want you to know of Jackson and how he alone fought off the bankers. They don&#39;t want you to know he was heroic, and even survived several assassination attempts. That is why he is being replaced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re going to give power over putting money into circulation into the hands of CONGRESS?  I may not understand the federal reserve system, but I don&#39;t see how you&#39;ll improve on what we have.</p>

<p>I think I became a debt slave by going to college and getting an education I couldn&#39;t afford.  Then I got sick and couldn&#39;t afford my treatment.  I&#39;ve received a bunch of goods and services I just couldn&#39;t afford.  That&#39;s the long and short of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to understand, the Federal Reserve is literally a foreign entity -- it is akin to giving access to your military weaponry to another nation, a nation with a history of malevolent intent towards you. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re being sarcastic, but our forefathers designed a very delicate balance of powers. Any funds that were required by the state were to be acquired through taxation. The IRS did not exist, and neither did the income tax. The IRS is the army of a foreign nation as well, there is no article in the constitution that calls for it, and it is an illegal entity. In this sense, the people were supposed to have control over their debt by voting, but in 1913 the bankers swindled the people by installing the Federal reserve bank, which although sounds like it is the bank of America, is really a foreign entity. I cannot stress that enough. The federal reserve cannot be audited, you cannot elect the members of the federal reserve, they are accountable to no one. The president himself could not control them, in fact, they control the president on any important matters.  </p>

<p>And did you even bother watching the video?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK - I&#39;ll watch the video and get back to you.  But the members of the federal reserve board are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate, and we vote for those jack-offs.  It may be &quot;foreign&quot; in some sense, but not in the sense of not American.  I don&#39;t know about controlling the president, other than he and congress may defer to their opinions because they don&#39;t want to crash the economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  I tried to watch the video.  If you come up with a good way of running a country, fighting umpteenth wars, without privatizing EVERYTHING and handing over EVERYTHING to greed, the profit motive and non-human human status corporations, ALL without running a debt, you put it on here.  Then I&#39;ll listen to you.</p>
