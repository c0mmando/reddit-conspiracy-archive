       Infowars is disinfo (real info mixed with lies). ATS is almost as bad as Reddit in terms of shills. I like and trust the Corbett Report, but you have to pay in order to post on the discussion boards. I also think globalresearch.ca and lastamericanvagabond are pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also recently been frequenting cluesforum.info. Lots of good content, and they have a virtual handshake and introduction policy for new members that (hopefully) helps to cut down on shills. But their focus is on media hoaxes and fakery -- of which there is plenty!!

       Well disinfo is truth mixed with lies, so it's redundant to mix disinfo with lies. The point about disinfo is that there is some truth to it, but there is also misdirection. Of course people can 'just be wrong' so just because I disagree with them doesn't mean they're deliberately attempting to misdirect me. As much as it's hard to tease apart the truth from the lies, it's hard to tell when someone is lying or just mistaken. And of course it's all subjective as one man's truth is another man's un-truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have time to go through and find something specific that stands out as a lie or a clear example of misdirection. One clue that he is disinfo is that he is
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">
        immensely popular and well known.
       </a>
       Another is that he is a fear-monger. Anybody who is trying to make you afraid like he does is 99.9% trying to control you in one way or another. They want us using our lizard brains, not our higher consciousness. And of course he makes money off of his fear-mongering by selling you stuff to help you feel protected. Maybe not a sign of disinfo, but kind of sleazy IMO. Probably the clearest sign that he is disinfo is that infowars links to mainstream science stories without further comment or attempt to despin them. Well I've got news for you, mainstream science is as much propaganda as any of the other media garbage they try to shovel into our gaping maws.

       I don't regularly watch Infowars. This is mainly because Alex Jones' religion and those beliefs which follow occasionally get mixed in with his diatribes. No offense intended to anyone reading, but its not always easy to listen to someone who you expect to be utilizing their capacity for critical thinking (i.e., hypothesizing/theorizing on the unknown which is a significant part of being a conspiracy theorist) while at the same time believing in an all-knowing entity that watches over, cares about and/or is displeased with certain behaviors of ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I have watched many Infowars interviews or came across a YouTube video on some specific topic I was seeking and found 99% of what I saw well reasoned, or at least in line with the general consensus of others I trust who similarly discuss "conspiracy topics". I am yet to be convinced that Alex Jones is controlled opposition or deliberate disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from hearing claims that AJ is disinfo, I have heard almost equally as frequently that he's a "shill for Israel". This too smacks of "seeing what you want (or expect) to see", or, a form of confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       On this last point, it's interesting to note that Jones recently did some videos (posted in this sub) where he slammed the ADL and the SJWs who defend the Jews... I think this takes credibility away from the belief/theory that Jones is simply an Israeli shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt however that many members/commenters on Infowars are shills. That follows logically. If he were disinfo, why would the government/deep state/establishment need to send shills his way?

       everyone is always saying "jones is disinfo" "jones is a shill" "jones is jewish" "jones is CIA".
      </p>
      <p>
       the guy has been exposing shit for how many years. one would think if "they" wanted to discredit him, why not push a bunch of bullshit about him being a shill and what not. seems like anyone today who tries to come out and tell the truth is automatically labeled a shill and disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       like the common "snowden is a shill, it was all a psy-op to make people be scared to question the government and be scared on the phone/internet"
      </p>
      <p>
       no, he was a fucking guy who saw what kind of illegal shit was going on and decided to open his mouth about it. he had the courage to do what most people wouldnt dare. just because jones doesnt loudly declare "ITS THE JEWS!!!!!!", hes a shill and disinfo. although i have to hand it to the government, the most commercial and arguably most popular conspiracy theorist today is now branded a "disinfo agent" doing "psy-ops" for the government. like come on people, i thought people in the conspiracy movement were smarter than this.

       It's one of following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They don't know what they are talking about, and they are parrotting what others are saying based on very flimsy evidence.
       </li>
       <li>
        They are themselves covert anticonspiracy people shilling on reddit, not so much to discredit Infowars but to cause people to doubt everything they think they know.
       </li>
       <li>
        They dislike a position Jones has, or believe Jones doesn't support or represent their view enough and therefore he's a shill.  For example, some are rabidly anti-Israel / anti-Jews and if infowars says something sympathetic then 'oh my gosh' they are totally shills.  It's not possible Jones is trying to keep from being pidgeonholed as an antisemite, having read-the-room of our cultures heightened sensitivity to such a label.
       </li>
       <li>
        Jones is Bill Hicks.  Rush Limbaugh is Jim Morrison, ....
       </li>
       <li>
        Because of Jones' histrionics, especially when interviewed on MSM, then his behavior serves to discredit conspiracy theorists with his behavior, therefore he's a shill and not just an angry adult-teenager radio personality
       </li>
       <li>
        He badgers some callers and therefore he's a shill
       </li>

       yupp, you nailed it exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most common one i have been seeing lately is "he knows its the jews but wont say it, therefore hes a shill and disinfo"
      </p>
      <p>
       like you said
       <strong>

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       thats exactly what it is. i think 90% of the jones haters are the disinfo psy-op shills they claim jones to be. and the other 10% just follow along because someone else said it first.
      </p>
      <p>
       the government does a great job of confusing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       another common theme is "hes just worried about profiting from selling his snake oil" and all that bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       running an operation similar to what jones does is NOT cheap, it takes a lot of money to do that. people suspect because he doesnt fund his whole operation out of his own pocket, therefore hes a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       i really thought people were smarter than this.

       His ads are like 5% of his content.  I can deal with that.  Especially since watching regular tv it's more like 40% ads.  Also, some of his stuff is interesting, and other things are just high cost (but high quality) herbs

       you can do a lot better, he's like a disney version of conspiracy news -  if you just kinda want to sit on the edge and get your toes in it but not really get wet. he'll go topical places but not really take you to the most interesting parts, also he does a lot of fear mongering about stuff that really does not come to fruition. you could do better to go to more genuine sources -- get much less of the fear mongering and more of the enlightening information/ I do think he's cia. he's there to give the slightly conspiracy curious a safe place to do their research . (safe as far as the ptb are concerned) you only suspect what they are comfortable with you suspecting there. -- you could do much better.

       I know I am going to get attacked for this but anybody who has spent hundreds if not thousands of hours going down the rabbit hole, and realized that literally our entire fucking existence is a conspiracy...well let's just say you won't write this site off at that point. If you are not fully awaken, you will prob roll your eyes with how out there it seems. In reality, probably one of the most truthful EVER. I'm assuming that's why it gets attacked so hard.

       ATS, its been slated a lot in this thread a lot but some of the forums, such as the disease and pandemics and fragile Earth ones can be very interesting indeed. The "new" filter is also useful during a major incident, I often find the rolling threads far more interesting than the rolling news coverage on terrestrial tv. Disclose TV has some interesting videos  and vigilent citizen is good for subliminal messages in pop culture. The Fortean times forum is great although some of the threads are a bit old now and it only has a few active members so it doesn't get updated that much, but it's great for general forteana and cryptozoology. For mainstream news, I like watching RT and Al jazzera England. I do switch between sky news and these channels during an incident as I like comparing the information that comes out. Generally Sky news only puts out the information it finds relevant and in some cases (like the Anonymous rioting that happens in London every year against parliament) doesn't report on things at all.
