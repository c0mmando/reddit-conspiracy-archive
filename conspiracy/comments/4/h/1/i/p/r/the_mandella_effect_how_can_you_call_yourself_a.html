        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The concept itself is not Sci-fi, so don&#39;t even bother<br/>
And i&#39;m not your educator. 
Just want to get those 2 things out in the Ether.</p>

<p><a href="http://mandelaeffect.com/">http://mandelaeffect.com/</a></p>

<p>We should all  be coming to the conclusion of truth because we, ourselves, came to that conclusion. Not because i have to present you with all the facts to wrap your head around it. Known quantum mechanics can theoretically create a reality that would account for all the things we are going to be discussing here. Do not come at me with your weak arguments unless your ready to show me scientifically how that could not be. I&#39;m not claiming to understand in the slightest how/why this is happening. But it is happening.  If you haven&#39;t accepted easy to grasp things like 9/11 or JFK yet, this will be over your head in almost every way possible (I&#39;m not being condescending, just realistic), and be entirely too far out of your perception/world view to entertain the idea to start IMO. Not to be rude, but to those of you, you opinions don&#39;t matter much to me seeing that you would still be believing the government sanctioned fairy tales.</p>

<p>I am being serious when i say to all my critical thinkers out there in search for truth, do not write this off without spending a few hours going full on down the rabbit hole. I did the same myself over the past year when i would stumble on things about it. You have no idea how deep this one goes my friend, and what life altering effects it will have on your perception and beliefs of the world. The person who says they got it all figured out, is the dumbest person in the room. None of us became awakened without having to swallow some really crazy shit before we really accepted it as incontrovertible truth. I have yet to meet anyone who is not a shill, or is just not far enough into living in the land of truth and facts that does not have their mind blown in every way possible. If you fall into those 2 requirements, i would seriously love to hear your thoughts on why this is not happening. So you waste a couple hours to find out i&#39;m full of shit, so what? Those 3 hours you lost out trolling Facebook or watching the mindless propaganda on the God box (TV) is such a loss to your enrichment? Worst case scenario, you can say you researched it and your comfortable that it&#39;s a bunch of delusional quacks feeding off each others mass delusions. Well hey, that&#39;s better than when you had no idea one way or the other right? If you are as awake as you think you are, i can guarantee that wont be the conclusion you&#39;ll come to.</p>

<p><strong>For anyone 30 and under</strong>, you may not have been alive before these changes occurred. Please do not berate others, or feel you know best and &quot;how could these people possibly be so stupid&quot;, when your not even old enough to have had a memory of what something may have been like before the change.</p>

<p>I would like to hear some thought out views on this phenomenon, preferably on a deeper level than just the most well known &quot;Berenstein&quot; example. Here&#39;s some to give you an idea of what we are talking about here...</p>

<p>Did you know that in Snow White, the queen has always said &quot;Magic mirror&quot;? - Could have swore it was mirror, mirror....</p>

<p>Did you know that we mass hallucinated the most famous movie line in history? In Star Wars, apparently it is &quot;No, I am your father&quot;....could have swore that one was &quot;Luke, i am your father&quot;. Oh what does my stupid brain know, CNN tells me what to think!</p>

<p>How about Mr Rogers Neighborhood? My ingrained memory of watching that show daily for years is just so corrupted! My dumb ass thought they said &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful day in THE neighborhood.&quot; Oh you too? Nope, your an idiot too. It&#39;s always been &quot;THIS neighborhood&quot;.</p>

<p>But the kicker is, how is every tangible physical piece of evidence like movie covers, or books, all retroactively altered when for example, they have all sat in our attic undisturbed for 20 years?</p>

<p>These are just easy examples that most people can be exposed to, and have their interest piqued very quickly into looking into the subject more. There is information out there showing this goes from all the way from those well known examples i mentioned, all the way to entire land masses/islands moving, entire towns noticing a house is no longer where it used to sit, and even &quot;lost years&quot; of time! Why do some of us know in our soul that what we see now is not what once was, yet others are convinced in their soul that the current iteration is and always was? I don&#39;t believe either group is wrong. I think to each group, that was the reality of the time line they experienced. But how do we live in one now with two conflicting recollections?</p>

<p>Something is afoot my friends. What is happening on our planet to cause changes in the fabric of space and time, that also retroactively align history with the present reality? If all this is new to you, and you have a mid to advanced level of understanding of Science and specifically, quantum physics, i highly recommend &quot;The Holographic Disclosure&quot; (has nothing to do with &quot;holographs&quot; a.k.a projections of an image into 3D space), to get you familiar with some of the broad ideas and concepts that may be at play here. </p>

<p>The shills are not going to convince me, and do not let them convince you, that our own mind and thoughts are just some sort of quirk of the brains ability to remember certain syllables and grammatical spelling. That&#39;s a straw man bullshit explanation that I nor you should accept from strangers on the internet.</p>

<p>Sorry for being so long winded, i just can&#39;t stop thinking about this today and would love to hear some other CRITICAL THINKERS&#39; opinion on this subject. I expect this to become downvoted into oblivion as quick as they can do it nowadays, but i do have hope a few of you will see this.  If anyone wants to get super serious in discussion, please private message me for both our personal safety and well-being. If even one of you has now become exposed to the insanity of this, i feel my epic rant was well worth it. Peace my friends.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR: I don&#39;t believe people should be using shortcut when searching for truth</strong>. Maybe this topic just isn&#39;t for you right now then, make a mental bookmark and come back to this subject later after you have learned more :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was sitting in a waiting room the other day and a girl asked where the bathroom was.  She was told there was a code to get in, something like 5237.  5 minutes later another girl needed to go to the restroom and asked someone if they remembered what the code was and she was told 5273.  For whatever reason the brain is not designed to remember everything identically.  I tend to think that it is because this place would not change at all if everyone thought identically.  These instances of &quot;misremembering&quot; could very easily be our minds filling in voids the way we thought they should be instead of the way they actually are.  For example how often do you catch yourself singing along to a song you think you know really well but then sing the wrong lyric?  It happens to people all the time.  The &quot;Luke I am your father&quot; has been engrained into all of our heads by tommy boy not Star Wars.  Bernstein bears is because we&#39;re exposed to names with &quot;stein&quot; in it all the time, I can&#39;t remember meeting  anyone with &quot;stain&quot; in their names.  If you view the mind as an independent space time entity you are absolutely right, in that it has changed because you have encountered your assumptions to be false just like when I found out 9/11 was an inside job.  It wasn&#39;t just planes that brought those towers down.  When I learned about wtc7 it restructured the physical neurological connections in my mind changing my understanding of space and time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the post, but it&#39;s a very weak argument in the face of millions, if not 10&#39;s of millions of people that, to say your just remembering wrong. It&#39;s downright offensive really. That explanation is some coincidence theory level stuff because you really have to believe that many people could be mistaken on ALL the same thing vs something like the LHC causing a ripple or something in the fabric of space time. It&#39;s crazy but the second explanation is a lot more believable IMO.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see anyone walking around saying they remember McDonalds being spelled different, or that the sky used to  be green.</p>

<p>Almost everyone agrees about the exact same things being changed. So that&#39;s that as far as that argument goes. How do you account for people speaking different languages where the words process different in their brain, yet they will remember the same things us English speakers do? Have i proven how weak this is yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might just be that we all tend to make the same kind of mistakes is all I&#39;m saying.  We all are very closely related genetically and we may be programmed to do the same things, even when they&#39;re wrong.  That is why the masses follow complete tools who don&#39;t have their best interests at heart.  People believe lies more easily than they believe truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mother was a kindergarten teacher for years and years. She definitely remembers Berenstain. 
You really think the LHC collider is to blame for a few things being remembered incorrectly? Surely it would have changed some other stuff too. You know what? Maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe all the grammar nazis on Reddit are from a different universe and the rest are just remembering their own universe&#39;s pragmatics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not I have looked. Simply having a different opinion doesn&#39;t mean ignorance. I specifically remember being surprised by the spelling of Berenstain when I visited my mother in her classroom  years ago. I remember thinking that I had always thought it was -stein as well when I picked up a book. However, this was over ten years ago. So when exactly did this shift happen? And what about the actual -stain family members? Are they just playing along?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess so. Because I still don&#39;t have any idea what you&#39;re trying to say. And yes I downvote comments that claim my ignorance, include an unneeded meme, and/or call me obtuse. I really would like to discuss this intelligently. But not with this guy anymore. I actually would like to talk about the picture of Henry the VIII holding a turkey leg that doesn&#39;t exist. I seem to remember that for some reason. So if you&#39;re reading this, and not putin_rapes_cats, and would like to discuss then hit me. </p>

<p>Also now I&#39;m being acute.

    <div class="md"><p>Something definitely that changed our reality. I read something in reference to this a while back that stated that in this system we are unable to view our own destruction. They went on to add that something big must have happened for such a large group to have diverged from our original timeline.
 I personally have earlier recollections of large historical events happening at different dates ( years earlier than Wikipedia says they are now) so I&#39;m already familiar with the feeling that something isn&#39;t the same about my universe. If anything I&#39;ve just sort of learned not to trust my perceptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. Ive read a lot about it, because:</p>

<p>1- I think 9/11, on some level, was an occult ritual. </p>

<p>2- I had a near-death car accident where the vehicle was utterly totaled and the windshield shattered into my face and I walked away completely unscathed. It was &quot;a miracle,&quot; one of the people who stopped to see if I was alright said. </p>

<p>3- Shit everywhere is just getting too weird.</p>

<p>That said, not every &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; resonates with me. It was always &quot;Interview with THE Vampire,&quot; it was always, &quot;No, I am your father.&quot; In the Prince song, it was always &quot;Afterworld,&quot; not &quot;afterlife.&quot; Reba McEntire/McIntire, I don&#39;t remember.</p>

<p>But the Depend adult diapers thing gets me. The Berenstain Bears. A couple others. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not dismissing it. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m buying it, but I don&#39;t throw it out like rotting meat either. But &quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Interview,&quot; etc., those reference points are correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are bad at remembering things. And when you activate a memory but in a different (or incorrect) way you can change it. Your memory is resaved differently everytime you think of it.</p>

<p>You have heard people say Luke i am your father, because it is a pop culture line. It was never in the movie.</p>

<p>Luke always said &quot;you killed my father&quot; and then Vader said &quot;no I am your father.&quot;</p>

<p>The one that really gets me is I swear Mandela died in prison....but then again I never did give 2 fucks about Africa in social studies....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Mandela Effect will be studied by psychologists in the future. </p>

<p>Not because its real, but because it is amazing what people will make up rather than admit they are wrong.</p>

<p>Edit: It is well known that a memory is resaved differently everytime it is recalled. Sorry not sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shit is almost as bad as flat earth. Question: Do you believe that different timelines converged through the magic of &quot;quantum mechanics?&quot;</p>

<p>I have a unique memory about the Berenstain Bears. My family had a Berenstain Bear book that I read. When we went to ValleyFair amusement park (they have a Berenstain Bear section,) I remember asking my mom why it was called Berenstain and not Berenstein. This was probably 25 years ago.</p>

<p>In a related post someone mentioned they thought Louie Anderson was dead. I also thought this, I think I heard it on the radio. He went to the hospital in 2003 (from USA Today) and then was out of the public eye for so long people assume he is dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Keep posting this. Honestly, I&#39;m done with Reddit after this election season. Time to move on and do it bigger than Reddit. It&#39;s insane to see how Reddit has shifted over the past 5 years. Even more so over the past 2 years</p>
