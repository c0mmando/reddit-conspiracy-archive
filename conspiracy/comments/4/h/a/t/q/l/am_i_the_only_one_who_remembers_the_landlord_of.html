       I seem to recall that, immediately after the San Bernadino attack, reporters showed up at their apartment and convinced their landlord to open the boarded up door, which he inexplicably did.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should have been an active crime scene, shouldn't it have? Shouldn't there have been bomb squad guys there, securing the area, before countless police and feds started crawling all over the area with fine toothed combs?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reporters barged in and started filming their personal items and likely touching things and contaminating the crime scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, after all this, I don't remember there ever being any acknowledgment of this incident, no follow up report about how the landlord and reporters had been charged with many serious crimes. Just nothing. A black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody want to discuss this, and similar incidents?

       I've never seen the F.B.I. hand over a crime scene that quick with that much possible evidence.You're right to think it very odd,along with a large majority of people who watched it unfold on live tv.

       This is just to try to solidify the muslim connection which is a crafted narrative. The apartment was not a crime scene. The muslim couple are patsies. Who benefits? The joos.

       I will never forget that. Never has that happened its bullshit to say the scene was clear. A "terrorist" attack had happened 2 days and they were done with it? Unheard of in this day and age.

        The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said at a news conference in Washington that he had seen the video of the reporters in the townhouse. “I think I’m neither unhappy nor happy,” he said. “When we are done with a location, we return it to their rightful owners and we have to leave an inventory under the law about what was taken. So, people got to see our great criminal justice system in action.”

       The FBI were done with a crime scene without inspecting recently shredded documents that were in the apartment? Despite the fact it was a terrorist attack and they always look for other members / other plots?
      </p>

       Ignoring anything else (like conflicting eye witness reports - which are common) that makes no fucking sense and is incredibly suspicious

       They shredded the evidence. They were the shooters. 3 large athletic males. False flag couple. False marriage so they set em up. The neighbors and brothers got sent to jail for knowing about the sham marriages. Marriages. This stinks to the core and we have no concrete idea what happened. How do you lose the couple for almost 20 min! Then "find" them when you made the switch?  Cops here are corrupt. They are desperate for funding. I wonder how much they get to increase their budget for the coming years. So sad.

       Yep that whole event was bullshit. I know people who worked in that same fuxking building and the stories do NOT add up to what the news has reported

       I remember it well. The circus at the "crime scene" was one of the big red flags that the whole event was somehow being manipulated and managed. It's like they were trying to cram it down our throats, using the unwitting media, to show us just how undeniably guilty the couple was. There was evidence everywhere, sitting out in the open, just ready for cameras.

       So many weird particulars about the whole shooting. Individually, the particulars can be explained away, but en masse, they defy belief.

       It wasn't the landlord, it was a British journalist who in the past had tweeted some tongue-in-cheek stuff about journalists being MI6.

       Just goes to show how fallible human memory is.

       The reporters entered
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the police had left the scene:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The house had been scoured by law enforcement, and then, with the permission of the landlord, it was the journalists’ turn.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But instead of a cache of weapons or parts for making explosives — which the authorities had removed — they found what would have looked like a relatively normal cluttered household, notwithstanding a shredded front door that had been ripped from its hinges and cast aside as law enforcement officers broke in.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        F.B.I. officials confirmed that they had searched the home and were finished.
       </p>
       <p>
        The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said at a news conference in Washington that he had seen the video of the reporters in the townhouse. “I think I’m neither unhappy nor happy,” he said. “When we are done with a location, we return it to their rightful owners and we have to leave an inventory under the law about what was taken. So, people got to see our great criminal justice system in action.”
