        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I seem to recall that, immediately after the San Bernadino attack, reporters showed up at their apartment and convinced their landlord to open the boarded up door, which he inexplicably did.</p>

<p>It should have been an active crime scene, shouldn&#39;t it have? Shouldn&#39;t there have been bomb squad guys there, securing the area, before countless police and feds started crawling all over the area with fine toothed combs?</p>

<p>The reporters barged in and started filming their personal items and likely touching things and contaminating the crime scene.</p>

<p>Then, after all this, I don&#39;t remember there ever being any acknowledgment of this incident, no follow up report about how the landlord and reporters had been charged with many serious crimes. Just nothing. A black hole.</p>

<p>Anybody want to discuss this, and similar incidents?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They shredded the evidence. They were the shooters. 3 large athletic males. False flag couple. False marriage so they set em up. The neighbors and brothers got sent to jail for knowing about the sham marriages. Marriages. This stinks to the core and we have no concrete idea what happened. How do you lose the couple for almost 20 min! Then &quot;find&quot; them when you made the switch?  Cops here are corrupt. They are desperate for funding. I wonder how much they get to increase their budget for the coming years. So sad. </p>

There was evidence everywhere, sitting out in the open, just ready for cameras.</p>

<p>So many weird particulars about the whole shooting. Individually, the particulars can be explained away, but en masse, they defy belief.</p>
