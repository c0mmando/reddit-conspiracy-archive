       First and foremost, although I am an anarchist, I am not a Utopian. There is no social system which will utterly eliminate evil. In a stateless society, there will still be rape, theft, murder and abuse. To be fair, just and reasonable, we must compare a stateless society not to some standard of otherworldly perfection, but rather to the world as it already is. The moral argument for a stateless society includes the reality that it will eliminate a large amount of institutionalized violence and abuse, not that it will result in a perfectly peaceful world, which of course is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anarchy can be viewed as a cure for cancer and heart disease, not a prescription for endlessly perfect health. It would be unreasonable to oppose a cure for cancer because such a cure did not eliminate all other possible diseases â€“ in the same way, we cannot reasonably oppose a stateless society because some people are bad, and a free society will not make them good.

       Of course in a "stateless society" the bad people will have free reign to threaten and commit violence against the good.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more apt analogy is to consider the state as society's immune system - sometimes it attacks good cells and causes disease, but far more often it attacks bad cells and prevents disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting rid of the immune system will indeed get rid of the autoimmune diseases caused by the immune system attacking good cells, but the free reign offered to the bad cells would be far worse.

       He's the one that raised the issue of bad people. And then he went on to advocate a government to oppose them.

       A constabulary is composed of members of the community in turns, similar to a neighborhood watch, rather than professional police. In the past, they came under the auspices of a royal sheriff for expertise and firepower, but, except for political unrest brought about by the state, it was very rarely ever required. This was roughly duplicated in the American frontier, with the constable being called sheriff, and a federal marshal in the place of a royal sheriff; it continues vestigially as, at least nominally, democratically elected county sheriffs.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And how do the members of the community decide which rules the constabulary will enforce? And who makes sure the constabulary doesn't itself become an organisation that uses violence to impose its will?
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds to me like you are talking about unelected mobs roaming around and using violence to force other people to comply with their wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's use a hypothetical example: say there are two farms near a water source and both farms have grown to a size where they need all the water that source can provide. One farmer decides he deserves the water more than the other and begins extracting all the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who decides who gets to use the water? What if both farmers raise a "constabulary" to defend their rights to the water? What prevents those two farmers from starting a war over the water source?
      </p>
      <p>
       How has "statelessness" prevented violence in a situation like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if one farmer is wrong, and doesn't have a right to the water, but is wealthy enough to raise a larger "constabulary" to enforce his will? Who will defend the poorer farmer? What prevents "might making right" in that situation?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that wealthy farmer wins, and eventually takes control of the water source and the poorer farmer's property, how is that different from a state?
      </p>
      <p>
       OP said he doesn't need to know how society will be organised without a state, but what he really meant is he has no idea
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       a society
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be organised without a state, because a "society" by definition involves the creation of a state.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as a group of people come together and agree on a set of laws and create any kind of organisation to enforce those laws, they are creating a state, whether OP wants to admit it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason humans have had states for thousands of years. We literally can not have societies without them.

       By your own logic, that any social organization is by default a state, they have had a government all along; their objection is simply that it is composed of entirely of rival criminals coercing them to the benefit of other parties. Does that sound the least bit familiar to you?

       No, the most you can say is they were subjected to violence by rival governments, none of which they had any control over. In the end they chose to form a democratically elected central government to take power from the rival warlords who gained power at the barrel of a gun.

       Yes. The history of humanity is replete with similar stories. The modern governments most nations have are a result of humanity as a whole rejecting the idea of "statelessness".
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem people like you have is you blame the "state" for human nature. You seem to believe that if the "state" went away, humans would no longer coerce each other.

       They preferred to have people ruling over them? That may have been their problem. Of course, their condition was only leftover from a failed government. Now, thanks to the state, dependent people are left to rebuild from the rubble (a la Mad Max style). This time they should think twice before establishing rulers.

       "Stateless" does not preclude other, benign forms of organization, a constabulary or militia being a good example of what I mean. What is required for anarchy to work, is an active public that will not hesitate to organize specifically against attempts by the guilty to organize themselves into a system of coercion which would inevitably condense into a state if allowed to continue.

       Any form of "organisation" as you suggest would by definition become the "state" you claim to be getting rid of. Who makes the rules of the militia? Who commands it? What if I oppose the policies of that militia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that militia not itself be a "system of coercion"?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tell me "the people" will make the rules, then all you are describing is a communist state. As soon as the people organise themselves into a political community, they become a state.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not advocate getting rid of the state, you simply want a different political structure to govern that state according to the rules you prefer.

       Obviously, there would have to be some kind of understanding in the community as to exactly what a state is, and how the community is to organize to serve its needs while at the same time preventing its formation. IMO, the problem is not with organization, but condensation of power. Incorporations, whether public or private, must have a specific purpose and lifespan, and also the direct, democratic approval of the community, to prevent condensation of power into an agency of coercion.

       So once again, we come back to the fact that you don't actually have a problem with the concept of a state, but instead have a problem with how the state is run and who runs it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can agree that the states most nations have today are no longer beneficial to the societies they supposedly serve. They have been co-opted to benefit a minority at the expense of the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, these states are still better than no state at all, because the same people that co-opted the state still have to work within defined boundaries. In a statelesss nation, there will be no boundaries. Might (and wealth) will make right, and the average person would have no power to oppose short of violent revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know this? Because that's how our states formed in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with states is not that they exist, but that they have been taken over by a powerful minority while the majority sits back and lets them get away with it. We have returned to monarchy and only pretend we live in democracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is needed is democratic revolution to
       <em>
        restore
       </em>
       the state, not to get rid of it.

       As far as I am aware, there have been very few cases of "statelessness", and every single time it was a disaster for the people.

       Ask the Somalis. They were desperate to form a government after only a few years of statelessness.

       So he's the stupid kind of anarchist.  Nice.

       Anarchy should stop existing, because only about 2% of anarchists are actually intelligent people.  They should just stop trying to be edgy and flip to libertarianism.

       Pre-colonial Somalia perhaps, but not what is going on there now; I don't say post-colonial, because I believe Somalia's resources are still very much colonized, and that is the purpose of the perpetual-destabilization model Novus Ordo Seclorum is now implementing in all areas of the world not already under direct private-central-bank occupation.

       I think we have much to learn about effective social organization from indigenous cultures; not a few Americans believe the only true, functioning Democracy of scale that has existed in America during historical times was the Iroquois nation, and that it was likely the model Jefferson was working from, as he and Thomas Paine struggled against the 1% of their day while drafting the constitution.
