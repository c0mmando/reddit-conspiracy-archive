       Energy cannot be made or destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are human beings that are a creation of cells interacting with one another and developing consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we die, the energy is recycled and a new consciousness is born. We become a new person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not taking this from a Buddhist perspective but a Scientific perspective. I have long thought this.

       Here's my take on it. Picture a large punch bowl full of water. That represents the essences of the souls of the universe. When you are born, a ladle is taken from it and that is you, pieces of many past souls. When you die, you are poured back in. When someone new is born, a ladle is taken out and maybe a bit of you is in it, along with pieces of many others. That's the energy of the consciousness of the universe. You're just a little part of it. The distinct you only exists in one incarnation and then is mixed back in. Just my thoughts. Not looking to debate them, just how I see it. (edited due to wine)

       That's awesome. I actually like debating on this stuff but essentially this is what I believe in just in a very eloquent metaphor.

       I was talking to my friend who works in the Suicide hotlines and he said specifically that he met someone who died really happy because he believed in reincarnation and so would have another shot in life.

       Well, the user mentioned a suicide hotline worker, so I'd imagine the person committed suicide, hoping in reincarnation. One could say that would be against the rules of the universe. But, one would have to be spiritual to understand that, and you don't seem like the spiritual type.

       Even being on Earth is dangerous, to survive you need to kill other animals, or if you can live off of plants, other animals are out to kill you. You can even die just from not chewing thoroughly and choking.

       Ever been to a high altitude? If there air is more dense at a low altitude, and it thins at a high altitude, it would logically follow that the higher you get, the less air there is.

       No.  I don't "believe" in reincarnation.  "Belief" is what you have when you don't have valid evidence of a thing.  I've studied Dr. Ian Stevenson and his work.  Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross.  Robert Monroe.  Individuals of that ilk.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not "belief".  What I have is an understanding of the evidence that exists regarding the validity of the phenomenon.

       It's not belief.  It's knowledge of it's existence.

       There are three parts to an organism: Matter, energy, and information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organic matter, and energy contained in the molecular bonds of some of that matter are reused by other organisms, thus reincarnated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genetic information is transmitted to offspring, and so is reincarnated. Cultural information can also be passed on to future generations, and that would apply as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when most people talk about reincarnation, they are talking about their memories, experiences, and personality that are preserved and reused. That is the only one of all of these which isn't possible, because the matter, energy, and genetic information may persist after death, but the others do not. When your brain dies, all its information storage and the products of its functions cease.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can write down your memories, knowledge, behaviors, goals, etc. and someone can later incorporate all that into their own personality, and if they emulate you closely enough some of that can be imperfectly reincarnated in a sense. I believe that is the idea behind archetypes, programming the Christ consciousness into someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mind does not exist as a thing that leaves your body upon death and gets reused in another organism, no.

       It seems to me for most sentient beings... Body is a Vessel, Soul is Pure Energy and Mind is Consciousness so add to this DNA and Memories (Information, Experience, Knowledge etc.) that can be "saved" and you basically have immortality anytime/anywhere in know Universe or what ever this time/space it.

       Some will say that time is a thread in a tire. Always repeating in "almost" the same place as long ago. If you can grasp what infinity really is, you will understand that reincarnation is a mathematical certainty.

       That's true, I guess. However, if you want to go down the simulation theory route, which science is starting to lean towards that possibility. That very well could explain re-incarnation, just not in the way we traditionally think.

       But through the whole process you're losing energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You die, you get buried under a plant, that plant feeds off of your body and some fruit grows - But it took energy to grow the plant and produce the fruit. So the production from the plant is less than what you put into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like you can just decompose, feed a plant to bear fruit and feed a person, who then dies, decomposes and keeps feeding the plant in an endless closed loop.

       It takes millions of years if not billions for matter to go from cooled state(matter) to heated state( energy , think of plasma inside of stars) and back to cooled state(after the star goes super nova). So , no if you die , you will never "reincarnate" back on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       One interesting thing to ask yourself , is what happens with "information" or  in oher words , our memories , after we die.

       Clearly aren't ? How do you know that . That's literally imposible to know considering we still don't have a clear definition of what "space" , really is.

       Our energy is turned into heat through decomp; the insects and critters that feed on us absorb that energy and if sealed up then our energy is transferred through the walls of whatever container we are in.

       So no, I do not believe in reincarnation in the way religion or spiritual belief systems portray. Our consciousness doesn't get recycled.
