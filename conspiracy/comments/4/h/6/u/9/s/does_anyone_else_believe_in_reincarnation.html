    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my take on it. Picture a large punch bowl full of water. That represents the essences of the souls of the universe. When you are born, a ladle is taken from it and that is you, pieces of many past souls. When you die, you are poured back in. When someone new is born, a ladle is taken out and maybe a bit of you is in it, along with pieces of many others. That&#39;s the energy of the consciousness of the universe. You&#39;re just a little part of it. The distinct you only exists in one incarnation and then is mixed back in. Just my thoughts. Not looking to debate them, just how I see it.

    <div class="md"><p>There are three parts to an organism: Matter, energy, and information.</p>

<p>The organic matter, and energy contained in the molecular bonds of some of that matter are reused by other organisms, thus reincarnated.</p>

<p>Genetic information is transmitted to offspring, and so is reincarnated. Cultural information can also be passed on to future generations, and that would apply as well.</p>

<p>However, when most people talk about reincarnation, they are talking about their memories, experiences, and personality that are preserved and reused. That is the only one of all of these which isn&#39;t possible, because the matter, energy, and genetic information may persist after death, but the others do not. When your brain dies, all its information storage and the products of its functions cease.</p>

<p>You can write down your memories, knowledge, behaviors, goals, etc. and someone can later incorporate all that into their own personality, and if they emulate you closely enough some of that can be imperfectly reincarnated in a sense. I believe that is the idea behind archetypes, programming the Christ consciousness into someone.</p>

<p>Your mind does not exist as a thing that leaves your body upon death and gets reused in another organism, no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, I guess. However, if you want to go down the simulation theory route, which science is starting to lean towards that possibility. That very well could explain re-incarnation, just not in the way we traditionally think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But through the whole process you&#39;re losing energy. </p>

<p>You die, you get buried under a plant, that plant feeds off of your body and some fruit grows - But it took energy to grow the plant and produce the fruit. So the production from the plant is less than what you put into it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like you can just decompose, feed a plant to bear fruit and feed a person, who then dies, decomposes and keeps feeding the plant in an endless closed loop. </p>

<p>You&#39;re losing energy at every stage of the cycle. 1 body cannot feed a plant enough for it to provide food sufficient to keep 1 human alive. You need a lot more energy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes millions of years if not billions for matter to go from cooled state(matter) to heated state( energy , think of plasma inside of stars) and back to cooled state(after the star goes super nova). So , no if you die , you will never &quot;reincarnate&quot; back on Earth. </p>

<p>One interesting thing to ask yourself , is what happens with &quot;information&quot; or  in oher words , our memories , after we die. </p>

<p>Do they get saved somewhere? Is there an archive out there?</p>
