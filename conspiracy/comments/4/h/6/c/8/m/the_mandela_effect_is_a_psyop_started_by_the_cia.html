<p>I pretty much dismissed the Mandela Effect -- I never thought he died in prison; worked in a library when &quot;Interview with THE Vampire&quot; was published; saw &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; several times and heard Darth say &quot;No, I am your father&quot;; etc., etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s consider the ways in which they could accomplish this. The first would be to hire a bunch of people to make &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; claims (about Mandela, but other things as well), hoping it would catch on. </p>

<p>The second would be to actually generate false stories, which can later be  erased from existence. This would account for mass-delusion on various things, although would be harder to carry out.</p>

<p>The third would be to actually leap into other universes, which would definitely be the most convincing. My uncle is pretty sure that They uncovered the necessary alien technology from Area 51 to accomplish this. Makes sense, really. </p>

<p>The fourth way would be if this is actually complete bullshit and people can have faulty memories (sometimes on similar things), and the CIA has nothing to fucking do with it. Call me crazy. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t people start noticing things by inconsistencies with very well known brands/songs/movies? What do you think would be more plausible for them to notice first if this theory is true? </p>

<p>This is assuming this theory is true okay? I am not saying it IS true, but you need to be able to consider both sides to have a constructive conversation here. What the proponents of this theory are saying is that you would never know things were different because in your universe they have always been the same. The ones experiencing this effect would know a different version of history than you do, and there would be no way for them to prove it to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I said I agreed that the idea of switching in between parallel universes was plausible. &quot;</p>

<p>And that is just pseudoscience.  We don&#39;t have any actual understanding of what travelling between &quot;parallel universes&quot; might mean or whether it is physically possible at all.</p>

<p>You are applying pop-science to this issue.  There is no agreed-upon physics or anything other than conjecture when it comes to travel between universes.  Indeed, the majority opinion is that such travel appears to be impossible.</p>

<p>And of course, our only evidence for other universes is entirely indirect.  Our physics seem to call for their existence but we can&#39;t find (and may never be able to find) any direct evidence for their existence.  The math allows for them but we can&#39;t indentify them empirically in any way.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t even figure a way to prove they exist how can we possibly say it &quot;switching in between parallel universes was plausible. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very accurate and I agree with you 100%. With that being said, it doesn&#39;t mean that there couldn&#39;t be something else going on as well. </p>

<p>Memories are very faulty when trying to remember crime scenes or when you take in a situation in real time and then try to recall it later. We are horrible at that. However, humans tend to have pretty good memories when it comes to advertising, music, movies etc...I can still sing the words from songs I haven&#39;t heard in 5+ years. </p>

<p>So I do agree with you that human memories are terrible, but that isn&#39;t true in all cases. </p>

<p>Very true.  But why assume a ridiculous conspiracy when the phenomenon can be explained much more credibly using PROVEN information about human memory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said in my original reply, there are certain kinds of memory that humans seem to do well with, and others that we completely fail at. </p>

<p>Without getting into a long drawn out explanation, I feel that there is an infinite amount of things that we are yet to discover scientifically, along with an infinite amount of things we will never discover due to human/dimensional limitations. </p>

<p>I like to keep my mind open, especially at the metaphysical level. There is no way to prove/disprove this theory, so no need to shoot it down as if you have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only the cattle (Atheists and the Various forms of Christians) would be the ones to believe this effect is bollocks, because to them seeing is believing which would mean at such a point they are functioning as strictly an animal but refuse such a claim. </p>

<p>The most evidence one could gather is regarding the recent &quot;white out&quot; effect which is now &#39;wite out&#39; and if you look up the term &#39;wite&#39; according to dictionary.com the the term is a noun with the following definitions 1.a. a fine imposed by a king or lord on a subject who committed a serious crime. b. a fee demanded for granting a special privilege. 2. Chiefly Scot. responsibility for a crime, fault, or misfortune; blame.</p>

<p>Now as unreliable Urban Dictionary is I still suggest you refer to it in this case because when I checked first looking up the term &quot;WHite out&quot; one of the definitions read 1) a correctional fluid usually white in color with a strong odor; it may come in a .7 fl oz. bottle (with a brush or foam stick), a pen, or even in a strip. I won&#39;t bother with the other definitions.</p>

<p>Now not more than a minute later I looked up &#39;Wite out&#39; and what do you know they didnt have a definition and if youre going to say that people overlooked this for years I say nay. This is as concrete as it can get with this effect.</p>

<p>I have the screenshots of Urban Dictionary on my phone and the term &#39;Wite&#39; should terrify one as innumerable numbers of the population have acquired a debt that is impossible to pay off, and the question remains what will they claim as reparations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so, but there are a lot of those. It&#39;s pretty tame compared to a lot of the other theories that come through here and other forums. While it&#39;s an entertaining trick of the mind, there are Flat Earth, lens flares supposedly being Planet X, and black goo videos running around that take way more faith to get behind. The possibility of there being parallel realities is one that even mainstream researchers entertain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. </p>

<p>If you want to go down this road: why do you consider ANY fringe conspiracy topic?</p>

<p>Not one of them can be proven.</p>

<p>Aliens are the same as flat earth as the same as Mandela Effect as the same God.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like the topic, that&#39;s fine, but you can&#39;t go crying &quot;psyop&quot; at every fringe theory. </p>
