       I like some of what Trump says, but any time I hear a wall, I think of the Israeli wall. No thanks. I'm for stronger borders, but not a wall. Methinks that's a bad idea.

       I agree, although I don't plan on voting. If I did, I'd write in Ron Paul. Even if he "won", I think it wouldn't make a difference. The deep state runs the show...

       Totally agree but the other thing I don't get about trump is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is literally the 0.01%, his entire life has been built on and depends on that status and all the shit that comes with it. How the fuck has he convinced people he's just like them and not part of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so he's not a part of the elected establishment but he is a part of the actual establishment that buys it way through life, buys governments and screws the people, he freely admits to having given money to everybody he could.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the hell would anyone believe he's suddenly all for them and anti establishment

       You're setting the bar too high. People don't know that Trump is for them, but  they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know that the elected establishment is against them. The elected establishment is also against Trump. So if Trump can break the establishment's lock on power, it's all good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a one-man wrecking crew, and that's enough at this point. Because the GOP's big idea was, what, JEB!??

       there wouldnt be a problem if the economic classes still existed.  there is no more middle class, at least not in the majority.  nowadays everyone is struggling and poor.  im actually very comfy but i came from dirt.  i see more abd more that your either a guard of the corporate prison or a prisoner, either way the prison still exists.  anyone who just accepts the world aroud them at face value and doesnt at least ask questions and make damn sure they are getting the whole truth is just another brick in the wall.  im tired of seeing the people continuously lose control of this country because of plain ignorance to what is right in front of them.

       Economic classes are alive and well just getting harder to get past as we run out of business opportunities and STEM jobs with good pay.  College in US maybe so expensive it's a luxury but less so in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is not as black and white as you say it is yet.  The pieces keeping people down on the ladder are slow to set up, and Trump was on record advocating to stimulate investment in startups to bridge that gap, during his 1991 criticism of US fiscal economic policy when he was on CSPAN.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also worked hard with a presentation to the UN convincing them to contract him (or just bargain better) for reno's on their office tower at less than half the price others were quoting in 1998.  He was ignored.  They went with their insider friends for 120%+ greater price (paid for by you).  If he is so establishment, how come he couldn't get a government Reno job IN NEW YORK for half the price of his competition with better plans and shorter projected schedule?

       My belief is he buys who he does selfishly in the past, cause that's business, you see it as an investment then, but his actions have not shown any signs of widening the gap between economic classes, despite fear mongering that has no supporting evidence at all, so I will continue to believe they are all Hillary shills.

       "They’re going to have enough to do without worrying about building a fence along the entire border, they are trying to setup as much of the police state apparatus now as possible in preparation. Finding excuses for us to accept it before they even roll out their real intentions makes their job much easier later. Of course this has very little to do with the politicians pushing for the fence, they are mostly doing it for votes. There are plenty of others who would love to see it go up to be used for nefarious purposes later, much like FEMA camps." - Ron Paul 2011

       I agree...it would take something catastrophic to sway people...like no electricity. Pacification trumps martial law everyday. Watch out for the black boogieman 282,000,000+ sleeping majority...stay inside, stay separated, stay in your safe place...everyone is a winner and you too could be famous overnight!! All you need to do is take dick in ass on Film and presto, little girls, you'll be just like your idol Kim!! And make sure it's a black guy who just got out of prison to impress your friends and family. Generation Cuck. Nation of Cuck.

       Sorry. The actual government has all that planned already. They have constructed re-education camps for citizens (their own words), removed Posse Comitatus, introduced legislation to deny citizens the right to travel if they owe taxes, and so on.

      <p>
       If you're scared of what Trump MIGHT do, you haven't been paying attention to the government at all.

       I'm personally worried about Americans who honestly believe Trump can actually get a wall built.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more worrisome is that anyone actually believes anything Trump says to begin with.

       Holy shit... i have been on a real synchronicity kick. Today my friend said along the lines what your voting for trump? And i said yeah hes building a wall. My friend was like yeah hes building a wall to keep the people who build it out and i said no if trump gets in to office then america is going to shit way faster than any one can imagine, the wall is to keep us in not keep them out. I thought that the idea of the wall to keep us in was absolutly brilliant and unique because i havnt herx any one say anything similar.  Today is first day in like a month i came here and this post. Today i had one other coincedence that i found extreamly odd almost disturbing.  Whats the deal with coincidences and synchronicitys?

       Undecided on my vote (not democrat though) but it's only a southern wall. We could still go to Canada, or overseas. I'd be more worried if it were a total surrounding wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note though, that's how all the great ancient cities defended their borders. Sure, there have been a couple bad ones, Berlin in one instance. But there have been thousands of good ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia/USSR didn't need an actual wall to keep their people in/others out. The iron curtain was pretty impenetrable without a physical structure.

       Tax the parasites western union wire transfers like he said and no actual American pays for the wall. Also why would anyone leave the US? Where you gonna go? Mexico is a garbage heap, Europe is busy getting raped by their white guilt, Chinese is hard to learn etc etc. I'd rather a strong nationalist take over and shut the border down than move to the 3rd world which is just about everywhere else.

       You really think he will build a wall? Lol  never does a politician tell the truth. The reason I am voting for him is just cause I wanna see what happens. The state of affairs now with the current system goes to show how little faith many of us have.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the jail Muslims, deport Mexicans, and whatever else anyone wants to say to make him into the devil they can unite to hate so be it. I just wanna say yeah I helped fuck it all up or make it great. Cause honestly how much worse can it get?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ask who your choices are? Sorry but a man that has liver spots on his hands older then me and been in politics his whole life I don't trust. I just won't. Then Hillary......fuck no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have a billionaire business man. I mean hell why not Regan was an actor. Let roll the dice and see. Either way this is my first time voting for anything. Perhaps you don't agree but I don't try to belittle you for the choice or otherwise try to influence your ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all means do what you feel is best for you. Cause that is what I am doing. Making a choice for my best interests. Not yours or anyone else's. Talking points and all that other shit aside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares? Has any politician ever fulfilled their campaign promises? If they have I don't remember it. So I am not expecting it now.

       As a non-US citizen, I hope he gets voted in.  He will fuck shit up so badly for the USA that you're going to have to spend years sorting out the mess and that means less time for you lot to go around fucking up the rest of the world for everybody else.

       Yeah I can see how that comment would come across like that.  I meant the US State and that wasn't clear.  I don't want anybody's life to get worse.  What I mean is that it appears - from the outside - that the USA needs a period of self-evaluation and that it might just take a collectlive bad decision to encourage or shock people into rethinking their ideas.

       That's more understandable and relatable.  As bad as it is, people's lives are going to have to go downhill a lot, and by a lot, I mean life changing in some of the most negative ways imaginable for a real wake up call to happen.  Too many, not all, but too many people in the US are ignorant and spoiled and are brainwashed, as much as they'll refute it.  I've been saying to family and friends what a dump the US has become ever since I got out of the military and they treat me like something messed with my head while I was in, like I'm the one in the wrong.  Americans don't need to suffer through a crumble of the nation and try to re-build ourselves up again, thats going to be insanely rough and frightening to most people, especially trying to do it alone.  We need the help and backing of other countries who support a non-oligarchy war-mongering nation.  Power in numbers, global numbers.

       I agree. Either people's lives have to reach a certain nadir or we need to run out of people to blame for our own mistakes and ill-judgement.  The problem with wanting other countries to help is that arrogance precludes that from happening because of the idea of American exceptionalism.  That and the fact that the problems in the USA at the moment are far from being exclusive to that country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen the map that was compiled from data gained from polling around the world to find out which countries are seen as the biggest threats to global peace and security?  By far the country most people are afraid of is the USA.  However, this fact is lost on most people because of internal politics and rehetoric.  What other people say simply doesn't matter as much because they are not part of the 'Greatest Country in the WorldTM'.  That the reiteration of that 'fact' is so popular - again, it seems like that from the outside at least - is something which simply isn't so common in more moderate countries.  It was absolutely the case during the age of European imperialist expansion and that attitude only ended with misery for millions around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably a bit of a ramble, that but I'm with you.  I'm a global thinker.  I'm British and I'm currently living in my third country (right now I'm in a bar in a small village in northern Tanzania) and I'm not a nationalist.  I think all people have the potential to equally as awesome and just wish that was a view shared by more people.  Ha, maybe we're just in the wrong!

       I grew up in the south in the US, the place where bible thumpers said I was going to hell for smoking weed and where I got sent home from school when I was young for not saying under God when having to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember I was still in highschool when 9/11 happened.  I'm white, but lived in a mostly Cambodian neighborhood.  Once word started to get around, the news started the blame game, hours after the tower fell, we were in the lunch line and my poor friends were getting the most hateful looks from other students and even some teachers.  They had no idea of the actual difference between Cambodians and Middle Easterners, they just knew they were 'different' with dark skin and it was disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, I've lived around people who believe we're more entitled because we're, "Gods original children, white and pure from sin", no shit.  That we should 'nuke' the Middle East to get rid of terrorists who can somehow attack the most powerful country military-wise from their desert caves across the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thankful that while I didn't get a great education, I was given enough common sense to undeerstand how fucked up a lot of Americans are, and it's even worse because they truly don't realize it.  I mean right now, we're debating over gay rights, transgender issues, same sex bathrooms - trivial shit that doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The propaganda fed to most Americans is haunting to say the least.  The only way we can escape the hole we've dug for ourselves is to learn to be humble, to learn that we're far from the greatest country on the planet, and I'm hoping ultimately that people will at some point disagree with the way the Nation is run and even come to terms that maybe trying to find out which country has the largest dick shouldn't be on the top of the list of priorities.

       Excellent post.  I think a major problem is one of starting from a point where you already know the answer/'truth'. The idea that 'the USA is greatest country on Earth' isn't up for debate.  It's a given.  It's the platform upon which all other ideas must be based as to think or say otherwise is to be un-patriotic and anti-American (again, completely bypassing any debate on what it means to be a patriot or whether it's even a good thing).  As you say, without being humble and willing to be self-critical and build opinions rather than simply acquiring them, there's little hope of advancement.  It's fundamentalism which is such a problem.

       Yeah, no.  The fed does not have control over national guard, each state controls their own national guard militia.  Which means a President can't order the NG to do BP, only the states that border Mexico governors can order such a thing.

       I'm very curious what you can point to that this is what he actually means when he says the words: “I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”

       What would make you think that a smart guy like Trump wouldn't load his speech with double entendres?  One meaning for the lowbrows and an entirely more abstract meaning for the highs.  Misunderstanding this is severely underestimating Trump's intelligence
