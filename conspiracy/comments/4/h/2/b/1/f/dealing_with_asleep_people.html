    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is how I went about it with my ex, he was never fully on board with it all, and mostly switched off when I began talking about it which was frustrating but on the other hand he was never very politically minded so I wasn&#39;t up against an angry liberal. In terms of that specific relationship he was aware of my stance but we rarely discuss politics or conspiracies so I didn&#39;t mind keeping those worlds separate, it was known in general to him about how I felt so it wasn&#39;t a secret. </p>

<p>The problem is these lefties. I wouldn&#39;t label myself rightwing or anything (as we know it&#39;s a Hegelian dialectic) but if you express any differing views they see you as Hitler. I&#39;m ok with not bringing up politics/conspiracies but I struggle to shut my mouth if they bring those topics up. It seems like to me the default settings for people I meet (early 30s in London UK) is to be a lefties. Some of them might be alright if they were deprogrammed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t let the brainless twits get you down. no matter your age, you should <em>never</em> dumb down! not for a man, not for any reason. the funny thing is, once you know the kind of guy you want; you&#39;ll attract all the losers (personal experience) as if life is &quot;testing&quot; you. </p>

<p>don&#39;t fall into the trap that you <em>HAVE TO</em> be coupled up with someone just because your friends have a bf. desperate females are not perceived as attractive.</p>

<p>my suggestion is to stop fretting about it, really; just be you, live your life &amp; do what makes you happy. then you&#39;ll meet <em>the one</em> (but his name won&#39;t be Neo). </p>

<p>As someone who was a best man and is currently the 3rd wheel to their marriage I agree.</p>

<p>To the OP;</p>

<p>As to finding someone with the same degree of world understanding; after dating someone who did it just felt like we were both preaching to the choir.</p>

<p>Ultimately your world views could be completely opposite and you should still be able to be together. All you need in a working relationship is trust, communication, and compromise.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go rushing into anything.</p>

<p>As for ice breakers my favorite has always been explaining how the electoral college actually picks our POTUS and our vote is just a suggestion. Especially with all the blatant fraud going on in this election; makes it a easy one for the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mate, I have friends (and a business). You can&#39;t live where I do without friends (I mean you could but you&#39;d have to be a fucking complete bad ass).  </p>

<p>As for a gf/wife. I&#39;ve already been in love in my life (not exactly basing my existence on it. I&#39;ve had it). That relationship lasted for years and completely changed my thinking. </p>

<p>I find solace in solitude. I love myself and enjoy myself (I cherish people&#39;s company every now and then). A great test is to be able to drink hard with yourself. If you cannot (enjoy your own company/face demons), why would others want to ;)?</p>

<p>Know thy self, and love thyself. It&#39;s not as lonely as you may think, especially if you are as spiritual as I am. Plus, I&#39;m never really alone (animals in the wild). I&#39;m where we as humans are supposed to be, in nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish you the best of luck. A little advice, know yourself before you head off into the woods. Even if it&#39;s just rural, know yourself and be prepared mentally. That is the most important thing. Physically, it&#39;s hard, but not like the mental aspect of it. Very different.</p>

<p>That was going to be my guess. Generally the people I&#39;ve meet not seeking relationships are either very independent or have at some point been in a long-term relationships.</p>

<p>Just my observations..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t want to get into too much detail. But, we started fairly young and lasted for years. It was a roller coaster ride. I&#39;m not against finding someone, just not actively seeking (I&#39;m also very independent). If it happens again, it happens. I have a female dog, so maybe that is the substitute. She likes to cuddle and that dog will die to protect me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a male myself but I know what you mean, it&#39;s that unconditional love.</p>

<p>Yup. That&#39;s the biggest thing. She is special to me, because she comes from the bloodline of the dog I originally had with the partner I was talking about. She&#39;s a Husky/Shepard mix. Looks like a wolf. </p>

<p>Sex is for the living.  Marriage is for the dead.  The only real point of monogamy is to have someone who is willing to hold your hand during the last fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>I saw a couple just last night.  The guy claimed that they&#39;d been together for six years and were still on their honeymoon; but his wife ate the entirety of a pizza which he had bought for their dinner, to the point where he actually told her to do it in order to shut her up.</p>

<p>Any type of intimate long term cohabitation with another human being (whether male or female, sexual or otherwise) is a form of imprisonment, and will generally involve continual psychological warfare.  Although tactics can widely vary, you will virtually never find anyone who will not attempt to subjugate you.  Dominate or be dominated is the rule.</p>
