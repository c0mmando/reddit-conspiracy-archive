        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, to be honest I don&#39;t usually subscribe to very many conspiracy theories but I have been digging around in 9/11 stuff and am intrigued. I am on the fence about 9/11. Convince me that it was an inside job, explain to me, show me links, videos, sources, etc..., anything that can convince me because I need to know. If this kind of request is frowned upon let me know kindly and I will delete the post. I will try to counter points, not because I want to prove anybody right or wrong, but because I want to see what is truth. Definitely try to counter any counter points I can conjure up. Thank you everyone.</p>

<p>Edit: thanks everyone for being so active, helpful and responsive. I will look over all of these over the weekend for sure</p>

<p>Right. Only the AIA members who didn&#39;t vote in favor are reputable. But the ones who did, those guys aren&#39;t reputable. ..../s See how your argument fails? </p>

<p>Again....</p>

<p>AE911truth was only allowed a 6 minute presentation. They were not even allowed to show a video of WTC7&#39;s collapse. Additionally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vote came after a number of impassioned statements from supporters and opponents. It was evident that those who opposed the resolution did not fully understand the official explanation of WTC 7’s destruction for which they claimed such adamant support. <strong>One architect from New York stated that diesel fuel fires were responsible for WTC 7’s destruction, an explanation that even NIST itself has disavowed.</strong></p>

<p>Looks like not all voters were paying attention. And that architect was <em>from</em> NY. Slow progress is still progress. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507162324/http://www.ae911truth.org/">https://web.archive.org/web/20150507162324/http://www.ae911truth.org/</a></p>

<p>2354 signatories. </p>

<p>Now look up the same site from end of December of the same year:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, I never admitted free fall (at least in the truther way of saying it happened instantly). And NIST admitted it happened in a reasonable time after the collapse began.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a video, it appears that WTC 7 is descending in free fall, something that would not occur in the structural collapse that you describe. How can you ignore basic laws of physics?</p>

<p>In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.</p>

<p>To further clarify the descent of the north face, NIST recorded the downward displacement of a point near the center of the roofline from first movement until the north face was no longer visible in the video. Numerical analyses were conducted to calculate the velocity and acceleration of the roofline point from the time-dependent displacement data. The instant at which vertical motion of the roofline first occurred was determined by tracking the numerical value of the brightness of a pixel (a single element in the video image) at the roofline. This pixel became brighter as the roofline began to descend because the color of the pixel started to change from that of the building façade to the lighter color of the sky.</p>

<p>The approach taken by NIST is summarized in Section 3.6 of the final summary report, NCSTAR 1A (released Nov. 20, 2008; available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201A.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201A.pdf</a>) and detailed in Section 12.5.3 of NIST NCSTAR 1-9 (available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-9%20Vol%202.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-9%20Vol%202.pdf</a>).
The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Later in the public draft hearing, a high school physics teacher pointed out WTC 7 reached gravitational acceleration. NIST responded by placing it in &quot;Stage 2&quot; of their collapse sequence. </p>

<p>Experts have come out saying, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The collapse we see cannot be due to a column failure, or a few column failures, or a sequence of column failures.  All 24 interior columns and 58 perimeter columns had to have been removed over the span of 8 floors low in the building simultaneously to within a small fraction of a second, and in such a way that the top half of the building remains intact and uncrumpled.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Controlled demolition can instantaneously remove 8 stories allowing the upper structure to accelerate downwards in free fall.  The absolute free fall of Building 7 over a period of 2.25 seconds is by itself overwhelming evidence that fire could not bring have brought down the building.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>All 24 interior columns and 58 perimeter columns had to have been removed over the span of 8 floors low in the building simultaneously</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there were intense fires on floors: 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19, 27 and 28. Which went completely uncontrolled for hours as the emergency services stopped trying to put them out.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more likely: the &#39;people that be&#39; went through the immense effort to rig WTC7 to collapse but didn&#39;t think &quot;Hey, wouldn&#39;t it be suspicious if this looks like a building demolition?&quot;, and then whatever devices (the explosives, detonators and cords/timers/wireless transmitters) they used for the demolition somehow survived several hours of intense heat to still all detonate perfectly simultaneously.</p>

<p>OR a building well past its designed fire tolerances, ignored by firemen, with a failed fire suppression systems collapsed because... well... that&#39;s what happens when you go past the fire tolerance.</p>

<p>And it collapses symmetrically, almost as if &quot;all 24 interior columns and 58 perimeter columns had to have been removed over the span of 8 floors low in the building simultaneously to within a small fraction of a second&quot; because that&#39;s could have been what happened when, over the span of multiple floors, you have a fire raging for many hours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The city water main had been cut by the collapse of the two WTC Towers, so the sprinklers in Building 7 did not function for much of the bottom half of the building. Nevertheless, other tall office buildings have burned for as long or longer in similar fires without collapsing—when sprinklers either did not exist or were not functional.&quot; - NIST (Shyam Sunder)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza, both
commercial office buildings, had fires that fully
involved entire floors. In both buildings, vertical spread 
of fire was by external flame exposure, breaking
glass windows from the outside and igniting office furnishings
in the floor above. By contrast, the fires in
WTC 7 spread across several floors, but did not involve
an entire floor at any given time. Additionally, in
WTC 7 there was no evidence of floor-to-floor fire spread 
in the photographic and videographic records.
Finally, the combustible load was likely similar in First 
Interstate Bank, One Meridian Plaza, and WTC 7,
with the combustible load in One Meridian Plaza perhaps 
even greater as it was described subjectively as
“heavy.” <strong>NIST therefore concluded that the fires in First Interstate Bank and One Meridian Plaza were at
least as severe, and probably more severe, than the fires in WTC 7.&quot;</strong> NIST NCSTAR 1-9 pg. 341</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the major differences between &quot;typical&quot; major high-rise building fires that have occurred in the United States and the fire in the WTC 7 building on Sept. 11, 2001?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more similarities than differences between the uncontrolled fires that burned in WTC 7 and those that occurred in the following buildings: First Interstate Bank Building (1988), One Meridian Plaza Building (1991), One New York Plaza (1970), and WTC 5 (2001).</p>

<p>NIST NCSTAR Report 1-9, Section 8.5, provides details about these building fires.</p>

<p>The following factors describe the fire events that occurred in both WTC 7 and the referenced buildings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fuel for the fires was ordinary office combustibles at ordinary combustible load levels.</li>
<li>There was no use of accelerants.</li>
<li>The spread of fire from combustible to combustible was governed by ordinary fire physics.</li>
<li>Fire-induced window breakage provided ventilation for continued fire spread and growth.</li>
<li>There were simultaneous fires on multiple floors.</li>
<li>The fires on each floor occupied a substantial portion of the floor.</li>
<li>The fires on each floor had passed the point of flashover and the structure was subjected to typical post-flashover temperatures.</li>
<li><strong>The sprinklers were inoperative or ineffective; and 9) the fires burned for sufficient time to cause significant distortion and/or failure to the building structure.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There were some differences between the fires in WTC 7 and those in the referenced buildings, but these differences were secondary to the fire factors that led to the collapse of WTC 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fires in high-rise buildings typically have a single point of origin on a single floor, whereas the fires in WTC 7 likely had a single point of origin on multiple (10) floors.</li>
<li>Fires in other high-rise buildings were due to isolated events, whereas the fires in WTC 7 followed the collapse of WTC 1.</li>
<li>Water was available to fight fires in the other high rise buildings, but the water supply to fight fires in WTC 7 was impaired.</li>
<li>While the fires in the other buildings were actively fought by firefighters to the extent possible, in WTC 7, no efforts were made to fight the fires because of the lack of a water supply.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The differences in the fires were not meaningful for the following reasons.</strong> By the time WTC 7 collapsed, the fires in WTC 7 had advanced well beyond the likely points of origin on multiple floors (i.e., south and west faces), and points of fire origin had no bearing on the fire conditions when the building collapsed (i.e., in the northeast quadrant). <strong>Additionally, in each of the other referenced buildings, the fires burned out several floors, even with available water and firefighting activities (except for WTC 5). Thus, whether the fire fighters fought the WTC 7 fires or not is not a meaningful point of dissimilarity from the other cited fires.</strong></p>

<p>What? Are you being serious? How did I make both of those claims?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who says they all did? </p>

<p>The person I replied to said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controlled demolition can <strong>instantaneously remove 8 stories</strong> allowing the upper structure to accelerate downwards in free fall. The absolute free fall of Building 7 over a period of 2.25 seconds is by itself overwhelming evidence that fire could not bring have brought down the building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>had to have been removed over the span of 8 floors low in the building simultaneously <strong>to within a small fraction of a second</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning that he believes you must &#39;instantaneously remove 8 stories&#39; for the &#39;upper structure to accelerate downwards in free fall&#39;.</p>

<p>Re-read my reply. It&#39;s very obvious that I&#39;m arguing that explosives were <strong>not needed</strong> for the collapse due to the fire damage, and I backed this up by saying that explosives were not involved since they would not have survived seven hours of being on fire.</p>

<p>I get your point that &#39;maybe only three exploded&#39;, but if you say that only two or three explosives needed to work for the building to enter free fall then you&#39;re also saying that only two or three columns needed to fail for the building to enter free fall.</p>

<p>Are you now going to tell me that it&#39;s unreasonable for two or three columns to fail during a building fire?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make this even clearer:</p>

<p>Explosives weren&#39;t needed.</p>

<p>If you keep arguing that explosives were needed to &#39;instantaneously remove 8 stories&#39; and that this must have happened &#39;simultaneously to within a small fraction of a second&#39;, then there&#39;s a problem since there is no way the hundreds of charges required to do this would have survived the fire.</p>

<p>If you think they can survive then look at the detonators for explosives used in demolition or how thermite is ignited (magnesium strips, autoignition at 473C, WTC7 could have reached from 1,300C to 2,000C). The det cord, explosive caps, magnesium igniter, transmitters, timers, whatever, all needed to detonate the charges would not have survived the fire.</p>

<p>If, like you said, you then argue &#39;maybe only three exploded&#39; then... that completely invalidates the start of this argument. The only reason we&#39;re having this discussion is because people believe &#39;all 24 interior columns and 58 perimeter columns had to have been removed over the span of 8 floors low in the building simultaneously to within a small fraction of a second&#39; for free fall to occur, and that that <strong>requires a controlled demolition</strong>. And you just admitted that that is not what happened, as only a few of the charges might have gone off, and thus all columns were <strong>not</strong> removed instantaneously by explosives.</p>

<p>So the goal post moved from 8 stories were instantaneously pulverised <strong>with</strong> controlled explosives to maybe one or two charges went off to trigger the collapse. If you admit that only a couple of detonations were needed to cause free fall then how can you possibly say it&#39;s unreasonable that one or two column failures, due to fire, would cause the same thing?</p>

<p>That&#39;s cognitive dissonance.</p>

You were arguing that explosives can&#39;t possibly survive the fire, while at the same time arguing that no explosives were needed to bring down the tower. So let me repeat it again, you can&#39;t both argue that all explosives had to survive the fire AND that no explosives were needed.</p>

<p>If you argue that the buildings could&#39;ve come down without explosives, I can argue that one explosive was used because obviously one explosive could&#39;ve survived.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of belief, that&#39;s just physics, if you understand &quot;free fall&quot;, that should be obvious.</p>

<p>What? How can you argue that only three columns failed when three explosives were used when you argue that ALL columns failed without a single explosive?</p>

<p>1) If fire caused Building 7 to collapse, it would be the first ever fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise.</p>

<p>2) Building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

<p>3) According to a Zogby poll in 2006, 43% of Americans did not know about Building 7.</p>

<p>4) It took the federal government seven years to conduct an investigation and issue a report for Building 7.</p>

<p>5) 1,700+ architects and engineers have signed a petition calling for a new investigation into the destruction of Building 7, specifying that it should include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives.</p>

<p>6) Numerous witnesses say the possibility of demolishing Building 7 was widely discussed by emergency personnel at the scene and advocated by the building’s owner.</p>

<p>7) Building 7 housed several intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the NYC Office of Emergency Management’s Emergency Operations Center, more commonly known as “Giuliani’s Bunker”.</p>

<p>Building 7 was a 47-story skyscraper and was part of the World Trade Center complex. Built in 1984, it would have been the tallest high-rise in 33 states in the United States. It collapsed at 5:20 pm on September 11, 2001. It was not hit by an airplane and suffered minimal damage compared to other buildings much closer to the Twin Towers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Smoking Gun</strong>: Free fall occurred in Building 7&#39;s collapse for 2.25 seconds. NIST was attempting to cover this up, but a physics teacher called them out at the public draft hearing. Surprisingly, in its final report released in November 2008, NIST finally acknowledged free fall, but dishonestly placed it in bizarre framework that continues to deny its clear significance. This video series was created by the man who forced NIST to admit free fall occurred and displays the brazenness of the NIST WTC7 coverup.</p>

The core of the Bush Administration was predominantly made up of members of an organization called &quot;The Project For The New American Century.&quot; This group produced a document entitled, &quot;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses&quot; that said the &quot;process of transformation&quot; they wanted our military to undertake would take an excessively long time, unless there was a &quot;catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot; That document was written in September 2000. This document even cited that &quot;advanced forms of biological warfare that can &quot;target&quot; specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.&quot; A lot of the same people were part of a group that wrote a report entitled, &quot;A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm&quot; that advocated an aggressive Israeli policy in the Middle East.</p>

<h2><strong>Noam Chomsky and the Willful Ignorance of 9/11</strong></h2>

<p>In response to a question at the University of Florida recently, Noam Chomsky claimed that there were only “a miniscule number of architects and engineers” who felt that the official account of WTC Building 7 should be treated with skepticism.  Chomsky followed-up by saying, “a tiny number—a couple of them—are perfectly serious.”</p>

<p>If signing your name and credentials to a public petition on the subject means being serious, then Noam Chomsky’s tiny number begins at 2,100, not counting scientists and other professionals. Why would Chomsky make such an obvious exaggeration when he has been presented with contradictory facts many times?</p>

<p>I’ve personally had over thirty email exchanges with Chomsky. In those exchanges, he has agreed that it is “conceivable” that explosives might have been used at the WTC. But, he wrote, if that were the case it would have had to be Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden who had made it so.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter how many professionals or intellectuals are willing to admit it. The facts remain that the U.S. government’s account for the destruction of the WTC on 9/11 is purely false.  There is no science behind the government’s explanation for WTC7 or for the Twin Towers and everyone, including the government, admits that WTC Building 7 experienced free fall on 9/11. There is no explanation for that other than the use of explosives.</p>

<p>The obviously bogus “tiny number” statement from Chomsky is only one of several such absurdities the man uttered in his lecture response. Here are a few of the others.</p>

<p>“[Scientists seeking the truth about 9/11] are not doing what scientists and engineers do when they think they’ve discovered something. What you do, when you think you have discovered something, is you write articles in scientific journals [he admits to “one or two minor articles”], give talks at the professional societies, and go to the Civil Engineering Department at MIT, or Florida or wherever you are, and present your results.”</p>

<p>I’ve copied Chomsky on more than two peer-reviewed scientific articles in mainstream journals that describe evidence for demolition at the WTC. Therefore he knows that this statement is not true. And I’ve given dozens of talks around the U.S. and Canada that focused on the WTC demolition theory, many of which were at universities.</p>

<p>I’ve also pointed out that MIT’s civil engineering professor Eduardo Kausel made elementary mistakes in his public comments about the WTC disaster. Kausel claimed in Scientific American that the WTC towers were “never designed for the the intense jet fuel fires—a key design omission.”  Kausel also claimed that jet fuel from the aircraft “softened or melted the structural elements—floor trusses and columns—so that they became like chewing gum.”  At the risk of making a Chomsky-like exaggeration, I’ll venture that nearly everyone today knows that these statements are false.</p>

<p>Chomsky went on in an attempt to belittle, and downplay the sacrifices of, people seeking the truth.</p>

<p>“There happen to be a lot of people around who spent an hour on the internet who think they know a lot of physics but it doesn’t work like that.”</p>

<p>“Anyone who has any record of, any familiarity, with political activism knows that this is one of the safest things you can do. It’s almost riskless. People take risks far beyond this constantly, including scientists and engineers. I could, have run through, and can run through many examples. Maybe people will laugh at you but that’s about it. It’s almost a riskless position.”</p>

<p>Chomsky knows that I was fired from my job as Site Manager at Underwriters Laboratories for publicly challenging the government’s investigation into the WTC tragedy.  He knows that many others have suffered similar responses as well, including Brigham Young University physicist Steven Jones and University of Copenhagen chemist Niels Harrit, who were forced into retirement for speaking out. And although everyone knows that researchers and universities today depend on billions of grant dollars from the government, Chomsky implies that such funding could never be impacted in any way by questioning of the government’s most sensitive political positions.</p>

<p>The “hour on the internet” nonsense is ludicrous, of course, and Chomsky knows it well. Jones and Harrit have better scientific credentials than some MIT professors and we have all spent many years studying the events of 9/11. I’ve spent over a decade, and have contributed to many books and scientific articles, on the subject.</p>

<p>Pandering to the hecklers in the crowd, Chomsky summarized his simplistic (public) position on the events of 9/11.</p>

<p>“However, there’s a much more deeper issue which has been brought up repeatedly and I have yet to hear a response to it. There is just overwhelming evidence that the Bush administration wasn’t involved—very elementary evidence. You don’t have to be a physicist to understand it, you just have to think for a minute. There’s a couple of facts which are uncontroversial:</p>

<h1>1—The Bush Administration desperately wanted to invade Iraq. (He goes on to say that there were good reasons, including that Iraq was “right in the middle if the world’s energy producing region.)</h1>

<h1>2—They didn’t blame 9/11 on Iraqis, they blamed it on Saudis—that’s their major ally.</h1>

<h1>3—Unless they’re total lunatics, they would have blamed it on Iraqis if they were involved in any way.” He continues to say that “there was no reason to invade Afghanistan” which “has been mostly a waste of time.”</h1>

<p>Basically, these three “overwhelming” reasons boil down to one reason—Chomsky assumes that if the Bush Administration was involved it would have immediately blamed Iraq for 9/11. Of course, Bush Administration leaders did immediately blame Iraq for 9/11 and they did so repeatedly. That was one of the two original justifications given by the Bush Administration for invading Iraq.</p>

<p>Moreover, Chomsky most definitely received a response to his “deeper issue” when he received a copy of my new book Another Nineteen several months before his comments.  The book gives ample reasons—meaning actual overwhelming evidence—to suspect that Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and nineteen of their colleagues were behind the 9/11 attacks. After writing that he was “glad to learn about the new book,” he sent his mailing address for a free copy. Chomsky acknowledged receiving the book in August and wrote to me that he was “pleased to have a copy of the book, and hope to be able to get to it before too long.”</p>

<p>Therefore, Chomsky has either ignored the response to his one major concern for several months or he knows that his concern is no longer valid. What would make him feign ignorance in such a way?  Perhaps it is the fact that he would lose a great deal of face if he were to finally admit that there is much more to the story of 9/11.</p>

<p>Regardless, when a tiny number begins at 2,100 and “just overwhelming evidence” to exonerate the Bush Administration boils down to one bad assumption, we are again reminded of the power that 9/11 holds. When presented with substantial evidence for complicity on the part of corporate and government leaders, the obvious becomes either undeniable or an emotional cue to dissemble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order to understand that the 9/11 attacks were staged, it helps immensely to understand that the physical behavior exhibited by the collapsing towers is completely illogical, and impossible, except in the case that the towers were demolished by explosives. </p>

<p>To put it simply: in order for the buildings to fall to the ground at freefall speed or near freefall speed, the materials between the point of collapse and the ground would need to be ejected at the same speed as the building was collapsing, otherwise those materials would provide resistance, absorb the force of the collapse, and therefore slow the speed of the collapse. It is impossible for this material to have been ejected in the case of an organic collapse, as there is no possible place for the force of the ejection to have come from - not without diverting force from the collapse itself and therefore slowing the speed of the collapse. The only explanation for these additional forces is explosives.</p>

<p>Basically, what I&#39;m referencing is common sense, a high schooler&#39;s understanding of physics. When you drop a heavy object onto another solid object, the heavy object doesn&#39;t magically torpedo through the entire solid object - it meets resistance, the force of the heavy object&#39;s descent is slowed, and the heavy object no longer has the force to torpedo any further through the solid object. This is what would happen if the collapse of the towers were organic - the solid foundation of the buildings, without question, would have prevented the upper portions of the buildings from falling to the ground. Instead we see the upper portions of the buildings torpedo straight to the ground as if there was literally nothing between them and the ground. This is completely impossible without explosives removing the lower part of the building - which is exactly the reason buildings are demolished this way to begin with.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJNzaMRsN00">here&#39;s a neat 15-minute video that goes into the logic and demonstrates the physics experimentally. Very layman-friendly</a>  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZBcKeKllvU">here&#39;s a 20-minute video where mental health professionals attempt to provide psychiatric explanations for people failing to acknowledge the truth of 9/11. Basically, denial, pathological avoidance of cognitive dissonance, AKA being a pussy syndrome</a></p>

<p>Good luck to you OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if I remember bin laden refuted the claims about his involvement and said that from a dialysis clinic. His family says he&#39;s been dead since 2002. The confession video has Osama have darker skin, right handed, and wears rigs which is against bin ladens religion. Also didn&#39;t the owner of the trade center take out a huge policy on it on 9/10? Also everyone reported explosives not planes. Hardly anyone saw planes and a claimed chi fuck up. They had the tech then. Also the flight 93 thing, the parents got robotic sounding calls like &quot;hello mother this is Rick Sanchez&quot;, weird stuff also the height the plane was at, civilian planes didn&#39;t have the tech to call from that height. Also the cracks was a small hole, no wreckage. Same with the pentagon, no plane shape with wings, looked like a missile. They proved in the doc that the building HAD to have fallen by explosive showing it during freefal. Also. Vaguely remember that a news channel in the UK got the timing fucked up, too early. Not to mention them prooving thermite particles were in the dust. Also they proved that it would melt the steel, as a fireman said when interviewed, &quot;gasonline hasn&#39;t meltedsteel, it never has and never will. The fireproofing done on the building could hold more the the supposed load if the supports buckled, and had a higher heat threshhold. Wanna see an example of what a plane looks like when it hits a buildong, loo up when a plane flew into the empire state building in like the 30s. The plane wouldn&#39;t go far if at all into thebuildong, the exterior of the towers were strong enough to stop a planes. Also nearly zero wreckage. If I remember right they found a pristine plane engine (wrong engine too) and on hijackers pasdport. Also most of the hijackers were alive and living normal lives in the middleeast. Also molten steel burned for weeks in the elevator shafts. Gasoline doesn&#39;t do that. I find it easy to believe on the news the planes were cgi, maybe if something hit them it was a missile or particle beam (plane for a death ray have existed since Tesla was alive, also him discovering wireless electricity. They have engineered the public to mock anyone saying it was a conspiracy. It&#39;s as obvious as Watergate to me. It even took them actively going after an NBA employee just to believe him. America are terrible at executing cover ups. Also any footage that exists is low quality, we don&#39;t have any HD video to spot cgi. I mean these are the guys that supposedly taped over the HD footage of the moon landing and lost 1 ton of moon rocks. The footage broadcast was a video of another taping. Not to mention it obviously having scale issues and can set wires and stage lights.here&#39;s the tech level discrepancy, armstrong supposedly phones home on a Motorola phon, in 1969 before cell phones.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it&#39;s deceitful to say &quot;2,500 architects and engineers question the official story. 2,500 is a <strong>big</strong> number! Look at how big it is!&quot; without mentioning that there are literally millions of architects and engineers worldwide, and that 2,500 is a tiny percentage of that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that a few thousand doctors think vaccines cause autism, and a few thousand scientists think global warming isn&#39;t man made, and a few thousand historians think the Holocaust never happened, and a few thousand whatevers think something that clearly didn&#39;t happen did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to scrape the bottom of the barrel in a world of seven billion people and find a few thousand willing to back anything.</p>

<p>Edit--- seems from the article this was quite political. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear that a majority of the people in that room were voting not based on a rational examination of what happened to Building 7 but on how they feel and what they want to believe about what happened on September 11th,&quot; he observes. &quot;They were more concerned with the reputation of the AIA and were not willing to commit the AIA to taking a position on anything as controversial as the collapse of Building 7.&quot;</p>
