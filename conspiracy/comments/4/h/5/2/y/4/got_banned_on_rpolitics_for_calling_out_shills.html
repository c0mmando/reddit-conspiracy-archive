    <div class="md"><p>You can get the same treatment here (Rule 10).</p>

<p>How about, instead of screaming shill, point out the inauthentic tactic the poster is using and ask them to expand upon their thoughts?</p>

<p>Reddit is getting so boring with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>User 1: Low effort shill post.</p>

<p>User 2: Shill!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing useful there, at all.</p>

<p>Better with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>User 1: Low effort shill post.</p>

<p>User 2: That&#39;s low effort and ad-hominem/missing the point/etc. Why do you think that/can you expound on that?</p>

<p>User 1: Downvote/silence/actual response that starts an interesting conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the user <em>isn&#39;t</em> a shill, you might actually have good conversation. If they are a shill, it&#39;s pretty obvious to all watchers.</p>

<p>In that same case, pointing out their low-value contribution and lame tactic and asking them to provide something more substantive is so much better a way to point out shills than yelling &quot;Shill!!!&quot;</p>

<p>In case #1, the onus is on them to provide a valuable contribution. It becomes obvious to drive-by readers that the user is not authentic.</p>

<p>In case #2, <em>you</em> look like a shill and have doubled-down on low-value posts (and believe it or not, calling people who disagree with you a shill to discredit their opinion is actually a shill tactic. Have had multiple GMO shills call me a shill...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And so you argue points, not accuse them of shills. Point is, you&#39;ll never know who the shill is, and it&#39;s worthless to point it out and damages you. Are you seriously not getting that point?</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly inclined to believe you are the shill, because what you are doing is truly hurting the cause of exposing conspiracies and turning people away from our points when we do make them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what happens when you accuse someone of being a shill who isn&#39;t (which will happen since you never know). They argue their point looking for a challenge to their opinion. You call them a shill for saying their points and they just think &quot;wow, no wonder they believe what they believe, they dismiss all counter evidence as coming from a shill&quot; and they confirm their beliefs that we are all tin foil hat wearing wackos.</p>
