       Has anybody been there lately? The comment threads are just shitshows of anti-bernie communism rhetoric.. it's disgusting and clearly a huge contrast in the last week or so.. Here's my comment:

       You can get the same treatment here (Rule 10).
      </p>
      <p>
       How about, instead of screaming shill, point out the inauthentic tactic the poster is using and ask them to expand upon their thoughts?

       Reddit is getting so boring with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        User 1: Low effort shill post.
       </p>
       <p>
        User 2: Shill!!!!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing useful there, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        User 1: Low effort shill post.
       </p>
       <p>
        User 2: That's low effort and ad-hominem/missing the point/etc. Why do you think that/can you expound on that?
       </p>
       <p>
        User 1: Downvote/silence/actual response that starts an interesting conversation.

      <p>
       If the user
       <em>
        isn't

       a shill, you might actually have good conversation. If they are a shill, it's pretty obvious to all watchers.

       Yep, ask them to prove their point. The conversation ends their and the lolz, nazi, and racist comments come storming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I offered a person from this forum Reddit Gold to back up false claims. Ended with "Too easy!" and that was yesterday. I have a feeling I'll be waiting a long time before I get a legitimate response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have visions of someone furiously key smashing in google trying to verify their false claims only to hear them say "No, no, it can't be true! I know I'm right!!1; I'll just not respond and hope he forgets my handle".

       In that same case, pointing out their low-value contribution and lame tactic and asking them to provide something more substantive is so much better a way to point out shills than yelling "Shill!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       In case #1, the onus is on them to provide a valuable contribution. It becomes obvious to drive-by readers that the user is not authentic.

      <p>
       In case #2,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       look like a shill and have doubled-down on low-value posts (and believe it or not, calling people who disagree with you a shill to discredit their opinion is actually a shill tactic. Have had multiple GMO shills call me a shill...).

       And so you argue points, not accuse them of shills. Point is, you'll never know who the shill is, and it's worthless to point it out and damages you. Are you seriously not getting that point?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm honestly inclined to believe you are the shill, because what you are doing is truly hurting the cause of exposing conspiracies and turning people away from our points when we do make them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what happens when you accuse someone of being a shill who isn't (which will happen since you never know). They argue their point looking for a challenge to their opinion. You call them a shill for saying their points and they just think "wow, no wonder they believe what they believe, they dismiss all counter evidence as coming from a shill" and they confirm their beliefs that we are all tin foil hat wearing wackos.

       Number 1 rule in that sub is "be civil" looking at your posting history on there I can see why you got a 1 day ban.

       From "what are you smoking dude", through the shill comments to "offensive and you're an asshole. Did I miss anything" might be the kind of thing to avoid in future.

       Yeah that sub has changed tremendously in the past few days. Lots of correcting of the record going on. Amazing that it is confirmed that her campaign is sending shills to the sub so the solution is to ban calling it out.

       Right?? I'm glad I"m not the only one that noticed.. I guess most of the default subs are dead.. some of the lesser known ones are still great, of course but those big ones are just propaganda machines at this point.. I miss the old Reddit.

       The entire sub is ran by them.
       <a href="/r/technology">

       was ruined by shills that infiltrated and took over the sub.  The same bullshit we are with almost every default in existence.

       I just got banned from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . All I did was point out who any article/post that is anti-Hillary gets down voted immediately by shills.  Didn't realize you could get banned for that.  Since when did Reddit become the kings of censorship?

       It's funny because I can't even respond to any of the replies on my comments, so they automatically get the last word since I'm banned.  Well played $hillary campagn.. Karma's a bitch and this dirty pool will catch up to you one day.

       Well firstly, you can get banned on here for just calling out shills here (although there don't tend to be many shills here because it's
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, I'm sick of seeing Bernie Panders all over
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       so it's good to see that he is a fraud Marxist.

       He's not a socialist.  Get your facts straight.  I guess you'd prefer Hillary's socialism that just benefits the 1% which you will never be part of?  Well played.

       When he first won election to the House in 1990, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) embraced his political identity. "I am a socialist and everyone knows that," Sanders said, responding to an ad that tried to link him to the regime of Fidel Castro.
