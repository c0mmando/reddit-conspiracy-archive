       Not all Subreddits, like this one....but with most of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the years I have noticed a huge decrease in the amount of words being used in posts, a decrease in the willingness of responders or OPs to be open to opposing viewpoints, and an increase in overall conceitedness.  I read an article the other day saying that now over 50% of politically minded Americans think that the opposing political/ideological side is rooted in hate and doesnt want to help people....it hasn't been like this in a long time, and maybe the method sites like reddit use is one of the contributing factors in why we are seeing America become more divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         The reason I think this is occuring is a result of Reddit's use of the upvote/downvote system.  Posts should not be determined by the ratio of upvotes/downvotes, but by the total amount of upvotes.  Posts in which like 49% of people upvote and 51% of people downvote will always be moved to the bottom of the list and essentially silenced!  People are even shadowbanned for posting lots of posts that are only slightly controversial!  This is not fucking trolling....Something with like 99% downvotes would most likely be trolling...
        </em>
       </strong>
       *
      </p>
      <p>
       Controversial articles are good, it leads to people changing their minds and allows for actual public discussion.  There is a huge difference between someone stating something stupid and getting 99% downvotes and someone saying something very logical and rational with evidence to back it up and getting something like 55% downvotes....they are treated as the same on this site.  Its not just this site, tons of site have incorporated this method where posts that should become popular dont become popular because a slight majority disagree. At this point all reddit seems to be good for is for generating memes....just shit that a majority of people find funny.  You expressed an opinion that people already agreed with that might be wrong you are commended...you express an opinion that a minority of people disagree with that ends up being right you are punished. This is creating a hive mind of sorts, I even notice that in non-political subs that the hive mind mentality exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who are punished for having controversial views end up leaving certain subs or reddit all together, this leads to even more and more people having identical viewpoints that then influence others who have none or are young that are now only exposed to one view because everyone else has left or had been shadow banned that had another view!  On certain subs I get nasty responses for just expressing slightly controversial ideas, sometimes ideas that the vast majority of Americans would agree with, but the thing is that nearly everyone of these nasty responses sounds like the same fucking person!  On certain subs it literally seems that upwards of 90% of responders are the same person!  Not only are their viewpoints identical, but it appears that things like attitude, lack of kindness, and their willingness or unwillingness to read or not is the same as well!  Lots of posts in certain subs are INSTANTLY downvoted because they are over a paragraph long....so you seriously could even express an opinion that the majority would agree with, but they dont because maybe like 10% or 20% instantly downvote the post because it is a "wall of text"....People need to realize that "TLDR" summaries cant always get the point across, I try to write them but the TLDR version is usually 2 paragraphs which in of itself is too long for some to read...if you dont want to read it then dont fucking downvote....You could seriously express an opinion that 60% of people would agree with but because 15% of people instantly downvote it because it is a page long...it would also be silenced!  Maybe reddit should incorporate a system where if a post is like 5 paragraphs long, the person cant upvote/downvote it until 50 seconds or so!
      </p>
      <p>
       This all varies per sub, but I like to go out of my way to try and influence people towards what I think is right and just....what the fuck is wrong with that!?!  Sure Im not always right, but sometime I am...what if I did speak the truth and could influence someone?  Reddit only allows for people to be influenced by what is already popular.  If Galileo said the earth was round in 2030, even more people would have disagreed and would have had that false view for longer!
      </p>
      <p>
       This may seem unimportant or silly, but its very dangerous I think.  Here are some few examples....
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          During 2003 a slight majority of americans supported going to war with Iraq.  A lot have blamed the major media for this occuring....but at least major networks and such allowed for opposing opinions to be heard!  Imagine if the Iraq war happened in like 2030 instead and most politically minded people debated issues and learned about them on sites similar to Reddit....If a slight majority agreed going to war with Iraq, and someone who disagreed posted some amazing viewpoint on why it would be a bad idea...an idea that would change some opinions...well chances are that post and others like it would be moved to the bottom of the list and silenced even though something like 45% of people upvoted it.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Lets look at a more current issue.  So right now probably something like 50ish% of republicans support Trump.  Maybe like 25% of republicans hate him, for varying reasons.  Lets say the republican subs have like 55% Trump supporters.  Ok, so a republican historian sees a lot of similarities in Trump with dictators throughout history and has good evidence to back it up.  He posts his thought but they are almost instantly put towards the bottom even though lots of people upvoted him, but a slight majority of the mostly trump supporter downvoted him for talking against who they thought to believe would be the best president.  This may or may not be true, but lets say Trump did end up becoming a dictator....well people wouldn't have been properly warned beforehand and would have never known of the dangers.  You could post this in a liberal forum or another forum and it could be hugely popular.  People arn't right all the time though, and need opposing viewpoints!
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Go to a sub that is mostly anti-feminist and talk smack about feminists...you will probably get a popular post.  Now go to a sub with a lot of feminists and talk smack you will be put to the bottom of the list.  Thats a silly example, but imagine more important issues that could exist.  For example, if you could go to a sub that is made up of around 60% racist-minded people and you try to convince them to be better people and not be racist....Even though some people there arn't racist and applaud your post and wish more people in their sub to not be racist, it would have no chance at convincing the racists so much because it would be silenced because most of the racists instantly downvoted.  Another bad example probably, but do you see what Im getting at?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Best example would be an ACTUAL CONSPIRACY THEORY that ends up being TRUE!  Most assume that all conspiracy theorists are one in the same.  Lets say someone exposes actual evidence of some crazy shit going down, they try to post it and tons of people agree with them but the others instantly down-vote it because they think its just another "tinfoil hat wearer" and didnt even bother reading it!
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone start a petition to Reddit to end popularity being determined by the upvote-downvote ratio.  Lets try to encourage Reddit to determine popularity based upon the total number of up-votes and not the ratio!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a time period should be established for when you can upvote or downvote something.  If its a picture or a sentence you should be able to vote instantly or vote on it without opening it, but the longer the post is the more time someone should have to wait before voting to make sure they had a chance to at least read some of it.  Nothing too crazy though....this post maybe takes a couple minutes to read at most....the timer should be set at 20 or 30 seconds just so people at least read some of it.  This is kinda like people "reading a book by its cover", well its more like "People coming to a conclusion based upon just the title of a post"....Imagine if like 20% of all book reviews were just based upon someone looking at the cover and maybe reading the description on the back...or if someone reviewed a movie when they only watched the first 2 minutes...This and what I talked about above and both of these two things are the main reasons to why I think Reddit's policy is leading to a
       <strong>
        decrease in open discussion and logical thinking in american society!

       Seeing how much the media can wrongly influence the population, I had a lot of hope for sites like reddit and blogging in general.  Systems like this make it worse actually....Even though hosts on media outlets, like CNN or Fox News, often dismiss, ridicule, or insult those who express controversial ideas...at least they give them the fucking chance to express those ideas!  This is far worse imo....
      </p>
      <p>
       This site has so much potential, and I think just making it so popularity is determined JUST by the amount of upvotes would fix most problems!

       So if you posted "Aaron Swchartz was murdered" would it be downvoted out of existence or get you shadowbanned?  What if you did that and it got upvoted a ton on this sub, went to reddit's main page where most people downvoted...you started at like +1,000 votes then since it went to main page you went well under zero to like -1,000 votes...would that get you shadowbanned?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been wondering if that happens at all....

       Is this some kind of insult to show that you dont care about what I am saying?  Or are you generally busy right now, were intrugeud by my original statement, and wish to come back to read it later?

       Lol, I just spent like a few minutes reading about and figuring out what a tangent is in geometry....and what analogy you were trying to show by comparing what you meant to "In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that "just touches" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve."
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I think any harder, did you mean I was going off on a tangent?  Or you just talking about that the tangent is the point or line that helps to determine what is consider popular or unpopular in Reddit's voting algorithm?

       Haha, I was just thinking about Obi-Wan and how he might be my favorite Jedi.
      </p>

       I know it sounds like a tangent and thinking about this started off as a tangent but here is the thing....I did care back then but dont care now that I was shadowbanned from one of my accounts a few months ago for mainly simply trying to convince people that requiring the Line App to play with friends in the disney mobile game Tsum Tsum is a bad thing...Disney...Star Wars...crazy, force is strong with us.  A tangent off a tangents....its a never ending loop!  But I assure you, I have put a lot of thought into this to where its beyond just being another one of my tangents now and is actually a theory that could eventually be considered scholarly if more time is put into it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways Im pretty self aware, and do go on tangents all the time.  Most of the time I realize I am wrong or put too much attention on it a few days or weeks later...and most of these tangents are over things that greatly effect my life, this tangent was minor when compared to most.  I did post shit similar to this a couple months ago after being banned, but my outrage has faded away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spend a lot of time daydreaming about the future and past of mankind and how things happen....I just kept thinking about this, but not in response to my anger over being shadowbanned.  This wasn't like most other extreme responses or tangents I would go on before....I put a lot of thought into this and think that this is EXTREMELY dangerous, and I am not trying to be sarcastic or exaggerate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just keep thinking about all the times in history when great thinkers or scientists have come about and how they were jailed, ridiculed, or executed just because most of the population disagreed with them.  Its not nearly as bad now in this country, but this is still going on despite that people think we have progressed so far.  We have not reached the pinnacle of human understanding or science....people will come out and express truths that seem wrong to most at the time in politics, religion, etc...  I think its very important people are paid attention to that have controversial ideas or the next great thinker will come about and the same shit that has happened in the past will happen where they are discredeted because a majority disagrees when in fact it is proven later on they are right....this is the information age!  Fuck discovering great things later on when they are being stated now!
      </p>
      <p>
       You think this is a tangent lol, you should see the somewhat similar post I made right after being shadowbanned!  This post have its roots in being a tangent though...so your partly correct.  Its not so much against reddit, but more of the voting/popularity model that reddit uses that is being incorporated into other websties where people discuss shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds somewhat minor....but I really do believe that this type of thing is very dangerous and important.  This is how most people are going to learn about stuff and discuss stuff in the future...basing popularity on populism in things like science, philosophy, sociolagy, etc is very dangerous!

       Extremely flawed.  Its a learning process.

      <p>
       Not too flawed though, because I would have never came to the conclusion that I did without figuring out where I was wrong...Can tell tactics are improving because have posted 2 similar posts with much less success!  This is great improvement!

       I have pride, hence the 5 page post...its all due to the confidence I developed in my research!  If I had no pride I would have responded with "your gay stfu"...instead I persevered, mainly from the INCREDIBLE pride I have developed from debating, discussing, and thinking about this issue!

       Sad to see that something that is only one page long is considered "raving" now.  How long does a post have to be before it is considered raving?  What do we call a sentence long post with no explanations?  Typical?
      </p>

       Dont know where the middleground is....express an opinion, people downvote and say "but consider this..." which you already knew or believed.  In another post you go out of your way to show that you already considered or thought about stuff that people might argue and nobody reads it leading them to downvote it anyways...some even bring up counter arguments that you already adressed in the post!  This even happens in posts with less than a paragraph...seems too many jump to conclusions based just upon what the title says.  TLDR can only go so far!
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. - This is one of the only subs where I knew this post wouldnt be downvoted out of existence.  Karma is fragile cant afford another shadowban!

       Yeah you are definitely correct, the hive mind is alive and well and it's best promoters don't even know they are doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would take your original post a step further and say that often good ideas or interesting ideas don't even get any upvotes or traction, its almost just the luck of the draw whether a post gets up or down votes first. If it's detractors get there first, an idea's supporters will probably never even see it. An entire sub can effectively be controlled by a couple handfuls of very active users.

       So true!  I swear there have been a couple times where I posted something that was not paid attention that wasn't very important and was like related to videogames, art, or film....then months later its like a hugely popular idea floating around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont think I was original one who thought of them, probably other people stated similar shit too.  Like when new star wars came out I made a post called something like "OMG look at Finn when planets blow up he hears the people crying before he looks into sky!!! Is he Jedi?!?".  I was called an idiot a couple times and someone said interesting, then it was downvoted out of existence within a few minutes....In past month a few youtube videos popped up with 100,000s of views with people debating it and interested by it..one video credits some guy who posted about it on Reddit...and I know for a fact I posted about it, and probably other people posted about it, weeks or months before that guy did!
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy to think that could have been all me and someone stole my idea!  But probably a few others noticed and posted about it too and wern't given credit.  Some guy got credit for it because he either noticed it later on or heard about it in another post...he just happened to post at the correct time, had more friends on reddit, or used easier to read words or less text....Maybe he just had a stupid meme of John Boyegga making a stupid face attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never know if I should use cat memes or dog memes to get more votes....which works better for discussing politics or theories pertaining to societal injustice?  I tried a picture of an Orangatan sticking his tongue out...but was called an idiot because someone wanted a silverback instead.

       Yep, it's all part of the problem. They discourage rational thought. They encourage impulsive behavior. It all falls in line with our education system too. Maybe it's because they realize that this system might end up actually helping too much if it was designed well? Wouldn't want that! Reddit exists now as a means to propagate propaganda and nothing else. Aaron Swartz would be very sad indeed.

       Dont want to remind anyone they are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if someone is wrong and they dont know it or believe it then you should tell it to them and prove it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't really saying anyone was wrong in this post....well except maybe the people who decided upon the voting system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im talking more about hypothetical shit in the future.  If someone is wrong, but at that point in time it cant be determined if they are...its all just based on what they will think in the future.  Well they may or may not be wrong.  People convince people to think certain ways, and usually evidence or good points sway people...
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is not reminding them, its more so that they have the option to make up their own mind.  We are both wrong on many things probablly, but its more likely we would not be wrong or change our minds if we were open to more opinions.  Just because an opinion is slightly unpopular we may never see it on reddit because most people jump to conclusions and vote it down because they believe they are right....but what about you and me?  What if we wanted to read that and that would change our minds?  I just want people to have information available...and if information is popular but just not popular enough that should not mean that it should be removed from the site..
      </p>
      <p>
       If I said "Nobody wants to be wrong", I was talking more about how some people always think they are right and are unwilling to compromise or change opinions...because they are so scared of being wrong.  But these people who arn't open or downvote something because it isnt their politics, that would threaten people like you and me who might be more open to reading an article that might change our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did I say I want to remind them that they are wrong?  Just want people who are viewed as being wrong now, who are later right, to be given attention now rather than later...its more I want to remind people that someone was right way longbeforehand he was considered to be correct...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I could not want to be wrong, but that doesnt mean I wouldnt tell other people they are wrong...but that wasnt what I was trying to convey.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I got lost in my own words...you win?

       Reddit Died a long time ago.. if you are here to promote information you are wasting your fucking time.   It is best to salt all of reddit until it fades away.

       Yea, I was thinking that.  I dont know if it will fade away though is the problem.  People like to hear that they are right or have people agree with them.  Its contagious, and reddit as it is now only promotes this kind of attention seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I thought reddit and sites like it would just fade away I wouldnt care...but even if they fade somewhat this will just segregate ideas on the internet more...For example, in 30 years all people that like Cambodian cartoons might think that mexicans are over represented in the senate and all people that like vietnamese cartoons may think that we need more mexicans in the senate.  The two things have nothing to do with one another, but this is what I am witnessing now...well not that example but things like it!
      </p>
      <p>
       If reddit wont die, the best thing to do is try to make it so that open discussion and exchange of ideas can occur normally!  If I walked into a Town hall meeting with like 40% of people over 100 and yelled "People over 100 should be allowed to drive!" and got cheers from like 49% of people there I wouldnt just vanish!  Someone says something that lots of people agree with, its popular...its as simple as that and thats how it should be!
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Reddit will eventually fade away.  I hope.  But it isnt just reddit, lots of sites use this method and all will eventually have same outcome.  Do you have some evidence of reddit fading away....if you prove it to me I wont give a shit, and I will post this on the up and coming forum.

       I believe myself to be a counterexample...of the notion that's proposed by you guys and this post generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, I used to think israel was behind everything in the NWO. And now because of people here in r conspiracy I believe that not to be the case.  there are still people crying about jews but I think they are part of a larger catholic conspiracy that's been in play for nearly 2k yrs.  Which may be itself part of an even larger conspiracy of gnostics hiding behind layers upon layers of subterfuge.  This belief comes from a lot of research, and learning about true history in a way that I never studied in college.  I know a lot more now than i ever did then.  My beliefs have been turned on their head, and it's because of others, here, on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I now believe the satanic churches and what not in america to be a complete psyop, a kind of distraction to absorb the terror of an uncritical protestant extremist mob....who really doesn't understand that there is a subsurface of guile that is literally permeated throughout all their culture that is so vast as to be indescribable and incomprehensible until one gets the courage to pull at the strings.

       The whole Jesish nonsense is mainly for one reason...."Jews are news!".  How many Palestinians have died from Israeli occupation over the past 15 years?  Maybe 10,000 at the most....how many have died in the Congo from war?  5 million!  Its a joke, and the only reason people pay so much attention to it is because so many media outlets act like its the biggest fucking story of our time.  Imagine how many lives could be saved if they only paid the minor situation(in comparison) what it deserved....imagine the outcry over wars that have killed millions that could occur!  Instead people have been bitching about the a fucked up situation like its the biggest news event ever....but when it comes to human lives it doesnt even rank in the top fucking 20 for conflicts in the past 20 years...hell its probably not even in top 50.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just dont pay attention to the issue, its way overblown.  Honestly I think a bunch of Arab countries are just pissed off about losing the 6 day war and shit....They have a lot of money and media influence so keep fucking talking about it.  Wonder why so many muslims hate jews?  Because they are news and are constantly talked about...dont get me wrong Israel does fucked up shit...but there are other regimes in the world killing far more muslims thatn Israel ever has.  This media attention makes more people hate them....its silly...do yourself a favor and the world and dont even pay attention to it and pay to another world conflict that actually kills more than 2,000 people a year....even the conflict in Ukraine has killed more people than in Israel over past couple years.  More people have died in Syria in 4 years than palestinians have died in 100 years.  More people have died in Mexican drug wars over like 6 years that have died in Palestine in past 50.
      </p>

       It also gets new because its a rich country kinda near Europe.  European countries(which Israel is kinda of an extension) always get all the attention.

       Also I dont buy these religion conspiracies.  If any super secret orginization is doing demonic rituals and whatnot, or if they are christian or whatever... I bet they are just doing it to have fun and laugh and freak out the people they are fucking with.  I have no doubt super shady orginizations exists, but doubt they are rooted in some sort of religion....they are rooted in green and power.  Probably just more of a fraternity or party thing they do...doubt many are even religious.  I have no doubt some do super super fucked up shit and evil shit...but I dont think they are like evil because they are demonic or jewish or whatever...they are greedy and want power...that is all.  Greedy and want power....ohh ok, that explains the jew part!  Now I get it!  JK.  Glad you dont believe the religious secret society crap...sure some exists, but doubt they are based in religion, cults, or rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is kind of dying....most of the death and destruction in the 20th century was conducted by governments that were strictly atheist or by barely religios/atheist leaders who claimed to be religious but wern't.  Humans are humans and we are flawed...well some are, especially ones who tend to rise to power.  Outside of a few fanaticals, I dont think religion or a cult is going to be the reason for all the fucked up shit happening outside of Islam... but thats a newer religion that still has a few hundred years to go before it is as open and less strict and radical overall.  Probably the reasons humans have betrayed, killed, manipulated, and done fucked up shit before religion existed and once religion started dying in the 20th century.  Its all just a lust for power...thats it....if there is a super secret demonic or catholic or religious orginization controlling the world, that means they are probably too stupid to stay in power much longer...wouldn't suprise me if they were all just atheist or agnostic and were just doing all the religious ceremonies or making it appear they are a cult or religion for shits and giggles...maybe just to manipulate religious people into thinking they are more scary because they are the devil or something.  If they have that much power, they are too smart to believe in devil worship or some other nonsense.

       Im glad you keep changing your mind....I have been wrong about so much and still am.  But I think I'm a bit more right now lol.  Like what you said you think is going on now, thats kinda what I think is happening.  Everything is a mass distraction....most the news is nonsense or insignificant.  Major news gets attention, but celelberity gossip or constantly talking about Israel--Palestine instead of conflicts that kill 100x more for example is what Americans think are the most important things in the world.  A week of coverage for Prince....every week someone who is famous dies and its the major news story.  Someone semi-famous dies and it takes up a whole day...thats the biggest distraction of all.  The tabloid industry has taken over major media it appears....that way nobody who goes out of their way HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON.  Talk to most americans about syria, they assume that ISIS is teamed up with Assad and the Russians and they are fighting against us...Bring up that most the fighting is between the FSA, al-nusra, and Assad...and that ISIS isnt nearly involved...they would probably call you a conspiracy nut even though this is fact and most every person who reads shit in developed countries knows this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful though, even though more open minded people on here on this sub....say someone came out and proved that a popular conspiracy theory was wrong that most people believed on this sub...it would be instantly downvoted and no attention paid.  If you truly want to keep an open mind, scroll to the bottom of the posts for the day and click on shit with the most comments...those tend to be the most controversial and actually open your mind or critically argue.  The controversial tab is a joke, dont click that!
