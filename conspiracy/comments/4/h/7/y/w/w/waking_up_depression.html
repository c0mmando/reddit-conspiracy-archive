       Hi there, like-minded individuals,
Long-time lurker here, who just recently decided to become more active in the virtual conversation of our world and state (not sure if that's ideal, if half of what is discussed on this thread is true), and I want to open up a conversation about current realizations/perceptions/ideologies/observations and their influence on states of well-being. I realize that is a very vague categorization, but I think that is ok given my interest in a varied response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pose this discussion point because I find that the more I become what is commonly referred to here (and perhaps becoming a bit cliche) as "awake" to the real situation of our world and reality, the more I find it brings me down. I can definitely see how the pursuit of truth leads to a very nihilistic belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, I am not there yet. I somehow still have optimism for the future, though I am realistic in terms of the shit I see coming in the meantime, and want a new ideology (though I hate that word) to grasp, even if it's just for mental and spiritual survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in shorter terms, how in the heck do I get through the day? I spend my nights dreaming about bombs at sporting events, with large transforming boxes in the sky barking orders at the general public as we transfer violently into a purely militaristic state, and spend my days unable to enjoy any social interaction outside of work due to the bombardment of newly global idealistic agendas and independent-mind numbing reinforcement of capitalistic slavery. I can't eat my breakfast without thinking about Monsanto and the debates behind GMO foods that are, conveniently, the only brands of food within my budget, I can't finish the workday without at least one concerning realization about the relationship between the corporate world and our healthcare or our education or our economy or our prison system or our election process or our media providers or our constitution rights or.... the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in even shorter terms that were supposed to be shorter than all of that ^ in the first place (but who's really keeping score so here we are anyways type of terms), what does the road look like from here? How do we handle this shit? Aaaaaaand discuss. Sorry for the novel.

       I’ve arrived at the general conclusion that life on this planet is essentially a school for the development and evolution of our identities, and these identities are not limited to the physical bodies they are temporarily attached to and associated with while on this planet.  As a result, I just try to do the best I can with what I have while I’m here…and try not to worry
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much about how everything may or may not all turn out around me…because, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether the entire school I’m in (Earth) burns down or not so long as I do my best and pass my classes.  Then I can move on to the next step of evolution after this.

       There’s simply
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too much actual, documented, scholastically-based evidence strongly pointing toward the continuation of personal identity for anyone with even half a brain cell to conclude that there is “nothing” after the termination of any particular physical life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Ian Stevenson, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Robert Monroe, Dr. Eben Alexander, Dr. Raymond Moody, etc, etc, etc…
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Lots
       </em>
       of very seeeerious professionals, academics, and doctors have done some hardcore studies and have had some intense personal experiences that simply cannot be discounted or written off.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s just that we really and truly live in a prison planet.  It’s overtaken and run by entities (human and/or non-human) who work hard at making sure that the human population here remains in the dark, and stays perpetually ignorant of what is truly out there, of what we are truly capable of, of what we can
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       do.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, a lot of us spend our lives trapped in this tiny prison cell of very limited existence…but we still feel, we can still
       <em>
        sense
       </em>
       - somehow - that we are being trapped; that we are being held down, kept down, limited…Yet we don’t know what to do.  We don’t know what we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       do.  And since most of us are so overwhelmed by all the societal conditioning in society that consciously and subconsciously keeps telling us that we are “nothing but flesh and bones” and there is “nothing afterward” and “this is all there is” and that we are “limited to the extreme and short span of time in this life and this life only”…then we just feel fucking
       <em>
        overwhelmed
       </em>
       by this intense feeling of despair; this feeling that things CAN’T be this fucking horrible and this shitty and this dark and this limiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Right!?!?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  Right.  Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       why so many of us feel literally
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       claustrophobically exasperated and overwhelmed by life on this planet.  It’s because we are indeed made and composed of so much more than we’re being told we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I’m trapped here…for now…just like everybody else (or most everybody else).  I know there is likely not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much more I can do while in this life than I’m currently doing to educate myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know, however, that as I keep diligently searching and digging and trying to understand and discover more and more about what’s
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       going on, that I will continue to learn and grow and evolve more.  And I will get that much closer - every day, day after day, life after life - to finally being evolved enough to no longer have to suffer through the things that so many of us are currently suffering through.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks.  Yes.  But I know that it will not last forever.

       Please do not do this.  Please!  I'll be focusing on terrorism in the following (as there is a much better reason to be afraid of the veracity of NWO conspiracies)
      </p>
      <p>
       1) If terrorism were really a threat, you empower it by fearing it
2) In reality, it's much more complicated than the bad boys outside of America being the "terries."  Governments have used terrorism as a tool to control the masses, change direction of policies, and instigate wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be skeptical of it all. Realize that although you are gaining important information on the conspiracies alarge, the true power comes from
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being afraid.  I feel as if you are not integrating the knowledge in the most valuable ways.

       I totally understand what you are saying, and I don't buy into the MSM portrayals of "terrorism." However, I am becoming acutely aware of the incredible propaganda directed at us, the general public, and have realized that in the average day, the fear-mongering narrative will always be pushed at us somewhere, somehow. I think my dreaming about it speaks more to the fact that we are just continuously bombarded with fear-mongering war propaganda and it has leaked into the subconscious. Which, I guess is the point of propaganda...

       Seems like we are fighting a losing battle. Don't lose hope though. I'm just watching and rooting for somehow gaining real freedom/sustainability. Who knows how much time is left before we enter a new Era or our final days as a species.

       And that's where I think it can be hard to discern the line between literal freedom, and "freedom/sustainability" that is pushed at us. How do you know who or what to root for? One second I am rooting for Bernie Sanders because I'm thinking, holy shit, is this the momentum and representative we need? And the next second I'm like, well dammit I knew he was too good to be true and if anti-establishment proponents aren't fully behind him well then maybe its not what I thought it was...
      </p>
      <p>
       And in terms of the "new Era or our final days" that you reference, that is what I think terrifies and depresses me the most. The fact that we may be on the brink or in this era, and I am afraid of what it would bring, and that the majority of people I care about have no idea.

       It definitely can be depressing, but you have to first be happy that you aren't a sheep anymore and can help others see the truth. Secondly, understanding nothing is permanent is important. Knowing that more and more will become awake and that life has always been full of struggles, regardless of the time period. Be mindful and grateful for what you have and the people in your life. Knowledge is a constant pursuit in life, which has no end so don't become so consumed by the negative, as there is much positivity to learn as well.

       I agree.... Or at least I tell myself that a lot. The whole, well I'd rather know the truth than be blissfully unaware. But you're point about life has always been full of struggles definitely rings true. That even with being more aware of some things, the struggles don't necessarily increase, my perception of them just changes as my priorities change.

       No matter how much we plan in life, it doesn't mean it will end up that way. Right now I'm pretty helpless bc someone I love deeply is being screwed over by the FDA and govt. Completely helpless to watch someone who's done nothing wrong be targeted bc they've messed with someone's plan for a monopoly of full control and profits. However, I live day by day and I'm thankful for this awakening because it helped me regain my own brain, thoughts and life back. I am no longer consumed by the bullshit propagated around us. I also try volunteering more as that's helped me get back to reality. Helping others is truly rewarding. I also talk to my friend in the Ukraine who gives me a huge reality check as well. Someone who has to live off $6 a week in food and you start feeling like a dumbass for the shit you complain about.

       Coming up on the anniversary of my
       <em>
        food poisoning
       </em>
       saga. It really hit me today.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are days that I wish I had just let go. All would be done and over with by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've not had a solid shit in nearly a years time and it seems like such a disgusting remark for casual conversation but it is like slow death, torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Got fired from my job of six plus, years my first week back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have managed to get my roommate in a
       <em>
        get-around-chair
       </em>
       , get rain-gutters put up, a roof replaced, working on the siding that is falling off of his house...and some days it is just fucking hard to give a damn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday was that day. Today was that day. Tomorrow, I'll get out of bed and it just might be changed because you posted.

       To be honest, I read your reply with thoughts ranging from, this is a play on words with diarrhea, to oh shit this is serious, to oh shit I think maybe I can relate to some things they're saying here? 
Though, I hope your last sentence isn't sincere. Realistically, I hope it is sarcasm, and if it's not, that is incredibly inspiring and I wish I could be that optimistic.

       . . . coming to the realization that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       (nor anyone) can save the world. i think a lot of people go through the same thing, i think it's part of the process of our evolution; becoming aware of what's "real".

       For me, it has given me more drive to get to know me, as well as those around me.  To be more dependant on my life, and to take the time to use my body physically as well as the time to meditate.  It's a nice motivation to be more self sustaining in anyway you have available to you.  It's also a nice way to remember to love you're neighbors and your community.  We have to be the change we want to see.

       Sorry to be the one to break this to you, and I doubt it is going to help with the depression, but

       How long has it been since you woke up? It took me the better part of a month to start coming down from a roller coaster of emotions (or to use a different metaphor, to start climbing out of a deep, dark despair). But I'm good at putting my emotions in check, so I suppose for most it probably takes longer. So depending on how fresh it is for you, you will hopefully start to get more even keeled in the near future.

       I recommend searching through postings here, as you are definitely not the first to try to spark a conversation about this issue. In previous posts like this, I've seen people counsel trying to get your priorities straight and also planning on a way to recede from society, buy some farmland and become independent. There is also a set of communal living arrangements for people who are trying to live outside the MATRIX. I can't remember what they're called, but a search of this subreddit should be able to turn something up. Good luck to you!

       I idk about those walt whitman pdf's I just read. It could just be a dude writing poetry with collective consciousness programming spilling out through some of the words. But a lot of his poetry is still realy dope, transcendent, and applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just felt like those pdf's are reaching. But I'd have to do my own research

       I don't know what you mean by "those walt whitman pdf's" because I only posted
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       pdf to walt whitman. The other was to the salem witch trials. I think the pdf (singular) on whitman may sound like a stretch if read in isolation, but if you go back and read Miles's earlier stuff, for example on
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/beat.pdf">
        Theosophy
       </a>
       and the
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lincoln.pdf">
        Lincoln assassination hoax,
       </a>
       it makes more sense and seems much more plausible.

       Yea I meant the singular whitman pdf...read the whole thing.....wasn't sure about your other link....so accidentally assumed it was another on Whitman.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, Whitman says some transcendental things that by themselves are inherently true, and really powerful to live by and adapt to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the character himself.....if he was some archetypal shill or a theosophist or part of secret societies or all the other things said about him....yeah, perhaps they might be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       y whole point was, transcendentalism itself, is legit, and an awesome way to life your life and it helps the newly awakened critical thinkers to cope with going down the rabbit hole without a complete and utter melt down

       For me it went from a journey outward exploring new thoughts and ideas to one inward and sepf reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly reforming your worldview (and self-view - if that makes any sense) can be painful and difficult as you slowly and inevetiably break yourself down and build yourself back up after you hack away at the programming (TV, media, schooling) you grew up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, by focusing inward and healing your mind, you can then progress to healigng your body as you can better care and control of what goes in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it takes time. Just know that there are those here who did it and are still doing it, and those who have yet to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we are all in this together. And I get comfort from that.
And you should too.

       The USSR got their 70 years of a Secret Police State.  Now it's the West's turn.  Grow the fuck up and see how it feels for the next 70 years.

       Kinda funny, too, how easy it was to scare the U.S. into giving up all its rights.  All it took was 4 alleged hijackings &amp; 3 buildings.  No invading army.  No nuke.  Gotta admit, Americans embraced Walmart &amp; Monsanto &amp; deregulation of media ownership &amp; corporatism.  Stupid Americans.  Enjoy your STASI lifestyle/lifespan.

       Hey OP,
I've been into the critical thinking(conspiracy) game since high school, when one of the seniors who saw I was always questioning everyone, gave me a copy of Behold The Pale Horse by William Cooper to borrow....mind blown!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is good in this world. Love, people helping others, family, children, the potential in people, the spirit realms and the messages that come from Near Death Experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get out of the house and go for walks, meditate, learn to just be, to accept, to do the best you can do by helping wake up others.....no need to go into depression....why? Because we are literally in a global war right now, and the evil hasn't won just yet.....this is an info war, intellectual war, psychological war,and spiritual war.....and its constantly shifting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Monsatan's poisons for example. Now majority of people want non-gmo and food with as little glyphosates as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the Federal reserve....more and more people keep mentioning that it needs to be audited, as it enters into the collective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the elections, people are starting to really question them and see them as rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the redacted 28 pages from 9/11 Commission, its now slowly being leaked because a few congressmen made some moves to find out what's in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the fluoride that we all knew was poisoning the pineal gland and lowering IQ's, finally a harvard study admits and towns across the U.S. are slowly getting it taken out of the local water supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need the Grand Context OP, you need to see that its a dynamic and active war on a number of levels.....this whole thing is a loooooooong way from being over

       No matter how much we plan in life, it doesn't mean it will end up that way. Right now I'm pretty helpless bc someone I love deeply is being screwed over by the FDA and govt. Completely helpless to watch someone who's done nothing wrong be targeted bc they've messed with someone's plan for a monopoly of full control and profits. However, I live day by day and I'm thankful for this awakening because it helped me regain my own brain, thoughts and life back. I am no longer consumed by the bullshit propagated around us. I also try volunteering more as that's helped me get back to reality. Helping others is truly rewarding. I also talk to my friend in the Ukraine who gives me a huge reality check as well. Someone who has to live off $6 a week in food and you start feeling like a dumbass for the shit you complain about.
