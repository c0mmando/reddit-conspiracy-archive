       First, Brexit weakened the EU as well as Britain's influence on the EU, which completely benefits Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the DNC was hacked by the Russians and released by wikileaks right before the convention. Both Putin and Assange are known to despise Hillary. Also, Donald has said he wouldn't help NATO allies if they don't pay, as well as saying the Russians aren't that bad (statements that would have caused the GOP to crucify you 5 yrs ago). In addition, Donald wants to stop wasting money on military bases overseas, which would benefit Russia. His campaign manager used to work for Pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Isn't this all very suspicious?

       I think he truly loves/wants what's best for Russia. However, like all political leaders, he's shady and corrupt, though. He's also a lesser of evils via the East NWO.

       Putin has never gave me a reason to not trust him therefore I trust him More than any western politician.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I know about Putin is what I'm told by western media. That being said western media is by far the least trustworthy source of information known to man.

       What about his role in the brutal false flag

       He often uses his group of young Nashi thugs to harass and/or kill people.

       I've seen a lot of Russian documentaries about him and his government, and it sure seems like any other evil gov.

       Russia is in bed with all the scumbag corporations the rest are, and Putin has even tried to make his own globalist network (whose name escapes me) modeled on the EU.

       So are some of the most "well respected" western media outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The BBC, for example, is owned by the government and controlled by political appointees. Yet we in the west are told that they are the most trustworthy news organisation on the planet.

       What’s this? The American government actually holding someone to their word rather than forcing the US population to pay for the difference? How horrible!

       They aren’t. Russia and the US were once best fucking buddies. Why do you think they sold us Alaska? To spite the British. Why do you think they ALMOST sold us everything in Asia east of 160ºE? Why do you think the Russian Empire sent their navy to Boston harbor during the Civil War? To spite the British and French and to tell them that if they dared intervene in the Civil War that Russia would join on the Union side.

       Russia–her land, her culture, and her people–was raped by the commies for that very reason. She was only a puppet. Russians were never the enemy. Bolsheviks were. And still are.

       In Europe and the middle east. So? Why should we be forced to pay to police the world? Why should we be dragged into others’ wars? Why should we pay to be their defense budget? Why should we do any of this without anything in return?

       The time is fast approaching when the US will cast off its government (overt and covert) and the world will tremble in fear at the American people and the revenge we will demand from for the last 70-100 years of thankless suffering and toil.

       Don't trust him, but don't think he wants to take over the world, either. Just wants Russia to have dignity and some power.

       I agree.  I've listened to his speeches.  What's interesting is he tells you some truth.  One does not get truth from american politicians.  We get half-truths and flag waving.

       You don't get to where he is by being a nice guy spreading truth and love (he's a brutal, totalitarian, billionaire), however it's in his best interest to air out America's dirty laundry which makes him a decent source of information.

       Unfortunately, Putin is a ticking time bomb when it comes to things. So does china and any other communist country. But in this state the west is seen worse because it in fact is worse (More like setting foot for a demise).
