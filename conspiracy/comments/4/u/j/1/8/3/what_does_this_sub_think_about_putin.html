<p>Now, the DNC was hacked by the Russians and released by wikileaks right before the convention. Both Putin and Assange are known to despise Hillary. Also, Donald has said he wouldn&#39;t help NATO allies if they don&#39;t pay, as well as saying the Russians aren&#39;t that bad (statements that would have caused the GOP to crucify you 5 yrs ago). In addition, Donald wants to stop wasting money on military bases overseas, which would benefit Russia. His campaign manager used to work for Pro-Russia officials in Ukraine. Isn&#39;t this all very suspicious?</p>

<p>He often uses his group of young Nashi thugs to harass and/or kill people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of Russian documentaries about him and his government, and it sure seems like any other evil gov.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a clever guy, and is often quite amusing, but he&#39;s the same as the others. </p>

<p>Russia is in bed with all the scumbag corporations the rest are, and Putin has even tried to make his own globalist network (whose name escapes me) modeled on the EU.</p>

<p>And yet…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, Donald has said he wouldn’t help NATO allies if they don’t pay</p>

<p>What’s this? The American government actually holding someone to their word rather than forcing the US population to pay for the difference? How horrible!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Russians aren’t that bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They aren’t. Russia and the US were once best fucking buddies. Why do you think they sold us Alaska? To spite the British. Why do you think they ALMOST sold us everything in Asia east of 160ºE? Why do you think the Russian Empire sent their navy to Boston harbor during the Civil War? To spite the British and French and to tell them that if they dared intervene in the Civil War that Russia would join on the Union side.</p>

<p>Russia–her land, her culture, and her people–was raped by the commies for that very reason. She was only a puppet. Russians were never the enemy. Bolsheviks were. And still are.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>FUCK YEAH.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which would benefit Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Europe and the middle east. So? Why should we be forced to pay to police the world? Why should we be dragged into others’ wars? Why should we pay to be their defense budget? Why should we do any of this without anything in return?</p>

<p>The time is fast approaching when the US will cast off its government (overt and covert) and the world will tremble in fear at the American people and the revenge we will demand from for the last 70-100 years of thankless suffering and toil.</p>

<p>I smell annexations. And that’s a good thing.</p>
