<p>Edit: this doesnt sound like a pro hillary speech at all. It sounds like a &quot;I am with you if you are still with me&quot; speech. No fucking mention of Hillary at all yet. </p>

<p>Oh jesus, I hope this is real. I cant vote for Hill or Trump. Its Gary or Bernie only. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who needs superheroes. We just need people who can be human beings before playing silly roles of democrats, republicans, libertarians, etc. If his loyalty was truly aligned with humanity, there&#39;s no way he would endorse Clinton. But he still chose to be a trooper for a party that pretty much conspired to fuck him over from the get-go. There is no validity to the &#39;lesser of two evils&#39; rhetoric this election season. Both candidates are walking disasters. He needs to wisen up and call an ace an ace and a spade a spade if he is indeed a man of integrity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only at the end, and after he shoved her own catch phrase in her face. He said &quot;I am with you&quot; pointing to all the Bernie chanters&quot; ratyet than delivering her tag line of &quot;I am with Her&quot;.</p>

<p>75 percent was him talking Bout his campaign, his platform and looking forward to the rollcall vote tomorrow (unprecendented that, when there is only one candidate in the race) no need for roll call unless they want the votes public. </p>

<p>That LAST part of the speech he talked of her, but mostly in a &quot;she worthy because she is finally incoporating my ideas&quot;</p>

<p>He is playing both outcomes - if they vote for him, he will take it. If they stick with Hillary, he will support it. The majority of that speech was him talking about his platform and campaign, not hers.</p>

<p>Every pundit said he had to deliver and unequivical full supoort speech of clinton tonight to calm down his suporters, get them.in line. That, he did not do at all. He got himself a rollcall tomorrow. Thats amazing. Yes, he would support Clinton if she wins, but why even have a roll call if she is garanteed to win? Why does he look forward to it right after he tells &quot;us&quot;, that he is with &quot; us&quot; admist cheers of Bernie Bernie! when Clintons suporters are all using the tagline &quot;I am with HER&quot;. </p>
