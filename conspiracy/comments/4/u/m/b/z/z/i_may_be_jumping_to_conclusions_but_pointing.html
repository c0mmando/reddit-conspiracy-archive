        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Experts (third party sources channeled through the Clinton campaign) say that the DNC hack was done by the Russians because Trump is friends with Putin. So you&#39;re telling me the Russian government, who has one of the most advanced intelligence agencies in the world, hacked the DNC, and accidentally left a signature in the Cyrillic alphabet. It&#39;s gotta be Russia because the hack took place during Russian daylight hours? Sorry, but Occam&#39;s Razor says no.</p>

<p>The simpler explanation is that Clinton wanted Wasserman Schultz on her team and there was no elegant way to do that without admitting that the chair of the DNC has been in her corner all along. So they turned it into an offensive move. They released the emails, faked a hack, and Wasserman steps down, allowing the DNC to &quot;make amends&quot;. The Clinton campaign then snaps her up within 24 hours. So now, you&#39;re not just uniting your base against Trump, you&#39;re uniting it against Trump AND the looming threat of the unpredictable Reds across the sea. Every word of the rhetoric of this year&#39;s convention has been about party unity. I think we just underestimated exactly how dirty the DNC is willing to get in order to impart that message.</p>

<p>It seems to me that if Russia wanted to rig a foreign election, they wouldn&#39;t be so sloppy as to leave footprints. If I&#39;m right, I almost respect them for the brilliant con. If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m now a nutjob conspiracy theorist. Either way, I can&#39;t shake the feeling that we&#39;re being duped by some crazy systematic sleight of hand.</p>

<p>Edit: Formatting, wording for clarity.</p>

<p>Update: I was <a href="http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/dnc_update.html">wrong</a>! An independent cyber-security firm confirmed the findings. It was a fun ride while it lasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sensible people shouldn&#39;t give a shit about who performed the hack anyway. The focus should always be on its legitimacy and the content disclosed through the hacks. It&#39;s not like Russia manufactured the intel even if they were behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely, but I&#39;m concerned that the legitimacy of the content won&#39;t be part of the larger narrative. Wikileaks has enough credibility as an organization for the veracity of the emails to be perceived as a given, especially since Wasserman has already stepped down in response. I&#39;m really interested to see how the story unfolds in the next couple weeks.</p>
