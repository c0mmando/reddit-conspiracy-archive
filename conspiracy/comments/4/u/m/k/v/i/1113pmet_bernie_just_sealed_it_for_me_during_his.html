    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It&#39;s beyond disgusting!
How can Hillary get away with being so arrogant as to immediately bring the shamed DWS onto her campaign, when the DNC is publicly admitting (and blaming it all on her) she singlehandedly rigged the election on 100% her own accord? WHY ISNT THIS BEING TALKED ABOUT?! We all need to do ourselves a favor and cancel our cable subscriptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mind boggles. The FBI wants to investigate the hack itself rather than what the hack uncovered.</p>

<p>WTFF!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my two cents: I always thought of Snowden as being controlled opposition, as in Snowden was their way of letting us know we are being spied upon. I think the email hack is their way of letting us know this ain&#39;t no democracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing though, I completely see what you mean cuz I can see how he would have been a pawn too. But at the same time, if he was a pawn, why did the media censor him so incredibly much. They always twisted his words, always created lies about him and ALWAYS put the heat on him when he was live and he still managed to make them look like fools. I was even at one of his rally&#39;s in New Haven, CT and somebody fainted during the rally and the guy stopped the whole speech to make sure that dude was okay. Bernie is a genuine guy and I honestly believe that he was threatened and pressured a little too hard behind closed doors to endorse Hillary and end his cute movement. Because he literally just flip-flopped out of the f****n blue when that happened. Plus if he was a pawn I&#39;m not sure as to why Hillary&#39;s entire campaign spent millions of dollars to troll him and strategically bash him if she already knew he was going to cave for her in the end. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious to me that it is PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE to vote specifically to keep a member out of the Presidency, rather than voting for the RIGHT PERSON.</p>

<p>People are likely to vote Trump over Hillary, and TPTB know this. Trump is butt buddies with the Clinton&#39;s................................................</p>

<p>Anyway, Ron retired after 2012 campaign and refused to capitulate to RNC talking points and thereby chose not to speak at the convention. Bernie is and has been a mealy-mouthed do-nothing his whole career. To compare Ron to Bernie is express ignorance of what Ron accomplished and what he stood for. You probably don&#39;t know it, but the RNC committee changed the Party Rules <strong>during</strong> the Primaries to keep Ron off the convention ballot. The details are out there - you should read about it.</p>

<p>You might be surprised by the Libertarian stance on certain issues. Legalize drugs? Yep. Justice reform? Yep. Basically, they want to follow the Constitution and get the Federal Government under control. It makes a lot of sense. Johnson was former governor of New Mexico. Weld was former Governor of Massachusetts. They have the experience and the vision to actually start fixing things in this country.

<p>That&#39;s not necessarily true. It could have large benefits for the average person in that it reduces the overhead of doing business. You look at big business, who have already figured out how and can afforded to get around paying taxes, meanwhile those corporate taxes are really hurting the small business.</p>

It was never about the lay people, it was always about the capitalists. And the capitalists are the ones in control right now (and if I recall correctly since president Carter). The only reason people in America seem to think capitalism has ever worked is because every other capable country was trying to catch up after the destruction of WW2. I&#39;m interested however in how things turn out now. I really wish it is for the best of both, the Americans, and for the foreigners. (I have this dream to work at Boulder, CO too..)</p>

<p>we&#39;ve only discovered one means to effectively govern--or so we say</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to read up on some history. For example check out sortition from ancient Greece.</p>

<p>Also.. I don&#39;t understand how you can write everything you just did, but advocate for a world government? Corruption seeps into every power center. No matter what schemes are devised for accountable governance.. after a few hundred years corruption will have found it&#39;s way back in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is normal to hold out hope against hope that somehow the system is going to revert to what it used to be, or to what they told us it was. But, the system was never what they said, and nothing is going to &quot;change&quot; no matter how hard we &quot;hope&quot;. </p>

<p>The USA is not a democracy. It is a type of Fascist state where the elections, political parties, and the government are controlled by the wealthy people and corporations. </p>

<p>The US has 319 Million people and 2 political parties. Think about this fact for a moment.</p>

<p>The only way out would be massive organization. Most people are too busy working, or too burned out, or drunk, or high, or watching TV or porn or whatever to know or care.</p>

<p>We have no good future ahead of us. </p>

The 28 pages are just a ploy, because ultimately we are going to throw down the hammer on Saudi Arabia to make way for a Greater Israel project. Everything since 9/11 has been a conjoined effort towards the Greater Israel, including Syria, Libya, Iraq, and probably within the next decade we may see a war with even Iran, especially if Mrs. Clinton is to be the commander in chief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m voting for him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the system has been designed to make people <em>counter-vote</em>. So, for instance, whenever I encourage someone to vote for Johnson they always say the same thing: &quot;You are wasting your vote because he can&#39;t win.&quot; After I explain to them that is a self-defeating approach to voting. They follow up with &quot;You have to vote for major candidate A because major candidate B will win otherwise.&quot; (Insert the Democrat/Republican pair for A and B). So people never end up voting <em>for</em> someone, instead they vote <em>against</em> the other guy from the pair given to them by the MSM and DNC/RNC. </p>

<p>Essentially it amounts to the perfect system of fake democracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure why <em>anyone</em> expected Bernie to be the real deal. I&#39;m not from the US though, so I&#39;m just watching the circus from the outside, but it was quite obvious from the start that it was all a charade and that Bernie and Trump are actors on the pay roll of Wall Street, Israel and the military industrial complex. They might claim otherwise, but it&#39;s really nothing more than empty rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find little peace in joining you all in this thread. It saddens me that Bernie did not stand up for himself. I&#39;ve seen more pro Bernie car stickers than any other candidate. Trump came second, then Hillary for prison in third. Believe me, I&#39;ve been counting. </p>

<p>All I can say now is this...I hope we&#39;ve been wrong all along about Hillary. I hope she does a good job. I hope her actions succeed in Bernie&#39;s vision, after she constantly claimed they were the same. I hope we don&#39;t fuck with international matters that we don&#39;t belong in anymore. I hope she does indeed make the banks to &quot;cut it out&quot;. I hope universal healthcare becomes a reality. I hope our theories about her remain just theories. But I know I&#39;ll be proven wrong on most of those. If we lived in a world where those would be realities, then Bernie would have won...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately both Hitler and Jackson also had the awful vice of targeting an ethnic group with violence. So no they weren&#39;t our saviors by any means. But unlike most of what we always hear, they did hold to other ideals that went a long way toward it. It&#39;s very unfortunate b/c so much of the good got thrown out with the bad -- and that is largely why things are the way they are today.</p>

<p>I&#39;m entirely in agreement about the system.  It&#39;s a fucking farce.  A blatant, open, festering wound, and they need to realize it.  That&#39;s why I say first step, flick your affiliation back in their face.</p>
