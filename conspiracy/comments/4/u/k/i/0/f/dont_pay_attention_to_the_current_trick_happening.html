       1.The Elite know nobody likes her
      </p>
      <p>
       2.She is revealing the criminal aspect of the current political system
      </p>
      <p>
       3.A Clinton Foundation leak would expose her foreign sabotage of US for her foundation  interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.If you pay attention to media undertones, Clearly  Mika Brzezinski is the only Liberal media figure criticizing Hillary, but she is the most important one, and this tells us something is up...hmmm...Mika calls Wasserman for resignation in May and bam! Wasserman is gone in two months later!
      </p>
      <p>
       5.The Elite would never force an obviously hated and corrupt Leader when they can trick us with a seemingly harmless one we believe in to help us. This is the real magic trick, the one we don't see in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while Hillary may step down or lose, she was the real distraction the whole time. This is the clever slight of hand.

       Honestly doesnt even matter. Everyone is all like "The corrupt elite are being exposed and the NWO is crumbling!" and I'm all over here like "Ok so their plan A isnt going so great, they just gonna move to plan B and in all honestly plan B frightens me."

       Here's what my fear is, my fear is Trump will win because at this point, everyone hates Hillary and when Trump is announced the winner, that's when the Illuminati will cause the biggest false flag tragedy ever, allowing Obama to suspend all elections and remain president and declare martial law; Because like Rush Limbaugh and so many others have said, I don't think Obama is going to give up the presidency without a fight and as I said, I don't think enough people like Clinton at this point to vote for her.

       Thats is my exact concern as well. That plan B is a massive false flag attack to suspend the election. Judging from all Obama's executive orders and the Patriot Act its like they have been preparing for a state of emergency for years.

       Yes they have, I've been telling everyone, between now and November, if they don't already have an underground bunker filled with food and supplies to last for up to three years, they should because come November, shit's going to get frightening.

So if they choose i need to die for them to obtain power they can go right ahead. i refuse to be afraid and i refuse to live in a fascist world. Bring on the apocalypse! Just give me a 5 minute warning so i can smoke my last joint and drink my last beer!

       I dont deny something is coming. I too believe something is coming. But people going underground in 2012 isnt going to scare me. In fact nothing will scare me. I let it get to me for a while but lately i have the "oh well" attitude. I plan to live my life to the fullest up until my time is up. I have a plan for survival in the event i need to. But i wont make a plan for an apocalypse. Id rather die than live in a fascist world.

       Hillary will win and we've all known it to begin with. You really think the elite would put Trump in? He's too uncontrollable for the Jewish lobby to be sure of him.

       If Trump

       controlled opposition, he would superficially appear to be a bad goy, but his policies would all serve Jewish and Israeli interests. He’s not.

       Did he not say on the very same day “Israel will pay us if they want our protection”? Did he not repeatedly cancel his trip to fellate the wall? Did he not push the Overton window backward 30 years with one sentence? Has he not repeatedly and consistently undermined their every whim (globalism, free trade, open borders, anti-nationalism, racial pride) during the entire campaign?

       How does that address his choice of VP?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he's not a friend of Israel (which is what he said he is), that would mean he's lying about at least one thing, so what else is he lying about? He's telling you what you want to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's pretend he really is a friend of We the People, and he gets elected and he rebukes the globalistic, monopolistic powers subverting our constitution. This a pipe dream, but let's say this is how it goes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       He'll get bumped off, and Pence will be right there to bring the establishment back.
      </p>
      <p>
       A VP choice is important you know, if you die it's who takes over. How can you defend Pence?

       Thats is my exact concern as well. That plan B is a massive false flag attack to suspend the election. Judging from all Obama's executive orders and the Patriot Act its like they have been preparing for a state of emergency for years.
