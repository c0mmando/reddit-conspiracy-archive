    <div class="md"><p>So, has anybody checked this list for accuracy? I looked at the first one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/578">DNC member killing horses for insurance money.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what the email says. The email says &quot;Finance asked us to vet as potential POTUS host/donor. &quot; And the response is &quot;I vote fail....again.&quot; </p>

<p>So a potential donor was rejected. Nothing about a DNC member.</p>

<p>If the first item is this bad (a total lie), what about the rest? </p>

<p>Apparently there&#39;s some real dirt somewhere in the emails, since Debbie Wasserman Schulz resigned, but if there is, lead with the real ones, not this fake shit.</p>

<p>Damn, I have to go to work, I don&#39;t have time to read these. Another false headline—two, actually—is &quot;DNC Hillary supporters infiltrated Sanders campaign&quot;/&quot;A mole working inside of the Sanders campaign&quot;. Those emails actually say that the only information they have is a Facebook post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you missed the part, below that... So I&#39;ll quote -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>George Lindemann Jr. was a highly-ranked rider, Olympic hopeful, and heir to an $800 million fortune. In 1990 he hired Tommy &quot;The Sandman&quot; Burns to electrocute his horse, Charisma, in order to collect on a $250,000 insurance policy. Lindemann was convicted of three counts of wire fraud in 1995 and was sentenced to a 33-month term in federal prison with two years probation after his release. He was sentenced to pay a $500,000 fine, $250,000 in restitution to the insurance company, and the cost of his prison stay. He was expelled from the American Horse Shows Association (&quot;AHSA&quot;), and upon his release, filed a $100 million antitrust suit against the AHSA for refusing to allow him to compete. Federal investigators believe that over 50 horses were killed between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s in acts of insurance fraud. Lindemann was one of 23 people indicted for charges related to the scandal, which received national media attention at the time and rocked the world of equestrian sports. </p>
