        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It verifys everything that Bernie supporters were saying about him being silenced and thwarted at every turn by a committee that had already predecided its candidate, but it also implicates multiple news agencies for conspiring with the DNC. </p>

<p>It seems like there was one day of Revelation where political news sources took the story, but even they didn&#39;t dig much deeper than five fairly vague emails out of the 20,000(?)</p>

<p>Now it seems Wasserman will probably resign but that takes the bullet for Hillary who dodged this one too- as if she didn&#39;t give them her blessings to do whatever it took.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the widespread voting fraud will fade into the memories of just a few. The public for the most part already thinks Bernie Sanders is out of the race.</p>

<p>We can only hope someone yet unearths a juicy email that nails HRC without dodgable doubt.</p>

<p>Even then, will the MSM get the word out?
Doesn&#39;t the press realize that the best thing that they can do to get on top again, to be believed by the disenfranchised viewing public, is not to cower from the Clintons for fear of not getting access to future inside scoops- but to scoop now! Investigate! Bite the hand that controls and muzzles them. </p>

<p>The first reporter that survives REALLY investigating the clintons, or the first news organization that actually dissects what&#39;s going on and uncovers massive crime and fraud- will become the most trusted and respected news source from here on out. It will be too big to contain. So why don&#39;t they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying but truly, it&#39;s the other way around. The Clinton campaign is the perfect corporate campaign, and thus, large corporations and governments abroad and quasi-governmental organizations will support her campaign in an attempt to be on the winning side, poised to further their aims and hopefully rake in massive profits in exchange for their efforts.</p>

<p>Ain&#39;t America grand?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been checking the various news sources all day yesterday, and if the story is mentioned at all, it&#39;s buried or positioned in a tiny link.  The bias is overwhelming.</p>

<p>Abby Martin did a great piece on Clinton, and its only gotten about a half million views.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV_PLCC6jeI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV_PLCC6jeI</a>  Abby Martin has more journalistic courage than the sum total of everyone attending whitehouse correspondence dinners.</p>

<p>The media is owned by powerful people who want Clinton <em>selected,</em> not elected.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  She was chosen a long time ago.  If you really want to see some shit, watch her 2016 AIPAC speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most people are so TERRIFIED of Trump: the new Hitler, The Antichrist, the Racist that will open the Seals and cause WWIII due a bad hair day. They have <em>come to their senses</em> and accepted that Bernie had no chance, and that if he was screwed due election shennanigans that happened, well, tough luck. </p>

<p>Everybody in the net is now willing to overlook the issues with Hillary&#39;s past &amp; present as long as Trump loses.</p>

<p>Trump. The scarecrow that Hillary set up for this purpose.</p>

<p>I&#39;d have expected the Bernies to make some noise next week on the DNC but... after the Never Trump people just folded tents and left, I doubt it now.</p>

<p>Fox and cnn ( CBS / MSNBC didnt see it on theit website) had it on their website all day yesterday but they have since moved on to dws resignation.</p>

<p>The media is ignoring their collaboration with the Dnc and I dont see them mentioning it.</p>

<p>Voter fraud will hurt both Hillary and Bernie. In addition I don&#39;t believe that if voter fraud wasn&#39;t present Bernie will have won he will have still lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Cause MSM won&#39;t allow it. Who is pouring millions of dollars in ads? Who is paying millions to remove hashtags and trending topics from the Internet?</p>

<p>Clinton </p>

<p>Please sit down a minute and think: Do you have friends who believe the will win a brand new car by sharing a picture or status on Facebook? </p>

<p>Just like that, Clinton knows whatever gets posted online, will have an influence among voters. So, if she controls that, people will not be aware of this scandal. Remember, millions don&#39;t watch msm news, and they will believe anything posted online. </p>
