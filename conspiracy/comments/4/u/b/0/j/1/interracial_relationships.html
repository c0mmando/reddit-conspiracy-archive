<p>Completely retarded bullshit disproven by even a cursory understanding of human genetics.</p>

<p>The notion that hybridization results in heterosis for humans is highly unlikely, especially when taking into account the fact there is greater genetic variation within any given population compared to the number of alleles for any given locus. There is a surprisingly low number of genes in an individual human’s genome (20,000-25,000) and therefore any difference resulting from population hybridization would have negligible results for hybrid vigor. Not to mention both hybrid vigor hypotheses involve inbred parental populations, making the assumptions for human heterosis further disproved. And the benefits diminish from the F1 generation onwards, so to continue producing human hybrid offspring with these hypothetical results requires the divergent populations to remain intact, just as with any other species.</p>

<p>Also, the assumption that an admixed human, subpopulation-wise, is entirely heterozygous is utterly wrong. Let’s look at a contradictory case: you have two parents from different populations with pairs of identical homozygous alleles for eye color. Draw the Punnett square if necessary; the offspring will be homozygotes with respect to eye color. There are many more example of these cases beyond just eye color.</p>

<p>Such as immunity, the fact is admixing in humans does not equate to more functional immune systems in terms of HLA diversity. There are admixed individuals with a very limited set of these allotypes and non-admixed individuals who have many up to the maximum number as there are only so many available loci per genome. Consider HL A1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 which limited to a maximum of 2 in any given person. For example, a person could have A1, A2, A7, A8 but not A1, A2, A3, and A11 or A7, A8, A14, A15. Because each human population already has more HLA variants than the limit of loci per individual, it’s better to pass on the alleles that confer resistance to regional pathogens which offspring will be more likely to encounter than foreign alleles from foreign populations. Currently HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1, have roughly 1000, 1600, and 870 known alleles, respectively.</p>

<p>The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that multiracial kids are not subject to hybrid vigor any more than monoracial kids.</p>

<p>Black Americans are a hybrid race of around 22% white ancestry. (17) This 22% ancestry is the cause of multiple negative health effects due to genetic incompatibility. Indeed, consistent with Haldane’s Rule, unmixed blacks from Africa and white Americans do not have the same rate of birth problems that hybrid American blacks have: “In 2005, the mortality rate for black infants was 4.4 times higher than that of white infants… African women who come to the United States and have babies experience the same low rate of infant deaths as white American mothers.” John R. Baker, in his book Race, says, “Indiscriminate interbreeding between distinct forms, whether ‘species’ or markedly different races, is not generally beneficial. The defect may show in a change in the sex-ratio of the offspring, probably caused by the early abortion of members of one sex, generally the male in the case of mammals.” LTA4H, or “leukotriene A4 hydrolase” is found on chromosome 17. An allele of this gene increases the risk of heart attack (the #1 cause of death in America) in blacks by more than 250%, but only 16% in whites. The 30% of whites with this allele have counteracting genes, while the 6% of black Americans who obtained it through miscegenation do not. (18)</p>

<p>The average rate of success for mixed race couples is around half that of same race couples, 0.127 compared to 0.213. (19) There is evidence that the more similar the two people are, the happier their marriage tends to be. (20) A study in Iceland showed that 3rd cousin marriages are the most fertile and successful. This suggests that mating within one’s ethnic/racial group would be more beneficial than outside of one’s ethnic/racial group. (21) One study showed that people tend to find their own face–morphed into the opposite sex–most attractive, even when he/she doesn’t know it’s his own face. This strongly suggests that people typically prefer those who look like themselves–in other words, their own racial/ethnic group. (22)</p>

<p>Hybrid vigor (heterosis) does not seem to apply to humans, as we are already very heterozygous, at 0.776. (23) Compared to dogs, for example, at 0.401. (24) Some argue that race mixing “averages out” traits. They claim that since average faces are considered more attractive, mixed race offspring would be more attractive. This, of course, is fallacious, as it assumes we are designed for perfect symmetry. In fact, the magnitude of asymmetry is the correct measurement and this random component fluctuates–also called “fluctuating asymmetry”–so a lower level of asymmetry correlates with increased attractiveness, not symmetry. (25) But does increased heterozygosity cause lower asymmetry? A meta analysis of 118 datasets in 14 studies revealed a very weak inverse correlation between the two, showing that increased heterozygosity has no beneficial effect on symmetry or asymmetry. One study on the craniofacial morphology in white-Indioe mixed race individuals found that over half of the 52 shape variables deviated from the mathematical average, completely shattering the above argument.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol.. from these ignorant comments it seems all these people wanted to be whites- only folk but TV is making them chose coloured people subliminally therefore all white girls are chosing coloured men? Go and breed white-only, TV doesn&#39;t control you. That is your choice, just like buying a Iphone or not. If they are arguing about some deep control like that, then nonwhites are controlled too and it is not limited to white people. So racist paranoia over something you can chose. Big globalized cities have been very multi-racial for centuries. Get over it. Is it a conspiracy? People want to shape your mind and control how you  behave by  their ideas of the world you don&#39;t  have to buy it.</p>

<p>If were going to talk about culling millions of people of certain coulour or culture, how about we talk about Iraq or Syria? Are whites subliminally being controlled into mix breeding? And others are being culled in other ways, can we agree its not limited to whites? </p>

<p>Yes, that’s my fault. The direct links are self-explanatory. The citations that are just titles are the titles of scientific papers by those names. I have them downloaded directly to my computer (so that they can’t be deleted from repositories) and simply reference them locally that way, but you can copy and paste them into virtually any of the science paper aggregate websites (Google should work, too) to find them.

<p>In the immune system, how important is race? “If Nick Glasgow were white, he would have a nearly 90 percent chance of finding a matching bone marrow donor who could cure his leukemia.” The reason that mixed-heritage patients are so hard to match can be found in the immune system. Different races have developed certain proteins, or markers, that are part of the body&#39;s natural defenses. These markers help the immune system determine which cells are foreign and should be rejected. A match between two people who share more genetically in common significantly reduces the risk of the donor and recipient cells attacking each other. (read: cells from people of two different races will attack each other as though they are a virus) The more people of different backgrounds who produce offspring, the more types that are harder to match. Multiracial patients have uncommon profiles and since there can be many possible racial and ethnic combinations in multiracial societies, finding a match can be extremely difficult. (31)</p>

<p>As an example, a white mother of a mixed-race child would have more genetically in common with a random white person on the street than with her own child. If such a dramatic and fundamental alienation from your own parents is not horrific enough, every member of the family of a mixed-race child diagnosed with leukemia is an incompatible donor for a bone marrow transplant, and finding a compatible donor is unlikely. “One obstacle to finding a matching donor was her mixed ethnic background. Her father is black, with West Indian and Panamanian roots. Her mother is white, with Russian-Jewish roots. In addition, only 5 percent of registered donors are black.” (32) Compared to organ transplants, bone marrow donations need to be even more genetically similar to their recipients. Since all the immune system’s cells come from bone marrow, a transplant essentially introduces an entirely new new immune system to a person. Without genetic similarity between the donor and the patient, the new white blood cells will attack the host body. (33) Race matters when a patient needs a stem cell or marrow transplant. (34)</p>

<p>A seasoned cancer researcher would never set up a study in which all the ill patients were, say, Canadian, and all the healthy controls were Japanese. And yet cancer researchers risk making a similar mistake if they overlook genetic information that fleshes out what many of us like to think of as race or ethnicity, some experts say. Fortunately, awareness of how ancestral genetics might contribute to risk of disease and drug response in people has risen over the last several years. Studies that look directly at the problem are on the rapid rise, and this increased interest has biotechnology companies lowering the cost of tests that determine genetic ancestry, thanks to a little competition. However, experts have yet to decide on how to genetically define ancestry, suggesting examining anywhere from a handful to hundreds of gene variants. Not including information on the race or ethnicity of study volunteers could skew disease risks as stronger or weaker than they really are. “Alzheimer’s is the poster child for this problem,” says pharmacogeneticist Esteban Burchard, MD, of the University of California in San Francisco. A variant of the gene ApoE4 is a strong genetic risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer’s, and the characteristic most likely to raise or lower that risk is race. “It occurs in about 20% of the black American population, and it means nothing. It occurs in about 6% of the Japanese, and it makes their risk six times higher [than that for white people],” Burchard said. “Something about being Japanese unleashes the wrath of the gene, and something about being black American attenuates it.” (35)</p>

<p>The FDA have approved a heart failure drug called Bidil, but only for blacks, as blacks do not benefit from conventional heart failure drugs. (36) Sickle cell anaemia is a condition found almost exclusively in blacks–about 1 in 4 West Africans carry the gene for it while almost no whites do. Any whites who carry the gene most likely have a black ancestor. As a result of population growth in African-Caribbean regions of overseas France and immigration from North and sub-Saharan Africa to mainland France, sickle cell disease has become a major health problem in France. SCD has become the most common genetic disease in this country. (37) </p>

You turned into an even bigger fuck nugget. That&#39;s why I&#39;m done. I love arguing and debating but I&#39;m not going to bother with someone like you. Get your head out of your ass, go outside, and find someone to give you a hug, because it seems like you desperately need it</p>
