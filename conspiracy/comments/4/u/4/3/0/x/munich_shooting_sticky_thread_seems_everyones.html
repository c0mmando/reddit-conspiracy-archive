    <div class="md"><p>Sooooo, the camera person just starts filming this dude before anyone around the guy even knows whats about to happen?</p>

<p>Can someone explain how a person could predict such an event... and film it instead of run for their lives? Something stinks...</p>

<p>EDIT 1: <strong>Female Instagram account, yet the video has a man&#39;s voice as being the camera operator. Could be a video repost from another source. No source was given on the profile.</strong></p>

<p>EDIT 2: <strong>Pedestrians on the street are acting normal, as if nothing has happened prior to this footage. YET, we see evidence that other people are running towards the suspect very quickly, and BEFORE he pulls his gun and starts shooting.</strong></p>

<p>EDIT 3: <strong>We can presume that no shots were fired prior to the video, as the street pedestrians are not reacting to loud gunshots within their vicinity. You can see the grey haired man jump in shock once the suspect pulls the trigger for the first time. Why are there people running for their lives up the alley though?... and towards the suspect?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT 4: <strong>People running up the alley bang a right and run in a straight path, directly in the line of fire of the shooter as soon as he starts shooting. At close range, no one is seen getting shot.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this person seems to only be holding a pistol in the footage. Surprised they didn&#39;t spring for the AR-15 debate again. No doubt this will be some form of automatic weapon discussion by the time they feed us all the &quot;facts.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re speaking on visual evidence please, as seen in this video. We are not making assumptions from things we cannot see or prove.</p>

<p>What I SEE are cars on a road... pedestrians un-phased by anything as if its just a normal day. Then we see a man in black walking around a bit and pulling a gun. It looks as if he cocks it back, and then starts to fire at the crowd of people in front of him... that same crowd of people who do not appear to be reacting to &quot;hearing gun shots&quot; within 50 feet of their location prior to the suspect shooting at them. You will notice the grey haired man jump in shock.</p>

<p>How could this cameraman, who is further from them... be more alerted to what&#39;s going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are mentioning. Yes, it appears they are running directly towards him, and immediately bang a right when they realize he&#39;s the one with the gun. </p>

<p>I also notice that he&#39;s a terrible shot, not hitting a single person at close range as they run in a linear direction away from him. </p>

<p>Not defending my point, but just raising more suspicious questions. We should wait and see what other media they put out. This one is still active, and has the potential to outdo any of the previous incidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrorism can be encouraged and it can be coerced, but I doubt that there&#39;s many who have done it for money straight up. (At least, not the guy who&#39;s going to be shot at the end of this - the others who will be forgotten probably get a nice paycheck). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well how could reports of a mall shooting, and a McDonalds be the same person at the same time? Did he get hungry, and then decide to start shooting up there too?</p>

<p>If the MSM starts talking about one person, we&#39;ll know something else is up for sure. Although, the multiple people and still at large would be something new.</p>

<p>And later on you have the &#39;crazy&#39; person drinking in the corner of the bar saying that they saw two or three people &#39;together&#39; - they weren&#39;t confused and attributing one person running around lots of places as multiple perps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This exact idea destroys my concept of bribed-terrorism. How could you fund a side to carry out such terrible acts, when in the end, they just blow themselves up? It&#39;s paying someone to kill themselves. I suppose that&#39;s where religion comes in...</p>

<p>Yes, this person seems to only be holding a pistol in the footage. Surprised they didn&#39;t spring for the AR-15 debate again. No doubt this will be some form of automatic weapon discussion by the time they feed us all the &quot;facts.&quot;</p>
