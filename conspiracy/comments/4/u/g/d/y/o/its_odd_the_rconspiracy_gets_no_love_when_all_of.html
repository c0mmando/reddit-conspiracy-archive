       It looks like when ever a former "conspiracy theory" ends up being right people stop treating it like it was ever a conspiracy theory and then continue to shit on all other conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a healthy outlook from the mainstream

       Edit: People are fixating on this sub as a whole not getting love. Should've titled it "It's odd conspiracies in general get no love when a lot of them have ended up being true".

       For every decent post there's 19 going on about the builderberg group, flat earth, the illuminati, UFOs, Satanism and symbology, etc. While there might be some truth in some others things 90% is bogus nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one takes r/conspiracy seriously because there's some awful crap on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying all these things are in of themselves wrong or terrible (most are) but people have associations about them. Negative associations.
      </p>
      <p>
       R/conspiracy is never going to get love as long as it continues to allow posts about whackjob theories. Especially those around right wing Christian conservatives who post about Satanism and the occult. Those posts make people roll their eyes.

       I thought the same thing. haha Nice way to try to group together two things, known by us as gov psyops, with something very real and troubling. Nice try but the ball is in the builderberg cup. You would think they would put the less talented on facebook and twitter. That shit may work on the normies, but I've been here more than ten or more years and probably read his dads disinfo.

       I'm just going to quote myself cause I know it's not explicit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm not saying all these things are in of themselves wrong or terrible (most are) but people have associations about them. Negative associations."
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Builderberg Group is actually something we should be more aware and very wary of. But the general public doesn't have that association. They see it as a whack job conspiracy theory. The words "Builderberg Group" are associated with negative and dismissive thoughts in the public's mind. Which is why I included it on the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what is actually being said in r/conspiracy, as long as people associate it with crazy whackjobs, everything posted here will be put under the pressure of extra scrutiny and doubt because "this has just gotta be crazy people, right?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what I was trying to highlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I'm a government shill. Stop being so quick to judge and try to read between the lines. My original post has very clear context. My opening words are "For every decent post there's 19 going on about [things people think are crazy conspiracy things]". For every DECENT post. There is good stuff happening here. But it will be ignored so long as people
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       95% of the stuff here is whack.

        Builderberg Group: - Ok, this is real.

       <li>
        Flat Earth: - Bogus.
       </li>
       <li>
        Illuminati: - Are rich people working together? Yes. Are they the
        <em>
         actual
        </em>
        Illumanati? I seriously doubt it what with there being not a single piece of evidence for that.
       </li>
       <li>
        UFOs: - They're experimental aircraft. It's what? 5-10% they can't explain? That's interesting. But I usually see the 90% obvious stuff on here.
       </li>
       <li>
        Satanism: - This is a special form of paranoia that's as dangerous as Islamic terrorism, if you ask me.
       </li>
       <li>
        Symbology: - Quite similar to above. Sure, there are common symbols and themes everywhere you look. Might have something to do with a common, shared global culture what with people taking inspiration from each other and from past relics/ideas/etc. So basically, bogus.

       There's also a weird tendency to dismiss an entire person's argument when the say one tiny thing you disagree with. I've been banned for
       <em>
        suggesting
       </em>
       that the main narrative might actual be right before. There's as much free discourse on this sub as there is on r/worldnews.

       It's sketchy as fuck and is what people are actually referring to when they say "Illuminati". No one knows what happens in there but these are the guys that literally run the Western World. They're not talking about Game of Thrones.

       Another way of saying this is that the problem seems so beyond their capability to deal with, or effect. I think most people have a general understanding of what's happening. I just don't think they know how to process and deal with it.

       Exactly. The sentence "conspiracy theory" is a stop-think. It's never meant to be used by rational individuals. If a conspiracy theory turns out true, then it belongs to the memory hole.

       the goal posts are always moved when a conspiracy is proven to be true.  10 years ago there were a lot of people calling people conspiratards for thinking the government would spy on people but once it is brought into the light people think how could the government do this while continuing to call people idiots for believing in other things.

       To acknowledge the Lies would shake the Foundations upon which their material and psychological Comfort rests. If they suddenly change and acknowledge certain Truths, then they risk losing Job and/or Career, Fellowship and Esteem of various Friends, Home, Family, essentially everything save for their own SelfRespect. Should you choose to accept the Humiliation, Pain and Suffering associated with acknowledging the Truth anyway, the Trick to surviving is to immediately build oneself a new Life, seek a new Circle of Colleagues and Friends and find  a new Partner and/or Family with whom you can at least  tolerate and maybe even accept the Truths you espouse. Failing any of the above, adopt a Dog. They are great Listeners (although not always good at following Instructions).

       in their newspapers and magazines and websites and youtube channels. As for people who forget something in 2 days and move on i think there should be a youtube channel called "What Happened" which regularly posts updated videos and blog posts about what the current status of various hot topics of the recent past is.

       I was berated by a guy at work several years ago after I claimed the NSA was scooping up data on all citizens. I had heard of Russ Tice, Bill Binney, and Thomas Drake and suggested this only to receive ruthless insults, accusations of being a "conspiracy theorist" (of course), and made fun of publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several years later after the Snowden thing, I never got an apology. Ah well.

       We get no attention because Americans fucking suck. People get irritated with me when I bring up the facts about Clinton.
       <em>
        With
       </em>
       credible sources to back it up. They then go back to discussing Clinton v. Trump. Deciding which would be best because they have become so accustomed to pretty-word politics, that facts and truth mean nothing anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans have become complacent in most aspects of their lives. They have been manipulated into learning to ignore the negative in favor of looking at the positives while the negatives get worse and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also like 1984. One week it's the Eurasians we are fighting, the next week it's Eastasia when in reality, the government is the true enemy. The only ones increasing the negatives while dangling positives in front of us like twinkies on a stick.

       Apparently it's not a "conspiracy theory" if it's pro-western establishment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Erdogan's coup was a FALSE FLAG HOAX!
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Apparently this isn't a conspiracy theory and is totally reasonable even though we've know for MONTHS that the gulenists were working with a certain intelligence agency to oust Erdogan.  But THAT'S crazy!
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Putin is working with trump and wikileaks to criticize hillary and the DNC
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's wrong, but is there ANY evidence of this at all?  As soon as the DNC is proven to have been conspiring against sanders, now they're hiding behind a conspiracy theory?  But we were called crazy by these shills for even suggesting that the DNC was actively working against sanders.  I'll bet they'll STILL deny it.

       the 28 pages proves or claims that Saudi payed money to agents (could just be boring spies), its obvious that the four planes and the 19 hijackers are TLA/MSM fantasy, so any supporting details to back up the official story is suspect.

       To be perfectly honest I myself believe in less conspiracies than the majority of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I was commenting on a larger societal issue. One where people disregard that some conspiracy theories are true, and proceed to act like they're
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that any rational individual would believe in at least some level of conspiracy, given how many have been proven true in the past. It's undeniable that our government has been up to shady stuff they don't want us to know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disregard what I said about this sub getting no love then. It's understandable when people see things like the moon landing being faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact is conspiracy theories in general have a bad stigma. Again, even though a large amount of them have been proven true. This doesn't make sense.

      <p>
       The reason it gets no love is because of the amount of bullshit conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why, it's nothing crazy here.  It's not a societal issue.  It's the fact that many in this sub just go all out on every possibility in life as a conspiracy.  Many who frequent here will go after anything without ANY PROOF.  Asking for a source or proof can provide you with many people who will say you're a shill.

      <p>
       Yea people do believe in at least some level of conspiracy.  Yet most of us aren't going to act like a "sheep", I want fucking proof.  How hard is that to understand?  Proof.  Proof.  Actual proof, not some weird conspiracy site that says they saw the boogeyman fuck Obama.

      <p>
       And here we have the problem.  A large amount of them have not been proven true.  So stop there.  If you actually follow conspiracies you'd know a small portion have been proven true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You even state yourself you believe in less conspiracies than this sub, why don't you believe in a large amount of them if they're largely true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they aren't largely true.

      <p>
       The reason this sub isn't loved is simple.  You deny wanting to have facts.  You deny waiting for all the information.  You make up tons of things without any actual proof.  Tons of threads like that.  Great 1 out of 1000 gotten right.  My cat could poop out better answers than that.

       Obviously I should've named the thread something else. I don't deny what you've said, but conspiracy in general has a negative stigma. It's not just from people that want proof, it's people that treat anyone that believes
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       conspiracy as crazy.

       Good to know it was coherent. And I would suggest that you are expressing your opinion, which is divorced from the fact. But, again, you rely on an attack on the credibility of those interacting in this sub. "Crazy." A good litmus test for when you should be exceptionally skeptical of someone, is their use (or over-use) of the word "crazy."
