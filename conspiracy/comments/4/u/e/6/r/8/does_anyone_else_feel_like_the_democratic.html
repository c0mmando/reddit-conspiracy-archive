       The shocker is that Sanders won 45%+ of the vote even with it being rigged against him.

       I would have loved to see every state with open primaries with same day registration, and no super delegates obviously. It would have been much closer.

       Hillary is too twisted and criminal to have ever let anyone else have a chance at the nomination. She worked behind the scenes for years to make sure it was sewn up before the process even started.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ironic thing is, she is sick. She has some kind of nerve disease, maybe a brain tumor, and she would not be able to serve as president, even if she were elected.

       I thought maybe it was because two people blasted her at once but, thats still an odd reaction. Also she goes straight to it being brain freeze from her cold chai despite not drinking it (in the clip) leading to the rocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe its from receiving gun fire in Bosnia?

       Yes! That's the clip I was talking about. Thanks for linking. I knew a girl who had seizures and she could sense them coming a few moments before they happened. She would rock very similar to her head motion in the video. What struck me was there was two instances in the video. If it was being taken aback by the two questions at once, I would expect only one recoil, not two.

       Yes. It's about the only thing that makes sense. It's a testament to how powerful the Clinton's are too that the DNC is pretty much willing to commit suicide this election to honor their promise of giving the Presidency to her. Probably because if they don't they know of a lot of them will be dying of suicides by 2 bullets to the back of the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't believe how arrogant she is. Even picking someone like Kaine showing she feels it's rigged enough she can win with no Sanders voters.

       I said in 08 Obama got selected to fuel a race war, paving the way for his polar opposite Trump. So the dnc is actually the ones taking the fall this time around. Everyone assumed it was trump playing ball to help hillary, but it may be the opposite.

       Funny, for a while I said that we will have a series of specific characters as presidents:
      </p>
      <p>
       A black one.
      </p>
      <p>
       A female.

      <p>
       A Latino.

       Then it gets shady, but it will be a gay/lesbian and whatever else needed to give the illusion of "modernizing " the White House.

       I agree but I feel like in between the Female and Latino there will be another white male. People would start to get suspicious otherwise. And given these extra 4-8 years there will be more time for Hispanics legal or illegal to come into the country and back a Hispanic candidate.

       Yes! That's the clip I was talking about. Thanks for linking. I knew a girl who had seizures and she could sense them coming a few moments before they happened. She would rock very similar to her head motion in the video. What struck me was there was two instances in the video. If it was being taken aback by the two questions at once, I would expect only one recoil, not two.
