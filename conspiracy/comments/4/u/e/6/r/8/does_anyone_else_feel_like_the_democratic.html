<p>The shocker is that Sanders won 45%+ of the vote even with it being rigged against him. </p>

<p>I would have loved to see every state with open primaries with same day registration, and no super delegates obviously. It would have been much closer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary is too twisted and criminal to have ever let anyone else have a chance at the nomination. She worked behind the scenes for years to make sure it was sewn up before the process even started.</p>

<p>The ironic thing is, she is sick. She has some kind of nerve disease, maybe a brain tumor, and she would not be able to serve as president, even if she were elected.</p>

<p>I thought maybe it was because two people blasted her at once but, thats still an odd reaction. Also she goes straight to it being brain freeze from her cold chai despite not drinking it (in the clip) leading to the rocking.</p>

<p>Maybe its from receiving gun fire in Bosnia?<sup><sup>/s</sup></sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s about the only thing that makes sense. It&#39;s a testament to how powerful the Clinton&#39;s are too that the DNC is pretty much willing to commit suicide this election to honor their promise of giving the Presidency to her. Probably because if they don&#39;t they know of a lot of them will be dying of suicides by 2 bullets to the back of the head.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t believe how arrogant she is. Even picking someone like Kaine showing she feels it&#39;s rigged enough she can win with no Sanders voters. </p>
