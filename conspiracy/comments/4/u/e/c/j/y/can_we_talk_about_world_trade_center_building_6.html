        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This sub has 2 posts that I could find related to building 6 with barely any discussion in them. Yet building 7 posts are always talked about here. Seems like some mighty fine gatekeeping to me but hey that&#39;s what this sub does best. Now regarding building 6, it supposedly exploded at the exact time or a little after the second tower was &quot;hit&quot;. The core of the building was destroyed almost like it was scooped out. The building burned for hours. Got rained on by debris (much more than building 7) yet it did not fully collapse. People always say building 7 is the smoking gun but it&#39;s not. Building 6 is. So let us discuss what happened and why this isn&#39;t talked about. </p>

<p>Edit: now that I think more about it when I say building 6 is more important I just think it should be used to further show how already obvious building 7s controlled demolition was. Because they say building 7 fell because of fires in the building and debris. Well building 6 had fires and debris also (not to mention the huge crater) and it didn&#39;t completely collapse like building 7. </p>

<p>Edit2: looking into it more it does not seem to be an explosion that caused the hole nor debris which is really really odd. Will continue to looking into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If building six didn&#39;t have the strange hollowed out look to it,   if it just looked like normal fire,  or normal falling debris had got to it,  it would not be quite as interesting as it.</p>

<p>On the other hand,  the drama at 1,  2,  and 7, really,   how could you blame people for going for those first?!?    After that,  its like,  god damnit,   the government lied,  and to tell the truth,  by then its really obvious that no amount of arm chair speculating can take the place of what a real murder trial and a real investigation are supposed to do.    We know that the 9/11 commission was not that,  but a cover up.   </p>

<p>At that point,  we can add building six,  &quot;toasted cars&quot;  etc.  to stuff that should be looked at.    Without expert,  due process,  would you really believe anything just because someone stood up and claimed to know?   If you would,   I have some Judy Wood types you should listen to.   Its really a shame that something as important to the whole world has to take a back seat to these sick fucks and their fat egos.    Richard Gage and Jon Cole are not out their making ridiculous claims.   One of their friends,  Niels H. Harrit, of the University of Copenhagen,  has some interesting possibilities regarding the toasted cars and building 6.   Reactions of thermite,  thermitic materials,  nano-thermite and related stuff have similar effects as what is seen on those cars and building six.   If some of that material fell on them,  perhaps it would leave a line of demarcation where it had reacted with some parts and not others,  depending on how and where it landed,  the size of the falling object etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but the reason building 6 is the most important is because it had all the same conditions as 7 yet it did not completely collapse plus its core was blown to smithereens. How can you explain that building not falling yet building 7 falls perfectly into its footprint lol. </p>

<p>Edit: also you talk about Richard gage who is a gatekeeper with AE9111 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll say it again.   You and I sitting in an arm chair are not going to explain it.    Listen carefully:   A murder investigation of 3000 murders convenes experts and brings in government officials under oath etc.    When the Challenger blew up,  Richard Feynman was one of the best voices of reason.   That might have been the last honest investigation ever conducted in the US.</p>

<p>If we have an idea what happened to those cars and building 6,  as Niels H. Harrit, of the University of Copenhagen has suggested carefully,  as a mere possibility,  then it is still fair game to be challenged.</p>

<p>You do not have proof that the interior of building 6 was exploded.   It may have been,  but it might have also been carved out thermitically,  chemically.    That&#39;s a bit like pouring acid on something.   It looks like it dissolved.    Like a hole in your pants from battery acid,  kind of look.   Not only that,  it leaves a chemical residue and a smell.</p>

<p>Again,   we are better off living with the uncertainty as to cause,  trust me.    Otherwise you will be left trying to defend a cause that you can&#39;t.    That&#39;s what happened in the JFK assassination case,  all the brilliant minds spent decades being private detectives.    That is a waste of time and effort.    The key suspects did not emerge from that,   they emerged by following who benefited by JFK being dead and out of the way.    Have you read JFK The Unspeakable by Douglass.</p>

<p>More importantly,  regarding 9/11,  have you looked into everything from Kevin Ryan,  David Griffin,  Richard Gage,  Jon Cole?   edit:  and David Chandler!  Drop the obsession and get up to date with the best information that we DO have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm there was video of it exploding so idk what you&#39;re talking about. And can you quit writing such long responses with nothing but telling me how to think and what to be doing? I&#39;m not obsessing over this I already know 9/11 is an inside job I just think people should talk about building 6 instead of 7 sheesh. And I already told you gage is a gatekeeper.</p>

<p>Edit: I apologize there is no video I thought there was cause I saw a picture from footage taken by cnn but it appears to be dust from one of the towers falling. Regardless I don&#39;t think debris can cause such a precise crater like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link I posted claims,  with that picture,  that the video the picture is related to,  is showing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the frame was clearly taken just after the South Tower collapsed, and shows a column of its dust cloud rising from the World Trade Center plaza. This is obvious from an examination of the geometry of the camera vantage point and the relative positions of the buildings. The frame shows the North Tower from the North with its northeast face slightly more foreshortened than its northwest face. This guarantees that, had the South Tower been standing, about 60 percent of its northwest face would have been visible to the right of the North Tower. All that is visible to the right of the North Tower in the video frame is the smoke and dust plume from the just-collapsed South Tower.</p>

<p>Even ignoring the absence of the South Tower in the video frame, it is obvious from the thick white color of the dust cloud that it was not from some kind of explosion. Rather it was part of the vast dust cloud from the collapsed WTC2) tower. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s your proof of building 6 exploding,  then you got nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize you&#39;re right that does look like dust from the tower collapsing. Regardless wtc 6 had to have exploded what else would carve out the core like that?

<p>dust from the tower being exploded in mid air is more like it.   now wtc 7,  that one did look more like your typical demolition induced collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point it was more of an explosion since the dust was exploding out if I remember correctly. Also you seem very knowledgable on the topic, more so than me, so what is your opinion on the no planes theory? I&#39;m just genuinely curious because I recently watched a very good video and I&#39;m starting to think there really were no planes. </p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-8" data-depth="10" data-id="d5p6swz">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/rockytimber.html">rockytimber</a> 2016-07-24</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I think the evidence of the main videos of planes on 9/11 being faked or altered,  as reviewed by people who knew how CGI worked in 2001,  is rather convincing.    But I am not personally an expert on CGI,  now or how the tech worked in 2001.</p>

<p>However,  the eyewitness testimony in New York,  Washington,  and Shanksville PA on that date is also problematic,   some witnesses are not credible,  but some are.   What the credible witnesses saw is often rather puzzling compared to the official story.</p>

<p>What I think is that I don&#39;t recall any believable video or stills of the hijackers at the airports where those four planes took off from,  and I think those hijackers were prepared patsies who did not probably know how to make commercial jets behave in the way the jets are claimed to have flown.    So,  its likely that something flew into WTC 1 and 2 and likely something hit the pentagon,  but very likely it was not commercial jets,  and almost surely,  not hijacked commercial jets.    In other words,  it could have been something remotely controlled,  maybe.    That would explain,  for one thing,  the speeds that were recorded at wtc 1 and 2 from radar,  speeds that would have been impossible for commercial jets of the kind claimed.</p>

<p>But I think that the above is too much for most people,  and what gets most people to doubt the official version is that the behavior of wtc1,  2 and 7 when they fell,  especially the speed at which they fell,  is not consistent with the damage to the structures that could have occurred from fire,  jets,  and in the case of 7,  fire and falling debris.    Those buildings had a lot of mass,  a lot of resistance to falling,   and if they fell,  they would have fallen at a speed that reflected some resistance,  not nearly zero resistance.   So instead of 10 floors a second,  they would have had to fall at a slower rate unless other additional means had been (and WERE) used to eliminate resistance and thus facilitate the speed of fall to near  free fall speeds,  the speed at which gravity allows things to fall when there is only air resistance.</p>

<p>It was not only dust exploding outward in the case of wtc1 and wtc2,  it was many structural chunks being projected outwards for hundreds of feet at speeds from 60 to 100 mph,  and sometimes even appearing to be projected slightly upwards,  and sometimes appearing to accelerate mid air.    Remember,  bone fragments were discovered on roof tops hundreds of feet away.   Remember,  over a thousand people are claimed to have died for which even the tiniest fragment of DNA was never recovered,  even when the dust was processed through screens to pick up fragments as small as a fingernail to be DNA tested.    </p>

<p>The main thing to remember about the no planers is that proof of video fakery is not the same thing as proof of no planes.    Proof that there were relatively few reliable plane witnesses is not proof that there were no planes.    Proof that the holes &quot;punched&quot; in the wtc 1 and 2 were unlikely caused by the claimed aircraft is not proof that there were no planes.    Proof that the claimed air based telephone conversations did not happen is not proof of no planes.</p>

<p>Remember,   Cheney was documented counting down the minutes in Washington DC for an approaching air craft,  in relations to orders that had been given,  to which Cheney said &quot;the orders still stand&quot;.    Norad documents air activity for tracked aircraft.    A pilot has come out admitting to shooting down a plane over Shanksville PA.</p>

<p>Its a national trauma, played as a ghastly spectacle,  intentionally by the media,   and now an international one,  because in revenge our troops killed the wrong people.   Too many people want to be a celebrity for a day by being experts.   I am an expert in one thing:   I saw the media condition Americans within 24 hours,  based on no proof at all,  to believe a story that was manufactured right in front of their eyes on tv.    What was presented on tv was not proof of the story line presented.    But people were told what to believe.   And did not believe what their own eyes had seen.   And believed all kinds of cock and bull lies that do not add up in the least.</p>

<p>&quot;Wherever a man commits a crime, God finds a witness. Every secret crime has its reporter.&quot;
~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

<p>9/11 Finding The Truth by Andrew Johnson - Audiobook </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvaxr0OSBw2DtOWulcA96d7sG2rsNyOgb">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvaxr0OSBw2DtOWulcA96d7sG2rsNyOgb</a></p>

<p>THE DIRECTED ENERGY COVER-UP TEAM</p>

<p><a href="https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50694/images/Richard-DavidG-StevenJ.jpg">https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50694/images/Richard-DavidG-StevenJ.jpg</a></p>

<p>Other examples of Directed Energy (not necessarily used as a weapon) are radio waves, cell phone signals, TV remote control signals, wireless internet signals...etc.</p>

<p>Those who want to cover up the evidence of what happen often falsely claim that Dr. Wood is talking about a specific weapon and a specific location of it (e.g. laser beam from outer space, or &quot;spacebeams&quot;). This disinformation campaign was initiated by Steven Jones on 11/11/2006 in a presentation he gave in California (available in the internet archives*), telling his audience that &quot;Judy Woods (Wood) says it&#39;s a laser or maser from space&quot; while showing how difficult it is to hold his hand like a beam from space. Not only does Dr. Wood NOT SAY THAT, she actually RULES THAT OUT. The mechanism of destruction of a laser beam would be from heat and produce a bright and blinding light. But we know the buildings were not cooked to death. The term Directed Energy is used because energy is directed to do something different then it normally does and it is directed to do this within a certain geographic zone. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn to atomic-sized dust. Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]</p>

<p>At the end of Chapter 20 in Dr. Wood&#39;s book, she explains why playing &quot;name the weapon&quot; game is counterproductive. Name dropping trendy terms is not synonymous with understanding. The easiest example is HAARP. The full capabilities are classified. But people often name-drop the trendy term to APPEAR to know something. A tongue-in-cheek definition of HAARP stands for High Amplitude Advancement of Real Propaganda. They are just substituting &quot;HAARP&quot; for &quot;Bin Laden.&quot;</p>

<p>In Dr. Wood&#39;s book, the closest she comes to &quot;naming a weapon&quot; is merely describing what it creates: magnetic-electrogravitic-nuclear reactions (page 365). But as soon as someone starts talking about a name, people will stop looking at the evidence which is another form of a cover up.</p>

<p>Early on, Dr. Steven Jones created a website he called &quot;The Journal of Nine Eleven Studies&quot; or J.O.N.E.S. It is referred to as a &quot;peer-reviewed journal&quot; but the only peer-reviewing was to screen out true scientific work and post what he wanted his followers to believe. For the first two years, it was primarily used to promote disinformation about Dr. Wood&#39;s work. For example, Jones recruited a patent attorney for the oil and gas industry (James Gourley**) to write hit pieces on Dr. Wood, refuting &quot;ray beams from outer space.&quot; This convinced his readers that &quot;Judy Woods&quot; must be talking about &quot;ray beams from outer space&quot; and that &quot;such nonsense has been refuted.&quot; Refuting false propaganda about Dr. Wood&#39;s work does not refute Dr. Wood&#39;s work -- yet it creates the belief in the average person that Dr. Wood&#39;s work has been refuted.</p>

<p>Steven Jones and Greg Jenkins also claimed that it would take more than five times the world&#39;s energy to destroy the WTC towers. Does that mean their thermite came from off planet or &quot;outer space&quot;? LOL Steven Jones used to ridicule Dr. Wood during his talks saying that &quot;Judy Woods needs to make calculations to see if it is even possible to turn the buildings to dust&quot;. But any reputable scientist knows that calculations are not a part of observing empirical evidence. What are the calculations for, to prove the buildings are still there or if the buildings are gone? Why not just look? No assumptions needed with empirical evidence.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that no one has refuted anything in Dr. Wood&#39;s book nor can they. They only refute their own false propaganda about her book, not her book. Other detractors claim that &quot;she hasn&#39;t identified the weapon that was used so she&#39;s got nothing.&quot; To the contrary. The evidence is PROOF that there exists a technology that can do what was done. It happened. That is, the fact that the buildings mostly turned to dust in mid-air shows that there exists a weapon that can turn buildings into dust in mid-air. It happened.</p>

<p>The sub-title of the book, &quot;Evidence of Directed Free-Energy Technology on 9/11&quot; indicates that the book contains evidence of what happened on 9/11 and it is indeed evidence that a technology exists that can do what was done. But this technology does not have to be used for evil purposes. It can be used to provide free-energy to the world much to the demise of the oil and gas industry. That is, Dr. Wood is noting that the same technology that was used for evil can also be used for good. It&#39;s a silver lining in the dark cloud... while also trying to stimulate thought about &quot;what are we doing here? learning new ways to kill or to live&quot;?</p>

<p>If you are worthy and willing to know the truth, read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? as I have. ♥</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no videos or witness accounts of seeing it explode so for now it&#39;s all speculation. Also after looking into it more I don&#39;t actually think there was an explosion at all. If you look at photos from inside it after 9/11 you see everything is uniformly facing downwards instead of behind like scattered and burnt from an explosion. It is also doesn&#39;t look like debris fell on it which is what the mainstream claim. So I legit have no clue what could have made a whole in that building which is killing me. </p>
