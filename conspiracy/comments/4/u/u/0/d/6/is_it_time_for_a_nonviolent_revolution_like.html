       Have a look at the pots-and-pans revolution of Iceland.
      </p>
      <p>
       They protested, clogging up the streets of the capital, and banged on pots and pans to create tons of noise for awareness. They did not stop until the government changed, and the constitution was rewritten by public committees from scratch. This is something the American people can do too, never forget that.

       Non-violent protest is the only way to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment destroy our protests and marches by creating violent disorder. the BLM protests are a great example. Violence is initiated by trouble-makers planted among the activists and the whole thing is discredited, condemned and shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protesting and marching may seem hopeless when it can be destroyed from the inside out like that so easily. But we can use it to our advantage: If we collectively agreed to self-police our protests, to treat any inciting of violence by another protester as an act of sabotage and to stop it before it even starts, then we would be protecting ourselves from infiltration and also ensuring a non-violent protest that could not be condemned or ignored.

       Good points. I like non-violent revolution because it begets legitimacy, as opposed to violent revolution which is often conflated with fear and hostile takeovers that people may not want. Non-violence ensures it's the people who are "driving the car" so to speak. And like you pointed out, this is something they will try and destroy by inducing violence, which puts the ball back in their court because they have the monopoly on violence. If they have to initiate the violence though, it makes them look very bad and they lose public support, so they have to create reasons that justify the use of it. If everyone is ardently non-violent then there is no way the police can be violent and look like good guys.

       Everyone takes vacation days all at once, when they are due back, they take maximum sick days too.  If the business calls, eveyrone is everyone else's doctor--lie to them.  I mean why is it that the US Gov has cornered the market on plausible deniability and lies and cheating and subversion--they haven't.  These things too can be yours.

       To be honest I think America has jumped the shark in terms of big events. If all the events and knowledge of the corruption we've already seen hasn't woken them up then I really can't think of anything that will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess 'taking our guns' might be the final frontier (excuse the pun). But that's only because people think it's going to be some sort of comic book style invasion and stand-off fantasy. What will actually happen is the law will change gradually, state by state. They will hand their weapons over, maybe with a few protest marches which will invariably descend into a shooting fiasco. The ones who don't comply will be made examples of with harsh sentences, and the rest of the people will eventually follow or be labelled a terrorist. Any fantasies people have about a hostile revolution are just that. A fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know what? The heart of a non-violent revolution is more about what you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       do. The whole system we're against is fueled by
       <em>
        money
       </em>
       . It depends on us all buying products and resources and a desire to be like the idiots on TV. Without the consumers supporting the corporations that have bought our democracy the whole system crumbles. Every time you buy something or elect
       <em>
        not to
       </em>
       buy something you are influencing the future, and because of that you have the ability to vote on the kind of world we live in every single day. Active inaction!

       They go to starbucks because there is no alternative and/or the alternatives charge the market price set by themselves AND starbuck.  For example you don't see a 'big lots' of starbucks where coffees are 50 cents but it's just not as good. You see Janets Star Cafe and it's still 4.5 dollars for a coffee. That's the market rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with smartphones, it's what is required of todays modern worker and cultural free agent.  If you don't have one, then your'e a ridiculous clown person who should be shunned by all humanity (I know, I don't have a cellphone anymore--no towers anywhere near me anymore ('economic downturn')so it's a brick to me).
      </p>
      <p>
       So although I agree with the rest of your post I had to point out that the cost of being a modern american is that you get gouged by 3.5 dollar coffees (or 4.5 if you tip); and expensive 120 / month postpaid cellphone plans.  Its just not fair to blame people for corporations collusion and extortion against them.

       And I know the argument about low end phones.  Those 'burner phones'  Have you used them?  They are impossibly frustrating to use and fucking shitty as fuck.  Sorry it's the truth. My nokia 'stick' capsule phone from 20 yrs ago was WAY better than a lot of these low end pieces of toxic garbage now, even thought that's 20 yrs of advancement--proof things get worse all the time.  It seems there's not really any inbetween a crap drug dealer burner and an android phone

       I think the potential to be non-violent is there, but there is definitely a propensity toward violent solutions in American culture, which is a real shame. But I think if people are diligent and careful and thoughtful, we can realize the game being played on us and collectively wake up and cast off our chains in a nonviolent mass-movement way

       True, but if we learn as a culture what to do when that time of reaction comes, we may end up doing something smart instead of dumb. That's why spreading the message of how to actually perform nonviolent revolutions is so important, so we are ready when the moment comes

       There is never a point of no return. There will always be another revolution. We must always improve our learning, as a world culture. Just keep trying, and let the cards fall where they may. The point is later on to be able to say that you really did try to help by spreading this info, then your conscience can be at peace

       it's been time for non violent revolution for a decade at the very least.  take power from the corrupt.  since their power is monetary, removing their money would cripple their influence considerably. you can't buy a politician if you can't afford one due to getting robin hooded by several hundred thousand angry peasants.  however, this means giving to the poor, so if you are going to clean out a wal mart with several hundred people, make sure to donate the  loot to charities that can give it to people in need.  this means wal mart would have to take the food and clothing from the charities, not a bunch of thieves, and there is no way they can spin that to be positive.

       Pacifism, alone, never accomplishes anything. The government and those in power never would have listened to MLK if there wasn't also Malcolm X, the Nation of Islam, Black Panthers, and an assortment of other more radical and violent groups. Robert Kennedy sought out and negotiated with MLK precisely because these other groups and individuals existed. The same could be said of Gandhi. Without Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh, the British never would have negotiated with Gandhi. It is only when non-violence is coupled with violent resistance that anything can be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, pacifism, as its name would imply, is passive. It asserts no power of its own accord, and instead appeals to some other, greater power (the state) to make desired changes. Rather, than asserting power and making demands, pacifism is an appeal to authority. It says, 'change things or I'll hurt myself.' Never, 'change things, or else we will'. Which ties into the fact, that pacifism is reformative in nature. It can never achieve change on its own, but appeals to someone else to make the change.
