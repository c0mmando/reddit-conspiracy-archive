<p>Extraordinarily brilliant, as it forces all leftist majors to be removed or privately subsidized. He also wants to destroy Lyndon “I totally didn’t have Kennedy killed, goyim” Johnson’s unconstitutional revocation of free speech within churches to allow the country to have a moral governmental rule again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Trump actually answered 12 questions</em> - more than Obama (And several of Obama&#39;s answers were about a plant and his favorite random shit), and that wasn&#39;t the only record it broke. </p>

<p>The issues occurred because Trump originally began answering questions while in the air aboard Trump Force One. He had a spotty connection and had some technical issues that needed to be addressed.</p>

<p>After answering a few questions in-air, he once again resumed answering a few more questions once TF1 had landed. This is the cause for the time-gap between his first batch of answers and the second. </p>

<p><strong><em>Trump had also actually delayed his entrance to his rally speech slightly so that he could answer those few more questions in the AMA.</em></strong></p>

<p>Starting an AMA while en route to a big rally when you&#39;re pressed for time is a huge deal, especially when he spends over an hour in total in the thread. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t want to answer real questions with real answers, that&#39;s the reality.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no excuse for Trump&#39;s laziness. He refused to answer a simple question about marijuana and the war on drugs despite over 2k upvotes.</p>

<p>Y&#39;know, maybe if he promised to end the war on drugs, the single most harmful conspiracy the government has ever participated in, I might not have hated him as much.</p>

<p>Instead he gave substance free answers with no real policy suggestions.</p>

<p>It is also the most brigaded and most targeted - which is why they are so strict. There are other pages to go to if you want to bash Trump. I&#39;ve posted on r/the_donald a lot and never had an issue. </p>

<p>He wants to make it legal to import medical drugs from overseas to bring down the price.</p>

<p>He wants to get rid of Common Core and return education to the States (currently we spend more on education per head than any other country, but our standard of education is really low). </p>

<p>He wants to secure out border and stop the drug cartel crime from spilling into our country. </p>

<p>He is anti-war... he wants to stop toppling foreign leaders. But he wants to crush ISIS. </p>

<p>He wants to build up our military.</p>

<p>He wants to eliminate taxes for the poor, and lower taxes for everyone else. </p>

<p>He wants to simplify the tax code. </p>

<p>He wants to make it so that colleges have to share responsibilities for student loans so that they are motivated to keep costs low and education high (this is kinda brilliant). </p>
