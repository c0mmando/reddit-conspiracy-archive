       It's irrelevant anyway. The Schultz controversy is a smokescreen, a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. mentioned, research shows that exit polls are almost always spot on. When one or two are incorrect, they could be statistical anomalies, but the more incorrect they are, the more it substantiates electoral fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is shown by the data, which is extremely suspicious: discrepancies in eight of the sixteen primaries favoring Clinton in voting results over exit polling data are outside of the margin of error. That’s half of them outside the margin of error: 2.3% greater in Tennessee, 2.6% in Massachusetts, 4% in Texas, 4.7% in Mississippi, 5.2% in Ohio, 6.2% in New York, 7% in Georgia, and 7.9% in Alabama.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is extremely, extremely abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The margin of error is designed to prevent this, accounting for the difference in percentage totals between the first exit polls and actual voting results for both candidates combined (as noted by the table’s third footnote). For instance, if Hillary Clinton outperforms the exit polls by 2.5% and Bernie Sanders underperforms by 2.5%, and the margin of error is 5%, then the exit poll is exactly on the margin of error. When an exit poll or two is outside of the margin, this denotes failure in the polling; when eight defy it — egregiously so — that indicates systemic electoral fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, these are the discrepancies in favor of Clinton between exit polls and voting results, from lowest to highest: -6.1%, -1.9%, 1.1%, 1.7%, 3.4%, 3.9%, 4.1%, 4.3%, 4.6%, 5.2%, 8%, 8.3%, 9.3%, 9.9%, 10%, 11.6%, 12.2%, and a whopping 14%.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The exit polls from the Republican primaries do not show these types of massive disparities)

       "No one has yet figured out a straightforward method of ensuring that one of the most revered democratic institutions - in this case, electing a U.S. president- can be double checked for fraud, particularly when paperless e-voting systems are used." - Larry Greenemeier, Scientific American
      </p>
      <p>
       Irregularities are unique to 2016
      </p>
      <p>
       To show that the pattern of votes may suggest a systematic effort to undercut Senator Sanders, we must show that no such patterns were in place in similar elections. Given that Secretary Clinton lost to President Obama in 2008, their data is a natural control and the best possible point of comparison for the 2016 data. Thus, as we did for 2016, we tabulated the percentage of delegates won in each state by (then Senator) Hillary Clinton. The Qsllil show that, contrary to the 2016 data, there is no evidence that primary states without paper trails favored Senator Clinton in 2008, P = 0.38. As such, the patterns of 2016 are different from their best point of comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we witnessing a dishonest election? Our first analysis showed that states wherein the voting outcomes are difficult to verify show far greater support for Secretary Clinton. Second, our examination of exit polling suggested large differences between the respondents that took the exit polls and the claimed voters in the final tally. Beyond these points, these irregular patterns of results did not exist in 2008. As such, as a whole, these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the 2016 Democratic Party Presidential Primary election. This fraud has overwhelmingly benefited Secretary Clinton at the expense of Senator Sanders.

       Interestingly, much information has recently come to light about the Clinton candidacy. Notably, the hacker Guccifer 2.0 released documents which he took from the computer network of the Democratic National Committee. Among these files, one tabulated a list of big-money donors to the Clinton Foundation. One fact has gone unreported in the media: Two of the three companies that control the electronic voting market, namely Dominion Voting and H.I.G. Capital (i.e. Hart Intercivic), are in this list of big-money donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       To examine the possibility that the products linked to these companies had been used to commit electoral fraud, we borrowed the methodology of a paper by Francois Choquette and James Johnson (C&amp;J). Their paper is based on one of the basic principles in the biological and social sciences: As the amount of data increases, the measurement of the average approaches the ‘true’ average. In other words, as more data is added, the average fluctuates less and less. [...]
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, these same voting irregularities had been shown to occur in the 2008 and 2012 elections in favor of McCain and Romney, respectively, by the researchers, Choquette and Johnson. In 2008 and 2012, McCain and Romney" were "financially interconnected with two of the major electronic voting companies." Both the companies who donated to the Clinton Foundation share a history of past election controversies and conviction for white collar crimes.

       Fuck mate, I actually read the same comment thinking it was a pretty insightful comment and I wanted to check out the youtube videos in it. Now that it was deleted for absolutely no reason makes me REALLY question the democratic party. Hillary couldn't stand losing another election to a perceived outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's funny is I spent time, looking through each thread, looking for the exact comment. I searched for cover up, exit polling and was SHOCKED to not find this comment anywhere. I can't believe you actually copied &amp; pasted it. Seriously REDDIT needs to throw out the bots and give the people it's voice back, otherwise we need to start heading elsewhere. This is not a conspiracy, this is a targeted effort by those in power to silence the truth. Thankfully Reddit's search engine isn't intelligent enough to silence searching for this thread but I imagine that one day it will be, and that's the scariest part of this all.

       These megathreads are censoring debate.

      <p>
       We can have dozens of articles about Trump and his family. But when real news breaks it's neatly packed and parceled away into a megathread where meaningful discussion is drowned in unrelated commentary.

       And looking at the bigger picture (and I'm speculating here), a well visible MEGATHREAD about something risque, and upvotes/downvotes being hidden by default, combined with most people on Reddit only reading the top few comments; only the comments that push an agenda will be on top.

       Ok, who among you are republicans? Seriously, i have no party and do not support hillary in any way, but just because RFK jr said it, doesnt make it necessarily true. Heres the thing: stats are a bitch. I cant verify any of the sources beyond a shadow of a doubt without physical, incontrovertible evidence. My gut is telling me she did it, but that easily could be bias swaying my opinion. I understand where electronic voting could have played a huge factor (which is why i always cast a paper ballot, even though i dont vote) but i cannot accept any of this until someone steps forward and brings ACTUAL physical data that can spot these "irregularities", even if they are highly incongrous. If we are operating under these premises, then why isnt bush in jail for stealing 2000 and 2004? No really, if you have proof, you need to file an amicus brief with the SCOTUS and have them make the states in question certify their vote once and for all for the record: no runoff, no dead voters, 100% false verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, you cant do this. Its a logistical nightmare and it wont make a dent in difference. Like the idiots saying Comey is going after the clintons for RICO. Really? On what grounds? What proof do you have?
      </p>
      <p>
       People, this isnt fucking rocket science: She either "did it" or she didnt. Even the emails, although scandolous, is nothing new. This happens more often than you think in campaigns and elections than you realize. I know this because i used to canvass for the dems, ive sat up on the nights leading into the elections listening to phone conferences and some of the shit you hear would make your head spin. Granted, its nothing like these emails, but its also strategy 101. Playing dirty, although dishonorable, is a part of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, i implore you to share the real proof that voter fraud did take place. Show me what can not be unseen and then ill believe you.

       Empirical evidence may be hard to find (although not impossible, and should be pursued regardless of your political views), it is not old news that the voting system can EASILY be manipulated.

       It's not about my views, it's about the truth. We can't go willy nilly against one of the most powerful political families without incontrovertible proof (if it hasn't already been expunged or destroyed already) that they done did it. That's really what I'm saying. As I said, I have no stake in the outcome.

       Dumbass, I have no party. I'm neither conservative or liberal. A guy dying before a testimony, although highly improbable and downright suspicious, doesn't prove that "she did it". As for 9/11, I'm more in the camp that Bush and Friends let it happen, but the whole range of conspiracies on the towers collapsing go from batshit to mediocre. I dont want to start an arguement, I'm stating the fact that these emails need to be read in full and verified before anyone jumps to conclusions.

       No, I'm neither of those either, but way to make assumptions. I've first hand experienced corruption in ways you will never know and I hope you never do. So, if you have proof, produce these "lists". Also, the Clintons hate the Bush family, idk where you get your information from, but it's clear to me you have no idea what the hell you are talking about.

       because the context of what I'm talking about in re: to corruption is insignificant, as it is happening at a local and state level from my outpost and does not impact the national stage, with the exception of the primaries and voter purges. Again, what goes on in "my world" impacts me directly, but it also has deeper ties and implications than you would never understand. So again, go fuck yourself, you fucking child. You claim HRC has killed people, PROVE IT!

One fact has gone unreported in the media: Two of the three companies that control the electronic voting market, namely Dominion Voting and H.I.G.

       tldr; it is painfully obvious that HRC is cheating her way into the White House with plenty of help from a lot of people.

       They don't even have to do a cover up because the MSM (also HRC's backers) are simply refusing to report the facts.

       Maybe that's why Trump ran. They knew it was rigged, that Hill would win and no other candidate wanted a loss in his column, especially after collecting millions to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is an ego, can afford to run, got his face on tv some more and most importantly, got his son and daughter in the limelight for their politic runs soon enough.  We had bush/cliinton dynasties, why not a Clinton/Trump dynasty with Trumps's kids taking over after Hill's two terms?
