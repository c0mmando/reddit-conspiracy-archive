The actual calculations involved are not that complicated - Newton will do, as far as I&#39;m aware - and the entire mission can be preplanned down to the second without even leaving the ground. The fact that satellites were launched into precise orbits before any manned mission took place should indicate the basics were pretty well in hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, let&#39;s see about this one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know that famous scene where they land on the moon for the first time in the module. And then they record Neil stepping on the moon for the first time. Who or what was out there recording that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, you seem to be under the impression that the only way to record something is with someone holding a camera. Shockingly, stationary cameras don&#39;t need that. The first step was recorded with a stationary onboard camera mounted to the lander, not by a person - that&#39;s what NASA actually says, and the concept isn&#39;t exactly crazy. You can doubt them, of course, but it seems pointless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And who recorded them leaving so effortlessly in the module</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Launching back to space was recorded by a stationary camera too (which I would hope is obvious, as there was nobody left on the ground) that was controlled from back on Earth: radio is a thing. That&#39;s why only a single launch was caught fully in frame, too - there&#39;s a lightspeed delay with Earth which means you have to send the signal to tilt a little earlier than you&#39;d expect, sort of winging it. They only got it right the last time, I believe, the others are out of sync and only show part of the ascent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you know the one where the module goes poof and they magically float back in to space so effortlessly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going &#39;poof&#39; is an interesting criticism btw. Many fuels burn nearly invisibly &amp; you can see that in rocket footage, especially when they get to higher altitudes were there is little atmosphere. Watching the launch footage, you can see the brighter flame in the bell when the craft leans away from the camera, so it&#39;s not like the engines are off. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s telling that the lander behaves in a way that one would expect from knowledge about rocketry &amp; not how a layman would expect a spaceship to behave based on pop culture. Either they really took place, or the people who hoaxed it were familiar enough with rocketry to fake it in a way that&#39;s consistent with the science. Either way, the only person who is definitely wrong here is someone who thinks it&#39;s hoax <em>because</em> of the way it looks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>of course, they make perfect calculations and come back to Earth everytime perfectly!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Orbits aren&#39;t magical. You can calculate, with basic physics, the requirements for staying or going to various locations in space. Going back to Earth isn&#39;t particularly difficult - if you are <em>anywhere</em> in its sphere of influence, just slowing down your relative speed is a good way to get yourself a one-way ticket to the ground. The most impressive part here is that NASA aimed for a specific area in the ocean - and it was still a pretty big area. I mean, satellites will come back on their own, and the ISS would come howling to the ground if not for regular boosts to higher orbit. </p>

<p>Also, Apollo 13 kinda puts a dent in the argument that nothing goes wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s never any fear in the astronauts voice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Astronauts are freaking <em>astronauts.</em> Many of them are career military or fighter pilots, including test pilots, and being made out of stone-cold ice is pretty much a job requirement. Couple that with some seriously intense mission-specific training, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re expecting here - even if they were fearful, they would certainly have been trained to work on regardless. Maybe if they were random people picked off the streets you&#39;d have a point...</p>

We <em>know</em> that there isn&#39;t a space race currently, and we know that it is very expensive to send people out into space. That is sufficient to explain why nobody has done it recently.

    <div class="md"><p>Because radiation isn&#39;t some mysterious thing. They knew it existed and they planned around the most intense zones to limit exposure. Radiation can affect electronics but the electronics can be designed to withstand it. Radiation wasn&#39;t some unknown thing in the 1960s. There are currently sattelites that pass through the belt, and have been for a long time. It&#39;s not like it now just being learned about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have time to watch the whole thing tonight, but just so you are aware, the person who made the video is missing or purposefully excluding huge points. He points to an article written by Van Allen, and quotes a thing about the MAX levels of radiation being extremely deadly. The guy in the video stops there, but if you take 5 seconds to read the next sentence, &quot;.. a manned spacecraft can best take off through the radiation-free zone over the poles.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.testofbelievers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/VanAllenBelts-SciAm-Mar1959.pdf">You can read it here if you want :)</a></p>

<p>The Apollo missions didn&#39;t take off from the poles, but they traveled through the radiation closer to the poles, where the radiation isn&#39;t deadly. You can look at diagrams of the radiation values and how they taper off by orders of magnitude near the fringes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that never ceases to amaze me is peoples propensity to over estimate what computers can do, especially back then. I think there was a large enough number of people who wished Star Trek would happen in their life time that they let their imaginations get away from them and swallowed the moon landing without hesitation or critical thought. Just the fact that billions of dollars were spent on these programs shows that there were definitely individuals who had plenty of motivation to convince the public to keep the programs running.</p>

<p>with modern styled and complex annotations, something that was not easy or probable in pre CRT days. why have silly terse comments on the source code when they would never be used on a computer.</p>

<p>code back in those days was written by hand and stored on tape or card.</p>

<p>the source code would be in book form with complex comments and annotations, not the silly modern shite.</p>

<p>somebody versed in modern C and assembly likely wrote this &#39;retro&#39; code.</p>

<p>no computer compiling back in those days, everything was <strong>hand translated</strong> from assembler to machine code.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2001 is pretty, but I think people get a bit gaga over the special effects when the truth is most of them are affected by the constraints of the time. For a movie that&#39;s not particularly problematic - modern space movies get things wrong too, all the time, and CG still can&#39;t always conjure up a convincing image depending on how much effort is put in. For a hoax, it kinda is important.</p>

<p>Watch the movie again sometime and look not for shitty CG, but for factual errors in how things behave. I&#39;m talking everything from space ships to objects in the scene to light to the sky. It&#39;s pretty remarkable what you miss on a plain viewing. (Favorites: billowing clouds of dust on landing, incorrect moon landscape, inconsistent Earth, diffuse shadows, incorrect gravity.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that shifts the focus, though - the reason people bring up Hollywood is that they figure the people at the movies know how to convincingly fake space, using 2001 as their example. If Hollywood can&#39;t actually manage it well enough to matter, and it requires an astronomical budget and techniques unseen just to pull it off, then Hollywood&#39;s kind of become irrelevant.</p>

<p>This is brilliant, &quot;the fact that there are people who are interested in science, discovery, space and physics and are more knowledgeable about those areas than I am is enough to convince me that we didn&#39;t land on the moon!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna print out the quote and put it on my wall whenever I feel like I&#39;m getting lazy with my studies.  It will inspire me to overcome the tedium in order to never end up saying something even remotely similar to your comment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve shown you that we have, why are you now changing the point?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t logically comprehend why we&#39;re not sending people to the moon at an enormous cost for absolutely no reason other than to &quot;go back&quot;, then it&#39;s no wonder you&#39;ve fallen for the Moon Hoax disinfo campaign.</p>

<p>People explore to discover new things, make a profit or just plain show-off.  The moon has nothing profitable that would warrant the cost of going back, America already showed-off by making it there first, and new things are being discovered all the time via the probes.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing about people who believe nonsense.  Once they run out of ways to say they have no evidence, they run away because they&#39;re too afraid of actually learning something.  You&#39;ve been failed by a floundering educational system, a product of the progressive and intentional dumbing-down of society.  Your brain is jealous of the fact that it didn&#39;t manage to find itself in a more competent individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying its all or nothing. But most of The part that makes sound, The exhaust, is outside, in vaccum, which means no sound. Also, The internal compartment did probably shut out some of The sound. I promise you, even at take off, when they are on earth, The astronauts does not hear all of The 160db. Couple this with The shitty microphones they had at The time, and its no wonder that you dont hear when they fire The thrusters. </p>

<p>Also, honest question, since i have never talked to anyone who denies The moon landing. Why do you say that we are uninformed minority? If you were to talk to People on The Street or anywhere, they would say that its real. You are in a minority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying its all or nothing. But most of The part that makes sound, The exhaust, is outside, in vaccum, which means no sound. Also, The internal compartment did probably shut out some of The sound. I promise you, even at take off, when they are on earth, The astronauts does not hear all of The 160db. Couple this with The shitty microphones they had at The time, and its no wonder that you dont hear when they fire The thrusters. </p>

<p>Also, honest question, since i have never talked to anyone who denies The moon landing. Why do you say that we are uninformed minority? If you were to talk to People on The Street or anywhere, they would say that its real. You are in a minority. </p>

<p>Also,one thing i dont get (honest question, not trying to mock you) </p>

<p>Why would they fake The moon landing? What is there to gain?</p>
