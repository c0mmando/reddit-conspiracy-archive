        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>German journalist Richard Gutjahr, 42, who filmed the scene unfold, said: &#39;I stood on the balcony, right on the Promenade des Anglais, and saw how people celebrated there, and how suddenly a truck drove through the crowd,&#39; he told AFP on Friday. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3691144/Horrifying-footage-shows-moment-terrorist-ploughs-truck-screaming-Bastille-Day-crowd-killing-73-Nice.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3691144/Horrifying-footage-shows-moment-terrorist-ploughs-truck-screaming-Bastille-Day-crowd-killing-73-Nice.html</a></p>

<p>Local reporter Richard Gutjahr described the scene at the shopping center as something &quot;out of a bad movie,&quot; with the shopping center completely surrounded by police, a helicopter overhead, and police carrying semi-automatic rifles. Gutjahr was not able to confirm reports of deaths or injuries. </p>

<p>Richard Gutjahr who filmed the Nice France Bastille Day Staged attack is married to Mossad agent and Knesset member Einat Wilf. To quote Mossad agent Richard Gutjahr this video is like something &quot;out of a bad movie&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you have to qualify your statement by saying you &quot;don&#39;t usually ascribe to conspiracy theories&quot;? Genuinely curious about this. As if ascribing to conspiracy theories in general is something to be looked down on. They happen all the time, and it&#39;s not like if you believe in <em>a</em> conspiracy theory that you are* then a member of a club that makes you the same as everyone else who believes in <em>a</em> conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I don&#39;t? To elaborate, by ascribe I mean &quot;don&#39;t actively read or talk about it in my daily life&quot; because while these theories can be intriguing, I have other things to do in my life than worry about what the CIA/FSB/NATO/Israel/powerful lobbyists/world governments are up to. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not proving or qualifying anything, in fact I used to always watch videos about Conspiracies both real and theoretical years ago, as well as being subscribed to this subreddit; however you should be aware that comes with it&#39;s own negative sentiments, if you look at what other people on Reddit say about it. </p>

<p>The fact that I bothered to come to this thread, read OP&#39;s post, and scroll down here to see the additional info means that I am open to different perspectives on a topic and don&#39;t hold the same stigma as others do. Like you said yourself, me believing in one theory doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I believe in other theories, so me showing interest  in <em>this</em> particular theory shouldn&#39;t change that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally witnessed the glowing radiation cloud in space caused by a nuclear bomb test in space. You could see it from the ground and the media told you to lool for it. It was a big glow in the night sky that was completely obviously very high in the atmosphere (higheractually) and huge.</p>

<p>Plenty of peopel alive have seen actual nuclear tests in Nevada. People in las Vegas heard them and saw the clouds.   All paintings painted before the before the nuke was detonated don&#39;t have a certain element in the  paint that was created during the atomic blast. All paintings painted afterward do. Its one way they authentic old paintings.</p>

<p>For any one person the probability is low, but the probability that there was at least one person in the same location for any of the many recent-ish attacks in Europe is a lot higher.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s unclear, but since he is a journalist in Munich it seems likely that he would rush to the scene and I don&#39;t see any direct references to him being there as it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pictures he removed showed police operations during the first couple hours when the situation was still unclear. You&#39;re correct that he removed them after the munich police tweeted to not post videos or pictures, and  clarrified in <a href="https://twitter.com/gutjahr/status/756589133963943936">this tweet</a> that the 4 pics he posted were 30 mins delayed to not compromise the officers in those photos. </p>

<p>Just for context, I followed the situation from the start in the live thread on reddit, watched german television (native german), checked twitter for updates  and  even saw his pictures since  I follow him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much the election as the political situation in general. The two parties are both owned and controlled by largely the same people, with the same general interests. No matter who wins the election, the oligarchs win. </p>

<p>Dissent from this status quo is largely kept to the fringes of each party: Ron Paul in the GOP and Sanders in the DNC. But if the democrats were to split, and a viable third party to form, many on the fringe right could join, realizing both parties are corrupt. The oligarchs can effectively control the political system by controlling the two parties, but if enough people lose faith in them, their control is threatened.</p>

<p>All your values, morals, common sense, and view of history are heavily influenced by the society you live in and its primary method of obtaining information.  In the USA its hollywood movies.

    <div class="md"><p>I dislike the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; for all but the most absurd (flat-earthers, faked moon landing) because <em>shit like this happens</em>. </p>

<p>False flags happen (it&#39;s suspected Turkey&#39;s coupe was a false flag for the PM to seize more power...). <em>To this day</em>. Corruption happens (even with Western politicians!). People will pay other people to kill people and to keep them quiet. The drug cartels for sure do this. What puts politicians silencing opposition above it?</p>

<p>All of the above scenarios, at some point in time, have happened before. Society has made some good progress with lowering assassination attempts and corruption in general - but it still exists.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help when we have <em>proof from our own government</em> of doing shady shit. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-military-tested-bacterial-weapons-in-san-francisco-2015-7/">Things like this</a> or <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro">even shit like this</a>. </p>

<p>People like to think that stuff in the 50&#39;s-60&#39;s sure-as-shit wouldn&#39;t happen in the 21st century. <em>I don&#39;t understand that rationale</em>. My favorite conspiracy was actually <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964">proven to be a legitimate concern</a>, even in the 21st century.</p>

<p>It is OK in my book to remain suspicious of governments using COINTEL practices to control their population. The theory itself is <em>plausible</em>. Thinking the same journalist <em>proves</em> this theory is where people cross into &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; in my eyes. Occam&#39;s razor and all that jazz.</p>

<p>It is important to remain at least a little suspicious. After all, the government would love nothing more than its citizens to completely ignore everyone who thinks the government may be corrupt any time someone tries to out them as being corrupt. ;)</p>

<p>If I wasn&#39;t on the list already - I sure as hell am now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Local journalist says the scene was pretty full on. He is a journalist he headed to where the news was. It doesn&#39;t say he was at the McDonalds or even in the neighbourhood when it started. As a journalist he we&#39;d have been able to access more vantage points for news.
In addition I am sure journalists have a network of other journalists they seek info from. If he was early on to the scene it&#39;s probable an associate would have contacted him to get further information for their own articles......omg like this article just written</p>

That link said 17;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community">here&#39;s a link that says 16</a>.</p>

<p>Every major (cabinet level) agency has multiple intel agenices.   DoD has a quite few of them (DIA, NSA, ONI, CSS, etc)  The Treasury Department has a &quot;Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence&quot;.   The DoE has a Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.   And the State Department has its Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

<p><sup>hmm.   imagine how much better they could work together if we decided the purpose of all those agencies was mostly to Secure the Homeland, and rolled them all into one under DHS</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this post, I was ready get on my rarely used tin foil hat, but it seems like you are right. Coincidence of the gods, yes... But he didn&#39;t film the second one (yesterday&#39;s incident I mean) so I doubt he&#39;s that &quot;in the know&quot; and whatever his wife is, if she&#39;s Israeli, I doubt he gets to know the &quot;dankest hit spots in town&quot;. They treat their stuff just as secretively as the us does. And they&#39;re world class at it. Though who knows anymore, this shit has been going insane. I just pray as an atheist that if there is a god he slows all this down. It saddens me to see any innocent from any country get caught up in this shit. I&#39;m not a globalist by any means but I think we can all agree this has to all stop at every level. </p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s because Wilf&#39;s Wiki page was <strong>SCRUBBED</strong> over the past few days to remove all reference of her working in Israeli intelligence?</p>

Still, I don&#39;t really see what Israel could gain from this. There is a video of the gunman saying he did this because he was bullied for 7 years, making this a plausible &quot;normal&quot; killing spree due to mental health issues, not because of religion.</p>

<p>Yeah, and there are many mainstream sources that mention her service in Israeli Intelligence - Jerusalem Post and others. I cited several sources in this thread:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4u92vi/wiki_page_of_einat_wilf_scrubbed_wife_of_richard/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4u92vi/wiki_page_of_einat_wilf_scrubbed_wife_of_richard/</a></p>

<p>Seeing that your earlier (skeptical) post has the second highest upvotes in this thread, maybe you could edit it to show that she actually DID serve in Israeli intelligence?</p>

<p>It would be the honorable thing to do, no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>Unit 8200 is the largest unit in the Israel Defense Forces, comprising several thousand soldiers.[3] <strong>It is comparable in its function to the United States&#39; National Security Agency</strong> and is a Ministry of Defense body just as the NSA is part of the United States Department of Defense.</p>

<p>Subordinate to Unit 8200 is Unit Hatzav (Hebrew name for Drimia (Hebrew: יחידת חצב‎‎)), responsible for collecting OSINT intelligence. <strong>The unit monitors and collects military intelligence–related information from television, radio, newspapers, and the internet.</strong> The translation of various items accounts for part of what is termed &quot;basic intelligence&quot;, which is collected by the units. According to media reports, <strong>the unit provides over half of the overall intelligence information for the Israeli Intelligence Community.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Unit 8200 and Mossad is the same thing even though they are Israeli Intelligence Agencies and he does live in München. Still the coincidences can only stack up so high before things become apparent.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting article on Unit 8200 from Forbes (May 31, 2016)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another from the Financial Times (UK),  July 10, 2015</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/69f150da-25b8-11e5-bd83-71cb60e8f08c.html">Unit 8200: Israel’s cyber spy agency</a></strong></p>

<p>Unit 8200 is bizarre in that it connects military, intelligence and corporations worldwide into a little web - the hub of which is Israel and Unit 8200.</p>

<p>No doubt they are using these connections to get their fingers (and moles/industrial spies) into every facet of business and technology worldwide.</p>

<p>Yeah, attackers on terrorism events are reading twitter on their smartphone (making searches with hashtags and shit) while holding a rifle and shooting to people, to know where the police were 20 minutes ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;rape crisis&quot; in Sweden. This is some commentary I have saved on the subject:</p>

<p>There are a number of issues at play in the statistics. </p>

<p>First of all, the stats regarding immigrant rape haven&#39;t been published since 1996 (<a href="http://www.pdf-archive.com/2011/05/08/br-1996-2-invandrares-och-invandrares-barns-brottslighet-1/br-1996-2-invandrares-och-invandrares-barns-brottslighet-1.pdf">source</a>) so I would be interested to know what <em>your</em> sources are. </p>

<p>Rape is also reported differently in Sweden compared to other European countries, there are 3 main reasons for this are, statistical, legal, and substantive factors. 
<a href="http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/crime-statistics.html">Source</a></p>

<p>The combined effect of this makes it safe to contend that the Swedish rape statistics constitute an &#39;over-reporting&#39; relative to the European average. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1008713631586">source</a>.</p>

<p>Sweden has had the highest number of reported rapes since the 90s. I linked you that earlier, this was long before the refugee crisis and is due to how they record and classify sexual crimes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the collation of crime statistics was initiated by the Council of Europe, Sweden has had the highest number of registered rape offences in Europe by a considerable extent. In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences registered in 35 European countries. However, this does not necessarily mean rape is three times as likely to occur as in the rest of Europe, since cross-national comparisons of crime levels based on official crime statistics are problematic, due to a number of factors described below</p>

<p>A journalist from one of the largest, most important cities in Germany goes to visit one largest, most important cities in France during a National Holiday, and then returns home.

<p>What about that scenario is strange or hard to comprehend? There are probably dozens if not hundreds of people who live in Munich that were in Nice at the time. It&#39;s just that this guy is a journalist and the others weren&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>BOOM</strong> mass shooting. I get everything on film, because I know where most of the population will be because I did research. I didn&#39;t expect a tragedy, but because I did my homework I knew where everyone would congregate - just like a terrorist would. </p>

<p>Okay, so I go back home after a week or so because I need to do some work. One day I end up in a heavily populated area because it&#39;s a hub for whatever I need for the day as with everyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, from what I can glean from my hours and hours of research is that there is a sort of ritualistic intent when it comes to the revelation of method. I believe they have some sort of pact or code of conduct that states that it is only okay to rule over the people if you let them know it. If the masses cannot figure it out, then at least they have done their part, they have &quot;played fair&quot;. So they give hints. By they, I mean the intelligence agencies of course. Intelligence is just so entrenched in every aspect of it. There are so many layers too, and I think that intelligence is so clearly safe from any push-back that they probably see it as playing with their food. Many of these people are sadists and it probably gives them some sick pleasure. This is really the only logical reasoning I can conclude behind the many strategies of revelation they employ. But really, your guess is as good as mine. I&#39;d be lying if I told you I was sure one way or another.   </p>

<p>I see you grasping for answers just like I have. This is one area of research into the way they rule which can really go off the deep end quite easily. Satanic rituals run by the power elite? That&#39;s crazy!</p>

<p>I tend towards your way of thinking, that what you call Revelation of Method is a psychological trick. I have three different theories regarding it, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, all or none may be true.</p>

<p>1) Revealing intent and method is a means to reassure lower-level operatives that their consciences are clear because &quot;consent&quot; was given by the victim(s). In this scenario, the giveaways are intended to manipulate persons who serve the power elite, and not the power elite themselves, nor the victims.</p>

<p>2) Revealing intent and method is a means to assuage whatever conscience remains in the power elite themselves. I think for many of them, their role in the world is somewhat distasteful, and doesn&#39;t come as easily or naturally as we might assume. It&#39;s their point of view, shared by their peers, that they have a responsibility to a wider culture, race, organization, nation, or whatever &quot;transcendent&quot; collective they are beholden / loyal to, and that in order to carry out their responsibility to the collective, they must commit awful deeds. The ritual of revealing method and intent is a self-directed trick, which has been passed down from generation to generation inside the ruling circles.</p>

<p>3) Revealing intent and method is a means by which the victims are dehumanised, degraded, and devalued. This delights the psychopathic elite who despises men who are &quot;below&quot; him and who are incapable of the lawless viciousness which is his way of life. It fuels his fire, so to speak.</p>

<p>Most likely, the traditions of the ruling elites originated with the psychopath-type referenced in paragraph (3) above, and they begain ruling with the cooperation of those described in paragraphs (2) and (1). All three dynamics are simultaneously active, each targeting a different portion of the ruling and enforcer classes of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is another theory : &quot;Mega-rituals are often preceded by &#39;clues&#39; in mass media, warning or preparing the victims (and the world) for what&#39;s coming.

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, that&#39;s one rabbit hole even conspiracy connoisseurs are afraid to dive into and the establishment knows that very well. Religion and government are the two pillars of mind control. You think they won&#39;t pay attention to the former as much as the latter? I don&#39;t think so. An open minded investigation of esoteric truths is imperative in deconstructing the playbook of those involved in the great game.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not easy to kill people with an axe in a cramped train. Much harder than using a gun anyway.</p>

<p>Killing 9 people is quite a lot actually, not a lot of spree shooters kill more.</p>

<p>There was some panic in other places of Munich but police is saying it was just that, panicking people. Reports of multiple shooters were probably people not familiar with guns (nearly all Germans) unable to locate the shots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is a group of elite that run the world, or have immense power, or any of a dozen other things they could conceivably be doing it is certainly a reasonable assumption that they could be headquartered, or to some large degree operate out of Europe. (If I were trying to control the world I&#39;d start in Europe.) </p>

<p>The reasons for this are plentiful, but to name just a few:
1.The treaties and agreements between EU members allow for quick and easy travel from nation to nation.
2. The economies are predictable and interwoven with each other.
3. It&#39;s geographically perfect for clandestine activities worldwide.</p>

<p>So assuming this group is actually operating out of Europe, the list of candidates for a primary operations center or headquarters would be fairly small. Germany would likely be very high on this list I would imagine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just one plausible theory anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here, in the video about the Nice attack you can clearly hear his colleague say he was right there at that start by coincidence (in German):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhFTxa6l7M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhFTxa6l7M</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for proof that he was right there when it happened in Munich too. There are interviews with him about the attack and he twittered a photo that he apparently removed to not make the work of the police more difficult.</p>

<p>I want proof that he was right there when in happened. That would be very, very coincidental. Anyone that speaks German can show me to an interview where he clearly states that he was there?</p>

<p>edit: Do I understand correctly that he arrived later on the scene, just 20 minutes before this interview? <a href="https://youtu.be/_lgBhtb4DR4?t=2m">https://youtu.be/_lgBhtb4DR4?t=2m</a>.</p>

<p>So he didn&#39;t actually film the shooting, like many conspiracy videos out there are saying. And neither was he there when the shooting started. Disappointed again in &quot;truthers&quot;. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t possibly a story to this, but people committing to facts would actually make conspiracy theories much more believable to the general public.</p>

<p>So what are the odds that someone witnessed an attack and travelled to another attack and arrived shortly after it as a journalist? Well, much, much greater than witnessing two attacks.</p>

<p>Look at the ethnoreligiousnationality of the people who have pushed immigration on the west. Look at Israels  purely ethnic based immigration scheme. </p>

<p>This should not be surprising. This is the norm for at least a hundred years now. Hopefully people will start waking up when they realise Trump is bought and paid by the Israeli lobby and Fracking Industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this thread is a nice, concise example of the problem with conspiracy theories, and gives a good explanation of why you aren&#39;t taken seriously.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume, for the sake of argument, that what you say is true, and Gutjahr&#39;s wife is a Mossad agent. Let&#39;s assume also that Gutjahr himself is a Mossad agent. From this, you seem to deduce that the official story for both events is untrue and that Gutjahr was somehow involved in the conspiracy. This is ridiculous. Let&#39;s go with the most charitable conspiracy theory - that the media&#39;s representation of events was true (ISIS sympathiser in Nice, lone gunman in Munich) but that Gutjahr knew of the events beforehand and attended both in the knowledge they would happen. Why on earth, being privy to this through his Mossad connections, would an agent then turn up to both events and make it public knowledge that he was at both events? Are we supposed to believe that these dark forces are clever and cunning enough to allow these events to happen unimpeded, or even set up the events themselves, but then so short-sighted that they allow an agent, or the husband of an agent, to attend both and then give interviews on them?</p>

<p>A bare minimum of reflection on what it is you&#39;re implying ought to be enough to tell you how ridiculous you&#39;re being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love conspiracy theory but sometimes coincidences are just that. My university flatmate was on holiday in the US in August/September 2001 and was just getting out of a taxi at WTC on 9/11. Very harrowing photos. Flash forward a few years, we&#39;d finished uni and he was now a police officer and on duty at one of the sites where the 7/7 bombers attacked London. </p>

<p>&quot;Habe heute Fehler gemacht. Konnte nicht glauben, dass ich schon wieder in so eine Situation geraten bin. Die Bilder sind jetzt weg. #OEZ&quot;
<a href="https://twitter.com/gutjahr/status/756627290570784769">https://twitter.com/gutjahr/status/756627290570784769</a></p>

<p>translated: &quot;I have made mistakes today. Could not believe that I had again gotten into such a situation. The pictures are gone [removed] now.&quot;</p>

<p>He is obviously referring to a tweet by the local police asking the people not to upload pictures or footage, which he had retweeted immediately before. And he states that he has removed the images as a consequence of this.</p>

<p>Does anybody have links links to the original images? I think it is proven that he is not the one who recorded and distrubuted the video of the shooter coming out of McDonald&#39;s and opening fire.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lgBhtb4DR4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lgBhtb4DR4</a> In this phone interview he says [02:00] that he arrived 20 minutes after &quot;the whole thing happened&quot;. He was in his car on the &quot;Mittlerer Ring&quot; which is close to the Olympia site. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesstra%C3%9Fe_2_R">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesstraße_2_R</a> He &quot;followed the police convoys&quot;.</p>

<p>This Gutjahr/Wilf thing is very interesting. The question is: how will this and the rest of the story fit together?</p>

<p>Holy shit you guys are retarded. My God. I can&#39;t believe that the people of this sub lack the <em>simplest</em> critical thinking skills. They don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a difference between witnessing a shooting first hand and being a reporter sent to the scene of the crime after the fact. They make up bizarre tales of Mossad agents. Then, they use confirmation bias to make it look like a Mossad agent is directing her husband to film Zionist-manufactured shootings, because, uh, they want to scare people and control the world.</p>

<p>As for the so-called &quot;scrubbing&quot; of the Mossad connection in Einat Wilf&#39;s Wikipedia page, <em>there were no sources for that statement</em>. If you look in the edit history, the person who removed it said this statement was being &quot;abused&quot; and for good reason. Nobody even bothered checking for primary or secondary sources. And I thought you &quot;awake&quot; and &quot;open-minded&quot; alert people didn&#39;t trust Wikipedia because anyone can edit it? That goes both ways.</p>

<p>Please, for God&#39;s sake, reply to me and tell me what I said makes sense. Restore my faith in humanity, I&#39;m begging you.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article didn&#39;t mention a Mossad role. This sentence was specifically deleted:

<p>People were jumping to anti-semetic conspiracy theories in that forum and this person removed that line o stop that. Unfortunately, it underwent the Streisand Effect and people here began thinking that the removal itself was a conspiracy, even though the person removed it precisely to prevent these kinds of conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Not that I agree with the approach this person took, but do you at least understand why it was removed? There&#39;s nothing sinister about it.</p>

When I searched the edit history of that article I found that reference as early as 2009. I don&#39;t want to draw any further conclusions from this deleting.

<p>The blue background is from the blue walls of the hotel they stayed at. they built a studio/stage against the outside wall of the hotel, that&#39;s why it looks like a blue screen.</p>

<p>This is not to mention the fact that they interviewed people during the war who would have had to flown 24 hours + back and forth from the middle east to america if the whole thing was fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apples and Oranges. Merely being in the two cities at the same time as the nuclear events is not important. </p>

<p>What is important is that this journalist was at the EXACT LOCATIONS of very short lived terrorist events AS THEY HAPPENED.</p>

<p>That is orders of magnitude more significant than being inside a city of a nuclear attack which covers dozens of square miles.</p>

<p>The story basically amounts to a guy who lives in Munich saw the attack in Nice and then went to the attack in Munich after it started, i&#39;m guessing because he&#39;s a reporter.</p>
