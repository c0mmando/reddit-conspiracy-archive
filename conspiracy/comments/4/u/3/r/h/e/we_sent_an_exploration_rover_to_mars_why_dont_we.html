       I am just curious to know why we dont have a robot exploring the moon?  We have had one on Mars for a long time now.  Why has NASA never put an exploration rover on the moon?  It would seem logical to start by mapping the surface of our own moon before we venture as far as Mars.  Why?

       What if I told you that each new plane goes through testing before being approved for use?

       Of course, the Wright Brother's weren't the first to fly (in absolute terms), but they were the first to use scientific and engineering principals to build, test, build, test, build, test compounding on what was already proven.  This is the reason they beat out some highly paid and supported inventors of that time.  Now, apply that ingenuity to space and you will quickly find many "facts" are missing in research.

       For instance, you could claim that we already know how planes fly, therefore new models don't need to be tested - But new models still get tested to ensure they work as predicted.

       Of course, but that's not what I'm saying.  We don't even have the basic data to test on.  The Wright Brothers did. They even built their own wind tunnel.  Can I build my own space vacuum tunnel? NO, because I can't get reliable data on what space is.

       He definitely says, in this carefully made video: We (NASA) must SOLVE these (radiation) challenges BEFORE we send people through THIS REGION OF SPACE", which they would have to do to reach the Moon. Clear implication that people have not been through Van Allen (and hence the Moon).

       Every new plane that is designed has to solve the whole gravity and lift thing. That doesn't stop planes from flying nor from new designs being produced.

       Well if you want to get into the details, we're going to head into dirty water because, again, as a lifelong aerospace lover; the data is murky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the "spaceships" have to be shielded.  If you study the X planes and other skunk work type planes you will learn about the shielding they use against the extreme heat caused by atmospheric friction on the airframe.  These materials only handle heat radiation though and some minimal electromagnetic radiation (radar absorbing paint that really doesn't help all that much).  What does the Apollo capsules use? That's right, something that didn't exist in the 60's unless they had the means to push tons of iron up there.

       And yet you're incapable of respond to any of them. It's funny when you talk about "aren't really thinking" but didn't even think to read into relatively simple things like radiation exposure. No instead, let's rely on one youtube video we saw and stop there because the conclusion sounds nice.

       Trick question. We have probably been there for a while, doing stuff on the backside. This is looked at as "nutty" because why would they do it? What would the point of having a base on the moon be? There could be many uses. Perhaps we have been building something there for quite some time to launch a nuke or even fake asteroids. How could we know? Who would tell us? Why would they tell us?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one listens to men on their death beds because so many think they're just crazy and senile. We have been hinted at by quite a few that we have been doing things in space that we aren't being told.

       The reason that is most likely even with China doing their lunar rover is that the moon is essentially claimed by many different extraterrestrial and advanced human groups. Within the past couple decades has more and more countries been gaining access to the L.O.C. or lunar operations command.

       Of course the "spaceships" have to be shielded.  If you study the X planes and other skunk work type planes you will learn about the shielding they use against the extreme heat caused by atmospheric friction on the airframe.  These materials only handle heat radiation though and some minimal electromagnetic radiation (radar absorbing paint that really doesn't help all that much).  What does the Apollo capsules use? That's right, something that didn't exist in the 60's unless they had the means to push tons of iron up there.
