<p>fucking terrible.. but I need a more legtimate source of Assange&#39;s quote other than <a href="https://twitter.com/realkingrobbo/status/757801863970295809/photo/1">this page</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure assange didn&#39;t actually say this, so I think the post should be removed from this sub if there isn&#39;t any proof- BUT, your comment is interesting.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand the party registration process and who is responsible for keeping track of voter registration- I thought it was the state, but given that the primaries are run by the parties, I might be very wrong.  </p>

<p>according to Wikipedia (and I can&#39;t find the real source):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In many states, citizens registering to vote may declare an affiliation with a political party. This declaration of affiliation does not cost money, and does not make the citizen a dues-paying member of a party. A party cannot prevent a voter from declaring his or her affiliation with them, <strong>but it can refuse requests for full membership</strong>. In some states, only voters affiliated with a party may vote in that party&#39;s primary elections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if that&#39;s true, it means the party can potentially purge voters likely to vote outside &quot;party interests&quot;.  That would be in line with some things that DWS said about having ways to ensure that the party isn&#39;t hijacked by an outsider.</p>

<p>So, yeah- as the database analyst, Seth Rich was probably familiar with how party registration was being treated and potentially manipulated.  He was probably doing clustering and pulling lists and would have had intimate knowledge of the inner workings of their marketing strategy. Someone in his position would be the person to subpoena in the event of a lawsuit.</p>
