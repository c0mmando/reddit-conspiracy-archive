       I noticed a huge decrease right at the end of the 4 year Texas drought.  That spring, everything returned to normal and the rains came.  I also saw our spring thunderstorms and high winds (tornado season weather) that I remember as a child coming back; It had been a long time since I had seen weather like that and it stayed normal for about a year and a half.

       Because ignorance is an easily curable disease while simultaneously being incredibly dangerous?  Personally I just become frustrated and discouraged when people basically have all of the knowledge accumulated by humanity at their fingertips, then believe nonsense like the chemtrail conspiracy.

       There are many different types of ignorance.  Being blind to media manipulation and political maneuvering is one.  Being so clueless about the basic sciences behind meteorology and therefore believing in nonsense like chemtrails is another.

       Instead of driving away people who are imploring you to educate yourself to an adequate level you should try to listen and do some research to improve yourself.  It's a life-skill that will serve you well in the future.

       It seems unlikely that you've studied any atmospheric sciences if you believe the chemtrail conspiracy.  What "research" have you done beyond watching Youtube videos?  You are very quick to dismiss somebody who would like to help you educate yourself with something other than agenda driven lies ...

       Sir, the earliest mention of Global Warming is in an article about Geo-engineering.  The technology is at least older than the concept of Global Warming.  Do you believe it's possible for a single chemtrail in earths atmosphere?  Just one?

       The "chemtrail conspiracy" is the idea that the contrails following commercial airliners are something other than the vapour created by burning jet fuel.  It's obvious that these trails are having an effect on the environment, but the idea of chemtrails detracts from dealing with the actual problem of the vapour trails being created.  The uneducated musings of people screaming "look chemtrails" when they're just water condensation, is letting airliners off the hook for taking responsibility for the damage that vapour trails are creating:

       Just because you don't understand why contrails persist or don't, or how to use them to predict incoming weather fronts in combination with radar data and pressure systems, doesn't make them "chemtrails", it simply means that you don't know enough about the atmospheric sciences.  Hopefully your virus of ignorance regarding the issue doesn't spread too far in order for airliners to eventually be held accountable for the damage they are doing to the environment through condensation trails.

       I've noticed that REAL information and reports about chemtrails are a lightning rod for shills and operatives on Reddit. There's a bunch of whacky

        disinformation

       about chemtrails posted by trolls in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to throw everyone from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime a group of people start discussion chemtrail activity in various parts of the country (to compare notes) or a new web site starts up to track chemtrail activity, it get downvoted to hell instantly. Shills show up in the comments and downvote everyone. Then, they downvote the story. Then, they start flooding the sub-Reddit with a bunch of bullshit to "

       </a>
       " and make the chemtrail info disappear. The trolls wear people down via attrition. They hammer on the topic until it dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness: a thread I started 9 months ago about chemtrails:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qbg74/why_arent_there_any_current_web_sites_for_mapping/">

      <p>
       Downvoted to hell. Instantly. Nobody saw it.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       or any sub-Reddit and try to talk about chemtrails. Try getting people to work together to track them in an easy way. Your post will never see the light of day. Chemtrails and geo-engineering are an off-limits topic on the Internet. I'm sure the

       They are called contrails, and whether they persist or disappear is entirely down to the weather. If there's a cold front approaching you can expect contrails to persist and grow in size, but a warm front will mean no contrails. It's fairly simple science, and much simpler to explain than a global conspiracy involving every single person in the aircraft industry.

       Instead of driving away people who are imploring you to educate yourself to an adequate level you should try to listen and do some research to improve yourself.  It's a life-skill that will serve you well in the future.
