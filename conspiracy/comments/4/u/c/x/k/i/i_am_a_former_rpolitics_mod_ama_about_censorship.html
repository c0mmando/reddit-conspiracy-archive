<p>Do they think it&#39;s funny and get high on manipulating people?
Do they just see it as a job in a rotten economy/society?

Do they think they are &quot;in the know&quot;, therefore a special snowflake and not part of the rubble?</p>

<p>This person claiming we have email contact with any campaign though, as an example, is lying.

<p>No, but I remember why some people thought we did: that Breitbart subdomain (so not the whole site, but /videos/) was banned for rehosting, because it had 100% rehosted content. I&#39;m on my phone so I can&#39;t actually remember all the details, but as a topic it was not/is not banned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really understand your reply in terms of mine -- Breitbart&#39;s video subdomain had no original content, and we have one of those &quot;submit content from its original source&quot; rules (no rehosted content).

<p>So, the video is allowed, and if Breitbart is the original source (this is what I don&#39;t remember and can&#39;t easily check on phone), we would individually allow the content. </p>

<p>I possibly somewhat misunderstood you, sorry if so. I&#39;m packing up to drive home currently. </p>

<p>Why so adamant on defending your sub? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call it <em>adamant</em>, but yeah...I take issue to being accused of being a shill or pushing an agenda.  On top of that I&#39;m being accused of shilling for Hillary Clinton, of all people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you just think everyone should believe you and defend other mods?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s an odd question given this is an anonymous forum where people fight for imaginary internet points.  Redditors have proved time and again that they&#39;ll believe whatever suits their narrative but yes, I&#39;d hope they would.  I&#39;m not going to lose any sleep over it if they don&#39;t though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As always...the mods never answer the question presented to them. You are disconnected from each other believing you are connected for a comment goal. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reality you have created for yourself and you try to sell that to the users of your sub. We get it. Control what &quot;you&quot; think should be presented. Luckily your sub only has 3k subscribers. The remaining users are shielding from the propaganda your sub tried to present. </p>

<p>For example. Bernie and the Pope for a 5 min meeting. Your sub was plastered with every spot from every source trying to make Bernie look like he was aligned with the Pope. Do you think that sends a positive message? </p>

<p>Get a grip. You can&#39;t control anything. You&#39;re just a person modding a sub with zero influence of reality. Wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, this is exactly what I was talking about when I said help me follow.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about one thing here. You didn&#39;t explicitly accuse, you insinuated. It&#39;s still publicly calling another user a paid poster, which is clearly against the rules of the sub, as I copied for you.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s where I get even more confused; you knowingly broke the rules. You admitted that you broke the rules. I was discussing you breaking the rules. How does that equate to me defending another user? What are you seeing that I&#39;m not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, sorry to get to this late. Public accusations are never OK. Ever. If you have proof, you need to message us or the admins. The reason we don&#39;t allow you to do it in the comments is because someone who&#39;s shilling and someone who is just incredibly passionate is almost indistinguishable. Because of that, to dismiss someone as being a shill is to attack their character or their reason for commenting, rather than the merits of the argument itself. It may seem like a losing battle, but that&#39;s what we want the focus of our sub to be, discussing ideas.</p>

<p>Does this mean that shills slip through the cracks? Yeah, probably. But I&#39;d (personally) much rather allow that and try and make our sub accessible to all users, especially new comers, than to allow these public accusations, often times unsubstantiated, and, as a result, allow the credibility of well-intentioned users be attacked.</p>

<p>Obviously that&#39;s the unpopular opinion, but it&#39;s one I stand by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the media covering up objective evidence that ISIL is an Israeli false flag operation?</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that the Israeli government could be so effective.  Internally, the Israeli political system is a mess.  I understand that there are extra-political entities within Israel, such as Mossad, that are capable of acting independently of the government.  But, I&#39;m wondering if there is some objective proof that is actively being suppressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>R-/-Politics is corrupt to the core...so I&#39;m assuming since he&#39;s trying to blow the lid on that dump, the person is most likely using a different account and attempting to not get doxxed/harassed/who knows...</p>

<p>Since they are just a temp mod and already said that they weren&#39;t  allowed to be completely &quot;in the know&quot; about exact details if it&#39;s system, and that they were basically just an errand boy/girl doing menial crap. </p>

<p>I would guess they have went through more than a few of those, and if careful that they could remain hidden. Now if they were shown the door and 10 minutes later this pops up, well that may be a different story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has no one here been to r/politics since last December? The place was a pretty liberal lean for years upon years, and suddenly became Clinton hatefest, 24-7. The front page for several months was 70%-90% anti-Clinton posts, to the point where things like Brexit weren&#39;t even registering. Positive Clinton news, like Sanders&#39;s endorsement, would be squashed into a megathread and all other posts destroyed. The top comment on every post was something like &quot;Clinton is a corporate whore!&quot; with a thousand upvotes despite saying nothing of any substance. Any attempt at even nuance was downvoted into oblivion.</p>

<p>If r/politics is biased for Clinton, then the Red Pill is biased in favor of promoting respect for women and r/all is biased against shitpost memes.</p>
