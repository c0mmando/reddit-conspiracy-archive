    <div class="md"><p>I was going to start a similar thread, so I&#39;ll post this here:</p>

<p>What if every single leak was a calculated and intentional information drop?  What if the new plan was to make Hillary into the &quot;fall guy.&quot;  If Hillary loses, then we&#39;ll have REAL HONEST POLITICIANS, because obviously SHE is the only one who is dirty, right? </p>

<p>So let&#39;s set her up to fail and put another equally impotent pupped in as POTUS, and then people will feel like we FINALLY have someone who SAYS WHAT HE MEANS and DOES WHAT HE SAYS HE WILL.</p>

<p>If you think for a moment that Trump isn&#39;t already a part of the true political system that happens behind closed doors, you&#39;re a fool.</p>

<p>Hillary was the initially chosen nominee, but Bernie&#39;s followers stood tall and strong.  Suddenly (and quite predictably, especially by the posts in this sub), Bernie vanishes and it&#39;s down to Trump and Hil.  Just as suddenly, Hillary is being torn apart by leaked information from unknown sources that Bernie and Trump supporters foam at the mouth to see.  Trump can literally say anything and do anything and still somehow gets praise and accolades and attention.  Bernie has already given up, at least on some level.</p>

<p>The real truth, though, is that the POTUS has already been chosen for us and it doesn&#39;t even matter.  POTUS is a figurehead at best, and a slave at worst.</p>

<p>Everyone is lying to us all of the time, and we all know it.  This charade we call an election is reality TV, and it is a distraction mechanism while we prepare for a crumbling planet thanks to our overzealous overuse.  Keep the Americans busy fighting about Trump, Bernie, and Hillary while they do the real work behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The whole fucking thing is sleight of hand and no one seems to notice, no one seems to care.  Sure, we have our little online outrage spats about this or taht, but if anyone really cared, they&#39;d be out screaming in the streets.  But we have to work.  We have to feed our families, we have to pay our bills.  We can&#39;t stand up for what we believe in, because then our comfort is gone... or our lives.</p>

<p>We&#39;re completely locked into whatever the fuck is happening, and there&#39;s nothing we can do, nothing we can say.</p>

<p>The game is over, and we lose.</p>

<p>Unless you can convince enough people to vote outside of the two-party fix and actually kick these corrupt clowns down a notch. Neither of the two leaders are representing <em>your</em> future.<br/>
2016 deserves to be the year of the independant candidate after all the fuckery that&#39;s gone on. Why not make history?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way, cuck (since we established that you&#39;re the cuck in my last reply), let&#39;s talk about the term cuck and how you&#39;re idiotically using it, hm?</p>

<p>Cuck is short for cuckhold.  A cuckhold is someone whose wife goes around and fucks whomever she wants and her cuck husband stays at home and maybe jerks off with his tears.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not on any side, and therefore, I don&#39;t have anyone cuckholding me.  I&#39;m outside, and I watch this purely for amusement.</p>

<p>You, however, are still deeply invested in a system that is fucking everyone and everything around you, but not you.</p>

<p>SO... who&#39;s the cuck, cuck?</p>

It&#39;s there.  Have you taken even ten minutes to look at the emails?  People are not stepping down just because they feel like it.  The CFO is not apologizing for his remarks about trying to slander Sanders regarding his religious beliefs, for no reason.  The DNC is supposed to be an impartial organization you dolt!
