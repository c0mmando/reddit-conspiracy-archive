Normally everything is well, I see necessary evil, how it weighs with ethics, public policy, law, and economics; what objectives aim to a accomplish, who will be affected, and what is going to happen. </p>

<p>However, when I see the option for the people to move forward, I start using terms like &#39;wake up&#39;, &#39;media narrative&#39;, &#39;police state&#39;, and even think &#39;sheeple&#39;. These terms make people think &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;, and shut down the conversation. </p>

<p>That being said. I like Google is NSA, the NWO is a wonderful idea, and the Fed is only surviving because of nationalism. </p>

<p>I really want to open dialogue with people. There&#39;s no point in sealing myself in an echo chamber circlejerk. People are capable of critical thought. Is this a good place to develop strategies of approach?</p>

Everyone is here for different reasons so you might get a lot of views that differ from yours but you will find a lot of decent conversation if you ask the right questions.</p>

<p>Im try and avoid anything that is not heavily backed up and hold back my true thoughts a lot, almost impossible trying to guess what will wake people up but the more talking about it the better!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emotional responses are nowhere near as smart as responses that require thought. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re programed into a counter culture, with the same mechanism as the overarching culture, you&#39;re still a thoughtless sheep. </p>

<p>Just because you blindly follow the rhetoric of a debate which is considered against normative consensus, doesn&#39;t make you any less stupid than any other blind follower... </p>

<p>Rockafeller said &quot;competition is a pox&quot;, and look at what that did for the Fed. The proof is in the pudding. The concept of the NWO is already here whether you like it or not.  The fact that ignorant people can be divided and enslaved by imaginary money, and overwhelming structure; the very construct of nationalism is the reason that the bank cartel can exist at all!</p>

<p>If PEOPLE actually gave a damn about these third world countries, that the Fed has bought. Nothing would stop them from becoming first world countries! Your anger, your selfish passion, YOUR ignorance, and ineptitude has allowed the NWO to exist!</p>

<p>Actually resisting the concept of the physical manifestation of such an entity is what the Fed wants, because divided, nationalistic, fools like you are easier to strong-arm, than entire United Species. </p>
