       I see myself as a systems analyst. Normally everything is well, I see necessary evil, how it weighs with ethics, public policy, law, and economics; what objectives aim to a accomplish, who will be affected, and what is going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, when I see the option for the people to move forward, I start using terms like 'wake up', 'media narrative', 'police state', and even think 'sheeple'. These terms make people think 'conspiracy theorist', and shut down the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said. I like Google is NSA, the NWO is a wonderful idea, and the Fed is only surviving because of nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want to open dialogue with people. There's no point in sealing myself in an echo chamber circlejerk. People are capable of critical thought. Is this a good place to develop strategies of approach?

       I think we need to reclaim conspiracy theory, i always accept and explain when people say conspiracy theory that yes that is what im talking about. Everyone is here for different reasons so you might get a lot of views that differ from yours but you will find a lot of decent conversation if you ask the right questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im try and avoid anything that is not heavily backed up and hold back my true thoughts a lot, almost impossible trying to guess what will wake people up but the more talking about it the better!

       Yeah, I got no problem with "conspiracy theorist". The media are so widely known as propagandist whores, that when they use it to try to denigrate people now, it actually gives that person MORE credibility.

       Edit: TL&amp;DL: The Fed is established by Rockafeller, Morgan, etc. They are big money, anything that involves money they are involved in. It is a super efficient system of control that only exist because people don't understand it.

       Emotional responses are nowhere near as smart as responses that require thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're programed into a counter culture, with the same mechanism as the overarching culture, you're still a thoughtless sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you blindly follow the rhetoric of a debate which is considered against normative consensus, doesn't make you any less stupid than any other blind follower...
      </p>
      <p>
       Rockafeller said "competition is a pox", and look at what that did for the Fed. The proof is in the pudding. The concept of the NWO is already here whether you like it or not.  The fact that ignorant people can be divided and enslaved by imaginary money, and overwhelming structure; the very construct of nationalism is the reason that the bank cartel can exist at all!
      </p>
      <p>
       If PEOPLE actually gave a damn about these third world countries, that the Fed has bought. Nothing would stop them from becoming first world countries! Your anger, your selfish passion, YOUR ignorance, and ineptitude has allowed the NWO to exist!
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually resisting the concept of the physical manifestation of such an entity is what the Fed wants, because divided, nationalistic, fools like you are easier to strong-arm, than entire United Species.

       Yeah, he did. I really don't see any suggestions for a better system. I mean, the fear based control of the 20th century has been surpassed by the psychology of intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. Still these concepts are not totally detached from the fear/extrinsic motivation tactics, and less likely to incite violence.

       I'm a big fan of decentralized leadership, but it must be decentralized under the same policy, and mission. If that doesn't sound like the NWO concept, then you need to go a bit more in depth as to what a nation state means to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trolling, and not being purposefully obtuse. I tend to avoid any propaganda on binary splits. I just look at the numbers, and draw my own conclusions, then I field questions from that paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly value critical thinking. If you wish to engage me on an intellectual medium, I would much prefer that to your conflict theory stabs at my character.

       New world order is the 1% in control of the world under one doctrine with the working class pretty much slaves working to buy things to survive or to entertain them without the ability to save money. Forced medications and vaccines, permits to procreate if you fit the guidelines and no freedoms of choice or expression. Made to walk the line or be incarcerated or put to death. Ultimately in the end keeping the 1% rich as fuck!

       So, you admittedly don't care about the condition of the world, or the species; You actively oppose tearing down the great Wall of nationalism, and even prescribe to a have/have-nots split?

       I didn't say I didn't care! I just defined what NWO is and will be. Is there anything I can do about? No there isn't and there is nothing YOU can do about it either! There is a plan in place and it will happen. Will there be bloody battle on the streets of America and around the world? Yes! The truth is that this has all happened before and it will happen again! Civilization is much older than most people believe and millennia ago we were far more advanced than we are now!

       Indeed, too true. I tend to seek the most progressive version. The one that confirms mistakes were made, but revisions to rectify those mistakes have happened. A running historical narrative, if you will.

       This title is fantastic! It avoids emotional response, because it implies an actual evaluation of the entire system compared to an ideal.
