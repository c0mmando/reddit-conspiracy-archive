    <div class="md"><p>The only thing that matters here is that a presidential candidate had his AMA manually removed from the front page and r/all.</p>

<p>When I checked an hour ago it had over 8000 upvotes and appeared nowhere except the Trump subreddit.</p>

<p>This is censorship and political manipulation at the highest level. What if Obama&#39;s AMA was manually removed, or Sanders, or Clinton?</p>

<p>This should spark the biggest reddit exodus thus far. This should finally wake up all of those people who have been arguing up until now that reddit is not a fully compromised arm of the Western agenda. But sadly, I am sure I will get plenty of responses full of the same excuses that led us to this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another Digg V2 moment. This is pretty clearly where Reddit decided to commit suicide.  The censorship was fairly stealthy and clandestine in the old days so only a few people noticed it, but this is too big to conceal. </p>

<p>So the POTUS nominee of one of the two biggest political parties in the US does an AMA and Reddit buries it in a backwater where no one is likely to randomly come across the post. Does anyone still believe Reddit is likely to give a random post from a random user a fair share of exposure? Even people who despise Trump can see that his AMA was by far the biggest thing going on Reddit when it was active and yet nothing but garbage appeared on the front page. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but where the hell are we gonna go, huh?  Voat?  That&#39;s like trying to fit half an armada into a dingy.  Their servers will PHYSICALLY crack from the strain, and then we&#39;ll all end up back here.</p>

<p>One of the *Chans?  You have to be goddamn lucky to find anything in there because of how it&#39;s set up.  You can&#39;t search for relevant threads in those things!</p>

<p>No, unless someone can get the funding to give us something at least as stable as Reddit but with the anti-censorship stance of Voat, then we&#39;re fucking stuck here, man.  The establishment&#39;s got us by the digital balls.  Our only way OUT is a real-world revolution.  Non-violent, hopefully, as with Iceland, but a revolution nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of a P2P style Reddit (disclaimer; I lack the skills, fun to dream though).</p>

<p>Mods / sub reddit owner would be the original seeds (the layout, submitting posts), and as the sub grew, each online visitor (or anyone could be a seeder, just to help out the sub) would become a seeder of that sub. Reddit posts are mostly text and links so the file size shouldn&#39;t be too large. </p>

<p>I was also kinda worried that about using P2P protocol as its not really known for being anonymous. I also couldn&#39;t quite think of a way of splitting the sub&#39;s posts into smaller chunks nor how to go about archiving older posts (I feel it&#39;s important that posts do not drop off like they do on the Chan&#39;s).</p>

<p>I honestly think the next evolution of the internet (and freedom of information) will come in the form of decentralized servers, and peer sharing. You cannot trust any company to have the communities best interest at heart. The community must run and govern itself. Grown and evolve for the community, for the community.</p>

<p>Sorry for the high rambling, but its kinda something I hope a little personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, discussion boards are not like video streaming or something, the they dont take that much.</p>

<p>Also, who the fuck cares if there is a migration and your servers temporarily go down for a few days? Instead of selling out, wait a week, all the regular users will still be there and all of the SERIOUS users that migrated. fuck the rest.</p>

<p>He is literally worried about getting too popular that you end up selling out before the idea has even started to happen.</p>

Usually all the conspiracy theories I just laugh at them and dismiss but this was a truly opening for me. I am all against Trump and I think he will make a bad president, however I was looking forward to the AMA to see what he will write. And it was nowhere to be found I had to manually find it just because I knew that it was today. Honestly reddit just fell so hard in my eyes. Sad that this is happening, just shows how reddit has its own agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google as a &quot;private company&quot; is almost the textbook definition of a &quot;strawman&quot; argument (which frequently gets misused and propagated among pseudo-intellectuals around here who pretend they&#39;re informed).</p>

<p>Google basically is a CIA strawman, except it&#39;s not designed to take a fall like a patsy. It&#39;s a camouflaged front collecting (y)our data and metadata. Sort of like how social media appeals to the low. It is basically a lobster trap. Rather than going through the rigor of outright invasion, they&#39;ve created platforms that appeal to ignorant and/or unassuming people to come to them and post whatever data they will.</p>

<p>Between Apple, Microsoft (Windows 10), Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo! mail, and skype (and various other VoIP/call/tex services) they pretty much equip the masses to do their work for them. Windows 10 (basically the biggest piece of spyware ever engineered) and Google are the biggest offenders of the bunch, with Facebook following close behind.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the word &quot;golem?&quot; What about &quot;goyim?&quot; They&#39;re both Jewish words, and eerily similar, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<p>Look them up. Long before our time, and even before the time of the Templar, liberals/communists have been used as instruments to foment discord among populations. They&#39;ve been classically described as bearded, and usually crop up in form very similar to what we see today.</p>

<p>&quot;The golem, perhaps the best known of the Jewish legends, is an automaton, typically humanoid and typically male, created as the result of an intense, systematic, mystical meditation. The word golem means (or implies) something unformed and imperfect, or a body without a soul. The word appears only once in the Bible, in Psalms 139:15-16.&quot;</p>

<p>As an allegory, this describes the liberal quite well. A golem. An empty vassal, waiting to be animated by some purpose. The liberal very seldom makes any sense. This disconnect stems from their inseminated ideas. They are products of engineering, activated for a cause (BLM, Feminism, and all the usual liberal trappings) they don&#39;t even grasp. Puppets. Animated by something, but barely alive. Useful idiots to be discarded and recycled as needed.</p>

<p>No, that is not a person. That is an allegory of a golem. He has been engineered into a literal &quot;pinko.&quot; While &quot;Pinko&quot; is a fairly new term in the scale of human history, the concept behind it is virtually timeless.</p>

<p>What is the point in this little tangent? Social engineering. Which is why we have Clinton/Sanders supporters and why everyone gets by on a cult of personality. There is an objective measure to this. Is Trump better? Certainly. Is he good? Probably not. But the golems voting for the last 50 years have rendered us to a state of reality that Trump is the best thing we have.</p>

<p>One thing is for certain, we are just blip on the spinning record of human history, repeating it every full spin. This guy isn&#39;t new. The trends we see today aren&#39;t new. It&#39;s just the latest iteration. The only question is, what will be left when the golems/goyim have completed their purpose?</p>

<p>There is prosperity and growth and it wanes into illness and decay. We are waning. Sometimes nations and ways of life survive and rebound, but often they don&#39;t. Greater nations/empires than ours are subjects of history books. There&#39;s a tendency to place blame on war. But it&#39;s the illness.</p>

That reply is so thin I don&#39;t even know why he bothered.  He should&#39;ve just fessed up to gaming the votes.  It isn&#39;t like anyone believes that bull anyway.</p>

<p>I do also think it&#39;s a bit funny that almost all of <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> is up in arms about it and calling it childish and immature, while out of the other side of their mouth&#39;s hurling insults and name-calling.  That sub is generally one of the most immature and childish subs around.   You can&#39;t claim to take the high road when the top comments are things like, &#39;FUCK YOU SPEZ&#39;, &#39;YOUR WIFE WILL LEAVE YOU FOR HER BULL WHEN REDDIT&#39;S FAILURE IS COMPLETE.&#39;, &#39;SPEZ=CUCK&#39; and trying to get a nude painting of the other party&#39;s candidate to the front page.      </p>

<p>The whole thing is a total shitshow.  An entertaining one but still a shitshow.  I can see this being a hurtful thing for the site as a whole.  Reddit shouldn&#39;t really ever have been partisan in the first place.   </p>

He&#39;s a fake Ron Paul in an election scam that has been set up to trick the morons into thinking they &quot;won&quot; when he &quot;wins&quot; this &quot;democratic election&quot;. &quot;Oh gee we beat the corrupt billionaire mafia by electing a member&quot;, &quot;we beat clinton woohoo we elected her campaign donor and family friend instead go us we&#39;re such good americans&quot;. this is a dog and pony show.

<p>It&#39;s a scam, quit falling for it please.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s job is to co-opt and act as a pied-piper for the <em>would-be</em> opposition/anti-establishment bloc and to keep all the dumb people quiet for the next 8 years while the same agendas keep  on rolling ahead.  Stop falling for obvious scams you north korea-mericans.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to primary season in this sub. I was right in anticipating the surge of conspiracies, since it always happens, but I was very wrong to hope for any real discussion. A whoooole lot of people that should have been among the first to point things out are either absolutely silent or full of partisan excuses when it&#39;s their candidate under the microscope, to the extent that I half expect to see the magic words &quot;it&#39;s just a conspiracy theory&quot; thrown around.</p>

<p>Disappointing, but enlightening nonetheless.</p>

<p>The trick <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is leveraging that when they&#39;re unstickied, they the regain ability to appear on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. The giant boost they get from the initial sticky virtually guarantees they appear on subscribers&#39; front pages, which usually means a 1000+ point post, and many of those make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>
