    <div class="md"><p>24 upvotes for this, depressing.</p>

<p>Assuming you&#39;re not trolling: the wings on <em>any</em> plane can ice up at <em>any</em> time of year if you fly high enough. <a href="http://weather.unisys.com/upper_air/details.php">Temperatures</a> are regularly below zero at as low an altitude as 10,000 ft, well below the service ceiling of even a Cessna 152.</p>

<p>Icing conditions at altitude are more likely to occur in the winter, but are by no means unheard of in the summer. If this is your only reason to suspect foul play, that is ridiculous. Like dismissing a car accident as being impossible because it wasn&#39;t rush hour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s depressing is when someone is pedantic and literal-minded about a joke.</p>

<p>I guess if I said &quot;funny how a guy&#39;s brake lines just cut themselves when he crosses the DNC,&quot; I&#39;d get to hear from an auto mechanic about how it&#39;s almost impossible to kill someone that way because the ABS light would be blaring, and the brakes would feel all wrong, and then another one could say no Bernie drives a classic 1970 Mercedes 280SL convertible, which of course didn&#39;t have ABS, and then someone would say nuh-uh, Mercedes didn&#39;t make the 280SL in a convertible that year, and yet another expert could point out that it might have been an aftermarket conversion, and by then I would vote Trump 500 times just to make it stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching Obama&#39;s first inauguration, I admit a little tear came to my eye. I could remember a time when a black President would have been unthinkable. So that was moving.</p>

<p>But I remembered how Bill Clinton&#39;s stirring populist rhetoric had turned out to be a load of bullshit, and so I said out loud that I fully expected to be disappointed in Obama.</p>

<p>I expected to be disappointed, and then when it happened, it was so bad that I was STILL disappointed.</p>

<p>Hell, I thought the worst of W and Cheney, and even they disappointed me.</p>

<p>My point is, even when I&#39;m being as cynical as I can, they&#39;ve always got something up their sleeves that&#39;s even worse than I expected. It&#39;s amazing. You can&#39;t go into a new administration with zero expectations. That&#39;s way too high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Sincere people are stupid&quot;, someone wiser than me once said, a long time ago. I thought he was an idiot for saying it at the time. I realize now that he was right.</p>

<p>A good, honest, sincere person wants to see the goodness, honesty and sincerity in other people. It&#39;s simply projection of self, or judging others in your own image. So he/she will always subconsciously accept what others say. It takes a lot negative experience before a sincere person actually learns the evil ways of the world. And even then, it tends to be limited to specific individuals and circumstances.</p>

<p>A thief has the best security system.
A pervert makes for the most overprotective father.
A slut will call every woman a slut.</p>

<p>Point is, there&#39;s a lot of sincere people who keep getting fooled. It&#39;s bad because there is no progress being made. It&#39;s good because there&#39;s a lot of sincere people in the world.</p>

<p>Zero shock at Bernie. He&#39;s a career politician, what on earth do you expect to happen?

    <div class="md"><p>You know, honestly I think he&#39;d have done that any other ejection cycle, but this year, he was staring down the barrel of a trump presidency. I don&#39;t blame him for trying to do what he thinks is his only mode of action to stop a billionaire from taking the country further in the direction of income inequality. not to mention that if Trump is elected, and does half the shit he rambles incoherently about, the public will be forever wary to vote for a non-establishment candidate again. We need a non-establishment president but, you know, a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Sincere people are stupid&quot;, someone wiser than me once said, a long time ago. I thought he was an idiot for saying it at the time. I realize now that he was right.</p>

<p>A good, honest, sincere person wants to see the goodness, honesty and sincerity in other people. It&#39;s simply projection of self, or judging others in your own image. So he/she will always subconsciously accept what others say. It takes a lot negative experience before a sincere person actually learns the evil ways of the world. And even then, it tends to be limited to specific individuals and circumstances.</p>

<p>A thief has the best security system.
A pervert makes for the most overprotective father.
A slut will call every woman a slut.</p>

<p>Point is, there&#39;s a lot of sincere people who keep getting fooled. It&#39;s bad because there is no progress being made. It&#39;s good because there&#39;s a lot of sincere people in the world.</p>
