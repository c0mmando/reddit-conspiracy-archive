       What is the end game here? Even if everyone suddenly became aware that 9/11
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       an inside job or that the Clinton Foundation is a vast criminal enterprise, what would actually happen? I'm genuinely curious, because to me, it sounds like the answer is "not a god damn thing". If this is true, we live in a system where our government can literally do anything it wants to us and we have no way to stop it. This can't be right.....

       For me, as a European i have a feeling that as long as you guys have this conception of freedom, as in, you are able to live in a house, have a car or two, gas and electricity is cheap, you can own a big ass tv and a probably a gun, you're fine and in no way even thinking about revolting against your Government. And that is amazing to me seeing your country turn into a police state in the last 15 years. But it is like boiling a frog. You do it slowly and it will stay.

       Also american citizens go out in the streets for gun rights but not for economic rights. Thats when you know a population has been brainwashed to have fucked up priorities. Feed clothe and house yourself before worrying about your right to kill people ffs, it's not that complicated.

       He's right actually. I have friends who ditched the system once they saw the corruption and potential draft for Iraq, they went up north to Alaska, became homeless / drifters for a while free of financial burdens and social obligations, lived on the wild side and enjoyed it for a while, but once they came back to California they bought into the system. They don't care about corruption, don't want to do anything about it, don't even want to hear about it. Their comfort is more important than anything else, because being homeless sucks more than fighting corruption and/or sticking it to the man. I can't even mention corrupt Hillary during DNC night to one of them, he just tells me to stop being cynical or become a politician and change the system from within, but before that and before he went to Alaska he was the guy advocating the right for all Americans to produce their own 3D printed guns, he was the guy holding a Ron Paul sign next to the freeway offramp trying to change the world. Go figure. Yolo gets to everyone eventually. Government figured this out a long time ago.

       The only thing I would add on is that people who crave power (i.e. not just government) are just generally adept at these manipulations and, in my opinion, that adeptness stretches at least as far back to the switch over to an agricultural society. For this analogy I'm accepting the traditional narrative of pyramid construction (I suppose any major undertaking in early history works too) but that a pharaoh was able to woo so many people to build those things is the most impressive component. But the methodology is not all that surprising--the workers were well fed and their pointless task was conveyed as "honorable". Its essentially the same methodology now. Of course, the response to indignity surfaces...its just people in every 'civilized' society remain amazed at the rates of violent crime, substance abuse, mental health problems, etc...We often find alternate explanations for these phenomena, but I hold that they appear because its really just not that great to be building someone else's pyramid.

       Not all of us have our heads in the sand. Some of us have the right morals and would do anything in our power to help change the system. People from other countries are just as bad thinking that the majority of the US are just mindless gun owners happy to have a TV and a car. That's what all the media portrays and wants you to think. Yeah there are a lot of people like that. But there are also a lot of people not like that.

       Yeah, I know some decent people remain in the US, but when I see what the "counter culture" has become with Jones touting gun ownership as some sort of personal revolution, or the libertarians going for trump, I'm sorry to say that from the outside it looks really pathetic. Glad to hear some people don't buy into the whole cointel thing of pointing the attention away from economic issues.

       You need that gun to protect you from anyone trying to steal your money or what you obtain with that money.  You also need that gun to protect you from that government that comes to take from you.  And in this day and age with us all having a lesser amount of survival skills, its probably good for hunting our food if the country falls apart.   Having a gun is very important

       No, you're delusional. The only thing a gun is for is civil war. Did you get 9/11 truth with your gun? Did you stop the attack on syria with your gun? If the cops come and get you, you want to go out blazing in a firefight with the cops?

       Guns, and other things can be good for one thing (protection, hunting) and be completely irrelevant for something else (9/11, syria)  I thought you understood this.  For example:  Eggs might be a good source of protein when you eat them but they aren't going to be useful for helping your garden grow in your yard.
      </p>
      <p>
       A gun isn't good for protecting you from theifs/burglers/robbers? A home invasion?   I don't want to go out with a blazing fire fight with cops.  But one of the main reasons for the second amendment is so the citizens can protect themselves from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something were to happen like the power grid being knocked out for 6 months (not even that long maybe 3 weeks).  You are going to need that gun to protect your shelter, and whatever food you already have stocked up too.

       The funny thing about using guns to protect ourselves from the government though, is that our government has weaponry that makes our guns look pitiful by comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything the American people can buy legally, for the sake of protection, probably isn't going to be able to actually protect us from the government, should they come a knockin'.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] - I'm not saying we should take guns away from the American people. Just pointing out that the government could probably wipe the floor with our guns.

       Yeah I know.  They have tanks, they have body armor.  They have airstrike capabilities.  They have a lot of that.    But if there is ever a situation that ever lead the citizens down that path, maybe with enough push back the government would fall back and listen to the people before things got to an irreversible damage point.   But if there citizens have no guns or any means to protect themselves, then they will never be able to push back.

       Everything you argue is a different argument.  Both what I said can be true while at the same time what you are saying is true...because you are talking about things entirely different...like car accidents and the truth about 9/11.   Clown

       I didn't say all of your money.  I meant like your typical robbery.  It was also included under the scope of valuables and such like jewelry and other belongings.   I think that was pretty obvious.    You're are annoying in a way similar to a grammar nazi.  I am sure this is why nobody likes you, and you are a loser.

       No we haven't. that is grossly exaggerated by mainstream media. Mainly US media. I'd rather deal with the very very very slight change of being shot by an ISIS supporter (ISIS, who exist mainly because of your Government's actions) than having to live in fear of being shot by a trigger happy cop over nothing. Just tell me. what do you FEEL when you see cops in the street? You feel save? or are you somehow alerted/triggered to check if you are a law abiding citizen? Yes? how is that feeling ultimately compatible with living in a free country?

       I feel safe. Cops that I've run into have all been awesome people. For every one cop who is a trigger happy idiot, there are like 250 that are just doing a good job quietly.

       Except with a lot more guns. The Turkish people are far more restricted in their firearms ownership. So maybe more blood in the streets. Not sure how the military will react to rounding up people, either. We'll see.

       You could take this even further. Have an open military takeover of the country. If things were run more efficiently, more jobs, free university and health care etc. I bet most people would actually support such a dictatorship.

       Didn't just pull this out of my ass either. Go take a look at Singapore as one example. If the government is benevolent and there's a high enough standard of living/material comforts... most people don't really give a fuck about what style of gov't they have.

       Very true. Frequently, we're happy to outsource our outrage. Its kind of like the thinking is "Well, if its really bad someone else will take care of it". Its passive but I think it also plays into a daddy/mommy complex.

       It's the media. They literally create reality day by day. For most of the US and I would guess the western world, as long as the media defines the general populous's reality, the dumb, uneducated slaves will chase Pokémon and watch reality TV until they end up in a FEMA camp or whatever. Hell, the TV will probably convince them to go willingly.

       See, this is one side of the coin you are presenting and you are doing it in a social justice warrior victim like manner. On the other side of the coin, life is beautiful. I have a home to live in and a car to drive wherever i want. I can earn as much money as I want to as long as I have drive and determination. I can vacation all over the globe if I want to plan and save. I can send my kids to private schools if I don't want them to get a government slanted education. I can choose to vaccinate or not vaccinate. Heck in some states, I can even smoke weed if I want. We are free to roam, free to congregate, free to dream, free to love, free to tune in to whatever we want, free to learn, free to chose how to medicate ourselves, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of fact, i don't really think the government has any control over my life or my loved ones at all. I don't even have to pay taxes because usually my income and deductions don't warrant a single penny going to the IRS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, get a grip if you think your life is so terrible due to the government. See it for what it is. It's simply a dog and pony show designed to keep most of the masses occupied. For those of us lucky enough to have figured that out, live your life outside of the matrix as much as possible and enjoy the heck out of being free to do so.

       A derail for what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time you let your racism slip through you're derailing yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how many gifs of Jennifer Lawrence you post, or how many times you say you're drunk, you will always look shitty for the racism.

       Edit: also, I exist to troll digital cartel. Not sure why you brought that up

       The funny thing about using guns to protect ourselves from the government though, is that our government has weaponry that makes our guns look pitiful by comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything the American people can buy legally, for the sake of protection, probably isn't going to be able to actually protect us from the government, should they come a knockin'.
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] - I'm not saying we should take guns away from the American people. Just pointing out that the government could probably wipe the floor with our guns.
