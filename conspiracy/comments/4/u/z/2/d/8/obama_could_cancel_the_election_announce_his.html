Even if everyone suddenly became aware that 9/11 <em>was</em> an inside job or that the Clinton Foundation is a vast criminal enterprise, what would actually happen? I&#39;m genuinely curious, because to me, it sounds like the answer is &quot;not a god damn thing&quot;. If this is true, we live in a system where our government can literally do anything it wants to us and we have no way to stop it. This can&#39;t be right.....</p>

And that is amazing to me seeing your country turn into a police state in the last 15 years. But it is like boiling a frog. You do it slowly and it will stay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right actually. I have friends who ditched the system once they saw the corruption and potential draft for Iraq, they went up north to Alaska, became homeless / drifters for a while free of financial burdens and social obligations, lived on the wild side and enjoyed it for a while, but once they came back to California they bought into the system. They don&#39;t care about corruption, don&#39;t want to do anything about it, don&#39;t even want to hear about it. Their comfort is more important than anything else, because being homeless sucks more than fighting corruption and/or sticking it to the man. I can&#39;t even mention corrupt Hillary during DNC night to one of them, he just tells me to stop being cynical or become a politician and change the system from within, but before that and before he went to Alaska he was the guy advocating the right for all Americans to produce their own 3D printed guns, he was the guy holding a Ron Paul sign next to the freeway offramp trying to change the world. Go figure. Yolo gets to everyone eventually. Government figured this out a long time ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I would add on is that people who crave power (i.e. not just government) are just generally adept at these manipulations and, in my opinion, that adeptness stretches at least as far back to the switch over to an agricultural society. For this analogy I&#39;m accepting the traditional narrative of pyramid construction (I suppose any major undertaking in early history works too) but that a pharaoh was able to woo so many people to build those things is the most impressive component. But the methodology is not all that surprising--the workers were well fed and their pointless task was conveyed as &quot;honorable&quot;. Its essentially the same methodology now. Of course, the response to indignity surfaces...its just people in every &#39;civilized&#39; society remain amazed at the rates of violent crime, substance abuse, mental health problems, etc...We often find alternate explanations for these phenomena, but I hold that they appear because its really just not that great to be building someone else&#39;s pyramid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns, and other things can be good for one thing (protection, hunting) and be completely irrelevant for something else (9/11, syria)  I thought you understood this.  For example:  Eggs might be a good source of protein when you eat them but they aren&#39;t going to be useful for helping your garden grow in your yard.</p>

<p>A gun isn&#39;t good for protecting you from theifs/burglers/robbers? A home invasion?   I don&#39;t want to go out with a blazing fire fight with cops.  But one of the main reasons for the second amendment is so the citizens can protect themselves from the government.  </p>

<p>If something were to happen like the power grid being knocked out for 6 months (not even that long maybe 3 weeks).  You are going to need that gun to protect your shelter, and whatever food you already have stocked up too.</p>

<p>Anything the American people can buy legally, for the sake of protection, probably isn&#39;t going to be able to actually protect us from the government, should they come a knockin&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know.  They have tanks, they have body armor.  They have airstrike capabilities.  They have a lot of that.    But if there is ever a situation that ever lead the citizens down that path, maybe with enough push back the government would fall back and listen to the people before things got to an irreversible damage point.   But if there citizens have no guns or any means to protect themselves, then they will never be able to push back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is one side of the coin you are presenting and you are doing it in a social justice warrior victim like manner. On the other side of the coin, life is beautiful. I have a home to live in and a car to drive wherever i want. I can earn as much money as I want to as long as I have drive and determination. I can vacation all over the globe if I want to plan and save. I can send my kids to private schools if I don&#39;t want them to get a government slanted education. I can choose to vaccinate or not vaccinate. Heck in some states, I can even smoke weed if I want. We are free to roam, free to congregate, free to dream, free to love, free to tune in to whatever we want, free to learn, free to chose how to medicate ourselves, etc. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, i don&#39;t really think the government has any control over my life or my loved ones at all. I don&#39;t even have to pay taxes because usually my income and deductions don&#39;t warrant a single penny going to the IRS. </p>

<p>Honestly, get a grip if you think your life is so terrible due to the government. See it for what it is. It&#39;s simply a dog and pony show designed to keep most of the masses occupied. For those of us lucky enough to have figured that out, live your life outside of the matrix as much as possible and enjoy the heck out of being free to do so. </p>
