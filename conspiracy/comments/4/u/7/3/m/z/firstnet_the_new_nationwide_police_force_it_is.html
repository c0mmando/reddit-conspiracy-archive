        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The nationalized police force that is taking over first responder network: Fire. Police. Homeland Security. NATO Strategic Command FirstNet FL: &quot;The ability to share real-time images and video of the scene as well as the locations of responders and locally relevant information improves communication and outcomes. FirstNet will carry high-speed data, location information, images, and eventually streaming video that can mean the difference between life and death.&quot;(from FirstNet&#39;s state of FL) This is not the future, but now. Houston&#39;s got it, Florida, Ohio, many more- this isn&#39;t in the future but is happening right now.  States who don&#39;t want in this Panopticon have to Opt Out with an expensive and confusing set of guidelines, guidelines set by:FirstNet. It is not just the communications network, but the entire crime fighting and health network,Fusion Center actually <a href="http://www.channelingreality.com/Digital_Treason/homescam_unveiled.htm">http://www.channelingreality.com/Digital_Treason/homescam_unveiled.htm</a>
Here is a fluff piece on one of their &quot;FirstNet Experience&quot; video &quot;The OhioFirst.Net program has developed a unique way for people to experience the potential of the FirstNet network – a video game that allows users to virtually see the increased situational awareness&quot; <a href="http://www.emsworld.com/news/12207120/the-firstnet-experience-ohio-video-game-virtually-demonstrates-networks-potential">http://www.emsworld.com/news/12207120/the-firstnet-experience-ohio-video-game-virtually-demonstrates-networks-potential</a></p>

<p>The beauty of this &quot;network&quot;? It&#39;s a corporation. A corporation that makes profits, just like OmniCorp, except it is nationwide not just in Detroit.&quot;he FirstNet network will be a single, nationwide, interoperable LTE network for public safety communications. Built through an innovative <em>public-private partnership</em>, it will give first responders true priority in emergency situations to send voice or text messages, images, video and location information in <strong>real-time.</strong> It will enable information <em>sharing across disciplines and jurisdictions;</em> dramatically increase situational awareness; and support faster, more effective responses to emergencies or disasters&quot; FirstNet will remove authority from the local level and place it at FirstNet&#39;s HQ in D.C. 
&quot;Just what is FirstNet?&quot; at Global Expo (link to video) <a href="http://www.emsworld.com/video/10958086/what-is-firstnet-an-overview-of-the-nationwide-public-safety-broadband-project">http://www.emsworld.com/video/10958086/what-is-firstnet-an-overview-of-the-nationwide-public-safety-broadband-project</a> This is <em>not</em> just the radios and telecom, FirstNet takes over it all: vehicles, authority, and they even cross-jurisdiciton and cross-&quot;discipline&quot; There is so much more to say about this quite astonishing corporation. They are also dishonest and unethical: <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/walden-responds-inspector-general-report-firstnet">https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/walden-responds-inspector-general-report-firstnet</a> awash in all sorts of conflicts of interest, lying about financials, procrastinating when pressed for details by officials. They are secretive, very heavy on shilling and quite odd if you ask me. 
This thing is huge, and no one&#39;s even heard of it outside first responders or police radio comm folks or govt contractors. Your tax dollars pay into this and it&#39;s a corporation for profits- just like Fascism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more: FirstNet...the potential for about 5 million users of the network.  However, these user estimates are predicated upon almost every potential responder—police, fire, emergency medical, public works, utilities, transportation and so forth—using FirstNet’s network. Find every possible first responder with both handheld and vehicle-mounted devices—law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical and emergency management. This would include private ambulance and firefighting services (e.g., oil refineries and major manufacturers like Boeing), and private police and security, such as those protecting the Navy Yard in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>·         Find and engage every possible federal responder—FBI, Secret Service, Forest Service, Park Service, Coast Guard, Border Protection and more.</p>

<p>·         Offer special programs for volunteer agencies and users such as volunteer firefighters, search-and-rescue and others who will need lower-cost devices and rate plans.</p>

<p>·         Identify all electric, gas and water utility crews and field users, both public and private.  Such utilities are crucial to public health and safety, both to keep the energy and water flowing daily but especially after even small disasters.</p>

<p>·         Find all transportation, transit and related users, e.g., trains, buses and light rail.   Such responders are critical, whether they manage evacuations, respond to traffic crashes or protect the safety of riders on busses and trains.</p>

<p>·         Engage other responders and government field forces, including animal control, building inspectors, parks and recreation, and others.</p>

<p>·         Focus on the smartgrid.   Increasingly electric, water and gas utilities will automate their meters and distribution systems with wireless devices, not just to manage and bill usage, but also to control the network, rapidly detect outages, and remotely turn services off and on at individual premises.   There are probably 144 million or more electric meters alone—perhaps more than 200 million when gas and water are included—which, at a dollar a month or so, represent a revenue source of $2 billion or more a year with relatively low capacity requirements.</p>

<p>·         Similarly, focus on intelligent transportation systems.   The transportation grid also is becoming “metered,” with sensors and control devices in traffic signals, parking spaces, traffic cameras and other devices.  Federal transportation officials are advocating “connected vehicles,” where wireless devices in vehicles will communicate with other vehicles and the transportation grid to prevent crashes and improve traffic flow.</p>

<p>·         Embrace the “Internet of government things.” Beyond what’s listed above, there are and will be many devices owned and operated by governments which can be wirelessly enabled to improve public safety, the primary goal of FirstNet.  These include video-surveillance cameras, automatic vehicle location in all vehicles, body-worn video, and even “Google glass” devices to be worn by responders.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>well it cannot be benign by definition. When is Fascism &quot;benign&quot;? and most people do not know the definition of it anyway- they think it just means &quot;aggressive police&quot;. Also, how would you like the museum security guard and the mailman keeping tabs on you? you can&#39;t hide, because your car and your smartphone is connected. Everything that IS connected is connected to this. You have to be off the electrical grid, phoneless, car-less- I do believe the Cash for Clunkers was to rid US of the old non-connected cars. I have a rather suspiciously bizarre story about a car I had, that the police I assumed had a grudge against, a car that was without a computer, a vintage car but ran like a clock. I was forever getting pulled over, they did all they could to impound it, and keep it. It&#39;s a long and personal story so I will leave it out. But it made me think, there&#39;s something more to this than what they are letting on. They do not want non-connected cars on the road. That is why they make it so difficult for folks and their antiques, you can only drive it 20 mi. to and from a parade or some other nonsense. EDIT- because I forgot one other anecdote- connected phones. So, get this: I have, well- HAD- a &quot;candy bar&quot; mobile, the kind that isn&#39;t a smart phone. I had it put away in a drawer for emergencies. It worked still- very well, was like new actually. I figured I&#39;ll keep it for emergencies, as I do not carry a smartphone that is connected to a network, nor do I use a mobile unless special circumstances. This phone, which I had on prepaid and is not a SIM enabled phone (under VirginMobile fyi) I had put away, not in use and not with any &quot;minutes&quot; on the plan for months. 8 months of it being in a drawer, all of a sudden Virgin Mobile emails me with a Free 30 Days of Service! I know nothing is &quot;free&quot;, but I bit, and turned on the phone. JUST after `13 days of it being on the free Yay! minutes plan, it &quot;updated&quot; and bricked. I can no longer charge the phone. I didn&#39;t even get my free whole month. Mind you the phone nothing at all is wrong with it mechanically. It is a SOFTWARE issue - I know it is, being an ex-Nokia tech, and VM told me it was, and offered me a low price on a new.. SmartPhone! Oh so sorry, we no longer offer the &quot;old obsolete phones&quot; anymore, they claim. Just a coincidence I am sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed, indeed. Europeans, Eastern Europeans, they all are hip to this sort of thing, and can not be bamboozled, as it is still fresh in their hearts. We as a nation are oblivious and carefully trained and &quot;managed&quot; , also we only are provided specific content in the news. That is why, when you turn on the news or read it online, why all news outlets carrying the SAME stories. It is less and less localized, except for a few minor events such as local robberies, fires, etc. If you notice, there are no real important news, only &quot;events&quot; that could happen at any time in history- but nothing that specifically identifies with something that is happening NOW, or affecting us directly in a meaningful way. The &quot;public private partnerships&quot; ak a&quot;strategic partnerships&quot; (and keep an eye out for their next euphemism, they keep changing the names and words to evade capture) are not highlighted or mentioned, even going so far as to camouflage the stories so we do not see what is going on. This is deliberate and covert. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one in particular frightened me: &quot; Focus on the smartgrid.   Increasingly electric, water and gas utilities will automate their meters and distribution systems with wireless devices, not just to manage and bill usage, but also to control the network, rapidly detect outages, and <strong>remotely turn services off and on at individual</strong> premises&quot; What are they going to do with the Mennonites?? Demand they get hooked up to the grid, like they do with people in the city who don&#39;t have their utilities turned on (they red tag their domicile and not allow them back in- saying it&#39;s against the health code)? what will happen with them? what about people living out in the country- notice all the people they&#39;re using different methods to remove them from rural locations, all the fires then their house burns down, and the county or state will not let them rebuild- they either make it too expensive, or take the land through eminent domain. See, it&#39;s not just one method they use- it is various methods, that way a person cannot point their finger at it and say &quot;this is the method they are using&quot; because there is not just one thing. Same with FirstNet, if people are not aware of this &quot;enemy&quot; they do not know who to fight. This is what Sun Tsu meant when he said &quot;know thine enemy&quot;- he meant that if you do not know who the enemy is, you are fighting blind.

    <div class="md"><p>Bankers? I&#39;m not even sure it is bankers. It is the United Nations. Anyone can go to their website and read what they&#39;ve planned. This things&#39; been planned for a very long time. As I said earlier on a similar thread, I posted the same things here- not in a post but in the comments- during 9-11 remember how the media kept going on and on about the police, fire, and FBI etc getting tangled up in all the communications, and how one group could not communicate with another, and so on and so forth- which, by the way, is utter nonsense, because dispatches worked exactly as they were supposed to, and people got to talk to whomever they were supposed to. The &quot;problem&quot; was not a problem truly, and not one that needed &quot;solving&quot;, it was just a lot of radio calls, a lot- coming in all the time, and of course with all the panic and things sure stuff got mixed up. But for God sakes, it was a big deal- there is only so much you could have done- this &quot;FirstNet&quot; is NOT going to solve all those issues. That is what they are promoting- it&#39;s going to solve all the problems yay. No it won&#39;t. Oh! and on FirstNetOhio&#39;s pdf, that FirstNet put out themselves- listen to this &quot;&quot;FirstNet&#39;s &quot;startup&quot; funding of $6 billion is <em>a drop in the bucket</em>  (their words!) they say they will need up to 41 $ <strong>billion</strong> to build out the nation, and <em>still</em> need &quot;partners&quot; with cell carriers to help pitch in with expenses. 41... <em>billion</em>. And remember Obamacare and how much they claimed it would cost? and it went way way over that? well you know this one will too. Where&#39;s all this money going to come from?? Nobody has a job! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, spread it around. I posted a reply to the last comment, but I want to post it again so you&#39;ll see it too- just who all is involved with this nationwide thing- because it is NOT just police radios- the SmartGRid is part of it too- that is the worst, oh the worst part- but here is who else
        Find every possible first responder with both handheld and vehicle-mounted devices—law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical and emergency management. This would include private ambulance and firefighting services (e.g., oil refineries and major manufacturers like Boeing), and private police and security, such as those protecting the Navy Yard in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>·         Find and engage every possible federal responder—FBI, Secret Service, Forest Service, Park Service, Coast Guard, Border Protection and more.</p>

<p>·         Offer special programs for volunteer agencies and users such as volunteer firefighters, search-and-rescue and others who will need lower-cost devices and rate plans.</p>

<p>·         Identify all electric, gas and water utility crews and field users, both public and private.  Such utilities are crucial to public health and safety, both to keep the energy and water flowing daily but especially after even small disasters.</p>

<p>·         Find all transportation, transit and related users, e.g., trains, buses and light rail.   Such responders are critical, whether they manage evacuations, respond to traffic crashes or protect the safety of riders on busses and trains.</p>

<p>·         Engage other responders and government field forces, including animal control, building inspectors, parks and recreation, and others.</p>

<p>·         Focus on the smartgrid.   Increasingly electric, water and gas utilities will automate their meters and distribution systems with wireless devices, not just to manage and bill usage, but also to control the network, rapidly detect outages, and remotely turn services off and on at individual premises.   There are probably 144 million or more electric meters alone—perhaps more than 200 million when gas and water are included—which, at a dollar a month or so, represent a revenue source of $2 billion or more a year with relatively low capacity requirements.</p>

<p>·         Similarly, focus on intelligent transportation systems.   The transportation grid also is becoming “metered,” with sensors and control devices in traffic signals, parking spaces, traffic cameras and other devices.  Federal transportation officials are advocating “connected vehicles,” where wireless devices in vehicles will communicate with other vehicles and the transportation grid to prevent crashes and improve traffic flow.</p>

<p>·         Embrace the “Internet of government things.” Beyond what’s listed above, there are and will be many devices owned and operated by governments which can be wirelessly enabled to improve public safety, the primary goal of FirstNet.  These include video-surveillance cameras, automatic vehicle location in all vehicles, body-worn video, and even “Google glass” devices to be worn by responders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, and believe me, I almost did not post here. I rarely come to Reddit. I figured, sighs- maybe just MAYBE they will see it. Ive found in history that Reddit is often not the best place for intelligent arguments, sadly. Sometimes a cute Pug or kitten video or &quot;joke&quot; is at the top of the lists, and no one sees the things that affect them directly. </p>
