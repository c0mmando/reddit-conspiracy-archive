        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The pop stars covering their one eye.  Think they know what that&#39;s about?  When asked they either laugh and act like it&#39;s a little club or they change the subject.  Probably because they are actors and do what they are told.  Many hollywood non-actors have spilled the beans that these people have had to perform some sex act to get ahead and I believe this.  Several black entertainers and some in the rap music industry have said that rap music is controlled by a gay mafia and that rappers must do something unsavory to become famous.  I believe this also.  People refer to these cadres as &#39;the illuminati&#39; collectively.  I just want to park that there and not go into that more.  Let&#39;s say that&#39;s what shit youtube says about &#39;illuminati&#39;.</p>

<p>The illuminati has also been associated with the eye of providence on our dollar bill; inasmuch for the reason the bavarian illuminati was founded in 1776 the same year in which America was founded, as that people understand how power works, that the founding fathers were deeists (gnostics/freemasons/alchemists), and that the people who made the dollar baked in a lot of occult symbolism, making our dollars a kind of magical sigil as much as it is a contract.  Let&#39;s park that idea there also.</p>

<p>The covering of one eye by pop stars then is a reference to the eye of providence, which some purport to be the eye of horus, but it could just as easily be the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4s4dk5/eye_of_providence_is_not_eye_of_horus_but_the_eye/">eye of RA</a> or ..the third <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4qdwq4/the_eye_of_providence_is_actually_an_anus/">eye of the anus</a>, actually.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter.  Because the illuminati was Bavarian, which means from Germany, which means Rosicrucian as much as it means Norse.  Why would Germans want to climb hundreds of miles of swiss alps and italian appenine mountains to import the Roman/Greek gods when theirs are perfectly suitable substitutes for kemetic borrowgods?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to note that ODIN was the father god in Norse mythology, making him Zeus, making him RA.  </p>

<p><strong>ODIN had one eye</strong> because he sacrificed an eye in the well of wisdom to receive it&#39;s depth and mystery.</p>

<p>There is a saying, &quot;in the land of the blind, the <em>one-eyed man</em> is king&quot;.  According to wikitionary, this typically is used as an allegory to say, something like</p>

<ul>
<li>Among others with a disadvantage or disability, the one with the mildest disadvantage or disability is regarded as the greatest.</li>
<li>Even someone without much talent or ability is considered special by those with no talent or ability at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or </p>

<ul>
<li>A person with a unique technology has an extreme advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in the norse mythology context it takes on a completely different meaning.  The blind are people who have no ability to see the truth, the one-eyed man then deserves to be king because he&#39;s received wisdom and can see the truth.  It&#39;s almost a very fascist statement that the </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;cyclops deserves to rule&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>So now you understand the cryptometapolitics of ideology behind the freemasons.  They think that the one-eyed man, ODIN has a right to rule.   Also, freemasons are nazis, ideologically.  I forgot that part.</p>

<hr/>

<p>007 predictive doubtmaking:  odin was a god, not a man.  your argument is invalid and you are invalid and should die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Master mason here - the one eye, eye of providence, all seeing eye - is a reference to the eye of ra - not Odin - who gave up one eye so he could drink from the tree of knowledge.</p>

<p>You should read the children of Odin - the book of northern myths to help you understand the significance of that.</p>

<p>As for freemasons - the all seeing eye reminds us that nothing we do is hidden, so to always walk uprightly regardless of whether you are being watched or not - because there is always someone who knows everything you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because to be completely honest, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does get quite a lot of things right and are marginalized by the general public for it, because frankly, the general public is just not ready to accept how controlled they really are. </p>

<p>As you see unfolding before your very eyes, the people screaming that the DNC rigged the election against Bernie Sanders proved <strong>true</strong> though now, you&#39;ll find the media doing their best to marginalize the issue, claiming it was a rogue agent that has since stepped down and therefore, it was isolated and handled.  The media will soon fade from covering it - Trump will be ignored when he references it, they&#39;ll interview &quot;one or two&quot; bernie supporters who will suggest that it isn&#39;t going to influence them voting for Hillary, and her supporters will take to media and airwaves to try to redirect the narrative. </p>

<p>So, I like to get tips from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and then do some more investigation... hint - you want some insight into how Hillary is going to handle foreign policy... search her emails for &quot;Bohemian Grove.&quot; </p>

<p>Why I joined the freemasons - simple... knowledge.  The slogan, &quot;taking good man and making them better&quot; is true - for the right person, once their mind becomes opened, their power becomes limitless and freemasonry can be one of the many paths to that... so do I rely solely on freemasonry - not at all... there are many illuminated people outside the fraternity.  But it certainly helps having a few that meet with you weekly.</p>

<p>The problem is you have two enemies within the organization that are trying their damn-dest to tear it apart... </p>

<ol>
<li><p>apathy - those masons who treat the fraternity as a gentlemen&#39;s club and take no effort whatsoever to deeply study to the signs, symbols, or meaning of our ritual - viewing the ritual as just something to get out of the way so they can collect some dues and have another brother to drink with.</p></li>
<li><p>dark masons - If you truly study freemasonry - and truly come to know and understand the hidden secrets handed down therein, your mind becomes open and your power becomes limitless - a true &quot;illuminated&quot; freemason is something akin to a buddha. They are rare, they are powerful and can wield great influence. SOME - some are corrupted and desire to keep people in the dark so they can be controlled, wishing to keep the secrets to &quot;illumination&quot; to themselves.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The few true freemasons left that have not been corrupted, who have not become apathetic, and who hope to bring more people to light, try hard to counter the influence of dark masons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you can investigate the mysterious on your own, until you have walked through them, you&#39;ll never understand it.  When I say there are many paths to &quot;illumination,&quot; &quot;enlightenment,&quot; or &quot;salvation,&quot; - you have to actually walk the path to obtain it.  You cannot simply study it on your own and come to understand one of the ways.  That is the significance and importance in recognizing a god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you were religious before joining freemasonry, but were you ready to join an order that is full of arguably satanic rituals to potentially get knowledge which might be very biased and misinterpreted to suit the order&#39;s skewed religious beliefs? I commend your search for knowledge, but I don&#39;t see how joining freemasonry can achieve that. If anything I see it as a step in the opposite direction. There might well be no satanic rituals, but I don&#39;t see how a person is willing to risk it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Therein lies the point to the coffee table book.  You speak as if you have authority on the subject matter - as if you know for a fact our practices are satanic, claiming freemason has religious beliefs... </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know - the best you have is potentially secondhand knowledge if not tertiary knowledge, if not complete bullshit made up by other people.</p>

<p>First, freemasonry is not a religion, we do not hold any religious beliefs... that being said, no man can be made a mason until after acknowledging a belief in deity. </p>

<p>Second, most of our rituals trace back to traditions found among the ancient Hebrew people, brought to them from Egypt from Moses.  There is nothing &quot;satanic&quot; about them.  Worse, things like the pentagram were actually ancient <strong>christian</strong> symbols.  </p>

<p>So the truth of the matter is this: Freemasonry is a way to enlightenment through deep reflection of self and understanding of our nature in the universe, the meaning of life, and observance of certain principles and natural laws that govern our path back to the creator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you can investigate the mysterious on your own, until you have walked through them, you&#39;ll never understand it.  When I say there are many paths to &quot;illumination,&quot; &quot;enlightenment,&quot; or &quot;salvation,&quot; - you have to actually walk the path to obtain it.  You cannot simply study it on your own and come to understand one of the ways.  That is the significance and importance in recognizing a god.</p>
