       I'm honestly scared this thread is going to be censored and removed, for not being part of the anti-Hillary circle-jerk that is rampant. I also believe I'll just be downvoted or accused of using a website that people on this sub won't like
       <em>
        (I'm probably going to already be accused of simply being another Hillary shill)
       </em>
       , so I'll try to spread it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are parading Wikileaks stating that they release what is behind the scenes. And they do, don't get me wrong. I had enjoyed their fully transparant nature in the past and understand that the site was even blocked in Russia for a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But isn't it a tad sketchy that this email dump,
       <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/">
        which is more than likely confirmed to have been stolen by Russian hackers
       </a>
       , just suddenly ends up on Wikileaks to divulge
       <em>
        systematically
       </em>
       during the DNC? Aside from that is the relation Assange himself also has in Russia:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/08/opinion/how-julian-assange-is-destroying-wikileaks.html">
         Wikileaks doesn't release anything regarding Russian Intelligence, going so far as to use rhetoric to confront the US in a tweet about the Paris attacks
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/17/world-tomorrow-julian-assange-wikileaks">
         Assange himself had his own show on Russia Today (Now RT)
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/07/putin-dismisses-panama-papers-as-an-attempt-to-destabilise-russia">
         Putin specifically references WikiLeaks to dismiss the Panama Papers as a US-led effort to destabilize Russia
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-slams-west-wikileaks-arrest/story?id=12364345">
         Putin also spoke up about Assange's arrest in London calling the West's democracy hypocritical.
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then, during the RNC, isn't it a little offputting that
       <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing">
        Trump's new campaign manager was a communications advisor for Viktor Yanukovych
       </a>
       (Read no. 4, He was ousted from Ukraine in 2014 leading to the proxy war in Ukraine), and, most importantly:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Throughout the nomination,
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html">
         Trump's campaign had been dismissive of supporting Ukraine
        </a>
        , in opposite to what the GOP leadership believes in (Whereas a Reagan-style conservative would stand up to Russian aggression as a typical thought-process, keep in mind President Obama also decided not to send lethal support to Ukraine)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In response to criticism about the DNC Leak,
       <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/07/wikileaks-accused-of-anti-semitism-for-using-echoes-in-tweet-insulting-critics/">
        WikiLeaks had even tweeted an anti-semitic (((echoes))) remark implying that the main critics are Jews before the tweet was pulled.
       </a>
       (Found an image rather than simply a random website, but
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/01/julian-assange-jewish-conspiracy-comments">
        it isn't the first time this happened.
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end, this whole discussion had already been talked about on CNN so I suspect some conspiracy-theorists will just see this as 'eating the DNC pill'. But I'm honestly flabbergasted that not one post on this sub was on this, if not about WikiLeaks than the possibility that Russian hackers have influenced our American electorial process.

       As I've mentioned in my first paragraph, I understand if you, or anyone else for that matter, consider me some sort of paid man in this scenario. All I can give to counter that claim is simply my word that I am not. Aside from that, all I can do is play the 'It's a
       <em>
        possibility
       </em>
       ' game. It's the definition of a conspiracy theory.

       I'm a man who watched through the Republican National Convention, saw its good and downsides, and am doing the same thing for the DNC. As of now, I am glad that DWS has chosen to resign and upset that she was immediately hired by the Clinton campaign. I am just as upset of some of the emailers, who would bash candidates such as O'Malley and Sanders in them, were also given quick pardon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said. The main reason why I posted wasn't to provide a distraction, but rather because this sub has amassed a large quantity of Anti-DNC posts ever since Sanders conceded. That when a major news site discusses the
       <strong>
        <em>
         possibility
        </em>
       </strong>
       that an outside influence can be playing politics with our country.

       So I just looked up Trump's new campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and he didn't just advise Yanukovych and Trump. He also advised Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bob Dole. So this part of your argument is weak, unless these guys were somehow secretly working for Russia's interest which is a little hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I agree that Russia is probably influencing the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, saying the focus is on Trump in particular is misguided. There are segments of RT that are pro Sanders and anti-Trump also. It seems like they don't like any of the candidates but would prefer Trump, or Sanders over Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth RT ran a segment about how China dislikes Trump and Hillary but also prefers Trump over Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like Trump just wants to do trade with Russia and China and doesn't care about military pressure. What's so bad about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have trouble understanding what the current administration is trying to do by controlling Ukraine and surrounding Russia with missiles. It's not like Russia is an inherently evil country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine what would happen if we did just cooperate with each other and put the military posturing behind us.

       Thanks for the insight. I have figured that it may be more appealing to focus on one matter over the other. My main gripe is that the sub as a whole barely touched on the aspect of a distant enemy being able to influence who will be our next leader of the United States and instead will continue to add kindling to the fire it has started.

       I think maybe this just adds to the believes and suspicions already in place. Bernie, as loud as his followers are, does not stand a chance. He is an agent of disruption, not candidacy.

       Part of the issue is that when people complain that the political campaigns of Trump, Clinton and others are attempting to manipulate social media by having paid workers plant stories and try to control what is being discussed, that these campaigns are tiny in comparison to the numbers of people employed by the Russian government to do the same thing.

       Ill give you the benefit of the doubt, but here's my take on it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Russian Intelligence would be stupid enough to use names like "cozy bear" and "fancy bear", code names which you automatically associate with the "Russian Bear"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is the go-to enemy to blame because it provokes a "pavlovs dog" reaction in Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emails are highly embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're pissing in the wind.

       We all know that Russia is into something. Any sensible conspiracy researcher should.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alas, Russia (Putin) and China had always infiltrated western governments with assets like Obama, Hollande and Merkel along with the CIA, Mossad or MI6. Russian, Chinese and Intelligence infiltration of the west is a common fact that cannot be denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all the west is doing is to provoke it and China into a war that it cannot possibly win, which is maybe not a coincidence but as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Superpowers" (Puppets) of the new world order, will be Russia and China and western civilization (America, Europe, Japan etc.) will end as programmed by the world mafia.

       How do you know when the emails were obtained?  What if the dump happened right before the DNC because that's when they got all the info to release it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think that if they had the info earlier to release, they would have done it to try and sideline Hillary to give Bernie the advantage.  But they didn't and Hillary is now the Democratic nominee.

       Sadly, all I can offer is secondary sources with the only primary being Guccifer as mentioned. The only source I can find is
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/politics/dnc-hack-russians-guccifer-claims/">
        between Whenever to up to June 18 from CNN
       </a>
       (
       <em>
        DNC announced last week from June 21 that it had been hacked. States two groups, one that had been for years and the other for months.
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       I would appreciate any source that does state when Guccifer 2.0 hacked the DNC, as I do believe there may be one.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the timing to release, I do agree that it may have been more damaging to release it in the wake of Sanders vs. Clinton. However, assumptions then fall into a pure 'what if' territory. If it helped Sanders win then Trump Vs. Sanders would be different than what we see now. After all, these hackers don't seem to be doing it with the intent to get Bernie Sanders nominated.

       Who cares when Guccifer 2.0 hacked the DNC.  The important thing is the info got out and it at least forced the resignation of Debbie Shultz.

       This emails proved that the DMC destroyed democracy at it's core and these are the people that are suppose to be Democrats?

       Why are you not more disturbed that Democracy has failed instead of raising your eyebrows at when these emails are leaked?

       Yeah Wikileaks really did seem to kick the DNC right in the nads with this one, and at the right time, but at the same time I'm glad proof is getting out, as a "Bernie Bro" and fuck that title, as a Bernie supporter I feel vindicated that all of our bitching that Hillbots were attributing as us being sore losers is starting to look more and more verifiable, I just signed up for the class action against the DNC, hopefully anyone else who has donated to Sander's campaign will as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       However on the other side of things I'm getting back to where I could care less who wins, if it's not Sanders that is and most likely it won't be, this country deserves one or the other (Trump or Hillary) for being so fucking apathetic in so many ways, I mean seriously how about giving a shit what happens and what kind of shitheel we have for a president and any other elected position, and if those choices are corrupt or batshit crazy how about we reject the bad and go for some good.

       It's the basis of a conspiracy theory to make a hypothesis from the information absorbed by us.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the quotes stated in the articles mentioned are true, as is historical events such as past relations (Trump's new campaign manager Paul Manafort lobbying for Viktor Yanukovych). Because of these pieces of information that are true, it is our responsibility to create an allegation from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, this can be as true as me simply stating that Russia is actually supporting the DNC in this matter by making the press focus on Clinton and the convention rather than Trump. I always welcome anyone who wishes to take it with a grain of salt.

       The allegations of DNC fuckery, not Russian involvement. The possible Russian source is a distraction from the fact or falsehood of the material released. 
I've no doubt that Russia is tampering in our process as they have for many decades, on whichever side of the aisle they could get a foothold, whoever was in charge there.

       Why wouldn't Putin be working with Assange? He has stated repeatedly that he fears wwiii and that American forces are encroaching ever closer in a threatening manner. Isn't it his duty to his people to exercise whatever influence he can in order to promote peace? Of course he's using this. A trump presidency would be much more favorable to Russia than a Clinton one.

       Watch the new Clinton cash documentary and tell me Russia is behind all this. I tell you what!! If the mainstream media are reporting on Russian involvement in this we can be sure it is all lies. Mainstream media is directly on the Clinton machine payroll. Why would we start believing them now?
