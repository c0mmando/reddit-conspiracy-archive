<p>You&#39;re better off archiving them via something like <a href="http://archive.is/">http://archive.is/</a> rather than screenshots - Screenshots can be easily faked. Whereas trusted archives can&#39;t be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>opus dei was depicted as the bad guys in davinci code. and the enemy in angels &amp; demons was illuminati.</p>

<p>but he never, never mentioned the jesuits anywhere in his works. not once. cmiiw.</p>

<p>and freemasons were depicted in a positive manner as scholars and learned experts.</p>

<p>intelligence agencies are also potrayed in a positive light.</p>

<p>the fact that he never mentioned the jesuits at all, is a clue for me that jesuits might be the center piece of real world conspiracy.</p>

<p>opus dei and illuminati are probably irrelevant.</p>

<p>EDIT: adding into this. it&#39;s weird how even archived thread&#39;s karma points are still moving up and down. better fix that algorithm bug, reddit scammers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what&#39;s happening.  If I get immediately downvoted I know it&#39;s artificial, I delete and I repost and if it stays at 1, with no comments that&#39;s how I know people geniunely think it&#39;s a piece of shit post.  Or if they say they dont&#39; like it.</p>

<p>But if they attack <em>me</em>, then I know they aren&#39;t a real person because they came there specifically to attack me.</p>

<p>They also BAF 2 more who exhibit the same behavior, attacking the person, not the idea.</p>

<p>This is how you know they&#39;ve poisoned the thread, just like you are trying to do now, but you&#39;re on that list also.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t spam, I delete it and try again.  There was one famous case where I A/B tested and showed it to everyone and it got very high marks here.  (hillarybot is hillarycaught). This was a clear demonstration of obvious vote manipulation aganst posts containing hillary near email.  Those extras were deleted after the screenshot was taken adn the test complete.</p>

<p>That is not against the rules, nor is that manipulation and I&quot;ve checked with the mods and it&#39;s ok behavior here. If they had a problem with what I do, they&#39;d have told me a long time ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve reported your behaviors here a long time ago and they cannot do anything about it.  So this is a compromise.  I unfortunately don&#39;t have a private army working in tandem to fool the public so I have to delete and try again.</p>
