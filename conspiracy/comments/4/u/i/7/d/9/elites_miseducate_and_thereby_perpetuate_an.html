<p>A bygone modern philosopher of our time, Terence McKenna, once said of Science--of the <em>Big Bang</em> specifically-- </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Give us one free miracle and we&#39;ll explain the rest&quot;<sup><a href="http://realitysandwich.com/164908/undoing_dogmas_rupert_sheldrake/">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He went on to explain how science was very strict in its formula: observe, hypothesize, test.  The key to science is that it can be repeated.  The big bang will always fail this criteria.  We are left with ancient light and sound, which would be interpreted a number of ways if we didn&#39;t already assume and then dogmatically cling to the unproven hypothesis of the big bang.  It seems that the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge">sociology of science</a></em> and tyranny of the majority is then triumphant over empiricism <em>in this one unique snowflake of a case</em>.</p>

<p>Terence&#39;s friend and Cambridge-trained fringe evolutionary biologist Rupert Sheldrake agrees, expanding on Terence&#39;s thesis with several problems and assumptions made within the science community in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg&amp;ab_channel=revolutionloveevolve">TED talk</a>, which was later banned by TED.  Due to overwhelmingly negative responses from this ban, TED was forced to reevaluate, apologize to Rupert and reinstate his talk, albeit buried within their crappy, poorly-functioning site (so better to use youtube).</p>

<p>Science doesn&#39;t like being contradicted about some things.  There&#39;s a reason for that.  Some say it hurts the progress of science.  Others believe there&#39;s more covert politics at work.</p>

<p>For example, and back to the big bang, did you know that the big bang theory is based on theology and was proposed by a Jesuit priest?<sup><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre">[2]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/45agko/the_big_bang_is_religious_dogma_disguised_as/">[3]</a></sup>  Instead of making a hypothesis on observations without a bias coming from a religious book, I wonder what we would come up with?</p>

<p>With the observations we are capable of now, that answer could also be: <a href="https://youtu.be/fgg2tpUVbXQ?t=271">infinity</a>.  The fact is: we don&#39;t know.  And &quot;we don&#39;t know&quot; is the most honest answer we can give at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Eternity</strong></p>

<p>If the big bang were to turn out <em>not</em> to be true, then we&#39;d have to come to terms with the other possibility: eternity.  That the universe <em>is</em> and <em>always has been</em>.  This would also suggest that it if doesn&#39;t have a beginning, it might not have an end.  Should this be the case, then time could expand infinitely in each direction (infinitely in the past, infinitely into the future), or it could be a closed loop where the infinite past <em>is</em> the infinite future.  </p>

<p>But of course these are words and we can handle them to a degree conceptually, but practically it breaks most people&#39;s brains including my own.</p>

<p>And given that the big bang is a theological <em>idea</em> only with absolutely no basis other than some observations that are very likely incorrect (sampling bias, among many many other problems), then <em>the eternity model</em> is actually a far better candidate for the truth, since we have no reason to place a beginning and end into something that reliably happens for all of us, ever day, for centuries without fail, without any input or assistance from ourselves (reality itself).</p>

<p><strong>Boundaries</strong></p>

<p>If we artificially place a beginning, then that implies boundaries.  After all, a big bang theory starts as a single point within &#39;nothingness&#39; and expands the nothing by &#39;creating space&#39; with hot energy that coalesces into the material everything that exists from galaxies to suns, down to planets, sand, and us, atoms, muons, etc.</p>

<p>When you create that point as a concept, then boundaries are created by space or by &#39;void&#39;--or nothingness (ex: the gray area around a photo you are editing in photoshop)</p>

<p>If the universe were infinite there would be no boundaries, only infinite space.</p>

<p>Therefore, psychologically, when one creates boundaries one <em>identifies</em> with boundaries.  When one identifies with boundaries they develop a kind of metaphorical claustrophobia that inhibits them within their experience from feeling powerful, unlimited in terms of potential, ambitious and inspired.  Mental boundaries then become a form of social kontrol</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong></p>

<p>A beginning implies an end, or at least it begs the question of &#39;the end&#39;.  These concepts then create a continuum of time.  Which then can be broken up into parts and used to describe events and to fixate people into a framework of time.  This way, cycles can be predicted, events can be planned, and most importantly, the effort of every person can be evaluated in terms of output per unit of time and reward them correspondingly.</p>

<p>Time then becomes a means for people to control other and to control themselves.  It becomes a means for people to coordinate with others.  It becomes a way to control information and thereby create hierarchies based on who receives imminently important information quickly, and who receives that information decades later; whole castes are created based on who has privilege to timely information.</p>

<p>So in this way, time creates boundaries between people and groups of people; it forces people into individuation and separates us from each other.</p>

<p><strong>Alpha and Omega and Death</strong></p>

<p>Death.  The ultimate end.</p>

<p>Because of the Big Bang Trick, our culture seems to be very death-oriented.  Our culture seems to glorify death; glorify Jesus&#39; death and martyrdom.  I believe this is done to keep you from the idea of your soul being eternal and thereby would suggest reincarnation.  After all, if souls go to heaven (or hell), then where would new souls come from inhabit all the bodies that keep being born?  In the beginning-end model, they could be preallocated.  In eternity, however, there would have to be a garbage collector that would recycle them!</p>

<p><strong>Reality Warfare and Weaving Spiders</strong></p>

<p>Aristocrats have a different religion from regular Christians.  I bet you didn&#39;t know that.  Many of them are Alchemists or &quot;Gnostics&quot;, or they&#39;ve been exposed to either gnostic or new age ideas, most pertinently Jungian transpersonal psychology, holographic reality (fractal nature of everything), the idea of infinity and eternity, the idea of duality in all things, the idea of holism.  These &#39;esoteric&#39; teaching have been preserved among the occult, the secret societies, military intelligence elites (spies) going back to the rosicrucians, then the templars, then the craft guild heretics, then the mystery schools of ancient kemetic orders (hence the &#39;illuminati&#39; pyramid).  This is all substantiated by historical documents in other posts if you have trouble simply accepting this claim at face-value.  A key figure to invoke for authenticity sake is John Dee, an alchemical spy for Queen Elizabeth, upon whose name, the founding fathers religion Deism was formed (&#39;dee&#39; ism).  </p>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Because Aristocrats know that the world is not ending.  Their reality model is eternal.  They understand are revere cycles.  That&#39;s why they study astrotheology, the kali yuga, mayan astrology, astrology.</p>

<p>Therefore they know how to build.  How to save.  How to expand their empire.  How to network.  How to exploit the network for power.  How to share among themselves to help build.  </p>

<p>They are spiders.  They bide their time and weave their web of power and control over the planet because they know it&#39;s not going anywhere.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the fundamental difference between the 99% and the 1%.  The 1% knows the end-times are NOT around the corner. They also believe in reincarnation.</p>

<p><strong>Eschaton / End Times</strong></p>

<p>If you are a religion that uses the dogma of &#39;the beginning&#39; then surely you will have a section dealing with the &#39;end times&#39;.   And you ever notice how &quot;end times are coming&quot;.  They always have been coming.  &quot;End times&quot; are for stupid people who don&#39;t know that they are being used to manipulate and kontrol them by people who understand the real story.</p>

<p>If the end times are coming, there is no need to plan, no need to save, no need to preserve the future generations.  You are stuck in the right-now, focused on your pathetic, little lives with no motivation to build anything or make your mark on the world, especially since the world has been destroyed by floods over and over again (was it really?), or that pyramids were built by aliens because we&#39;re too stupid to do anything like that (were they really?)</p>

<p><strong>The Latest Fashion</strong></p>

<p>Ephemerality and near-death ideation and hyperconsumerism.</p>

<p>Ascension of souls in Heaven (/hell) gives rise to YOLO memes, and me-oriented me-xperience culture and more consumerism.</p>

<p>This culture they created by not knowing or caring about true history creates a mass illusion that traps people in the current moment of sensation-primacy and body-consciousness, fast money and immediate low quality reward.</p>

<p>Another thing Terence McKenna said was about <em>fashion</em>.  To paraphrase him, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;fashion means fast money and low political concern&quot;.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fashion is a way to control your mind and wallet by telling you that you always have to look novel and &#39;current&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Miseducation of Reality Models</strong></p>

<p>The aristocrats then create and sustain the underclass with religious dogma and mythologies of abuse and control that become inserted by double-agents embedded in science and academics to maintain a false model of reality.</p>

<p>Over time, this translates into a miseducation; a type of fascist dogmatism to &quot;science&quot; (ie: scientism), rather than an earnest attempt to understand reality.</p>

<p><strong>No the Illuminati doesn&#39;t want to destroy religion</strong></p>

<p>Nope.  Not one bit.  They need it to kontrol us.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t have your own personal relationship with Jesus or any other world mythos.  I think it&#39;s good to have something to get you through these times.  I&#39;m just saying that organized religion is not unlike any other mafia that&#39;s there to control your mind.  </p>

<p>I think the first freedom we should take back is not privacy but our minds.  Because we reclaim that and everything else will fall back into it&#39;s natural order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most believe in the Jesuit constructed world around us. Our world is based on religious Dogma wrapped in a veneer of Science and deception. This
 control works because they get you suspend your own thinking process. So you only learn what they tell you, You believe what Bullshit notions they have constructed around you.</p>

<p>The main problem is we are born into this control, and each generation traps the new generation, to call on pinkfloyd, &quot;Everyone is helping to build the Wall.&quot; </p>

<p>We are all Trumans in this world, born into deceptive control. But the controllers are never inside our head. That is the real key here.</p>
