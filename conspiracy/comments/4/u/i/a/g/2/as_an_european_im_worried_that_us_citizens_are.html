        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>With the latest news about Hillary&#39;s leaked emails I&#39;ve seen a huge negative response against her mostly from Bernie supporters. A response that I consider very reasonable.</p>

<p>The problem is that neither the US nor the world can risk having Trump become the most powerful person on earth, and what has been discovered about Hillary is rather minor compared to Trumps constant open declarations.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of people living in big cities/urban areas might see Trumps candidacy as a joke and something quite impossible, IT IS NOT. Don&#39;t forget that in your context you mostly see people that think like you and therefore it may seem like everybody thinks that way. Trump being president is a VERY REAL possibility.</p>

<p>In England nobody really thought that they were going to vote leave the European Union and a lot of people didn&#39;t go to vote thinking that leaving the EU was impossible. Finally extreme right, which are very dedicated voters, won and fucked the lives up of a lot of generations to come.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let that happen to you.</p>

Our former Bildenberg duped Swedish prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt for example set the stage for our mass immigration. The objective was to screw up swedish economy and force us to take loans in the elites banks. Mission accomplished Reinfeldt now has a well paid job at bank of America. Fucking traitor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ignorance? Exactly what am I ignorant about? You also ignored my other question: how do you feel that as a European it is now almost impossible for Americans to keep up with all the attacks on random civilians happening in Europe?</p>

<p>This is why your worldview is losing and why Trump will win: you can only attribute the fact that people disagree with you to ignorance or hate. Neither of these things are true. I don&#39;t hate anyone, but I&#39;m sure as hell voting for Trump. Just like British people concerned about Britain voted for Brexit, just like French people concerned about France will vote in the Le Pens, meanwhile the progressives will just sit on the side saying &quot;omg that&#39;s so racist don&#39;t you know I learned in college that all religions are the same and Islam is fine&quot;.</p>

<p>I see your from Spain, so you must know that Spain used to be ruled by Muslims, until a shit ton of people died so you would have the freedom of not living under a caliphate there. Maybe you should think about that a little bit. Western culture is a delicate thing and people making moves to literally save it from crumbling around you aren&#39;t ignorant or hate-filled. </p>

<p>Please respond with exactly what I&#39;m being ignorant about. I doubt you can back this bold assertion up with anything, just like everytime a liberal here comes out of the gate swinging and has literally nothing to back it up with except emotional rhetoric. Prove me wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NerosBeard666, you didn&#39;t understand my comment. I wasn&#39;t calling you an ignorant but calling you on the fact that you used my acknowledgement of my own ignorance to attack me. You have to take it easier bro or are going to have a heart attack.</p>

<p>What happened in Spain hundreds of years ago has no relevance to me when I think about today&#39;s politics. I&#39;m no defender of any religion, and myself as a &quot;liberal&quot; I have my doubts about Islam and its adaptation to the west. </p>

<p>Where I think you are wrong is where you identify your country&#39;s problems with Islam, Muslims or immigrants when you have an education system that forces 20 year olds to start their lives in deep debt, a mass shooting frequency that &quot;is almost impossible to count for europeans&quot;, a shitload of people living in the streets, healthcare that is almost impossible to pay, etc...</p>

<p>That is why I think Trump is so dangerous for you guys, I think he is willingly distracting you from the real issues your country has.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re saying this means you literally have no idea what you are talking about. Hillary&#39;s track record is abysmal and involves actual bodies on the ground and actual compromised state secrets due purely to her own incompetence and disregard for the law.

<p>Regarding the danger of Trump and the nuclear button (I presume that&#39;s your conceern here), I think you&#39;re mistaking the POTUS for an actual ruler. The US president is not an supreme commander. Even if he wanted to, he is constrained by the rest of his government and also the 2 houses.</p>

<p>What you ought to be concerned about is the fact that real power in the US is held be a bunch of out-and-out psychopaths who no-one voted for ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hyperbole much? We are yet to see the effect of what leaving the EU will be on Brits, and staying in certainly hasn&#39;t done much to help the lives of young Greek and Spanish citizens. And while the media has done a great job of only promoting the right wing leaver&#39;s views - there were some very solid reasons for left wingers to vote for Brexit (indeed, the head of the RMT union made some very convincing arguments, not to mention those made by Tony Benn and Bob Crow before they popped their clogs).</p>

<p>Trump would in my opinion be a disaster for poor people in the US, but the email leak proves that Hillary has committed crimes against democracy, and Wikileaks has said they&#39;ve got more to release which are even more damning... Neither candidate is going to be a &quot;good president&quot; (IMHO) and could you really vote for someone who has done what Hillary has?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you in that there is a lot to criticize in the EU (myself being a young Spanish citizen) but while it has its flaws I never believed that the way to change a system was to leave it. The European Union has brought Europe the brightest years of its history and if we continue working on building a political system next to the financial one it will be even better.</p>

<p>You are again right about Hillary but she is BY FAR the lesser evil, which I know is an horrible thing to say but that is simply how the system works and it is important to be realist about it in order to obtain the best possible outcome in a pretty shitty situation.  Trump would be a disaster for poor people and for international relationships in the US since he has shown an incredible ignorance in foreign politicy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? I want the USA out of Europa.</p>

<p>Most EU countries are vassals of the USA and you want this crap to continue? The massive immigration only happens because the current establishment in the USA wants that to happen. Merkel does not work for the german population. With Sarkozy they even had a freaking CIA asset running France.</p>

<p>Maybe your interpretation of &quot;brightest&quot; years is getting rid of the military dictatorship in Spain and replace it with whatever corrupt &quot;democratic party&quot; came next + a lot free money from the EU and easy credits from its member&#39;s bank to create a lot bogus infrastructure in Spain the country could not afford. Maybe you believe that the massive spanish youth underemployment will be painted over with Euro forevermore.</p>

<p>The EU was pretty much ok until the late 80s. Live and let live+cooperate where necessary to avoid friction with protected borders based on bi-lateral agreements. If a state screwed around they were still able to fix it by their own currency and help from stronger EU partners.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s all connected and it will blow up tearing down <em>everybody</em>. If you can&#39;t see the potential of violence in this scenario you&#39;re really naive.</p>

<p>I am inclined to agree with you about her being the lesser evil. I am sincerely worried that the next wikileaks release will mean she will be indicted, leaving Trump to more or less claim victory anyway. My only real hope is that this will happen quickly, and Sanders will be given the Dem nomination and go on to beat Trump.</p>

<p>Looks like we will have to agree to disagree on Europe - my personal opinion is that it is unreformable because it is based on a foundation of neo-liberal ideology, and is too obsessed with promotion of &quot;competitive&quot; markets and &quot;free&quot; trade to ever be a force for good for the workers of Europe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not about people being rude in emails that got leaked. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has a long and storied history of criminality. She &amp; Bill are followed by a constant accusations of drugs, murder, rape, pedophillia, blackmail, perjury and money laundering. She is a war monger who takes bribes from foreign governments and large corporations in exchange for regime change and genocide. Americans know this even if our media refuses to speak openly about it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that neither the US nor the world can risk having Trump become the most powerful person on earth, and what has been discovered about Hillary is rather minor compared to Trumps constant open declarations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather minor? Hillary thinks its fucking hilarious when regimes are toppled, when kids are raped, when villages are bombed. The leaks just proved she has a little army of minions who laugh along with her. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump being president is a VERY REAL possibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope you&#39;re right. None of us want wwiii. </p>
