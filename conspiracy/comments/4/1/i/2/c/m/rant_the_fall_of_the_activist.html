    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree, I think the majority of Western &#39;issues&#39; today focus on trying to treat symptoms of wider systematic issues (i.e. I think women are less successful in the workplace due to an overly competitive atmosphere in most workplaces that women are generally not prepared to thrive in by society rather than some kind of inherent sexism...) that go largely ignored by the activist crowd. There&#39;s still some hope in the privacy/internet-rights community I feel but this has been side-lined over the last few years to a depressing degree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m speaking from some experience here.  I attended a Friends school.  Quakers are notorious advocates of &quot;social justice&quot; and have played a historical role in the prohibition of slavery and civil rights movements in addition to anti-war and more contemporary justice movements.  </p>

<p>I watched at my own alma mater and have spoken with friends from numerous other affiliated schools who have had the same experience, where social justice movements focused on addressing the needs of those abused by power have been coopted to refocus on ego-driven emotional needs.

<p>I like how you use &quot;social justice&quot; as a generic catch-all term for the causes you like while feigning surprise that others--with whom you disagree--might do the same.</p>

<p>Anti-war, for example, is not &quot;social justice&quot; but rather simply &quot;anti-war.&quot;</p>

<p>You can accept or reject this reality.  That&#39;s fine with me.  You&#39;re free to make believe, but playing pretend will always just be playing pretend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre right in that the term is abstract and can be used however people want.  You&#39;re wrong in that war is addressed by social justice and that those who believe in social equality have been and are traditionally focused on the underprivileged and those abused by government institutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The American two-party system has successfully created a perpetual &quot;us vs. them&quot; mindset amongst the population which effectively stifles any kind of actual development.  It turns everything into a debate that lacks an in-between, conveniently camouflaging the actual issues at hand.  </p>

<p>If you have zealots on both sides of the pro-life debate (for example), you don&#39;t have nearly as many people asking <em>why</em> this debate is still going on in one of the (apparently) most developed countries in the world.  Meanwhile, the rest of the world is looking on in sheer confusion, wondering how America became such a baffling contradiction.</p>

<p>We see this with party leaders being considered &quot;generous&quot; when they make any strides towards a reasonable center as the people praise them for listening while nothing actually changes.  Reasonable decisions shouldn&#39;t be disguised as massive compromise, the rest of the modern world is well-beyond dealing with the issues that seem to generate an inordinate amount of attention in America.</p>
