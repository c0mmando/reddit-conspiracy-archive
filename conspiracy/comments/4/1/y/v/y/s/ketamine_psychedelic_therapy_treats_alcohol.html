       Psychedelic therapies in general seem to work surprisingly well. I've read articles talking about Ayahuasca, psilocybin and even LSD being used to treat alcoholism, depression etc. to great effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's probably part of the problem. A lot of people simply wouldn't bother with alcohol in the first place if weed was legal. Then there's the huge loss to the pharmaceutical industry if there was a cheap, effective and natural alternative to the shitty ineffective meds they sell.

       up until recently, I think in experiments, LSD was shown to have the greatest effect on alcoholics, with up to 50% of the subjects involved never touching a drink again (which is one of the largest success rates of any treatment at the time....looks like maybe ketamine can offer something similar)

       There have also been some similar stories about ibogaine. People experience real change in their lives after just one or two "treatments". This includes stuff like no longer being addicted to drugs such as heroin or oxycodone.
      </p>

       A drug that helps people get off drugs? Makes you wonder why something like that could possibly be illegal... and yet it is.

       Medical use of Ketamine isn't limited to depression.  It's used as an anaesthetic and for pain management too.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a minor, I was administered ketamine as a dissociative sedative for a surgical procedure where i didn't need to be put under (similar to N02/ xanax administration for wisdom tooth extraction).  There are other post-operative applications as well.

       I requested a trial of Ketamine for depression from my shrink.  He said no, he could lose his license for doing that.  (Don't know if that's really true.) So I don't know where people are getting the information that it's being used for depression.  It's been tested for use with depression, but not approved in the US.

       This article doesn't say anything about the KPT. How often are they being administered ketamine? If it's on a regular basis then it makes complete sense why it wouldn't be approved since ketamine damages your liver and mixing that with alcohol abuse would be very dangerous.
