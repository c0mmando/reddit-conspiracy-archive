    <div class="md"><p>Psychedelic therapies in general seem to work surprisingly well. I&#39;ve read articles talking about Ayahuasca, psilocybin and even LSD being used to treat alcoholism, depression etc. to great effect.</p>

<p>That&#39;s probably part of the problem. A lot of people simply wouldn&#39;t bother with alcohol in the first place if weed was legal. Then there&#39;s the huge loss to the pharmaceutical industry if there was a cheap, effective and natural alternative to the shitty ineffective meds they sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>up until recently, I think in experiments, LSD was shown to have the greatest effect on alcoholics, with up to 50% of the subjects involved never touching a drink again (which is one of the largest success rates of any treatment at the time....looks like maybe ketamine can offer something similar)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have also been some similar stories about ibogaine. People experience real change in their lives after just one or two &quot;treatments&quot;. This includes stuff like no longer being addicted to drugs such as heroin or oxycodone.</p>

<p>A drug that helps people get off drugs? Makes you wonder why something like that could possibly be illegal... and yet it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical use of Ketamine isn&#39;t limited to depression.  It&#39;s used as an anaesthetic and for pain management too.</p>

<p>As a minor, I was administered ketamine as a dissociative sedative for a surgical procedure where i didn&#39;t need to be put under (similar to N02/ xanax administration for wisdom tooth extraction).  There are other post-operative applications as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I requested a trial of Ketamine for depression from my shrink.  He said no, he could lose his license for doing that.  (Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really true.) So I don&#39;t know where people are getting the information that it&#39;s being used for depression.  It&#39;s been tested for use with depression, but not approved in the US.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This article doesn&#39;t say anything about the KPT. How often are they being administered ketamine? If it&#39;s on a regular basis then it makes complete sense why it wouldn&#39;t be approved since ketamine damages your liver and mixing that with alcohol abuse would be very dangerous. </p>
