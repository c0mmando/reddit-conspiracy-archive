       Problem -&gt; Reaction -&gt; Solution
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem: The stock market is crashing severely. (because the fed withdrew the 0% interest money it was lending to the big banks for the last 8 years, in December it raised the rate to 0.25%)
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaction: People are scared of losing their retirement funds (which are essentially locked in the stock market thanks to the popularity of the 401k) and want the freefall to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: TPTB have TPP ready to go, which is an international trade bill that will fix the stock market by allowing for more "free trade". It's passed, and the stock market goes back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the TPP has to be passed in 12 countries, so the stock market crash will be global too. This exact same problem -&gt; reaction -&gt; solution pattern will occur simultaneously with 12 governments in 12 countries as all stock markets crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       To test out this theory, we can keep track of the dates of passage of the TPP in all 12 countries. If they line up with a global stock market crash that seems to be coming soon, then that would appear rather damning, wouldn't it? And if the market miraculously recovers afterward, and if the media says the recovery is all thanks to the passage of the TPP, that will be more big signs that point to collusion at the highest levels of finance and media.

       Makes sense, but sadly I don't think they really need to wait for anything since there's virtually no news coverage, little if any public outcry, and the earliest they can vote will be February which means half the country will be obsessively distracted by the super bowl.

       You know, the more I think about it the less I buy this explanation of "the public will just sit back and do nothing". I think internalizing this type of thinking is what leads to our collective learned helplessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had to stop they Syria war because of the US and international outcry. These people still are beholden to the public on some level, and they know it. They know how controversial the TPP is right now. I think they will feel forced to hide the passage of this bill in the chaos of a market crash. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's my feeling. The people in charge are scared right now, this is a very tenuous period in history.

       Not so. Remember the national indicators prior to NAFTA? Economy "strong" (of course we can only take the government's word on this... ever), unemployment down (ditto), the nation was not in debt and even had a "surplus" (of what, you might ask)...
      </p>
      <p>
       And when everyone was happy and things were going good, NAFTA.
      </p>
      <p>
       After which, everything started to go to shit because the corporations started "fucking over the American workers" by taking those jobs overseas.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you hearing about America's "state of health" now that TPP is looming?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has jobs... the economy is cranking along... life is good in the U.S. of A.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except this time a lot of people aren't buying into the bullshit because of A) NAFTA's aftermath and B) it's hard to think everything is rosy and keen when you're working 2-3 jobs just to fucking be homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no... passing the TPP has nothing to do with the stock market dropout... that's a whole different pile of shit that needs its own space to talk about.

       Plus all the shitty things that happen as a result of TPP can be blamed on the "stock market crash", at least for a few years until everyone "forgets" about the TPP and accepts the new normal.

       The stock market is the government's best tool in demonstrating (falsely) how good the economy is doing. When they want to look good, they boost the economy through zero interest rates. But they've backed themselves into a corner with a sinking market and almost zero interest rates. In an election year, it's going to look bad if something else doesn't happen.

       Do you really think Obama would push things through on a fast track and then hand it over to the next President to sign?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm... Leaving it for the next President does shift the blame...

       I don't know if you've been paying attention but the republicans in congress don't want to pass anything that could be called an accomplishment for the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know the deal is being delayed in other counties too so there is no rush to pass it. Odds are the republicans will control both houses of congress no mater who wins the presidency and i doubt they fear Berny.

       Stock market is mainly crashing because of data out of China. The 0.25% is still not that significant and has priced in since October and to be honest ~0% doesn't look too different than 0.25% (but would look different from 0.75/1% in the markets)

       But you are onto something...with passing TPP since the market has been shit and everyone has been revising down global growth

       I was thinking this as well the other day. What a better time to introduce this "radical" legislation that basically no Americans knows about. I can see it already, they will say it will fix the economy and bring stability to the markets.

       what good is a trade agreement if everyone loses their money before hand. The markets would be stagnant for a bit (I'm assuming at this point) before buying power started to return. Same as before.

       Not only will the TPP be pushed through, but a new global currency controlled by the IMF will be created to replace each currency. This was predicted in 1988 by Rothschild-owned "The Economist": they call it "The Phoenix"
