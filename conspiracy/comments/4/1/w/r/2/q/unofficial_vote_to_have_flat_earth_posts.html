       All right, I yield.  I'm against censorship like everyone else here.  At least we're on the same page.  I honestly didn't expect this kind of response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't think this is a "conspiracy", I do think this can be argued as a non-conspiracy.  There are no group of people conspiring to keep us in the dark about this.  If that theory is correct, the world would have been like this for what, however many billions of years?  Not the work of any on secretive group trying to keep us in the dark here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, censorship it is and I'm not for that at all.  I honestly wanted to have a place where people don't need to resort to insulting the people who believe this idea or making fun of them or downvoting their posts into oblivion.  They should have their voice but I don't think its here.  That's just me I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Original post below
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I post this because I want to get an idea and maybe momentum on having these things separated from r/conspiracy.  I don't believe there is a lick of proof on the side of "flat earth" believers and thus are not a conspiracy at all.  I think there is a mountain of observable and scientific proof showing this to be impossible and thus does not need to be lumped in with the r/conspiracy sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you participate, please keep responses to a Yay or nay or the like for the sake of keeping the "vote" clear and obvious.  No need to make this thread an attempt to ridicule or attack either side, this is to get an idea of who is for and who is against.  Vote with a simple word and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in favor of having flat earth posts disallowed, vote yay.  All those in favor of allowing them, vote nay.
      </p>
      <p>
       No offense to those who do believe, I just don't believe you need to be posting it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe as I do that this kind of thing does damage to legitimate concerns in our world, please participate.  It will take only a second of your time.

       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       - Additional thoughts on if you believe this is censorship more than welcome.  please put that with your "nay".  I'm against censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply believe they can have their voice and their time but elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the sub thinks that is censorship.  I yield to the sub and will hush up.

       On this issue, i personally dont believe this could be termed a "conspiracy".  Dont worry though, voters have spoken and i dont want to be the one to stir another censorship debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe they can have a greater voice all on their own, in their own sub and they can spread the good word as they like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not for censorship, I dont think this actually qualifies as a conspiracy by definition.  I certainly dont believe they have any evidence that qualifies them as a legitimate issue.  This kind of thing, if true would be beyond groundbreaking.  Beyond a conspiracy.  It would change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats not the case though,  you can belive it as you like.  I would jever keep you from that.  This however, is beyond reason.  You live the evidence of a spherical earth every day you walk out the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not censorship.  Its pollution of legitimate concerns here in the sub.

       If seeing what you precive as the ISS is suppose to be major proof for a spherical Earth I'd say that's very weak.  Plus I said don't use NASA as a source considering they are known for lies and secrets.   ISS  = NASA

       Just admit that you've never actually thought about the shape of the Earth aside from what NASA has told you.  Do you trust every aspect of the Government or just NASA?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually look at the evidence for a spherical Earth you will find there is no hard evidence, you must trust NASA and their Apollo "photos" of Earth.  Shouldn't there be thousands of pictures of Earth available to us by now?  Wouldn't we have HD cameras on the Moon by now?

       The Chinese have a telescope on the moon and they've only taken one or two pictures??  Where are the thousands that you talked about?  Why is there no video of Earth spinning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't you admit that you are only relying on government agencies to tell you what the Earth looks like, you've never critically thought about it or researchd it on your own.

       Not wrong in the that the math doesn't work out, but wrong in the sense that just because the math works means that is the reality that we live in.  The math works just the same if you say the Sun and stars revolve around Earth instead of the Earth around the Sun.

       So when I look to the horizon I can see blue sky. Why is this sky blue and not smoky grey or something like that. Also, what's the mathemetical basis of your arguement?

       This is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, the object the size of the earth can't be a flat disc because gravity would force it into a round shape and the materials earth is made of can't overpower that gravitational pull.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, sun and stars are millions of times more massive than the earth is. And objects can't orbit less massive objects. That's against the basic laws of physics. How do we know stars are more massive than the earth is? Because we can easily measure their distances and brightness and from that it's easy to figure out their mass.

       I had to think about how to word my response to you Axol.  So here it is.  Also, please understand this is not an attack of any kind.  I simply want to find out where you or maybe even other mods stand on this issue.  I think this post has been
       <em>
        unfairly
       </em>
       turned into an issue of censorship, when that is not what I'm advocating for at all.  As you can see, there are many posts here who agree with this but still call it censorship.  A decision about meme's being allowed in this sub has been made, and they have been relegated to its own sub as per rule #8.  It wouldn't be the first time this kind of thing has been asked for and followed through on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you willing to allow me to flood this sub with posts and videos about how I "believe" the moon is made of cheese, simply because I believe in it?  I could come up with any excuse I could think of to "defend" my belief and you would be honor bound to allow me to pollute this sub with my unprovable claim?  Thus making it even harder for real free thinkers a fighting chance at finding real information about real conspiracies?  Ie. 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be honest, this
       <strong>
        IS NOT
       </strong>
       a provable claim to make about the planet that you an I live on.  We can prove that the moon is not made of cheese.  We can also prove the earth is not flat.  It has been proven.  Do we allow the sub to be subverted that way because we have infinite "tolerance" for any and all ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
       To give an example, I have been having a chat with user FlatPlane.  This person
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/41vxsa/the_rconspiracy_sub_in_the_news_flatearthers_are/">
        submitted this
       </a>
       as evidence that the theory is gaining traction.  In this chat, I reminded him that the burden of proof would be on him and that group to prove the claim.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/41vxsa/the_rconspiracy_sub_in_the_news_flatearthers_are/cz5nr2k">
        He informed me that he did not have to prove anything.
       </a>
       and the only way that he would do so, was if I went into space and took real time video of the earth rotating.  Which is impossible by itself, right?  See how that works?  He can't/won't prove his theory because I can't go into space and prove mine.  Checkmate?  Does that not say enough about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, experts and witnesses all contribute to the obviousness.  Is there any such thing possible for flat earth people?  Will there ever be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we let people post these claims that can do very real damage to what r/conspiracy was all based on?
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU0-ASniLvE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1128">
        Here is a Gentleman arguing that if we lived on a globe, the only real place for us to be able to stand on would be the North Pole, as in if we were not on a flat plane, we would fall off.
       </a>
       This is argument without reason.  Without basis in our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as one person here put it regarding censorship, it can be a slippery slope.  I agree.  But I think you are heading down another slippery slope when it comes to allowing this particular topic to take root here without publicly distancing from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is the same as advocating for this kind of thing to continue, and are responsible for spreading blatant misinformation and ignorance.  People are more than allowed to believe whatever they like but that's not the problem here.  Being associated with and even entertaining the idea is the damage done.  How easily can the sub be discredited because we say nothing about it in a very public way?  Have we thought this all through?
      </p>
      <p>
       We make ourselves an easy target by not drawing a line in the sand.  This kind of topic is an easy place to draw that line.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you value more?

       You're advocating censorship in this sub. Basically, it's segregation for things

       Do i hear safe space? In a truly free and open society/forum you have the right to be offended by whatever you want, you also can simply ignore whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much time of you day did you waste with this? Where most people simply choose to ignore ridiculous claims like flat earth, you felt the need to assert your apparent intellectual Napoleon complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be perfectly honest, you yourself cannot definitively prove anything (nor can I). And thus is the beauty of zero censorship.

       Last summer (or maybe 2 summers ago),
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       had a sidebar "filter option" to filter out all Ferguson/Ukraine/Gaza/Ebola stories that were swamping the entire top level of
       <a href="/r/news">

       to get past the Flat Earth/Jews/Immigrants/Hillary/Trump/Bernie spam.

       Then I'd only have to spend an extra hour sifting through all the reposts to find the 12 original daily submissions.

       Nay to censorship. It would inevitably become an unmoddable mess, as people had fun posting links to stuff that was almost sorta flat earthy, just to fuck with people who lack the ability to use the scroll wheel and move past threads they don't like for whatever reason.

       No! I think that is the path in totally wrong direction specially in the sub. Imagine if what you are suggesting was done to you and your post... yes that would be unfair and simply wrong. You need to put things in perspective a little more, censorship is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that FET is carefully engineered to somewhat put a psychosis on those that go too deep into this very well "planed dead end" of a theory, you need to fight and ignore this on your own whether you fall to it or rise above it... Speak the truth its the absolute weapon, make your own choice not choices that are allowed. The only one that is allowed to limit you is you as yourself (self limits are absolute and are just one of many ways to ascension) so think free, speak free, live free... you are BORN TO BE FREE!

       But then again, the results of this thread seem to be a clear validation of Asimov's assessment of the rampant anti intellectualism in modern society; when  pro-ignorance is  mistaken for anti-censorship.

       Definitely a NO from me. It would be a disaster for this sub for any conspiracy related subject to be deemed "off limits" in principle. Downvote or ignore the posts you don't  like, and move on to something that interests you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would also be the thin end of the wedge, because once you ban Flat Earth from being discussed, what would be next? Before you know it, the sidebar would have a nice long list of subjects banned "because they make the sub look bad".

       It would be lovely to have it both ways. Some dedicated soul could easily start the r/flat-earth-studies group without anybody banning it from here. Just do it. Add hollow-earth to the group if you like. But no need to banish them from here. Given such freedom, people will naturally gravitate to where the action is, and should the new group flourish, the topic will fade away here. Just sayin'.

       David Cole was the first person who made the holohoax plausible for me. Then David Irving. What lumps them all together is that Nazi scientists went on to found NASA and the deception multiplied from there.
