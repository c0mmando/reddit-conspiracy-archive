<p>Wtf? First, ITT thread you think you have the right to post a link some ridiculous YouTube video, but netteshelm can&#39;t link to a wikipedia page?  Your bias is at facist levels, but good thing nobody is going to respect you.</p>

<p>Secondly, he did prove it.  He linked to a page with a series of <strong>experiments</strong> which confirm the Earth&#39;s rotation.  That&#39;s great!  He doesn&#39;t have to copy-and-paste it here, that <em>is</em> how he would prove it.  He would look up some experiments, and maybe either do them or go look at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being serious?  </p>

<p>I will bet you $10,000 US that, given a suitable location such as a tower in the desert, we can measure the level of the horizon at various altitudes, and it will be at the angle relative to gravity predicted by spherical geometry.  At 1.5m above ground level, that means the horizon is 90.4 degrees off the gravity force vector.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly easy to prove that the earth is a sphere.  No intelligent person would ordinarily bother to explain it, but you&#39;re special, so I&#39;ll make a low amount of effort.</p>

<p>Other obvious proofs that the earth is round:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level of horizon recedes as you gain altitude</li>
<li>Coriolis pendulum</li>
<li>Shadow during an eclipse</li>
<li>Great circle air routes</li>
<li>The positions of the sun, moon, and stars in the sky is exactly what the accepted model predicts, without mathematical adjustments to make it all work.</li>
<li>The moon is a sphere, the sun is a sphere, every other body of material in our solar system that is large enough to become hydrostatic is a sphere.  You can look at them through telescopes and watch them rotate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any person can get a pilot&#39;s license.  If great circle routes were not the shortest distance between points, pilots would figure that out relatively quickly.  That doesn&#39;t happen because the earth is round and great circle routes are, in fact, the shortest routes between points.</p>

<p>The evidence that the earth is round is so overwhelming and has been validated by so many normal civilians that Flat Earth Zombies don&#39;t get a lot of replies.  The main issue is that people who ask the question are pretty obviously not open to the answers.  They couldn&#39;t have avoided already seeing the answers, so to get to the point of looking at Flat Earth as a valid question, they are usually beyond help.</p>

<p>The real question is: Why is there a Flat Earth Disinformation Operation?  The reasons are quite sinister.  By creating so much hate and anger within the conspiracy theorist community, the FEDO perpetrators are creating a relative common situation that happens during revolutions:  the stupid revolutionaries kill the intelligentsia revolutionaries, because they come to the crazy belief that their own intelligent allies are defrauding them, and are not their allies.</p>

<p>False.  I believe that 99% of you are people who can&#39;t do basic math, and you are the Flat Earth Zombies (FEZ), you are the victims of Flat Earth Disinformation Operation (FEDO).</p>

<p>Most of the reason I want you censored instead of having a discussion is that every single one of you pretends that the burden of proof involves me writing you a mathematical document that duplicates what you could already find on the web.</p>

<p>Foucalt&#39;s Pendulum or Coriolis Pendulum is described here:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum</a></p>

<p>You can go to a museum and see one for yourself.</p>

<p>Great Circle Routes are also on wikipedia.  For $10k you can go get a pilot&#39;s license and find out for yourself what the shortest distance is between two points.  And you can also watch the level of the horizon recede as you climb.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to claim the burden of proof somehow falls on me to document all these already-documented things.  It does not.  You&#39;re perspective is a mental illness.</p>

<p>So behind all of your insults, the only thing you have to show to prove the earth is round is a link to a description about Foucalt&#39;s Pendulum. That is not proof that earth is a sphere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scientists who have repeated variations of the experiment have conceded time and again that <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ETxNCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PT206&amp;amp;lpg=PT206&amp;amp;dq=it+was+difficult+to+avoid+giving+the+pendulum+some+slight+lateral+bias+at+starting.&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=D0M-1fhL6F&amp;amp;sig=U2RLhyJ1uFYjyT7rQzt7339NTtw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj77IGisK_KAhUC6RQKHUTdAlcQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=it%20was%20difficult%20to%20avoid%20giving%20the%20pendulum%20some%20slight%20lateral%20bias%20at%20starting.&amp;amp;f=false">“it was difficult to avoid giving the pendulum some slight lateral bias at starting.</a>” </p>

<p>The supposed rotation of the Earth is completely inconsequential and irrelevant to the pendulum’s swing. If the alleged constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should be no need to manually start pendulums in motion! If the Earth’s diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth!

    <div class="md"><p>Oh for God&#39;s sake, what you take as attacks, I take as observations about you.  It&#39;s a fact that people who subscribe to Flat Earth Delusion don&#39;t measure the earth and mostly can&#39;t do math. </p>

<p>As for your rebuttal of Foucalt&#39;s pendulum, is it not strange to you that pendula would be synchronized according to latitude of the museum they&#39;re in?  It&#39;s one thing to imagine that a person imparted sideways motion to the pendulum.  It&#39;s another thing to imagine that all those random impulses somehow synchronize according to latitude.</p>

<p>No, you don&#39;t &quot;need a $10k pilot license.&quot;  My point is that hundreds of thousands of people have those.  Your perspective is that those hundreds of thousands of people must all be &quot;in on it.&quot;  What&#39;s more, <em>you</em> could get a pilot&#39;s license and prove the earth isn&#39;t round, but you don&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>Imagine the fame you&#39;d receive if you did prove the earth isn&#39;t round.  Surely $10k would be a small price to pay for that validation, authority, and fame.  But you don&#39;t do it -- because, deep down, you know it&#39;s a dumb bet, and you know that the only reason you&#39;re so attached to your delusion is an emotional need.</p>

<p>So, yes, I suppose that&#39;s mental illness and you are mentally ill.  No offense!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a video in which a letter is received from a pilot.  The pilot writes that his eyes have been opened by the Flat Earth theory.  </p>

<p>At 7:09, the pilot&#39;s letter is being read, and says, &quot;I always believed I could see that faint curvature, the same one I saw from my deck in Georgia.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VaUBrui9L1I?t=429">https://youtu.be/VaUBrui9L1I?t=429</a></p>

<p>The problem with this explanation is that the horizon is not expected to appear curved on a round Earth.  It is expected to appear <em>level</em>, which a lot of people confuse with &quot;flat.&quot;</p>

<p>The difference in horizon between a flat Earth and the real Earth is this: a flat Earth would have a level horizon that appears at an angle 90-degrees lower than &quot;straight up&quot; as defined by local gravity.  As you gain altitude over a flat Earth, the position of the horizon does not change -- it stays 90-degrees perpendicular to &quot;vertical.&quot;</p>

<p>On the real Earth, the horizon appears to be at a lower angle the higher you are when you look at it.  At 1.5m, about eye level, the horizon appears to be 90.4-degrees from vertical.  At 30,000 feet, flight level for commercial airliners, the horizon is 100-degrees from vertical.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don&#39;t believe this letter was from a pilot, though.  Pilots have to take curvature of Earth into account when navigating by VOR, which is a skill that any older pilot would have.  This guy&#39;s supposed career history is old enough that he would have surely have to know hot to navigate by hand, which cannot be done correctly unless you account for the curvature of the Earth.</p>

<p>He works with the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, which the video calls a &quot;ranged weapon system.&quot;</p>

<p>Most weapon systems have ranges.  I am not sure what a &quot;non-ranged weapon system&quot; would be.  Even a fist has a range.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s get real:</p>

<p><strong>What is the range of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow this guy works with?</strong></p>

<p>Do you consider that range particularly far, especially with regard to the Coriolis effect?</p>

<p>unfortunately I do not think there is a quick proof. I think it takes time to take in the info. and then you only take it in if you are actually interested, so -- maybe it&#39;s not for you anyway, but I offer this as a first person voice of a man who can share first hand experience/proof/ </p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ve started on my pilot&#39;s license enough to fly on my own, and I&#39;m about $2k into it.  I&#39;m not allowed to fly very far, I&#39;ll grant you.  Every route has to be approved by my flight school to nearby airports.</p>

<p>Do you know how to post links with timecodes?</p>

<p>maybe it&#39;s not for you anyway</p>

<p>I was interested in this at first, but then I started working through &quot;200 proofs.&quot;  It turns out, they are all misleading claims.  We can start with #1, the idea suggested that the horizon should appear curved to us.  That&#39;s false for a round earth, same for a flat earth.  As you keep watching &quot;200 proofs&quot;, you find that all the &quot;proofs&quot; are dishonest.  Not just wrong, but dishonest.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I am so interested in the FEDO conspiracy.  Since November 2014, this PsyOp has been put out to cover something(s) else up.</p>

<p>Could you post time-stamp links to specific points the Navy Man makes?  FWIW, I have written programs for USN NSSC OPNAV, so I do have admiration and respect for the minds at US Navy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry I don&#39;t know what to time stamp because I think it&#39;s the whole show that leads to the understanding &amp; I really - I think you should listen to the whole thing. but I know the idea of that could be daunting. i say skip around only to see if listening to the guy appeals to you at all first. and if you like it awesome - and if it doesn&#39;t intreague you then no worries. I have no military experience but to me -  the guy really speaks like a navy guy. He&#39;s very disciplined in his language. I found him to be -- great to listen to esp because he comes at the topic saying he assumed it was all nonsense at first, and then he considered the mechanics of how he was firing weapons, , etc. listening to him - it&#39;s like a slow story -- that helps you find a way in -- to how something so outlandish -- started to seem self apparent to a person with applicable expertise.  ~the first few mins is  weird animation for the radio show. so start maybe 5 mins in. </p>

<p>and if the lack of time code issue not ok for you - here is much shorter video - be wary it&#39;s made for those who already think the earth is flat so you may find the humor off putting but I think you might find the point it makes interesting.. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOaHZzRb1Ro">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOaHZzRb1Ro</a></p>

<p>that&#39;s great you got your pilot license. as you can fly further and further I hope you do experiments to try to challenge any flat earth theory - or ball earth theory too. first hand experience just can&#39;t be beat. </p>

<p>-- I gotta say normally if somebody talks to me as you have I&#39;d just ignore - with your anger and insults, but --- you know I can see for this specific topic -- if it hits you in the right way - it could be incredibly enraging. and if you don;&#39;t take it lightly, if you take it like an -- just a huge and angering thing - -well - I mean it&#39;s the shape of the earth. it&#39;s a big freakig deal. and we should not all be changing our mind about it lightly. and if it&#39;s not making sense to you why a lot of people are changing their mind about it -- well -- the anger does make sense. -- I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m cool with it. but -- I recognize the gravity of the topic. no pun intended.</p>

<p>as for the 200 proofs. I&#39;ve watched them. I agree SOME proofs are a little iffy, actually. -- this looking out and seeing flat sky/water -- this is a really tough way to prove anything. we think of fish eye lenses curving things -- but the truth is the human eye alters perception too. all eyes alter at a certain distance. . as do all lenses. so looking at a single image and pointing to a straight or curved line -- is always going to be problematic as a proof unto itself, I agree. </p>

<p>I think the abundance of evidence is compelling even if some of the alleged proofs are not solid. and what I find perhaps even more &quot;solid&quot; as proof is not so much that the flat earth model must be correct but that the globe model can&#39;t be entirely correct. why and what that really means - is interesting as hell to me. </p>

<p>but flat earth theory needs vehement testing. those who are finding their way to believe it need no insult, but the theory itself should be tested in every way possible. as should the globe earth theory. </p>

<p>i hope you find more information either way the further out you fly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that it&#39;s daunting.  I watch 3 hour videos if they&#39;re good.  The issue is that most of the FE videos are really, really, bad.  They bring in all kinds of other conspiracy theories and don&#39;t stick to the points.</p>

<p>But, just for you, I will check it out and let you know what I think.</p>

<p>Not yet.  I basically have a learner&#39;s permit.  Daytime only, have to coordinate with my flight school, etc.</p>

<p>I agree, but I think it&#39;s a big freakin deal that you&#39;ve been misled to believe your perspective.</p>

<p>Well, thanks for talking to me.  I would like to suggest we make a decisive YouTube video.  Let&#39;s find a location, maybe Reno or Vegas where there towers in the desert.  Then let&#39;s go up to a high balcony, and measure the angle of the horizon.  If it matches round earth, you buy me a drink.  If it matches flat earth, I buy you a drink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FIrst, let me say that this is a fucking terrible video.  It&#39;s not &quot;daunting,&quot; in any way, other than it is <em>inefficient</em>.</p>

<p>The video is 110 minutes.  The first claim of fact occurs at 9:30!  Here it is:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xJOB0vcZ4NI?t=570">https://youtu.be/xJOB0vcZ4NI?t=570</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uh the biggest thing, that was really the turning port, uh, point for me, uh, personally, was, one argument was brought forward, that I could not ignore any more.  And uh the biggest one that it was, was the fact that, when we look up at the night sky</p>

<p>[mmm hmm]</p>

<p>Um, you know, we&#39;re supposedly a spherical earth orbitting, you know, the Sun, at 93 million miles away, where we take a orbit pattern of 350 million miles, and we never see any constellations in the sky merge across each other.  There&#39;s no parallax shift uh with line of sight that we have with the constellations.  And, you know, when we&#39;re supposedly on an axis, and we&#39;re wobbling, and you know we&#39;re travelling on the other side of the Sun at some point during our uh a half year passing, that never happens, we never observe that in, you know, natural space, we don&#39;t see that.</p>

<p>And that was one of the biggest things for me, because, you know, geometry doesn&#39;t lie, trigonometry doesn&#39;t lie. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Wow</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s work this out.  What would the parallax angle be for the nearest star, Alpha Centauri?  Most of the stars in constellations are much farther away, but the closer stars will show more parallax, and I&#39;m trying to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, so let&#39;s do the math for the nearest star: </p>

<p>The first thing we want to know, is what is the longest line that connects two points in the Earth&#39;s orbit?  We average a distance of 93 million miles, so we could just double that and call it a good estimate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit#/media/File:Seasons1.svg">but the orbit is elliptical.</a></p>

<p>To get the most parallax possible, we want to take our measurements on January 3rd (Periapsis) and July 3rd (Apoapsis).  That gives us 299 million kilometers, or 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> km.</p>

<p>The distance to Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years, or 4.13 x 10<sup>13</sup> km.</p>

<p>The ratio of these distances is 1:10,000.  Alpha centauri is 10,000 times farther away than the widest axis of Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun.</p>

<p>The angle defined by that 1:10,000 ratio is: 0.006 degrees.  That is 6 thousandths of one degree.</p>

<p>So, to make the claim that constellations should &quot;merge&quot; is absurd.  The apparent parallax motion of stars is a very, very small change in angle, and it will be less for stars farther from Earth.  Alpha Centauri is our nearest neighbor.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax">Stellar parallax</a> is observable and defines the distance unit, the &quot;Parsec.&quot;  It&#39;s just that stellar parallax is so small that setting an expectation of &quot;merging constellations&quot; is unrealistic.</p>

<p>Speaking of his missile systems, they are the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow.  The video chose to call them &quot;Ranged Weapons,&quot; as if they travel long range.  What is the actual range of a RIM-7 Sea Sparrow?  Is it very far, in your opinion?</p>

<p>I can only imagine the mathematical blunders in the remaining 100 minutes of this video, but, from my perspective, I&#39;m done.  I just disqualified that guy from making any points on the subject.  I suppose it&#39;s possible he makes a mathematically valid point later on, but, if so, hopefully one of you FEDObians will point me to that with a time stamp and a succinct summary, like I do for you.</p>

<p>P.S. For the record, I gave him the best possible but unrealistic example.  There is no reason to believe that Alpha Centauri is on the Jan 3-Jul 3 orbital axis that givest the highest resolution.  I just wanted to base the math in assumptions that give the most credit to the claim I aim refuting.  So, I pretended that Alpha Centauri, the closes star from us, happened to lie in the plane that is perpendicular to the long axis of our orbit.  I doubt that&#39;s true in reality, but it&#39;s not a mistake, I did that intentionally.  To give the Navy guy the benefit of the doubt, I combined the highest resolution position with the closes star, as an example.  It still refutes the claim that Navy guy says turned him to FEDObian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is a big difference between -- who do you believe - and who are you interested in hearing from and considering their ideas. I want to hear all sorts of ideas. I want to consider the ideas I hear and consider if they intrigue me and if I want to research further in the directions they suggest. There is great power in listening to information from many sources. </p>

<p>when you go to universities -- more or less you are told information you expect to absorb without question. tho students do often question - which is good, but the idea is to take in knowledge, </p>

<p>but you don&#39;t have to treat all learning in this same way.you don&#39;t have to only hear ideas from credited sources, you trust before you even know what they have to say. you can hear ideas from any source you like and make your own judgement how credible the information itself sounds. </p>

<p>ideas are for considering - not for just believing. when you take that approach -- yeah -- youtube in an incredible resource of information. </p>

<p>and for that matter you should never treat university learning with such blind faith. education is great -- but you should always reserve the right to question and to consider the validity of information for yourself no matter what the source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but if even one student had a problem with anything being taught they&#39;d be able to do something about it, it&#39;s an open forum in that sense, they don&#39;t teach blatant lies at most universities, at least knowingly.</p>

<p>My issue with the type of sources conspiracy theorists provide is they&#39;re not based on any sort of facts or research, they just present some sort of idea and their argument for why it&#39;s true always relies on people&#39;s paranoia of cover-ups and their distrust of the establishment, they don&#39;t even bother to refute the actual science behind something nor even discuss it. The biggest problem with every conspiracy theory is that countless people are involved in them, humans just like you an me who have absolutely no reason to not disclose anything to the public and gain worldwide recognition. Chemtrails fail to acknowledge that pilots would be affecting their own families, Fluoridation fails to address why not a single scientist involved finds it to be a moral issue, the list goes on. Paranoia and distrust fuels conspiracy theorists, not logic and reason.</p>

I can find you a video of people saying the world is controlled by reptilians, reptilian voice recordings and other stupid bullshit that people believe just as much as you seem to believe this. It&#39;s all about fighting the norm, convinced the world is trying to feed you lies, a sentiment rooted in paranoia, the belief that an individual is smarter than everyone else (people that call others sheeple and other shit), and deep distrust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way, I listened to the whole video.  (It&#39;s really just an audio track with thematic images that aren&#39;t relevant.)</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but &quot;Robert&quot; the sailor hasn&#39;t really thought through all his claims.  When he says the weapon systems don&#39;t compensate for the curvature of the earth, and talks about the gimbal gyroscope system, and so on, I can tell he doesn&#39;t really understand what he&#39;s talking about.  Similarly, when he talks about the Norwegian tank computer hardware being repurposed into the missile launching system, he sounds confused about the importance of software differences.</p>

<p>The RIM-162 ESSM is guided by, as he puts it, a &quot;2 degree pencil beam.&quot;  He&#39;s talking about the AESA waveforms.  I can tell that he has to, basically, lie a bit when asked questions about the secret waveforms. (e.g., &quot;1 frequency&quot;).  He also alludes to things in a special articulation: when he says the proximity fuse explodes and &quot;impacts with high precision,&quot; what he doesn&#39;t mention is kinetic divert payloads.  Kinetic divert payloads do, indeed, explode and impact the target with high precision.  But most people listening to him wouldn&#39;t realize he&#39;s talking, probably, about a kinetic divert payload.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;d love to talk to him in private about all this.  I think he misunderstands the purpose of the Elevation and Bearing system he&#39;s talking about, and why it only needs input of ship&#39;s current attitude to track a target.  Basically, the tracking and control are relative to the ship.  The curvature of the Earth means the target has an altitude other than its apparent altitude, but the tracking radar only returns a relative bearing and elevation.  As the ship moves, the tracking is immediately adjusted, and because everything can be expressed as, again, bearing and elevation, those are the only inputs needed to the tracking computer to continue to &quot;paint&quot; the target as a bright radar spot in the sky.</p>

<p>The missile actively seeks the painted radar spot, and also has a data link mode of operation.  When it is seeking a painted radar spot, it just homes in on the illumination.</p>

<p>So I am not sure the Navy Guy quite understands that the software he&#39;s concerned with is simply using ship-local coordinates because that is the efficient way to solve the system problem, and not intended for map-making purposes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe he is saying that when he uses the integrated combat theatre warfare system, the AGL altitude displayed for remote targets matches the elevation of the tracking radar, as if the Earth were flat.  If that were true, it would be stunning.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what to think or say about the claim he made of viewing ships on the horizon at 25 miles and seeing the entire ship.  One thing for sure, I believe he saw that.</p>

<p>One time I looked through the periscope of the U.S.S. Pasadena.  About 4 miles away, I took a look at an apartment building balcony.  A guy was grilling hot dogs.  He forked a hot dog and we admired his cooking.  The grill mark was beautiful, and detailed, and brightly lit with bright colors.  I could see much more detailed than I can explain, but I could explain how an avalanche photon detector works, or a push-broom hyperspectral camera, or most other opto-electronic devices.  And I think I may know how the name of the tech they use in those optics, but I can&#39;t name it.</p>

<p>And so I don&#39;t really know what to think when he says he can see objects on the horizon with Navy optics.  All I can say is I won&#39;t yet consider it more than 0.001 mg of evidence for any strangeness with the Earth.  I would sooner assume that it&#39;s some amazing secret shit and he doesn&#39;t need to know.</p>

<p>I will keep it in mind, though.  To me, it&#39;s more interesting to speculate along the direction that USN has that technology, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah -- I&#39;ve given that a lot of thought. I used to believe that is exactly what we are seeing - but once I started questioning I see there are a lot of problems with being sure the lunar eclipse is the earths shadow on the moon and that that proves we are a ball. </p>

<p>here are some of the reasons I question it: </p>

<p>the way shadows really work. shadows stretch and expand and shrink due to the moving factors of the light source, the object casting the shadow and the surface the shadow is being cast on. we are not getting this in a lunar eclipse at all. if you attempt to recreate the experiment with balls and a lamp, etc -- I think it&#39;s impossible - to not see shadows crawling across the moon in a much different way than what we are seeing in the sky -- as you get each element into place to create the eclipse. so it&#39;s not so much the final eclipse I take issue with but the partial eclipse, the stages before and after, the shadow on the moon at those times looks like a circle moving across another circle, it looks like a flat disc creating a shadow on another flat disc. i know looking at the moons craters - it looks very much like the moon is a ball. but just viewing the shadows -- we never get the hot spots and the angles that a ball casting a shadow on a ball always creates -- instead what we see are shadows flat circular surfaces could create. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming that I know what a lunar eclipse is -- I sure do not. but I often watch them - - long before I considered flat earth, but once I had that change in perspective -- I realized that -- the shadows have never really been conducive to how we have always explained them .</p>

<p>as for the flat earth model - the atmosphere IS actually spherical  at least half so. it is a dome. much like a snow globe - flat bottom, round sky with a surface to the sky. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I totally understand the question.  The penumbral shadow can appear during a complete or incomplete eclipse, the umbral shadow is only visible during a total lunar eclipse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as for the flat earth model - the atmosphere IS actually spherical at least half so. it is a dome. much like a snow globe - flat bottom, round sky with a surface to the sky. </p>

<p>So then what explains the shadows moving across the moon?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how are those shadows explained with infinite space beyond the ball earth? I&#39;m not sure how they are explained either way - but seems to me a dome sky would get us closer to an explanation than an infinite space sky. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The penumbral shadow is primarily generated by the shape of the Earth in front of the moon.  Once the moon is completely covered, the umbral shadow is generated by the sun&#39;s beams travelling through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, which gives it that reddish glow.  </p>

<p>Here is a good example where you can see basically all of the phases:</p>

<p>How is this explained by the dome model?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks again for your answer. I agree hurricanes and weather and water flow seems to occur in opposing/mirroring patterns above and below the equator -- but I think it&#39;s not literally above and below I think it&#39;s within and without. there is an explanation for this weather/water behavior on a flat earth that imo makes equal if not much greater sense than on the globe earth model. I think that it stands to reason that if the weather patterns can be explained with a non-globe model then the weather patterns are not proof of a globe, and the proof is still to be made. </p>

<p>here is a short video showing the weather patterns on flat earth: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqKTLzUKqDc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqKTLzUKqDc</a></p>

<p>if you consider the sun is circling above - as shown in the seasons on flat earth graphic -- you can imagine the path the sun makes as it circles creating a kind of current of force/ focussed energy -- along the equator, pushing water away in opposing directions in it&#39;s wake. to me this is the best explanation I&#39;ve ever seen for water moving different directions in different parts of the earth. esp of you consider with the oceans we are talking about salt water and salt water can both conduct electricity and is effected by magnetic force.  it&#39;s only a theory -- but it makes sense that electric or magnetic energy is a part of what is moving the oceans, given those are major forces present in our world, and this is a major phenemon. however I think even just heat could do a lot of it/ </p>

<p>I also -- do not see how globe earth actually explains the hurricanes -- because on a rotating ball - all rotation is still parallel. the idea that the poles are pulling the water is problematic too since the north pole is still a force that dominates the southern hemisphere -- compass and gps do not revert to south pole magnetism in the south they still use the north pole. but this brings up a lot of other questions, anyway -- I also propose the globe model does not actually explain the water flow. only that it says it explains it - but if you break it down and look for the actual reasoning, why the globe creates the water motion like that -- I have looked for that specific explanation and so far I do not see it </p>

<p>again -- I&#39;m not claiming that flat earth is hereby proven, and I&#39;m especially not claiming that magnetism is for sure why our water flows as it does - but only that - if I can give a strong alternate explanation - I propose the weather, then, is not enough to prove globe earth.  </p>

<p>But you have not done that.  You&#39;re talking about the Earth&#39;s magnetic field affecting the flow of water.  Think about how weak the magnetic force is compared to the gravitational force.</p>

<p>Regardless, you were also replying with an answer that doesn&#39;t address swansong19&#39;s question.  That user is asking about Coriolis rotation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is proof of nothing.  I can imagine all sorts of nonsense, but then the burden is upon me to validate that.  There is zero evidence for your imagined mechanism, so your answer is not &quot;strong,&quot; but super-weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movements of stars.  Stars seem to move in a circular manner regaurdless of lattitude, even for northern or southern hemisperes.  If the earth were flat, we should expect the stars to act more akin to a dome rotating above the earth.  This means, the further you move from the north pole, the more elliptical the movement of the stars should appear from the ground.  Further more, in the southern hemisphere, we shouldn&#39;t expect to see stars moving around a different fixed point in the sky.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m allowed to accept distances measured by others (like the distance from the north pole to the equator) we can use basic trigonomitry to find what the expected angle of the sun should be at any point iin time, and consistantly expect an angle well above the horizon for most of the planet, most of the year.</p>

<p>Various tests with the coriollis effect using large still pools or large pendulums prove that we aren&#39;t in an inertial reference frame, and are best explained with the standard model.</p>

<p>We can take photos of various satellites and the ISS during their orbit.  Furthermore, using equations that assume a assume a sphereical earth, we can make accurate predictions as to when and where they will be visable again.</p>

<p>The same face of the moon is always visable to everyone on the earth, reguardless of location, and doesn&#39;t change from moon rise to moon set, even for two distant observers.  No photograph of the moon has ever been of a different face, even when taken by simultanious people in distant locations.  This implys the moon is a tremendous distance away.</p>

<p>Pictures like those, quite simply, do not fit in a flat earth model.  Also, I have sat and watched a sunset, I have seen it.  No doctored photos, no conspiracy, no math, my eyes.  So let&#39;s do it: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the sun a sphere? If it is a sphere that shines light in all directions equally, then it can&#39;t have the &quot;spotlight&quot; effect the flat earth model describes.  But if it is not a sphere (like a flashlight shining down) then its shape would be distorted as it moves away from your position, eventually becoming a sliver of light, but it&#39;s shape is never distorted as it sets. </p></li>
<li><p>No flat earth calculation of distance of the sun gets the sun to the horizon using basic trigonometry.  But forget trig, you can use common sense for this.  If the sun is above the flat earth and moving away from me - it will stay in the sky until it disappears out of sight.  Flat earthers disagree on how high the sun is, so I can&#39;t do the math here (without a number), but any number keeps the sun in the sky as it should slowly shrink away in the sky.  Pick a number (for the distance) and I will do some math if you want.  The point is simple, the sun shouldn&#39;t touch the ground, let alone be halfway behind it in a half circle of the same size. </p></li>
<li><p>No, this is not perspective.  Can bright objects appear larger than they are at a distance? Sure, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re seeing here.  How do I know? Because I can see it with my own eyes.  I can see the sun halfway behind the horizon.  Sure, there are pictures with the sun as a kind of glare filled blur at the horizon, where size is difficult to determine, but that&#39;s not how it always looks.  </p></li>
<li><p>If the sun is not a downward spotlight, then the light should fade slowly into the distance, there should not be such a stark &#39;night/day&#39; moment as sunrise sunset.  And yes, there is twilight, but I&#39;ve seen sunset, the moment the sun disappears beneath the horizon is a short period of time, when that last sliver goes, and it&#39;s distinct.  So a spotlight is the only way flat earth could explain this demarcation.  But the spotlight just doesn&#39;t match what we see with our eyes. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Flat earth theory is kind of fun.  It would be amazing to believe such a fantastical conspiracy on such an enormous scale.  So many people in on it.  It&#39;s a fantastical tale.  I would like to believe in Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster too - a world where everything we think we know can be turned upside down so thoroughly is kind of exciting.  </p>

<p>BUT, flat earthers usually start their arguments by imploring us to trust our senses.  We know we aren&#39;t flying around a globe because we can feel that we are stationary, we can see that the sun goes around us, we can see that the stars are points of light, etc. etc.  So use your sense and look at sunset, watch the sun never diminish in size as it allegedly gets further away.  Look at how it&#39;s shape is not distorted as it disappears below the horizon, that it isn&#39;t fading, that is going behind the horizon.  I know you can do it.  </p>

<p>There are better conspiracies out there anyway.  Hillary Clinton says she&#39;s going to release all documents about Area 51 when she&#39;s elected President.  That&#39;s a thing right? </p>

<p>Are you having fun attempting to dismiss me by saying -- whatever I think is &quot;kind of fun&quot;?</p>

<p>Dismissing an idea by psychologically &quot;explaining&quot; why somebody would &quot;enjoy&quot; thinking it, belittling it with minimizing language, and grouping it with other notoriously less plausible ideas  - -can keep you from ever considering the original idea fully, and keep you from ever genuinely understanding the people who are offering you the idea. it&#39;s demeaning prejudice you are demonstrating, suggesting I must also believe in aliens, or that all conspiracies are equal in legitimacy and that I should just pick a &quot;better one&quot; and that my ideas are merely &quot;kind of fun&quot;.. if that&#39;s where you want to stay with your thinking that&#39;s fully your privilege and you can get away with it in our current cultural climate -- but it is still prejudice, limiting and wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice technique.  Always be on the offensive.  Rather than address any issues, you have to attack what I&#39;m saying. If you can&#39;t attack <em>what</em> I&#39;m saying, then you better attack <em>how</em> I&#39;m saying it. </p>

<p>This ensures that the other side is always on the defensive, and that the topic is continually shifting to new ways that you are attacking them.  Now, I wasn&#39;t particularly rude, I didn&#39;t call you stupid or anything like that, so you can&#39;t use the usual attack that &#39;that&#39;s not how you win people over.&#39;  So instead I&#39;m condescending, because I&#39;m analyzing why you think this - and comparing it to things that you say are &quot;notoriously less plausible.&quot;  </p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s insulting.  Why would you assume these things are less plausible? and say they are notoriously so? I&#39;d guess that most people would say flat earth is far less plausible than even bigfoot or loch ness (let alone aliens).  Does it matter what most people would say? It does, because you said &quot;notoriously&quot; which implies a public perception.  </p>

<p>Of course we have to consider the psychological desire to believe certain things.  If we fail to do that, we fail to be critical thinkers.  I may have a drive to believe I&#39;m a good person.  I have to recognize that bias if I&#39;m going to consider whether I actually am.  I may want to think I&#39;m not racist, and so I&#39;ll be biased to think my actions are not racially motivated - I&#39;d say I can&#39;t properly analyze those actions without knowing those biases. </p>

<p>I was just trying to point out that the fantastical can be alluring.  That is not prejudice.  Is it demeaning? Sure, I guess, in so far as actually believing in a flat earth is a fantasy.  It is a psychological mindset that requires ignoring or dismissing massive amounts of evidence to the contrary of your idea, convoluted explanations that get more absurd with every passing year, and then taking weird and convoluted facts to believe something. </p>

<p>It betrays itself as an exercise.  Some people online try to argue the impossible.  Then others take up the mantle - and use different argument techniques in online forums.  It&#39;s good practice I guess.  Someone calls you stupid, you attack them as not convincing, someone calls you &quot;kind of fun&quot; you attack them as prejudiced.  Always keep the other side off balance, always keep them defensive, make them try to prove something and move the goalposts if they do. </p>

<p>Honestly? It&#39;s appealing, it&#39;s a lark.  I genuinely feel bad for the true believers, because I believe they are trying desperately to find a feeling of significance and importance in a difficult world.  </p>

<p>But no flat earther can explain the sunset.  Not in forums I have searched, not in blogs I have read, not in youtube videos.  It demonstrates that this isn&#39;t about observed evidence, it&#39;s bout either </p>

<p>a) a type of social trolling, where people try to believe in, argue for or prove the impossible.  A type of mental thought experiment in action. </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>b) a psychological disorder rooted in a desperate search for &quot;something.&quot; Because we, as human beings, do seem to have a desire to find and believe in things.</p>

<p>or, I guess</p>

<p>c) a religious belief that cannot waiver.  Although I guess this could be categorized under &#39;b&#39;  </p>

<p>I was just saying, that if it&#39;s &quot;b&quot; - well, I get that, but there are better options.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.  I&#39;m saying that there are other things out there to believe, pursue, investigate and argue on behalf of.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how can you feel attacked at all? you agree with what 99.999% of what the world believes. the president agrees with you and criticizes what I believe. and you feel attacked? get some perspective, </p>

<p>if you want to talk actual ideas great -- but yea -- you have to stop with the pseudo psycho- analysis. do you see me saying oh you just want to believe what the popular opinion is because it makes you feel safe to conform to society? you love that &quot;we &quot; are exploring space even tho there is no &quot;we&quot; about it -- you CAN NOT go to space -- but when your gov tells you people are going there on your behalf you feel warm and fuzzy. and it&#39;s fantastic. and you look at new pictures of new planets, that you can never take too nomatter how good a telescope you get,  and you don&#39;t ask question you just live the fantasy. </p>

<p>but you know what -- I don&#39;t think thats stupid. I don&#39;t think it needs to be psychologically criticized. I think it&#39;s almost impossible to realize --- that that stuff is all a trick, I personally only realized it about a years ago, by chance because somebody else tipped me off. the normal healthy response is to believe it - -because why would you question. except ---- there is a lot of evidence that it should be questioned .and a lot of people are trying to call it out -- to people who haven&#39;t been able to consider it should be questioned  yet. and it&#39;s out of WANTING TO SHARE GOOD INFORMATION&gt; -- that I would even post about this stuff. </p>

<p>I have no desire to fight with you . you need no offense or defense. imo/ -- you can consider flat earth theory or dismiss it -- it&#39;s up to you.  but if you are sure it&#39;s wrong - why even bother commenting -- you can be a part of what 99.99999% believe -- you don&#39;t need to say anything to me if you are not genuinely interested in understanding why I an really saying these things - rather than telling me why I am saying these things - while not knowing me at all, not knowing me any better than I know you. </p>

<p>and it&#39;s not a &quot;technique&quot; when I tell you not to be prejudiced to me. I am being 100% sincere. you are belittling me and I am telling you that is not ok. if you want to call it a technique you are only continuing to be dismissive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I put forward a genuine argument against the flat earth, that you have completely ignored. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say everyone was attacking me, I was saying you were as part of a debate tactic, and you are doing it again.  You called me prejudice, you said I was belittling you.  That is trying to put me on the defensive.  </p>

<p>Now you do it again (debate tactic) by misconstruing what I said, saying I said I feel attacked even though everyone agrees with me.  Now you are implying I don&#39;t want to talk actual ideas, when if you look at this chain, I&#39;m the only one who put out actual ideas.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, my psychological bias toward wanting to be part of the group should be considered.  It&#39;s one of many factors. I also enjoy believing in space exploration, it may make me more inclined to believe in the Mars rover or the moon landing or Voyager - because those are accomplishments we can all share in.  That&#39;s attractive.  That could create a bias - and one could argue is part of why they are successful propaganda (if you want to argue that&#39;s what they are).  </p>

<p>But the point is you asked for proof the was a spinning ball.  I said the sunset.  I then proceeded to explain why the sunset as observed supports a spinning ball theory (in that it fits with that model), while it does not support a flat earth theory (it does not fit).  You proceeded to derail the conversation by calling me prejudice, never addressing my points, and now telling me my pseudo psycho analysis is what&#39;s at issue here - right before doing your own psycho analysis.  </p>

<p>Then you declare that you don&#39;t want to fight with me and obviously I can&#39;t consider the real points or conversation here. </p>

<p>But y&#39;know, if you want to discuss ideas, we can.  I really engaged in that pseudo psych analysis because I genuinely believe you are wrong (if you are a true flat earth believer - you seem to be using debate tactics of diverting the conversation and attacking that suggest you are not) - and if you are wrong and about to realize it, I guess I wanted to make clear that it makes sense this belief would be attractive, and I was trying not to demean you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can&#39;t blend debating the math and science of something with personal attacks, the personal attacks shine through like neon signs an the math falls into shadow because of it. </p>

<p>and so -- ok -- maybe you thought giving me an &quot;out&quot; &quot;hey you are just having fun -- I can get that&quot; was better, ... -- but you should realize now,  I hope you realize, it&#39;s still not a respectful approach --</p>

<p>,generally speaking there is a hailstorm of insult often in response - to saying -- I think the earth is flat. and if somebody can&#39;t take the profound step to say -- well that makes absolutely no sense to me -- but i&#39;m open to learning about ideas that make no sense to me, if that doesn&#39;t happen,  ----then the conversation is really hard. because there are prejudiced barriers. and it&#39;s exhausting -- for me. to be insulted while also discussing math and angles, etc. most people who think those who think about flat earth are stupid - think they get cart blanche to just be degrading about it -- and here you ( I believe you) genuinely felt you were making an improvement on that by giving me an understandable &quot;reason&quot; to believe it. and I can believe you you didn&#39;t see fault in that and cruelty was not your intent. but it is still dismissive and degrading. </p>

<p>and this unto itself is an issue . it is an issue that stands in way of discussing the math. to really really discuss ideas - for what they are -- you have to have an openness that the other person can be saying what they think for legitimate reasons. there is a necessary respect -- that must be the context -- for sharing these ideas. -- not a -- well maybe you are right , that&#39;s not even necessary  -- but just a -- respect - I genuinely do not know why you are saying what you are saying -- and I&#39;m going to wait for you to tell me rather than filling in that blank myself. an admission of not knowing. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve &quot;debated&quot;flat earth plenty, plenty. I don&#39;y find your arguments persuasive, but that&#39;s fine, we can disagree . I don&#39;t feel like debating with you because I don;t like your contentious approach, you have to like somebody enough -- to want to discuss these things openely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for your reply. my thought on volcanoes is -- </p>

<p>when I bake a pan of lasagna I see volcanoes at the surface as it cooks.  my roasting pan is flat. </p>

<p>I agree there must be a source of great heat beneath us. but I don&#39;t see a reason we  can&#39;t also be flat. </p>

<p>No I didn&#39;t, and in fact I&#39;ve never banned someone who breaks a rule in response to me personally.</p>

<p>Is there anything superior in you acting like a dickhead to strangers?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you start by providing the proofs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Coriolis Pendulum is a thing you go see.  A pilot&#39;s license is a thing you go get.</p>

<p>Geometric solutions to these problems are easy to find as a quick google search.  So I think my bullet points speak for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assumption. You believe that everyone speaking about the Flat Earth is working in conjunction to spread disinformation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  I believe that 99% of you are people who can&#39;t do basic math, and you are the Flat Earth Zombies (FEZ), you are the victims of Flat Earth Disinformation Operation (FEDO).</p>

<p>Most of the reason I want you censored instead of having a discussion is that every single one of you pretends that the burden of proof involves me writing you a mathematical document that duplicates what you could already find on the web.</p>

<p>Foucalt&#39;s Pendulum or Coriolis Pendulum is described here:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum</a></p>

<p>You can go to a museum and see one for yourself.</p>

<p>Great Circle Routes are also on wikipedia.  For $10k you can go get a pilot&#39;s license and find out for yourself what the shortest distance is between two points.  And you can also watch the level of the horizon recede as you climb.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to claim the burden of proof somehow falls on me to document all these already-documented things.  It does not.  You&#39;re perspective is a mental illness.</p>

<p>Wtf? First, ITT thread you think you have the right to post a link some ridiculous YouTube video, but netteshelm can&#39;t link to a wikipedia page?  Your bias is at facist levels, but good thing nobody is going to respect you.</p>

<p>Secondly, he did prove it.  He linked to a page with a series of <strong>experiments</strong> which confirm the Earth&#39;s rotation.  That&#39;s great!  He doesn&#39;t have to copy-and-paste it here, that <em>is</em> how he would prove it.  He would look up some experiments, and maybe either do them or go look at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice technique.  Always be on the offensive.  Rather than address any issues, you have to attack what I&#39;m saying. If you can&#39;t attack <em>what</em> I&#39;m saying, then you better attack <em>how</em> I&#39;m saying it. </p>

<p>This ensures that the other side is always on the defensive, and that the topic is continually shifting to new ways that you are attacking them.  Now, I wasn&#39;t particularly rude, I didn&#39;t call you stupid or anything like that, so you can&#39;t use the usual attack that &#39;that&#39;s not how you win people over.&#39;  So instead I&#39;m condescending, because I&#39;m analyzing why you think this - and comparing it to things that you say are &quot;notoriously less plausible.&quot;  </p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s insulting.  Why would you assume these things are less plausible? and say they are notoriously so? I&#39;d guess that most people would say flat earth is far less plausible than even bigfoot or loch ness (let alone aliens).  Does it matter what most people would say? It does, because you said &quot;notoriously&quot; which implies a public perception.  </p>

<p>Of course we have to consider the psychological desire to believe certain things.  If we fail to do that, we fail to be critical thinkers.  I may have a drive to believe I&#39;m a good person.  I have to recognize that bias if I&#39;m going to consider whether I actually am.  I may want to think I&#39;m not racist, and so I&#39;ll be biased to think my actions are not racially motivated - I&#39;d say I can&#39;t properly analyze those actions without knowing those biases. </p>

<p>I was just trying to point out that the fantastical can be alluring.  That is not prejudice.  Is it demeaning? Sure, I guess, in so far as actually believing in a flat earth is a fantasy.  It is a psychological mindset that requires ignoring or dismissing massive amounts of evidence to the contrary of your idea, convoluted explanations that get more absurd with every passing year, and then taking weird and convoluted facts to believe something. </p>

<p>It betrays itself as an exercise.  Some people online try to argue the impossible.  Then others take up the mantle - and use different argument techniques in online forums.  It&#39;s good practice I guess.  Someone calls you stupid, you attack them as not convincing, someone calls you &quot;kind of fun&quot; you attack them as prejudiced.  Always keep the other side off balance, always keep them defensive, make them try to prove something and move the goalposts if they do. </p>

<p>Honestly? It&#39;s appealing, it&#39;s a lark.  I genuinely feel bad for the true believers, because I believe they are trying desperately to find a feeling of significance and importance in a difficult world.  </p>

<p>But no flat earther can explain the sunset.  Not in forums I have searched, not in blogs I have read, not in youtube videos.  It demonstrates that this isn&#39;t about observed evidence, it&#39;s bout either </p>

<p>a) a type of social trolling, where people try to believe in, argue for or prove the impossible.  A type of mental thought experiment in action. </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>b) a psychological disorder rooted in a desperate search for &quot;something.&quot; Because we, as human beings, do seem to have a desire to find and believe in things.</p>

<p>or, I guess</p>

<p>c) a religious belief that cannot waiver.  Although I guess this could be categorized under &#39;b&#39;  </p>

<p>I was just saying, that if it&#39;s &quot;b&quot; - well, I get that, but there are better options.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.  I&#39;m saying that there are other things out there to believe, pursue, investigate and argue on behalf of.  </p>
