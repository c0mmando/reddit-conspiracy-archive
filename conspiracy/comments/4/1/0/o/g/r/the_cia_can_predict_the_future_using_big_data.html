<p>Here is some text so you don&#39;t have to click it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We have the ability to do more sense-making to provide for analysts a real ability to forecast,” said Hallman, quickly adding that forecasting, arriving at a better understanding of multiple probabilities, is fundamentally different from prediction. “We are gaining the ability to anticipate the conditions of change to determine if they are anomalies or areas to focus on. This directorate will bring focus to that anticipatory intelligence capability,” he says. “It’s often in the aggregate that we get an impression.” That’s particularly true of social media, which provides of course not only intelligence for specific operations—targeting this or that ISIS leader in Syria—but also taking the temperature of an entire population. It’s sentiment analysis on a massive, population-wide scale. “If you have time, you can develop insight into patterns,” with social media data, he says.</p>

<p>What does that mean? In describing how the directorate will provide anticipatory intelligence, Hallman highlighted a 2011 program sponsored by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency, or IARPA, called Open Source Indicators, or OSI. The goal was to “develop methods for continuous, automated analysis of publicly available data in order to anticipate and/or detect significant societal events, such as political crises, humanitarian crises, mass violence, riots, mass migrations, disease outbreaks, economic instability, resource shortages, and responses to natural disaster,” according to the IARPA Web site. In other words, the agency wanted to take massive amounts of publically available data from news reports, social networks and every other available open information source and paint a picture of some event that might occur of national security significance, like a revolution or an assassination, perhaps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black budget is secret. But if you want to pretend the government has oversight of 100% feel free. Not here to change your views or delusions. </p>

<p>Rumsfeld said they lost track of a trillion dollars. Announced very conveniently on 9/11/2001.</p>

<p>High frequency traders and hedge funds with also already do stuff like this on Wall Street. </p>

<p>Also there was controversy about an assassination betting/prediction market back around 2003. Look it up. </p>

<p>Insider trading happens everyday. It&#39;s just hard to prove and detect. It&#39;s usually informed on or intercepted during other investigations. </p>

<p>So yes, it can, does and will happen. If the three letter agencies want to make some quick cash for their black ops, they will. Like they give a flying fuck about what some politician in D.C. says. They&#39;re in on the scam anyway, they&#39;re exempt from prosecution. They&#39;re above the law. </p>
