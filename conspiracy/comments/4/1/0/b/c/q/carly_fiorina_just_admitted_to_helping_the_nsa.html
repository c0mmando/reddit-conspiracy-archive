        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am watching the second tier debates now on Fox. </p>

<p>She just flat out admitted that whenever she was at HP, she got an urgent phone call that was/is &quot;classified&quot; (she also said she wasn&#39;t going to say what it was concerning)from the NSA...and that she took diverted an entire shipment of HP computers that were already en route to retail outlets, and directed them to go to the NSA facility. Carly then wrapped the story up and tried to convey the premise of her having lots of experience in the technological sector when it comes to fighting and defeating terrorists. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure to the folks who are still &quot;asleep&quot;, that went right over their head. But to you guys, thoughts? It was quite a long time ago when she was at HP...if she was already in the know years ago when it came to the spying and surveillance, I find it hard to believe she is as much of an &quot;outsider&quot; as she tries to have the world believe.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been asleep longer than any of us have been alive. Seriously.  The US Govt. has been bought and controlled for at least a hundred years, probably more.  The enemy used to be foreign powers and so life in the country was great unless you were an enlisted man or drafted.  I think once the Berlin wall came down the enemy became the people of the US, of any country really, and the US had control of the globe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be monumentally stupid, if true. Why would she admit to doing something like that during a debate? Being that the NSA has been accused of committing corporate espionage I could see something like this being connected. It&#39;s more likely that shipment of computers was going to a company and not retail outlets.</p>
