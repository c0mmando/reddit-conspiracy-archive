       This stock market correction (crash) is on par with - if not worse than 2000 and 2008. Yet there are absolutely no articles about it on any subreddit. Frankly, this feels eerie.

       Yuppies these days have also bought into the long term dollar cost averaging methodology, which generally allows them to ignore the volatility without much worry. There's a lot of justification for that as well. But only time will tell if it remains a payable strategy.

       These banks control what goes in the papers... especially the Wall St. Journal. Do you really think Murdoch's WST is going to go and prepare people for the next major financial collapse, or do you think it's more likely that it'd all be kept quiet so investors don't panic and sell their shares of
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       ? Gotta keep monies in the market, then sell big at the last possible second. With sufficient insider trading information, of course.

       There's another factor to consider as well. Psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the MSM plays up the story, it affects the mass psychology of the public in a very negative way. They might not own huge portfolios, but in large numbers, a big sell-off by average investors could start a market crash.

       TPTB don't want the market to crash. Not just yet anyways.

       Yeah well, but still...silver is at a 5 year low. I'm holding at levels I bought when it was $21/oz. I'm looking at converting some cash to silver bars. Right now $14/oz is looking pretty good.

       I have numerous buddies who were buying silver when it was $5 an ounce. It got up to $15 and that's when I gave it serious consideration. I bought a hundred oz bar for $1,700. It rose in price to $27 an oz I bought another hundred oz bar for $2,900. It got to $40 an oz I bought my last bar at $4,200. I know I need to buy while the price has dropped to make up for losses I'm just a little beat up by it all.

       Could always just pull out of the market and leave it in a money market fund. O wait I heard they were going to gate those.. And they might go negative if the yield curve flattens anymore.

       I ran many numbers yesterday and couldn't find a scenario in which I should reduce or eliminate altogether my contributions to my traditional 401(k). It would take a monumental crash in order to give the money going into my account less value than if I were to add it back to my take-home pay. Do keep in mind, though, that my company contributes a default 3% of my salary in addition to a 50% match of anything I contribute up to 8%. So my 8% translates into 15%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, a monumental crash is not out of the question, and it wouldn't shock me. Being 30, there's enough recovery time ahead of me and my relatively small account that it wouldn't cripple me if it does. If I was much older and closer to retirement, you'd better believe I'd be making some changes, and fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've found is that the Roth IRA should actually be more profitable in the long run, for me, but I have to research it more. No matter what, any 401(k) is risky. I'm not at all comfortable with it yet. Returns have been poor lately, including a negative return since January 2015.

       Depending on what the rest of the economy does, that's not a huge nor a surprising figure. But once it gets moving there are quadrillions sloshing around out there in derivatives and other CDOs. They're like heads of the hydra lately with their acronyms and products.

       'the big short' is some fiction some satire but it gives you an idea of various perspectives which I think is important. There's no denying it's hugely complex with lots of different players and variables all doing different things with different goals.

       "This"? What do you mean by "this"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think it's over?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha! The stock market volatility you're seeing now is the very beginning of what's shaping up. Look at the collapse of oil prices. That happened 17 months before the 2008 crash. We're watching oil plummet now. So give it a few months. What we're experiencing now is the prelude. And it will be much,
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       bigger than what happened in 2008 (because the banks are so much more over-leveraged with derivatives). 2 Quadrillion worth. It's a problem of several orders of magnitude bigger than what happened in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me illustrate it for you. When you buy house insurance, you're not magically making the possibility of fire disappear; you're merely shifting the liability to another institution. If it burns, they pay out. Corporations can do this with futures contracts. Energy companies, for instance, might fear that oil prices will spike in a year, so they can go to a middle man [an investment bank like Goldman Sachs] and negotiate a contract to give them barrels of oil at a specific spot-price. Say $100/barrel. Goldman Sachs is the middle man, between the Energy Company and the Oil Producing nation [say, for instance, Saudi Arabia]. Goldman Sachs takes on the liability to itself, saying, "Saudi Arabia, no matter what the price of oil is in the future, I pledge to pay you $100 a barrel." Then they pass on the oil to the energy company at that price.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if the price of oil falls?
      </p>
      <p>
       Goldman Sachs still has to contractually pay Saudi Arabia $100 a barrel--even though now oil is $80 a barrel. Wait! $60 a barrel. Nope! $30 a barrel. Crap! It's poised to fall even lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though the new going-price of oil is $28 a barrel, Goldman Sachs is locked in by a futures contract [a
       <em>
        derivative
       </em>
       ] to pay $100 a barrel for what is now trading at $28.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning: They're taking a loss of $72 per barrel that they've negotiated to buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are currently 2 quadrillion dollars of these derivatives, and Goldman Sachs doesn't have the money to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're over-leveraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the contracts come due (as many are slated to this February) many institutions are going to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike 2008, it's so large that the Federal Reserve doesn't have enough money to bail them out. Currently, the derivatives market is bloated into a bubble that is something like 22 times larger than the entire net-income of all the countries on Earth--combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning: No government on Earth has enough to pay this debt off. Even if all of them got together and gave every cent they had [and taxed every citizen at 100%, and plundered all their pension funds] they wouldn't even come close.
      </p>

        Footnote: What we're watching is the result of central planning, and a socialized economy which has cut all ties to the Free Market. Socialism calls for Central Banks. [It's the 5th plank of the "Communist Manifesto," in case you were wondering.] Free countries didn't used to have central banks. The US didn't have one until 1913. So they're not necessary. Once you institute one, you start seeing distortions in the economy as central planners rig the system in a way you can't do in the free market. They inject cheap money into the system (by printing up more bank notes at massive rates), and this artificial inflation of the money supply creates bubbles. To be able to run an economy artificially, you have to keep many plates spinning at the same time. This is the Achilles heel of central planners. 10 economists don't have the computing power of 340 million Americans. Whereas individuals conducting their own affairs can do it efficiently because they're right there, it requires a scatter-shot approach when you're trying to micro-manage from 50,000 feet up in the air. Result? Inefficiency and incompetence. This happened when one part of the government did something that the other part didn't anticipate. This requires a moment of explanation: In the 1980s, Reagan brought down the Soviet Union by getting the OPEC nations to over-produce oil [thus artificially bringing its price down]. The Soviets, being dependent on oil sales, were suddenly caught off guard. To their dismay, revenue they were depending on from oil sales abruptly wasn't there. They went broke. In consequence, they collapsed. Trying to replicate this now with Russia and Iran, certain "economic hitmen" from the US wanted to pull an instant replay of the 1980s. The problem? Unlike in the 1980s, the derivatives contracts as they exist now were illegal. (It required certain changes ushered in by George W. Bush to allow them to take place.) So the financial system is more vulnerable now than it was in 1988. When the economic hitmen arranged for the collapse of oil prices in the modern era, they had no idea that this would take down institutions like Goldman Sachs. Oops! (This is the direct result of a rigged economy--and men not intelligent enough to coordinate it.)

       "The Communist Manifesto" was utopian insofar as Marx imagined some priest-class of disinterested angels acting as honest stewards of the nation's money, operating selflessly for the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is: Wherever centralization occurred, "selfless angels" were in short supply. As it turns out (if you study history) centralization has seldom been associated with freedom and equality, but has, on balance, been used more as a tool of oppression and theft. It means more money and power in fewer hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can bottleneck all commerce and revenue through a tiny elite, you can effectively maintain crushing control over the rest of a society. This is why despots always opt for centralization. In fact, they
       <em>
        require
       </em>
       it. It's their oxygen. Without it, they can't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        De-centralization,
       </em>
       by contrast, has always been the hallmark of freedom and shared power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why the United States was constructed on the de-centralization model. 50 different rules for 50 different states.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was because of the deep skepticism engendered by the corrupt centralized European states that Americans distrusted the very idea of a central bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Andrew Jackson fought against it, and abolished one of the first attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was so unpopular even a century later that the financiers had to hide the term, "central bank" at all. Hence the euphemism "The Federal Reserve". Note the absence of the term "bank" in there. That wasn't accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans did NOT want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I referred to before . . . check out Nomi Prins' "All the President's Bankers". She goes through the history of all this. Up until her book. I'd always thought that it was Woodrow Wilson who sold America out. In fact, it was Teddy Roosevelt. The construction of the Federal Reserve was well under way, even before Wilson came onto the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       America's economic stability before a central bank is a fascinating thing to study. We're taught today that inflation is just some accident of nature that "just happens". We're trained to think it's normal for prices to rise so radically from one generation to another. Most Americans are shocked when they learn that inflation on dry goods was zero from 1790 to 1912. In other words, when George Washington bought a loaf of bread in 1790 it was the same price as when Woodrow Wilson bought one in 1912. [See chart:
       <a href="http://ct.swaffers.net/net/swaffers/ct/image.axd?picture=2012%2F4%2FCPI-GDP_1790-present2.PNG">
        http://ct.swaffers.net/net/swaffers/ct/image.axd?picture=2012%2F4%2FCPI-GDP_1790-present2.PNG
       </a>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       That kind of price-stability is unheard of today (after the Fed has devalued the dollar by 97%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the Central Bank we never had "great depressions". 11-year long economic disasters. Most economic dips in America (when the Free Market reigned) would last 2-6 months, and the correction would end. Not this decade-long hell that the central banks triggered and presided over.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're watching our economy fall apart now precisely because of the money-printing of all the world's central banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collapse is NOT happening due to "The Free Market" or capitalism. But, rather, due to socialism and centrally-controlled economies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rigged systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       But watch as the economy falters, the typical chorus of "It's capitalism's fault. The only solution is MORE socialism!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When it was socialism's central banks that caused it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism has no such concept as "Too Big To Fail". That's socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       What essentially happened was socialism's distaste for consequences. Like the new fad of not having winners or losers in little league baseball games. Everyone just gets "participation awards". The same mindset was in play when large institutions behaved recklessly and were about to experience the consequences of their actions. In came the Fed to prop them up. "There didn't need to be any losers," so long as they "stimulated" the economy with more debt and money-printing. This caused bubbles. Domino effects from one sector to another.  Unforeseen consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Free Market, the reckless would perish--and stand as an example to the other institutions. A correction would take place naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the new system, the reckless are kept on life-support artificially at great cost to the rest of society. Like a limb with gangrene that a doctor refuses to amputate. If you keep a necrotic arm like that for long, the rest of the body will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what we're seeing today in the economy: Necrotic institutions who are drawing away resources from the productive sectors of the economy. Result? A widespread economic decline as money is being diverted from Main Street to Wall Street. Resources channeled away from companies that actually make things to speculators who have phony paper profits that implode like the current derivatives bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're watching is the failure of the central banks, and the weaknesses in an artificial [rigged] economy. The inherent danger might be equated to that of a time-traveler: So tempted to "fix" one event, he risks triggering the butterfly effect--whereby he sets off a chain reaction affecting a million other things, unwittingly. This does NOT happen in an organic system (which naturally self-regulates). It
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       , however, happen in an artificial system. (But, by God, the temptation exists for men to engage in central banking, just as it does in the heart of every little boy to time-travel . . . with the same disastrous ancillary consequences.)

       You can go to Youtube and catch Greg Hunter's financial reports. The 2 quadrillion in derivatives was from him (and about a dozen other sources). As for the particular spot-price on oil that Goldman Sachs negotiated before the price of oil dropped, the contracts differ from deal to deal. Goldman Sachs didn't just make the futures contracts with one sector or one company (for one price). They entered into these agreements with tons of different institutions (and nation-states). [In my parable, I used $100/per barrel as a generic example.] But the overriding message is: In almost all of these contracts, they failed to see the crash in oil prices . . . which has them on the hook for large sums of money--far larger than what their assets can handle to pay back when the contracts come to maturity. And these derivatives are for more than just oil. They miscalculated across a massive swath of commodities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why these securities were illegal for most of economic history (before the George W. Bush administration eased up regulation). Derivatives were far too volatile and risky. Then we changed the rules--and we're watching the results now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this presentation of Greg Hunter's from last year on the subject (where he mentions that the derivatives industry is
       <em>
        officially
       </em>
       at 1 quadrillion, although [even by last year] the real figure was about two-and-a-half quadrillion):

       Thanks! I thought most of the commodities and Oil futures had already unwound for the most part and no big shocks were coming from it.  I sure will not cry if Goldman goes belly up...except for the chaos it will cause around the world.

       Man, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know is that legislation was quietly passed a month or two ago to allow the banks to plunder the retirement funds and pensions of their depositors (to help offset the bank's losses). They're called "Bail-ins".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just reading Nomi Prins' "All the President's Bankers" and she mentioned that this happened right before the 1929 crash. Certain commercial banks were stealing their depositors' money and giving them worthless stock in the floundering bank as an I.O.U. The average depositor had around $200 in the bank at the time, so the banks would take their assets and give them a share worth $200--or so they were told. Because when they tried to redeem those stocks, no one would buy them for $200. Or $100. Or even $5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the banks came in, stole their depositors' money and exchanged it with worthless pieces of paper as they stumbled toward insolvency.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Europe, the new bail-in policies went into effect January 1, 2016:
       <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/january-1-2016-the-new-bank-bail-in-system-goes-into-effect-in-europe">
        http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/january-1-2016-the-new-bank-bail-in-system-goes-into-effect-in-europe
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article on new bail-in policies in America:
       <a href="http://sandiegofreepress.org/2015/01/the-bail-in-how-you-and-your-money-will-be-parted-during-the-next-banking-crisis/">
        http://sandiegofreepress.org/2015/01/the-bail-in-how-you-and-your-money-will-be-parted-during-the-next-banking-crisis/
       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: One of the new laws quietly enacted was a change in FDIC policy. No longer are a bank's depositors the first to be insured. Derivatives are now the #1 payee. If anything goes wrong, they get the money first. American depositors are now fourth on the list of people getting insurance money--which means that, effectively, they're getting nothing. Because the derivative liabilities are larger than the entire global economy. Neither the FDIC nor the Federal Reserve has enough money to cover the losses. So thanks to recent regulatory changes, depositors at commercial banks are no longer insured. You were quietly changed definitionally from a "depositor" to an "investor" in the bank, with subsequent legal ramification changes. Whereas "depositors" were protected; "investors" are not. And in US law, you are now listed as a "investor". So if the bank goes down, you're not covered. See here:

       Thank you, amazing post. This answered a lot of questions I had about the upcoming crash. My questions is this: What should I expect? Will all businesses fail and not be able to operate? Will most people lose their jobs? Will $100 cash only get me a loaf of bread? Is there an expected time for this to happen? Would it be in February, when these contracts come due? Is there even a possibility for the economy to recover?
      </p>

       EDIT: "Question" to "Questions", because I clearly have a fuck ton of questions.

       Holy shit. Good post. I have been thinking for a while, that things are really going south.. but I didn't realize just how bad it has got. This is going to ruin many countries.. pretty scary. I hate to think what would happen to the world if the US goes through another crash but without the means to rectify it. Guess we'll find out soon enough.

       I don't know who is behind it, but I'm sure it is part of the "Don't Panic" propaganda campaign that we see on teevee. People don't realize that their retirement funds constitute a significant portion of the stock markets.

       The fact is, the market sheds a lot of value pretty regularly. The people who do the best are those that ride it out. People who sold in 2008 never got their money back, on the other hand. There's tons of research on the best behavior in a market slide.

       Take a look at the radar. I'm wondering where the system is. Bit of rain in TX/LA and a small snow system in MO but nothing that looks like it will explode into this "blizzard for the ages". IMO, fear porn to prop up GDP sales and the market a bit.

       They could be right.  The biggest ones are usually Noreasters - mixing of cold air from the Arctic mixing with the warm waters and swirling up the coast.  That being said, they usually over inflate the accumulation #s for some reason.

       The numbers say we're headed for recession or worse. There are hardly any write ups on it because the obedient MSM isn't saying a word about it. They are just trying to keep their audience from looking up from the grass they graze upon.

       The most interesting part in the oil debate for me is questioning Saudi Arabia &amp; OPEC's motives in pumping more. Am I really supposed to believe that they're at war with American fracking? My belief is that OPEC is battling to remain the top power source for the next three or four decades.

       In 2007-2008 the Dow dropped by nearly 46%. To match that kind of collapse today we'd need to see the Dow drop to, like, 9500 or so. So far the current correction looks pretty much like the one we had in September last year, and no even seems to remember that one...

       Who exactly is "they?" I'm subscribed to a lot of stock market and investing subreddits and everyone is talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are happy about this; smart investors can make money by shorting and trading options spreads that profit in market downturns. Also, seeing as we just had a mini crash this summer, investors aren't exactly caught off guard this time. Many might have positioned themselves in such a way to decrease their exposure to China's market turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally trade options only and I love this current market. I'm making trades to capitalize on high volatility. Long investors see this as a buying opportunity.

       While I agree with most of what you are saying, I'd like to call out the attempt to blame China's market for this. America has some serious problems of its own and we have no one else to blame. Our unemployment is crazy high (even though the government numbers want you to think different). Our housing and new construction markets are fluctuating like viral videos on the internet. Manufacturing and Trade is at a near stand still. And how long can the petrodollar really hold its own with oil prices this rock bottom?

       By "they", he means the entities that control the media. Their interest is to control the narrative so that even in times of chaos, the market can be manipulated to move as "they" please.

       Sure, you can stand to gain in any market, up or down. That's great for you. But we are more concerned about the concerted effort among MSM to blind us from the truth and always "look on the bright-side of things". Just turn on CNBC, it's a joke.

       I mean, "they" can pump whatever narrative they want. That happens all the time. Some people say we're fine, it's a normal correction. Some say it's doomsday. Regardless, one of the cardinal sins of investing is listening to anyone else. At the end of the day it's the investors that create the market.

       Seriously. It's like no one here has talked to their financial adviser at all. Oh wait, you mean most people here don't have one and are talking out of their ass? Who would've thunk it!

       LOL you're kidding yourself if you think you have access to the trading and market information that a Fidelity manager does. And for a fee of less than 1% of my returns when I don't have to do anything and gain 8% each year? Yeah, you can keep your passive income.. I'll stick with my FA any day :P

       You do know what the ROI was from the market in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, when people became millionaires, right? 10%.

       Welcome to the club, but I still have one because I am interested in learning when/what/how to invest. This is actually one of the best times to dump money into the market as long as you do it through a balanced and smart portfolio. As someone in their mid-20's it gets me excited I might be able to get in when the markets are at one of their lowest points.

       What does your financial adviser tell you? I've got my IRA in a Vanguard target date fund and I made a three fund portfolio on my 401K using the lowest cost funds available to me. It wasn't that hard and all of the information to do it was available for free online. I don't see the purpose of a financial adviser unless you have a lot of money.

       Luckily my dad is able to get me with his Fidelity adviser since they have some strange family plan now, but I need to have at least 25k in play. They completely manage my money and the fee is negligible/minimal. After all the research I've done and all the financial experts and advisers I've consulted this is the best course for long-term monetary growth. If I didn't have this available to me though I would literally be doing what you are in verbatim. Vanguard is amazing and your plan is a healthy one, but Fidelity honestly right now is king.

       Since at least the mid 1980s, when I first got into following conspiracy stuff (and it wouldn't surprise me if people who have been into it longer were hearing it well before that).

       It is comical reading the "experts" interpreting the market day by day. Of course it is in their best interest to tell people that it's not a big deal. Confidence is key when dealing with the stock market. I also feel like there are globalists pulling strings at the top keeping the bottom from falling out completely until they are want it too. I don't believe the market has ever been this volatile. Up and down thousands of points in just a few weeks.

       dumbasses, dont panic "propaganda" isnt propaganda, its a literal fact that a crash only turns to an economic disaster when the majority who are represented in stock prices back out of the mysterious game of wall street. them saying stay in there is literally the only way to prevent it. i cant see how what is currently happening can be compared to mortgage bonds and rating fraud unless its a general economic climate change which will be slow, but steadily, climbing back to normalcy and potentially higher. but you never asked me about stocks in general, which is just a made up game of bullshit.

       When people think something's wrong, if they are told that nothing is wrong, they take it as a confirmation that something is indeed wrong and that the "nothing's wrong" talk is just an attempt at keeping people under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, if nothing is wrong at all about a situation that might look bad at first glance, of course you'll hear "stay calm, everything's fine".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the current stock market situation is good or bad, I'm just saying that assuming that something's wrong because we're being told everything is fine is plain retarded. Yet a third of the comments on here are basically that.

       It's not that bad yet. We've had a couple crashes this bad between 2009 and now. The dip this past August was about as bad as where we are now. Give it another 5-10% and people will start talking.

       I would never invest into the market.I don't live for money,money will mever control me.My life is pretty simple,i dont want for anything.We own our cars &amp; house free of debt by hardwork.
People are too over leveraged today,trying to play stocks so they can try &amp; get out of debt,until the corrections start,and they lose alot.
By all means,go play with imaginary numbers,but i will never risk it

       I received a payout for my back injury late last year(im australian),the missus wanted to play stocks,but i took what i was payed out &amp; payed out every debt we (my car &amp; our house).
Now debt free at 34 yrs old.
I got hit pretty hard in 08/09 with my super fund,lost over 28k,lost my job(CSG Driller).
I have always been very cautious with money,never wanted to risk the stocks as i dont know anything about it,and being that i have always had very high paying jobs(100k + AUD),never wanted for more.

       Not my first,lost 28k in 08/09 from my Super fund,also lost my job(im Aussie).
I think the market is waaaay over due for a proper coreection,without the PPT saving the day,or more QE.Shit needs to get normal.You have all these companies(facebook,etc),that don't actually produce anything physical,but are worth Billions on paper.
The US economy started dying the day it took itself off the gold standard,and went to Petrodollar.Hell,here in Australia,the last decade,both sides of Goverment have hedged all our futures on the mining boom with China,and look what is happening now-China is slowly sinking,Mines have closed everywhere,bulk layoffs the last 3 yrs,et al.
Sure,we have all heard "the collapse is coming!the collapse is coming!",but,i feel there is going to be a very large correction market wise in the next 18 months

       But seriously, I've only really seen talk about the state of the Russian economy each time there's news about the DOW or Chinese stock market dropping.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments always seem to ignore the context that Russia has been placed under unilateral sanctions - for what? The past two years now? - I mean if anything, Russia's two years ahead of the rest of the world in terms of fixing their economy, but nothing seems to make people feel better than comparing the situation at home to what's
       <em>
        purportedly

       Pretty much nothing, if you were smart enough to leave your diversified portfolio alone with only minor adjustments. Pulling out in a panic was foolish. Most people recovered all their "lost" money in just a couple of short years and then some.

       The only reason the market "recovered" is because the Federal Reserve printed an unprecedented amount of money. The fact that they stopped QE is precisely why the bubble is collapsing. Tell me, once this market craters, how will they blow the next bubble?

       I don't know who is behind it, but I'm sure it is part of the "Don't Panic" propaganda campaign that we see on teevee. People don't realize that their retirement funds constitute a significant portion of the stock markets.

       "The Communist Manifesto" was utopian insofar as Marx imagined some priest-class of disinterested angels acting as honest stewards of the nation's money, operating selflessly for the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is: Wherever centralization occurred, "selfless angels" were in short supply. As it turns out (if you study history) centralization has seldom been associated with freedom and equality, but has, on balance, been used more as a tool of oppression and theft. It means more money and power in fewer hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can bottleneck all commerce and revenue through a tiny elite, you can effectively maintain crushing control over the rest of a society. This is why despots always opt for centralization. In fact, they
       <em>
        require
       </em>
       it. It's their oxygen. Without it, they can't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        De-centralization,
       </em>
       by contrast, has always been the hallmark of freedom and shared power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why the United States was constructed on the de-centralization model. 50 different rules for 50 different states.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was because of the deep skepticism engendered by the corrupt centralized European states that Americans distrusted the very idea of a central bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Andrew Jackson fought against it, and abolished one of the first attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was so unpopular even a century later that the financiers had to hide the term, "central bank" at all. Hence the euphemism "The Federal Reserve". Note the absence of the term "bank" in there. That wasn't accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans did NOT want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I referred to before . . . check out Nomi Prins' "All the President's Bankers". She goes through the history of all this. Up until her book. I'd always thought that it was Woodrow Wilson who sold America out. In fact, it was Teddy Roosevelt. The construction of the Federal Reserve was well under way, even before Wilson came onto the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       America's economic stability before a central bank is a fascinating thing to study. We're taught today that inflation is just some accident of nature that "just happens". We're trained to think it's normal for prices to rise so radically from one generation to another. Most Americans are shocked when they learn that inflation on dry goods was zero from 1790 to 1912. In other words, when George Washington bought a loaf of bread in 1790 it was the same price as when Woodrow Wilson bought one in 1912. [See chart:
       <a href="http://ct.swaffers.net/net/swaffers/ct/image.axd?picture=2012%2F4%2FCPI-GDP_1790-present2.PNG">
        http://ct.swaffers.net/net/swaffers/ct/image.axd?picture=2012%2F4%2FCPI-GDP_1790-present2.PNG
       </a>
       ]
      </p>
      <p>
       That kind of price-stability is unheard of today (after the Fed has devalued the dollar by 97%).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the Central Bank we never had "great depressions". 11-year long economic disasters. Most economic dips in America (when the Free Market reigned) would last 2-6 months, and the correction would end. Not this decade-long hell that the central banks triggered and presided over.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're watching our economy fall apart now precisely because of the money-printing of all the world's central banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collapse is NOT happening due to "The Free Market" or capitalism. But, rather, due to socialism and centrally-controlled economies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rigged systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       But watch as the economy falters, the typical chorus of "It's capitalism's fault. The only solution is MORE socialism!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When it was socialism's central banks that caused it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism has no such concept as "Too Big To Fail". That's socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       What essentially happened was socialism's distaste for consequences. Like the new fad of not having winners or losers in little league baseball games. Everyone just gets "participation awards". The same mindset was in play when large institutions behaved recklessly and were about to experience the consequences of their actions. In came the Fed to prop them up. "There didn't need to be any losers," so long as they "stimulated" the economy with more debt and money-printing. This caused bubbles. Domino effects from one sector to another.  Unforeseen consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Free Market, the reckless would perish--and stand as an example to the other institutions. A correction would take place naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the new system, the reckless are kept on life-support artificially at great cost to the rest of society. Like a limb with gangrene that a doctor refuses to amputate. If you keep a necrotic arm like that for long, the rest of the body will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what we're seeing today in the economy: Necrotic institutions who are drawing away resources from the productive sectors of the economy. Result? A widespread economic decline as money is being diverted from Main Street to Wall Street. Resources channeled away from companies that actually make things to speculators who have phony paper profits that implode like the current derivatives bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're watching is the failure of the central banks, and the weaknesses in an artificial [rigged] economy. The inherent danger might be equated to that of a time-traveler: So tempted to "fix" one event, he risks triggering the butterfly effect--whereby he sets off a chain reaction affecting a million other things, unwittingly. This does NOT happen in an organic system (which naturally self-regulates). It
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       , however, happen in an artificial system. (But, by God, the temptation exists for men to engage in central banking, just as it does in the heart of every little boy to time-travel . . . with the same disastrous ancillary consequences.)
