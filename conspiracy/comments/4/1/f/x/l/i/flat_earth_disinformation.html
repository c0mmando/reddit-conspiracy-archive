       Maybe different people get different holograms.  It seems round to me.  But even my own two eyes when I cover one, I see color shades differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be being promoted as disinfo, but the idea itself never died.  I tdon't think we have any credibility.  But perhaps the ability to change the thoughts of people close to us.  And even that is hard.

       I don't thinks so. Every scientific experiment is repeatable, the outcome will be the same, so if there is a hologram, it's homogeneous.

       I agree experiments are repeatable.  The dual slit experiment is a bit of an anomaly though.  Couple that with Schrodinger's cat.  And reality is in an undefined state until each of us observes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think parts are shared, parts aren't.  I don't know that a proper word has been coined for that.  Hologram is as close as I have at the moment, but it fits.  Holograms appear different from different angles, but two people looking at it would share some likeness in what they perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would also be true looking at two different holograms in the same spot.  Parts would match.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that's how it is.  I'm just thinking.

       I'm interested in this "different" holograms notion. You think some people, maybe because they have been conditioned and lack the ability to break out, think the world is flat/round just because other people say so, when in "reality" it's nothing, and it is what you make it. Is that close?

       Actually that "different" holograms was a shot from the hip.   But yes to your question I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plato's allegory of cave says basically once you've been presented with one reality for some period of time, any other reality could be yelling in your ear and you won't hear it.  Way paraphrased there, but that's the gist of it as I understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us do make it out of the reality that's presented to us and discover and are able to accept new things even when it means we've been wrong our whole lives.  Some truly cannot.  I don't know where that in/ability comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think some elements of reality that we all experience are shared experiences.  But we all experience them differently through our own filters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that a completely objective reality exists.  Is your view of the world happening if you are no longer here to perceive it?
      </p>
      <p>
       When every person dies a whole world dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       To some degree we are the creator.  See Schrodinger's cat.  If I understand that correctly.

       Your view of it is quite refreshing, and similar to my own. I make up stories and games in my head, regarding what happens with other people, society, history etc, their mine and nobody else's. If people understood this and respected each other's differences (and paid attention to the similarities) we would be much better off.

       Just take a look at the original "Flat Earth Society." The Flat Earth Society promoted two ideas:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The earth is flat (an absurdity that only uneducated hicks believe.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Moon Landing was faked.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The entire purpose was to ridicule the people suggesting that NASA faked the Moon Landing by pairing it with something long known to be false, the idea that the earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see the exact same thing with the 9/11 truth movement. The evidence shown by the 9/11 Truth movement gets paired with nonsense like Judith "Space Beams" Wood.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Jim Fetzer did this quite specifically: he started the group Scholars for 9/11 Truth and invited serious scholars like David Ray Griffin. Then, Fetzer started promoting disinformation like Judith Wood in order to discredit the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the serious truthers like Griffin immediately distanced themselves from Fetzer's disinformation.

       Im not a flat earth guy, but I been thinking. What if it were possible to dig a stright line through the earth, at what point do u start digging up and not down? Surley when u emerge on the other side you wont be upside down.

       There is an example I learned from physics.
Let's say there was a hole from one point that lead straight to a hole  opposite side of the world. 
You jump into the hole.
You would fall straight to the center and once you pass the center you are actually "flying" up to the opposite hole.
But you will at most barely make it out of the hole.
You then will fallback in and travel back the other way. This will happen multiple times, each time loosing more and more kinetic energy.
In the end you will just end up right at the center of the earth, having lost all kinetic energy.
Similarly to how a bouncy ball will bounce up and down, but less high at each bounce until it no longer bounces.
The reason you would end up at the center of the earth is because it's the point where gravity cancels out .

       What are you blind?!?!? Look strait and you will see the earth is flat. Duhhhh. Plus when u walk its not up or down hill. The bible doesnt lie and it says in the bible that its promised if you have faith you will be given eternal life with god and its promised.  Man what up with people not believing the bible its the most accurate history/science and guide for life ever created. Gesh give me your address so I can mail you pamphlet s on god and a bible all you have to do is read it and have unwavering faith. Just send me your money and what you give you will recieve back 20 times what you gave hurry while god is feeling generous.

       Mountains of madness and the Elder ones are part of H.P. Lovecraft's lore, but I think you may know that.

      <p>
       An interesting theory to stir in with that recipe.  That great minds, artists, and thinkers tune into the great song around us.
And they bring glimpses, sounds and words to us that are happening out of our perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have thought this is how Einstein and Tesla worked.  If lovecraft did... I'm scared, great horror.

       A story by H.P. Lovecraft.  At the Mountains of Madness.  He wrote the Cthulu mythos.  It's a good frightening read.  Kinda along the lines of John Carpenter's The Thing.  Which many people consider one of the most frightening movies.

       I don't remember where I saw or read about Tesla, And Einstein being able to let's say tune into the science/math song.  But I can certainly speak a bit for musicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       When making music on the fly, or when jamming with other musicians somehow/sometimes you get tune into something larger than yourself.  I remember The Black Crows calling it the great song.  You can make changes on the go to a song that's never never been played along with 5 other guys and all know what you're about to do.  It's incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music is kind of audible math or physics.  It's pitches and beats based in numbers.  The numbers work, or it's sour.  If a note is out of tune, a beat off step, you're gonna hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be a bit of a stretch to extrapolate that to writers and scientists and such, but it seems reasonable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smarter/dumber is somewhat subjective.  Some of the dumbest people I know are way happier than I am.  That sounds smart to me.  Was Einstein smarter than let's say any masterful musician, or painter, or anyone really.  We've all got our radio dials tuned to the station that's coming in the strongest.  But some of us spin the dial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our mind and senses are allowing us to experience what we are experiencing.  These are basically filters that decide what we are perceiving.  What are these filters not able to bring us?  I think there's more happening all around us than is imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some get pieces of the unimaginable to bring to the rest of us because their filters are different.  Plato, Socrates, Jesus if that's your guy, anybody.  Some people are able adjust their filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just kinda some ideas I've found may way to in 40 years.
As far a reading, maybe Terrence McKenna or Alan Watts.  With doses of Hunter S. Thompson, and Vonnegut.  Take chemicals and cartoons as needed for pain.

       I would say it depends on the drugs and the user.  I've had pretty great experiences with a lot of drugs.  But with alcohol I have no off switch, and have come close to destroying myself.

       All of the arts would be missing some great stuff without drugs, but I'm sure we lost great stuff as well.

       There's a book called "The City of Dreaming Books" (or "Die Stadt der Träumender Bücher" in original German) by Walter Moers. It's about a city of books, and a book-loving poet goes there for a visit. Adventure happens, and eventually he connects with "Das Orm", the cosmic muse that inspires all great authors and poets, and probably artists of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some authors are able to reach it regularly, others never can, and still others find it just once and spend the rest of their lives in fruitless pursuit after this fickle metaphysical space, only to die exhausted and alone, with just a single great work left for posterity.

       My personal headcanon regarding this book is that the story is autobiographical: the author achieved contact with the Orm, then wrote a book about it, replacing himself with a dinosaur with vestigial wings, and describing his metaphysical journey through mediocrity and depression metaphoricaly, as a physical journey through the underworld below the city of books. The book is so good it's clearly inspired by the cosmic muse, so this actually makes sense.

       Fuck, I'd forgotten about that book. My thoughts about Scribe 2 revolve (among other things) around the role of the Muse of writing in Scribe-world, not least because of my experiences with Scribe 1. Now I need to read/finish reading dSdTB...

       Hahaha, at this point it seems unlikely. I've got a stew of different elements going, including a competing religion, a foundational tale for the Church, a war story, a war and its politics, and all these things seem to revolve around the afore-mentioned Muse. The actual shape of the story is still a bit of a mystery, but that's fine because my active project is actually Dragongate.

       A new chapter of that is almost done — it took a while and I ended up rewriting most of it from another perspective before it made sense. "Always select the POV of the character with the most agency" is my new rule of thumb.

       My theory is that the energy of our experiences recombine into a whole. Something out of reach to most. Can't say i'll know until i'm dead though.

       Weird thing is, almost every religion has some sort of connected practice or passages on this concept, which emerged on all continents at different times, remote places that probably hadn't been connected even though they share some similarities in mythos or certain customs.

       I hadn't heard the term divine spark, but that's it.  We try to find ways to express this to each other.  I don't know that we completely can.  The expression falls short, gets messed up and misconstrued.  But I think that helps teach us compassion and love.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all sounds way hippie, but you're right.  That divine spark, great song, science, stories, is us experiencing ourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cool when that idea resonates with someone.  Thanks man

       No problem, i appreciate the discussion. Hadn't heard of it as the great song and it's a facet i'll look into.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could go into more detail about what you've experienced with musicians, i'd be willing to make a mental note of it for my future discussions with others. It's not a conversation i have often, once, twice a year i'll find someone.

       I'll try.  I think everybody has experienced it with someone and even alone.  Anytime you're thinking  and being creative.

       Sometimes I can sit there with my guitar for hours and not be able to make anything sound right.  Sometimes I can pick it up and pull sounds out of it and just be baffled that I made them.  Strait dialed into the void.  Call that whatever you like, inspiration, mood, reception.  It's even more potent with other people.
      </p>

       Picture yourself at a festival seeing a band no ones ever heard before with 100,000 people, and they are just rockin, raining down the song, everyone's dancing to it an knows where it's going even though they've never heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's in all of us.

       Freddy Mercury finds the song with 100,000 people.  One of the most powerful things I've seen, I'd argue in all history.  There's math and physics, and fairy tales, and religion in that.
      </p>

       I have been fortunate to have two brothers to improv jam and make music with since I was a kid.  We play maybe once a year, it's never the same thing, but we play it, and it jams.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same as dancing, or working out math problems, or science questions with someone.  It's a game or ride or song we're all trying to teach each other or play together.  And sometimes you get dialed into the juice and you can't help it, and everyone knows it.  I know I've had people dialed in have to show me how to step back into it many times.

       I agree experiments are repeatable.  The dual slit experiment is a bit of an anomaly though.  Couple that with Schrodinger's cat.  And reality is in an undefined state until each of us observes it.

       I think parts are shared, parts aren't.  I don't know that a proper word has been coined for that.  Hologram is as close as I have at the moment, but it fits.  Holograms appear different from different angles, but two people looking at it would share some likeness in what they perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would also be true looking at two different holograms in the same spot.  Parts would match.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that's how it is.  I'm just thinking.
