    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, how many conspiracies have there been throughout history again? Like thousands? </p>

<p>Any student of history knows conspiracies are obviously in fair play, so it seems reasonable to theorize about them happening before we know about them, since collusion among the upper echelon is so common. Conspiracy theories are useful. </p>

<p>What&#39;s not useful is buying in to every single conspiracy you come across. That&#39;s the image of the &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist&quot; I think many ignorant people have in their minds, thanks to the CIA apparently. </p>

<p>This is a problem with packaged ideologies that contain many ideas, as if &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was a blanket ideology or descriptor of one&#39;s disposition because they have the audacity to suggest that corporations and government might be colluding to screw regular people. Packaged ideologies are something I talked about in my article yesterday here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/414xqf/spreading_unheard_truths_is_far_more_important/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/414xqf/spreading_unheard_truths_is_far_more_important/</a></p>

<p>Then people don&#39;t want to be &quot;one of those people&quot; so they limit themselves from asking questions that are very important. They choose not to learn because of fear, given to them by social pressures which are created and highlighted through the media. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Between you starting this thread and my post around 5000 people starved to death, quite avoidable if we wouldn&#39;t struggle to preserve a system of self-benefit totally unfair to those who haven&#39;t been lucky enough to be born in a first world country. </p>

<p>Are we raging psychopaths or do we just conveniently look the other way? If you look at your own life would it seem incomprehensible to value the financial well-being of yourself higher than the well-being of some poor bastard you will never know?</p>

<p>The only difference between us and &quot;those in power&quot; is that we are a tad bit more helpless and slightly poorer - but if our daily life is a measure we wouldn&#39;t be any better. </p>

<p>Even within the USA we tend to ignore those we are living of less than 10000$ a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that they&#39;re ignorant, it&#39;s that much of the stuff posted here doesn&#39;t really have any evidence going for it.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist is a derogatory label for someone who doesn&#39;t require much evidence before he believes something. Many people here hate the &quot;authority&quot; so much they&#39;ll simply upvote anything that says it&#39;s bad - without even bothering to read the source, check the facts, etc. They shove garbage in people&#39;s faces and are surprised when they don&#39;t accept it as gourmet. </p>

<p>On some topics, you can&#39;t even question without being called a shill and told there is no reason for debate - because everyone already knows &quot;in their heart&quot; that xyz is true. </p>

<p>It&#39;s rather irritating, and why many conspiracy theorists will never be taken seriously by the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that it&#39;s even easier to just believe what the TV says? Your kind never get enough criticism. </p>

<p>Braindead, bootlicking followers don&#39;t require <em>any</em> evidence to believe something as long as it&#39;s on the TV. They are so ignorant and slow that they cannot imagine that something on the TV could be false.</p>

<p>When I think of the opposite of a conspiracy theorist, I picture a drugged-up halfwit who enjoys being lied to and is too scared to venture outside of the comfortable mental prison they were given. You could probably steal money right out of this person&#39;s wallet in front of them and they wouldn&#39;t believe it if two people were involved in the theft. </p>

<p>I might be a conspiracy theorist, but at least I&#39;m not a gullible, lobotomized moron.</p>
