       You should book a one way ticket and go live in Somalia TODAY.  You'd be so happy away from civilized society.  Think about it: no taxes, guns of all types, enhanced castle doctrine, never feel shamed into sharing or cooperating with others, live your dream of being a warlord, etc.  Seriously, you'd be so happy.

       Are we better off now than under british rule?  You think you are free?  You live under true authoritarian fascism (corporatism) right now.  Take your rose-colored "muh founding fathers" fantasy somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if obeying the british crown means getting affordable healthcare and not having to pay 100 grand for a broken arm, then hell yes Ill obey the crown instead of this corporatist bs we currently have.

       <strong>
        so
       </strong>
       much to students that I'm not sure your complaint can or should even be addressed. As far as teaching subservience, following school rules is easy and it's quite a stretch to say that they're harmful.

       Depends on the county and sometimes state(sex ed laws). For the most part yeah, public schools are pretty damn good and offer a lot. At my high school they had an excellent advanced math program and would cover tuition at the local university if you wanted to take Calc 3 your senior year.
However, there are also a lot of cities, such as Detroit, where the public schools are understaffed, underfunded, and aren't capable of all their students for college.

       as a libertarian it occurs to me that there is no libertarian global warming solution. Im so glad that our government is in control instead. By giving tax subsidies to oil producers, the animal agriculture industry and auto manufacturers I am confident we will stop this mess.

       Libertarians believe in minimal government involvement in basically everything. That means no subsidies for basically anything. Without subsidies, no industries have a natural advantage over the others. Without natural advantages, the free market will function the way its supposed to. Unsubsidizing the coal and oil industry won't immediate delete their advantage over every other industry in the entire world, but its a start. Shit, its leagues ahead of anything the Democrats and Republicans plan to do.

       Social security is a fucking ripoff man. They take 15% of your paycheck that you could use for insurance, to save and invest how you want, start your own business, etc. If you're a normal W-2 worker you pay 7.5% and your employer pays 7.5%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out this Chicago Tribune article that spells out how Social Security just isn't worth it for anyone:
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-201512241600--tms--savagectnts-a20151224-20151224-column.html">
        http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-201512241600--tms--savagectnts-a20151224-20151224-column.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't realize you pay 30-50%+ of your income in taxes. In a Libertarian world, you would be keeping a MUCH larger percentage of your income. Save it. Give it to family to support them (elderly care). Donate it to charities (conservatives give more to charity on average even if they are poor). People wouldn't NEED to beg the government for their money back to help them in a Libertarian world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the example of JUST removing Social Security, not even the entire swath of other useless programs or agencies that waste our money. If you make $25,000 per year and work for 40 years, You will have made $1 million. Social Security takes 15% of that (if SS didn't exist your employer would be paying you that 7.5% they match instead of the government). At retirement you'd have $150,000 in the bank if you never invested a penny. It's HUGE.

       You're right. I should be more clear. Government shouldn't subsidize
       <em>
        industry

       . Government has no place in business,
       <em>

       in a free market.

       Well ideally, you're right but we saw what happened when we left it up to corporations to run themselves in the 1800s and early 1900s.
If presented with the chance, industries will do anything they can to save a buck including the dumping toxic waste into a field, lake, or river. There would probably be extreme poverty as well if corporations had free reign through the outsourcing of anything the could while still owning the means of production.

       You missed his point though. He's not an anarchist. Libertarians aren't anarchists. If we were anarchists, we'd be the Anarchist party. We're Libertarians. We believe in liberty.

       His point is that while no one really has a
       <em>
        plan
       </em>
       for
       <em>
        defeating
       </em>
       global warming, the Democrats and Republicans who have deeply corrupted the government are actively pursuing the practices that got us here in the first place. Attacking a Libertarian with a question like "What's your party's solution for global warming?" Is like attacking a Democrat or Republican with "How do you plan to achieve world peace in your first 4 years?" No one has a plan for that. Its such a large problem that everyone will have to be on board to fixing essentially everything that we habitually do as a society that got us in this mess. At least Libertarians are advocating for the idea that government
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       put money directly towards an industry that perpetuates global warming more than anything on the planet.

       have a plan; switch to renewables. Spend the couple trillion to build a hydrogen cell infrastructure all over the US, with the solar/water/wind/geothermal plants to run it. It'd only cost us about 3/4 an Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell we could start with the major trucking, shipping and rail lines and building that infrastructure would create tons of jobs, plus boost our economy and help along technologies by seeing what works best/breaks down while getting rid of the biggest segment of polluters.

       It's totally doable, you just have to spell out to the military contractors that they're doing civilian work now...you can still have Lockheed manufacture the wind farm turbine blades, you can still give General Dynamics the machining contracts for the Geothermal plants. And when its' done, instead of a war-ravaged hellhole and a generation of terrorists from same, you have an infrastructure to last our country a lifetime.

       If you actually believe global warming is a man-made imminent threat, then the LAST thing any rational person would want to do is increase the size of government. The US federal government is the biggest single polluter on the planet, and why would it give a fuck? It steals $3 trillion per year from people and gets away with borrowing another $1 trillion. Nothing about government is efficient. Obama going to Africa takes 100 cars a few planes and hundreds of people to go tell poor people they'll never be able to use air conditioning because fuck them, while he produced more greenhouse gases in that trip than they would with a lifetime of air conditioning.

       Disbanding the largest net carbon emitter in the world right off the bat might be a good move I guess. Statists should really not use this one as an example, so few of you actually realise the carbon footprint of your cherished institutions. It's a little sad really.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's this rhetorical sleight of hand which the argument ventured here always fails to grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) The climate is changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Global warming is a constant and increasing thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) It's primarily caused by greenhouse gases.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Which are mostly anthropogenic co2 emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       E) In fact, solely anthropogenic co2 emissions, because this is the only thing which we can venture that humans have control over and thus make useful as a power lever on the rest of humanity, despite anthropogenic co2 emissions consisting of less than 5% of the total.
      </p>
      <p>
       F) Therefore the states of the world must unite and impose authoritarian controls on global anthropogenic co2 emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       G) This is the only possible solution to this extremely important problem, and it is not at all an attempted lever to get more power for the states.
      </p>
      <p>
       These all get bundled up into a neat little package and thrown at anyone daring to question any one of them, ranging from most to least credible in order, as if any single point was in fact equal to all of them, all the while seemingly totally unaware that the largest net emitters of co2 in the world are all state organisations. It's like putting the informal alcoholics anonymous relapse committee in charge of regulating the net intake of society's alcohol, because alcoholism is such a scourge.

       Speaking of rhetorical leight of hand, I gotta give it up for "Global warming's not a problem, and even if it was, it'd be the government's fault." Clearlthe answer is to replace governmental services with several competing companies trying to fill the vacuum left, that'd knock those emissions down for sure!

       It's funny that in a post where I point out that having differing opinions on the separate issues raised is always equated into a single heresy, I get accused of that exact heresy. Thank you for making my point for me so forcefully by example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I think it may very well be a problem, as I said, most to least credible, the point at which I switch from thinking there may be something to it (despite problems with things above this, like the proportion of anthropogenic to natural co2, co2 as a proportion of greenhouse emissions in net, the long pause in the data for actual global warming, potential solar activity contributions,  etc. Despite all that, from the perspective of evaluating the problem, just ignoring it is a bad gamble IMHO) and laughing my ass off at it as the point at which the proposed solution is more power to the state, the exact organisation that most heavily contributes to the exact problem being painted as putting all of humanity in such dire straits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real, actual solution is likely to be alternative energy, whether that be traditional renewables like Solar and wind solely or supplemented with advanced nuclear fission, thorium fission, or nuclear fusion going forward once the technical hurdles can be cleared.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of focusing on this humanity seems intent on focusing on carbon emissions quotas and cap and trade and other ways for the states of the world to lever their power more rather than actually finishing the problem once and for all, which of course is exactly what you'd expect if it was about increasing the power of the state, rather than solving the actual problem.

       Dude that argument is fucking idiotic. The anxiety and question about global warming isn't about the earth warming. Of course the earth has warmed before. It's about the earth warming with us on it. Yes the earth has been warmer you moron,  the earth was at one point a completely molten rock. Guess what though, there were no humans alive on it at that time were there now?

       Humans have never caused this drastic of climate change , and it's only going to get worse and that's just a fact.

       There have been ice ages and warming periods before human industrialization. What evidence do you have that proves humans are the main cause of any climate change? If you can't give me or if the climate scientists paid for by tax money (definitely conflict of interest) can't show me provable via scientific method evidence that you and I are going to change the world forever and we will all die and shit and whatever, please do. Otherwise, it's all bullshit based on proprietary formulas and guesses. How about I don't want to double my taxes and lower my quality of life for guesses? How about fuck those guys.

       I'm not going to waste my time showing you the research, I simply don't care enough about this conversation. It's such a unanimous scientific conclusion it wouldn't take you any effort to do it yourself, assuming you have at least a small amount of brainpower.
      </p>

       It wouldn't matter if I did because no matter what I show you, you are just going to scream conspiracy. It's probably part of your identity, the guy who knows better than most of the accepted science on the subject. Hey, good for you, basement dwellers need something. It's good to have skepticism but I legitimately believe you are crazy and stupid.

       Your reply is basically what everyone says, even the scientists. That's why it seems like a cult or something from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not the one putting forth the proposition that the world is ending due to human activity and we need to do a paradigm shift in the global economy and governmental control to stop it. The onus is on THOSE people to prove their assertion and to do it sinply without the snobbery and contempt involved that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you not distrusting of an establishment that gives your future to wall street via quantitative easing and who have killed more than a million innocents in Iraq and Afghanistan and spent $4 trillion+ on based on lies? The same government that proves it isn't worthy of trust time and time again to anyone who seriously reads history. Gulf of tonkin. Bay of pigs. Etc etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they're wrong? It will destroy the progress of third world nations for generations and because it would be such strong government authoritarian economic control they may never ever develop and prosper because they'll lose the knowledge to produce profitable goods and services because they were forced into a fake zero sum economy by global governance? It's about the most serious potential change in human history. Doubt more for your own good.

       Because the government isn't the one telling us global warming is real, more than 98% of the scientific consensus is telling us that global warming is real.. If anything the establishment that sent us to Afghanistan and spent more than 4 trillion dollars based on lies is on YOUR side of this conversation! It's much more profitable for them to ignore the fact that global warming is happening.

       Dude, occam's razor. Which one of our arguments has less assumptions? In the past two hundred years humans have been using machines that emit c02 exponentially more than anything in the past. C02 emissions raise the global temperature. Don't you think that scenario is far more likely than 98% of the world's scientists are coming together to conspire against the world so that they can convince the government to charge a carbon tax?  Wtf is that? That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard you donkey brain.

       Global Warming(tm) believers are just that, believers. There is no damning evidence otherwise it wouldn't be so controversial to give global governments untold power to lower our quality of lives and FURTHER pick economic winners and losers via crony capitalism and corporatism. When you talk to them, they often have never read a scientific paper or even a scientific article that's more than 1 page on the topic, it's just marketing imprinting (hearing something over and over again, just like Hitler said. If you say something enough people will think it's true). It's like telling devout religious people God doesn't exist and they will just laugh and ignore you or whatever because you are too dumb to understand the "Truth(tm)".

       Just follow the money. Al Gore was a stupid politician and now he's a super-millionaire. He doesn't create products or services, he works for the fucking government. If you get rich working for the government you're a corrupt piece of shit because those are all tax dollars taken by gunpoint and threat of jail to pay for his fat ass.

       That best part about this is that the evidence
       <em>
        actually does exist!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how we know you didn't do your research, and you're just spouting off stupid shit you thought of on the toilet or heard some Republican congressman say!
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously believe we have solid evidence of the fact that Earth was hotter in the past. How do you think we know that? Were people alive 10 million years ago? Nope. Were people alive during the ice age? Nope. But we
       <em>
        do know
       </em>
       the temperature of the Earth's climate during these periods. You believe that. Which is a good thing, by the way, because
       <em>
        that much
       </em>
       is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how do we know this? Because we have people that study
       <em>
        rocks
       </em>
       and those tell us a
       <strong>
        <em>
         helluva
        </em>
       </strong>
       lot about Earth's past. We can
       <em>
        carbon date
       </em>
       rocks to specific eras and we can also
       <em>
        carbon date
       </em>
       human fossils to specific eras and we can say things like "Oh, because this human fossil and this rock come from the same era and the same place, the Earth's climate during this period was roughly _ degrees. Cool!"
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         That's
        </em>
       </strong>
       how we know what temperatures humans existed in.
       <strong>
        <em>
         That's
        </em>
       </strong>
       how we know this is the hottest period humans have ever existed in.

       It's perfect for living under a big government. At least at a corporate job you aren't harming people by your existence (not using taxes taken by gunpoint from innocent people). You are taught not to question the new taxes, the new regulations, why the cops are beating you. Pick up that can!

       the personal computer's progress had nothing to do with the internet. networking computers and the progress of networks had nothing to do with the internet. there were modems before tcp/ip. have you heard of token ring before, or any of the other techs before the tcp/ip stack.

       The personal computer wouldn't have progressed if it weren't for the work Claude Shannon did at MIT he discovered that arrangements electromechanical relays could be used to solve problems in Boolean Algebra. Following that he worked on a defense funded projects at Bell Labs which critical to computer design.
I'm not sure about the funding of his thesis at MIT and whether it was funded by a grant from the gov or a donor but private and public universities both receive grants from the government that lead to many scientific and technological breakthroughs.

       Making computers talk to each other has nothing to do with the progress of computers? Are you even listening to yourself? There's no incentive to do the R&amp;D to make computers talk to each other if there's not even a market for computers.

       If Token Ring was so good we'd be using that instead. You can sit here all day and argue that IBM or Xerox were just about to invent the internet as we know it, but they didn't. The contention was that the government doesn't do anything good. I presented a counter example and your response is, "But someone else probably would have eventually done it!" Which is a completely moot point.

       You are showing your age. As an example, the apple 2 was deployed in many households, not just businesses, and had no networking (although, i think it had an expansion slot). Hell, desktops didn't come with ethernet built in until recently.

      <p>
       To counter your other point, we use mp3, a codec that has many licensing issues, can't be easily cut in the middle of a frame, etc.; instead of vorbis, a free very good codec without these problems. Why do we do this? because it got market share, not because the government made it, not because it was free, and not because it was better.

       And ARPANET's creation and deployment predated the Apple II by about a full decade and as you admit the Apple II still didn't include any network connectivity. ARPANET was developed DESPITE the lacking demand, that is exactly my point. So we already had a working packet switching technology using TCP/IP when there was little-to-no market demand and no motivation for private industries to develop. I suppose in your world we would have had to wait until the 80's when there may have been significant demand until we got something resembling what was introduced in the 60's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what your point is on the codecs. MP3 suffers from many of those problems you listed exactly because it was developed as a proprietary technology.

       That's because the people that decide what to do with the tax money have adopted the interests of the wealthiest multi-national businesspeople. If the government sensibly spent tax money to improve the conditions of the public, you would likely see massive infrastructure/public transpo/communications investment to increase economic opportunities, less waste on police because of alarmism and duh scary drugs/black people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schools, don't know. But if economic conditions improved in areas, you bet the schools would improve. Education has shown that throwing money at the issue doesn't work, but socio-economic conditions certainly influence educational systems as students from disadvantaged families have trouble with cultural norms of poor/destitute communities, teachers burning out, administrators seeking bandaids rather than earnestly committing to improvement etc.

       So damn right. Firefighters can pretty much do no wrong in modern America, except cost way too much. The rest is spot on. People seriously don't realize that even in America, if you take ALL of the forms of taxes you pay per year even low and middle class people are forced by gunpoint and threat of jail to pay 40-60% of their income to the government. Good slaves. I'm actually planning on doing a total tax experiment to total all of this and try and grow it and get others to join me in cataloging where they live and their tax rates and how the people feel about the services they're getting versus what they pay. It'd really open some eyes.

       change oil in a car, fix a flat tire with a plug or patch, rebuild a lawnmower engine, wire an electrical outlet, make soap, frame in a door, working on your bike, etc.

       When you get out of school you know how to do nothing of use to anyone, unless you took courses on how to program. Sure you know how to add and subtract, but you would pick that up just from living, and don't tell me you remember how to "complete the square" or other things that might prove useful.

       Are you shitting me? There many public highschools  that have machine shop or auto shop that teach car and small engine repair. Some even have programs that bus the kids from school to the community college to do those things. Fixing a flat tire with a plug or patch requires reading the label on the patch kit.  Wiring an electrical outlet, making soap, framing a door, and working on bikes are specialized tasks that are not even required for "survival" and can be easily learned by CHECKING OUT A BOOK AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY! Hey, there might even be one of those libraries at the public school.

       Things that schools should teach that aren't being taught are things like paying taxes and what actually happens with your taxes and where your taxes go and what happens if you don't pay taxes. Applying for college and which colleges offer which experiences and how to get the degree you're looking for and how to even know what degree you're looking for and what a degree even is...?

       How to manage your money. How to be responsible about your finances.

       You're only wrong about not being able to change a bike tire isn't important. That is basic problem solving and I wouldn't hire an accountant or any professional and trust that they can logically solve my advanced problem if they couldn't figure it out on their own. It'd be pathetic.

       Everything you said is important, all of it. Most people can't do any of that. Contemporary budgeting and personal finances are just "I can afford the minimum payment on my magic money cards and my $150,000 student loan debt, so I'm winning".

       Everyone has been conditioned to believe it is their birth right to be a part of the socialist/government ruling elite by going to university. Simply because they read a few books and are told what to think for a few years (many university programs still fail to produce critical thinking skills) and are a debt slave, they feel deeply and inherently superior to blue collar people who do things.

       Many people by and large can't do shit to survive or thrive by themselves, many people have a hard time even replacing a light bulb in a mildly ornate lighting fixture and need to call some "idiot" and pay him $150 to do it.

       Um, I've spent time in inner city schools, man. They're fucking falling apart. Sometimes they run out of pencils, and there are no doors in the bathroom stalls. It's degrading and humiliating.

       Really though? I've driven on plenty of decent roads, are they all in flawless shape? No but they're definitely not falling apart. Police are killing us? I've had plenty of funny, great experiences with officers. Firefighters can't stop global warming? Yeah no kidding? Public schools don't teach skills for survival? They're not meant to, they're meant for education and as a stepping stone to a career.

       Exactly. People don't understand that their federal income taxes basically go to pay debt to support the world's largest welfare program of federal jobs and kill brown people, little else. The huge amount of other taxes they somehow forget they pay all go to local programs.

       Last time I had to call the cops, someone broke into my home. They took 45 minutes to get there even though I was 3 blocks away from the thug station. Then, they proceeded to harass my wife about drugs because they saw incense.

       So no, I will never, ever dial 911 again no matter how bad the situation is. State thugs will only make my problems worse. If you were smart, you would do the same.

       I didn't say there would be none of this without government (though look up the etymology of "fire sale" if you truly think private firefighters are a good idea), I said that it's absurd to think government hasn't done anything for you.

       i understand what you're saying. government does a lot of things, problem is only a small percentage of those things actually help the majority of americans.

       government has very limited roles defined by our constitution, if they would just stick to those roles, we would be a lot better off, but i do see what you are saying.

       no gov. = still better than big gov.

       I'm sure there would be roads but it would be very difficult, if not impossible to have a competitive market for local roads. Takes a large amount of area and if you weren't satisfied with the road you take to your house or business it's not viable for other companies to compete and offer you an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally private education would be an absolute disaster. There would most likely be a monopolization of schools in cities making it unattainable for a large amount of people. If I were to have a monopoly on schools in a city I'd charge just enough in tuition to make unattainable for most to afford and then use them for cheap labor at a factory I owned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private prisons... all you'd have to do is pay the police/security force to frame people as you needed them for slave labor.

       If you're not delusional you'd see basically everything they do is getting a failing grade except maybe firefighters, but we could probably spend 80% less on that too. Public schools and universities are producing the low-functioning grown children who attend Yale and Harvard and sign petitions to ban the first amendment. Everyone is retarded, even the supposed "best and brightest" at the ivy league schools.

       That's what we're trying to change by getting money out of politics. Our taxes should be thought of the same as you would think of investing in the stock market. Pooling everyone's money together to accomplish something that you could never accomplish alone, like Universal health care standing up to big pharma or even simpler like building a bridge.

       Well, ok. So let's say that I'm a politician and I want to get my message out. "Vote for me, because I want to pass laws X, Y, and repeal Z." I task some Amazon EC2 servers and host a website. Oops, except that's not free, especially not a site that can stand up to the entire country checking out my stance on issues X, Y, and Z. Well, no problem - maybe the people who support passing X, Y, and repealing Z will help me out, kick in for the server hosting? Better yet, a message is more powerful if it seems like it's not just from one person, so maybe they go to the trouble of their own accord to stand up servers and host webpages that say "Vote for Crashfrog, he wants to pass X, Y, and repeal Z."

       Well, there's your money back in politics. There's me, having to listen a little harder to the people who can donate what I need to get my message out - because nobody will know why I'm running or even that I am, otherwise. Because what do you think politicians, and their interested supporters, are spending all that "money in politics"
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       , anyway?
       <em>
        Messaging.
       </em>
       The costs of mass communication to the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's either
       <em>
        that way
       </em>
       or we tell people "look, if you support a candidate,
       <em>
        you can't tell anyone about it.
       </em>
       No 'money in politics', and that means you can't spend money on speech to communicate your support of and advocacy for, anyone running for elected office! You can't buy so much as a soapbox to stand in the public square and
       <em>
        shout
       </em>
       your support." But political speech is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the speech we're guaranteed by the First Amendment. And that's why attempts to reign in 'money in politics' always fail on First Amendment grounds -
       <em>
        the money is being used for speech.
       </em>

       I agree but it seems that our options are running thin with all the lobbying in Washington causing only the voices of the rich and corporations to be heard. That's one of the reasons I support Bernie Sanders, he recognizes it and works to put an end to it and is the best option currently on the table but may not see its day.

       Except that Somalia is essentially pure anarchy and has been for many years whereas North Korea bears no resemblance to any real socialist thinking. Any Marxist economist would tell you that the totalitarian regimes that call themselves "communist" actually just took the capitalist mode of production and replaced private power with state power (Richard Wolff explicitly calls them State Capitalist countries).

       No it's not. There's no longer a unified national government, but as long as competing warlords are still imposing their rule it's not anarchy. It actually highlights the problem with statism, just as "socialist" nations become stinking quagmires of competing bureaucrats when voluntaryism is eliminated. You could argue that anarchy is not possible to achieve, just as some argue that true socialism is likewise merely a dream, but you can't use the current situation in Somalia to disparage the ideal. Living under a hundred tyrants is still far from perfect, but it is better than it used to be when living under just one.

       Warlords are a symptom of the lack of any universally recognized government structure. In my view, wherever there is pure anarchy, some other system will take it's place. I lean anarchist in my views believe it or not so I share the ideal. The only difference is that the american version of libertarianism has come to mean "extreme capitalist". Any true anarchist would be against the capitalist class structure and mode of production. The key is to create a sort of toothless bureaucracy to maintain order and protect people but also stay out of people's everyday lives. Abolishing the state is a mere fantasy at this point, and just giving over all of the power to unaccountable capitalists is much worse.

       “As regards the first set of dangers, it behooves us to remember that men can never escape being governed.
       <strong>
        Either they must govern themselves or they must submit to being governed by others. If from lawlessness or fickleness, from folly or self-indulgence, they refuse to govern themselves, then most assuredly in the end they will have to be governed from the outside. They can prevent the need of government from without only by showing that they possess the power of government from within.
       </strong>
       A sovereign can not make excuses for his failures; a sovereign must accept the responsibility for the exercise of the power that inheres in him; and where, as is true in our Republic, the people are sovereign, then the people must show a sober under standing and a sane and steadfast purpose if they are to preserve that orderly liberty upon which as a foundation every republic must rest." –

       Taxes are not voluntary.

       Living in a given country however is.

      <p>
       Unless you're too broke to move to a different country, in which case you are coincidentally unlikely to be significantly burdened by taxes in the first place (also see Romney's 47%.)

       Resist taxation? Fines.  Resist fines?  Arrest.  Resist arrest? Dead.
      </p>

       Taxation is theft.  I'm more of a minarchist or maybe even just "conservative" with libertarian leanings, but the left's inability to grasp this is incredibly astounding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their suggestion to "just leave" is pretty funny too since - surprise - your government and the government you're immigrating to will charge you thousands of dollars and years of your time - if you're not Muslim or illegal.  I'm not even American or a "Reaganite" but America was indeed the last best hope for liberty on Earth; where else can one go?

       There are a lot of services that are provided to you only as long as you pay. Stop paying, stop getting the service.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I stop paying my HOA dues, my home will be taken from me, and I'm sure I can get arrested or dead if I want to take it that far over it. Is my HOA a thief? No, that's non-sense, since they provide a service for the money I give them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, if I don't like it, I can just sell my house and go move elsewhere. I'll pay fees to sell, and fees to buy elsewhere. Whatever, it's the free market at work!
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow, applying the same idea to countries amuses you, because you feel the free-for-all that is the Earth as far as countries are concerned has not produced alternatives you find desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you sure that's the case? There are a lot of countries out there. 196 at last count. Some of them must have less taxes, perhaps even no taxes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give up on your pursuit of liberty so easily. Apply your libertarian ideals all the way.

       It depends on how far down the garden path you care to tread. When Europeans sailed into the Cook Islands, the only 'government' was a chieftain who had mostly ceremonial duties(such as hosting Luaus &amp; fucking all the virgin girls as they came of age) and his 'Big Man' enforcer. Otherwise their civilization was without government.

       It's taxes. Not theft.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we didn't have taxes, we wouldn't have power lines, roads, or anything that is a part of the public infrastructure. Except in places where the rich want that convenience and pay for it themselves.

        Still another of the frauds of these men is, that they are now establishing, and that the war was designed to establish, 'a government of consent.' The only idea they have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this – that it is one to which everybody must consent, or be shot. This idea was the dominant one on which the war was carried on; and it is the dominant one, now that we have got what is called 'peace.'

       Many people are not a party in this agreement. An agreement forced upon a person is not a valid one. It is obviously not a two-party agreement, hence the comparison to theft. Additionally, this implicit and informal agreement does not provide a way to opt out.

       Tip of the iceberg.  I'm not even a "full" libertarian or anything, but I don't know how one can be even remotely aware and not be at least sympathetic to libertarianism.

       For centuries grazing land in England didn't belong to anyone, it was common property. The system wirked well. Then greed took over and the wealthy fenced it up and a perfectly good system of common property was exploited and ruined forever - thus the 'tragedy of the commons'. The argument about the public versus private ownership is just political posturing anyway. There is no 'correct method'.

       You're contradicting yourself. Was it no one's property or was it owned by the commons? And how do you define commons?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either something is owned by someone or it is owned by no one. There is no magical third party called the commons.

       If its theft don't be part of the society. You're welcome to live in a jungle. The intolerable igorance of the American attitude that government steals from one person to give to another is disgusting and disingenuous. We choose to live in a civilized manner; where I don't have to crawl over someones dead grandma on my way to work, where I don't have to protect my property from bands of roaming nomads, where I don't have to worry about someone else's kids not getting the education they deserve. Only in America can this type of disgusting attitude fester.

       Maybe I misunderstood you, but here's my take ;-) : Develop LFTR:s. Fly in e-volo:s. Eliminate the propaganda machine, as unnecessary. People would have more time for other things than work, maybe get involved in human activities, like thinking, loving and sharing. Improving oneself to live a life of pleasure, engagement and meaning (to borrow the last phrase from Peterson and Seligman

       I know it's a joke, but that would literally be our problem. Nobody in the 1 percent seems to understand compound growth. I did the math recently, and those in power focused on what was best for the group instead of defending their private income, even those at the top would make far more money.

       I agree. This has been a hard lesson to learn. I thought that if I could show people "you will make more money from doing good" then they would do good. But that's not how we evolved. We did not evolve to think of absolute numbers, we evolved t think of RELATIVE numbers, how we do compared with the next guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I learned that, I thought the solution was for some group to simply create its own utopia and then the others would have to follow. but again, that's not how we evolved. If our goal is to only have RELATIVE superiority then it's much easier to sabotage some new upstart than to copy its ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a really hard lesson to learn. We really could have a perfect world, it would be much less work for everyone than our current world - but that's just not how we are wired. We evolved fighting tooth and claw, and by golly that's what we are going to do.

       In this theoretical dream, there will be plenty of money to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, end homelessness, AND lower taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sure hope I live to see the day. You know what's slightly more realistic? Ending the War on Drugs completely. It costs about 50 billion dollars a year, between state and federal money, and there's zero evidence that it's reduced any drug use. We could decriminalize and ultimately legalize them all. If they were legalized we'd get additional tax benefit, which we could use for things like education, while keeping general taxes at a reasonable level.

       Does that 50 billion dollars per year include the imprisonment and "justice system" legal fees? I'm curious if it wouldn't be closer to 70-80 billion including all of that.

       . But I believe the answer is no, it doesn't include prison costs and legal fees. And figures I've heard for the cost of imprisoning people is anywhere from 30-60 thousand dollars, depending on the state. Lot of money we spend to try to get people to stop using certain drugs. Of course, we know that's not what it's really about. It's a tool of social control.

       I have mixed feeling. It was an excelent and revolutionary program (help old people? Why havent we thought of that before!?!?) . But lately (last 20 something years) its started to be much less effective, the amount of money that they give isnt enough to pay your medical bills, food, housing ect. Its become a money pit for the us government since old people are living longer. And they arent getting any more money because the news back in the mid 2000s said that it was a 'bad investment' and that they had exclusive information that it will go bankrupt in the 2020s. This made a lot of young and working class people panic, decided to not pay anymore, fearing that they will never get their money back when they are retired. This made the entire system collapse. No new money comeing in, more money than expected going out.
      </p>

       I like SS, its helped my grandparents alot, but maybe privatization among several fedarally monitored companies might be what saves it.

       "Unable" is the wrong word.  Unable under the current system, perhaps, but the government is definitely capable of doing this, but while the rich are allowed to write the laws and siphon off the top of everyone's earnings, then yes, it's going to be vastly inefficient like it currently is.  We have to get the money out of politics so that the government can actually work for us.  Your frustration is legitimate but it should be directed at how the taxes are utilized, not the existence of taxes in the first place.  Taxes are a necessary part of any functioning society.

       So before the government stepped in people wouldn't hired thugs to take out their competition? Without government nobody is going to undercut, lie, cheat and steal? Without government they will self regulate and honestly tell everything they are putting into their products? They don't even do these things with the threat of government sanctions so why do you expect people would do it without it?

       Alright I'll make an argument. I spend $20,000 per year in taxes. If I had that all to myself how I go about building a road to my rural Kentucky farmhouse?
      </p>
      <p>
       It says
       <a href="http://www.artba.org/about/transportation-faqs/">
        here
       </a>
       the cost for a road is :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Construct a new 2-lane undivided road – about $2-$3 million per mile in rural areas, about $3-5 million in urban areas."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So even if I, and the maybe 20 neighbors I have, all had to come together to build that road, so we could get to our jobs, medical care, food, we would combine for 200,000 dollars. Our town is about 10 miles away. We could build less than a mile of road.

       No it's not. This is an example of government being BAD at infrastructure, not good at it. Your example just means that you living where you do is extremely inefficient and costly. Everyone else is subsidizing you to their detriment and your benefit. The many millions of dollars spent so you can have a nice road to your house is simply not worth it, except to you and your 20 neighbors. You should be responsible for the costs of your own choices, rather than supporting a system where others are stolen/extorted from to subsidize yourself.

       Oh, then what's the true cost per mile of road? If the government is inefficient at building it then what would be an efficient cost per mile then? And the point of taxes and government is that as a society that we have all become a part of supports each other through infrastructure. So my neighbors and I can't afford the road. So the government pays for it at the cost to someone else, then I have my road. Next year, or maybe last year, a road was built to the houses of those who helped pay for my road. Or the school their children use. That's how a functional society is supposed to work.

       So what you're saying is that it only makes sense to live where you do if you can convince the government to make other people pay for your road?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had to pay for that road, and you couldn't get some government to force everyone else to pay for it for you, would you have been so foolish as to live out in the middle of nowhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       Returning ourselves to reality, those figures are for asphalt roads. A gravel road would cost way fucking less, so if you couldn't rob your neighbors to get that fancy asphalt road you can't afford, boo-goddamn-hoo, you'd be driving on gravel. That $200k should just about cover building that gravel road, and it'll last forever as long as you grade it every 3 years and add gravel every 6. So, realistically, that road would have been built as gravel many years ago and you wouldn't even be thinking about it.

       Oh bullshit! Government is just a mechanism that enables you to live 10 miles out in the middle of nowhere and have absolutely no concern for who footed the bill for the road to your house that you couldn't afford on your own.

       Wait so am I to understand you're suggesting a society with no government, with essential services being controlled by private corporations? The same types of organizations that used to employ children to do the most dangerous jobs? Make people work 60 hour weeks with no breaks? Buy out entire sections of a market, create a monopoly, and charge unaffordable prices for essential services?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying all companies are evil, or that the government is even close to a perfect solution at the moment. But the system of infrastructure in the US is a commonly agreed upon good thing, and far from equal to slavery or theft. If it's not a system you want to participate in, go ahead and move to Somalia.

       realize the irony of attacking someone for living somewhere that is almost certainly more easily converted to post-government collapse than an urban center, right? I mean, I'm betting he could actually grow crops somewhere within walking distance. I can say the same since I live near a large park, but there's no way the amount of arable land in my city could support the 1,200,000 residents.

       The problem is that under the inherent inequality in capitalism, many people are unable to significantly improve their material conditions, sometimes directly as a consequence of those who have more than them. The people who end up controlling most of the resources have shown themselves throughout history to not make an honest effort to improve the standard of living with the resources they acquire. This uneven distribution of resources also naturally leads to an uneven distribution of power and influence, which feeds back into the inequality loop. I'm going to avoid talking about human nature and simply point to the fact that capitalism encourages this type of behavior, the consolidation of resources and influence. Without a government to regulate, this accumulation can become very socially harmful.

       So before there were formal states, when the warband raided my village and took all my stuff and sat on a pile of gold, I was just imaging things? Plenty of pre-national settlments had no conception of individual property or wealth, and were sharing amongst each other... but that does not sound like the anarcho-capitalist worldview you are professing in the first place. As soon as you assign material possessions to people under their ownership and control, someone will have more things than everyone else, by the nature of physical reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economics is a game. Everyone is playing, but different people have different objectives. If you are playing to profit, you are always going to outperform those who are playing to raise a family or have a stable living environment or who want material possessions over investments. And that means the class of people playing for profit
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       consolidate wealth because everyone else is valuing wealth accumulation less than they are. The natural state of affairs is to create Rockafellers and Rothschilds - dynasties of wealth where the parents imbue the decedents with the outlook to play the game towards maximizing profit, and you end up with runaway capital control by those who stay the course.

       I said capitalism creates inequality (specifically in terms of material conditions), and you consider saying that inequality is just a fact of life "demolishing" my argument. That's why I mocked you. Because what you said is dumb. You can say something like "just as much inequality exists outside capitalism/before capitalism" and that would be a semi-valid argument if unpacked. (edit: I say semi valid because waving away the inequality caused by capitalist political economy because "inequality just exists/existed before" is really just not a good argument against making changes to alleviate inequality)

       Also this isn't your Intro to Logic class. Raising a finger and going "Tautology!" means nothing in the context of what I was saying. That's the same argument as climate deniers "Climate changes naturally! Ignore anthropogenic effects on the environment, they are normal!"

       It's not irrelevant. Given globalization happened and this dramatic increase in inequality came from it, it is definitely the duty of states to at least try something to improve the material conditions of the working class. Private citizens allocating their own resources will do jack shit for the working class unless they can make the maximum return on investment. Which is fucked. These are people we are talking about, not commodities.

That everyone keeps living a shitty life, instead of a portion of the population living a better life, and everyone else living a slightly better life (as they benefit from the spending of those with higher incomes)?

       The alternative is that there is no tiny global elite that controls a majority of the worlds resources at the expense of the worlds poor, and goods are produced for the benefit of the people at large in a socially responsible manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record, you really need to read up on inequality caused by globalization. Because I am not talking about those who ended up benefiting from it, like people able to work outsourced IT jobs in India and rural subsistence farmers turned factory workers. That is not what increased inequality. It was the very most elite of society. The numbers reflect this YOU FUCKING MOUTHBREATHER.

       Its not like just anyone can drive on your private road, its private. You probably put a toll booth at the entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason private roads don't work is because there is no way to get the land to place them, not that you cannot logistically profit off a road. If you can get 999 people out of a thousand to sell you land to build a highway, you need eminent domain for the last one, and it would be insane for the state to be eminent domaining peoples property to give it to other private parties. I mean, they already
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       it, but it is still an obviously immoral notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       With modern technology you can probably very easily have a standardized scanner to install in your car that you can have read when you enter a new private road and will bill you for all miles traveled on it, and you could use something like Google Maps to plot the optimal course balancing cost / time to your liking. It would probably be exactly like now, except with a monetary incentive to expand and maintain roads that is much stronger than it is now (the current incentive is reelection, which often is not an incentive at all for infrastructure investment).

       thats just my point. "We" DID figure it out. We chose some people to look after it while the rest of us do other shit. We pay them to do it. They're called DOT, police, et cetera. In this country, what the founding fathers gave us is government of the people by the people and for the people. Its ours. We vote to do whatever we want with it, to solve problems like organizing roads. Lots of folks go on as if the government is something different than the people. It isnt. They want you to look at it that way so that we take away power from the government, but thats really taking power away from ourselves, and give it to private companies to solve problems for us. Only issue is that companies have no such thing as common good, so whatever they solve they do so in a more costly manner, and in a way that robs us of freedoms. Thats what the British did, made everything overseas a company (east India company, et cetera). Didnt work out well.

       This is why universal basic income is important - correct for automation and the declining utility and demand for human labor and the compromised bargaining position of the worker against the owner with a threshold of wealth nobody can fall below, with the recognition that individuals will handle the money much better than any state could, and that by eliminating bureaucracy involved you can minimize the overhead and economic burden of redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its actually panacea for free markets, because you can abolish the vast majority of regulations surrounding work (minimum wage, hourly constraints, forced insurance payment, unemployment coverage) if everyone has the bottom tiers of their hierarchy of needs fulfilled before negotiating their time away. And the easiest way to pay for it is to progressively tax the largest instances of wealth accumulation, because those denote centers of existent profitability you can siphon from without compromising market pressures and growth.

       You should think a little harder about where money comes from. Consider the fact that the economy, in the current economic system, is entirely dependent on massive concentrations of unaccountable private power. These corporations don't care whether you live or you die, and they certainly don't care about your quality of life. Yet, these companies make all the major decisions in our society. We all have to beg them for the opportunity to bind ourselves to them as their expendable servants just to survive. We are working towards goals which we cannot play any role in constructing and share in none of the benefits that the owners and shareholders receive. Ask yourself, I beg you, is this an economic system that really deserves to exist?

       Why is it necessary to improve everyone's standard of living? Is it not the responsibility of each individual in society to provide service and in turn raise their own standard? Then government and charities assist those who truly need assistance, members of society who actually need a hand up and not a hand out.

       On its face this sounds great, just like socialism. The reality however is that we should incentivize corporations that create and employ. Those same people with their hand out may have an opportunity to earn it. A large part of our jobless situation and shitty economy is that we tax these companies straight out of our country. With the companies go the jobs. Musk isn't stupid he is a billionaire for a reason he doesn't line his own pockets exclusively with this money. I'd like someone to show how many jobs have been/will be created through this expansion of tesla (factories, dealerships etc...)?

       This is a symptom that we've allowed to happen because of money in politics.  Corporations lobby Congress to allow them to stash their profits overseas in tax havens.  What you said will have people feeling sorry for the corporations, but just look at the wealth inequality in this nation.  The truth is economies are based on a strong middle class which results in high demand to perpetuate the economy.  But right now, the wealth is so concentrated at the top that the economy can't function efficiently and it's beginning to buckle.  Those at the top are spending a lot of money to propagate these ideas that big government, the poor, regulation, and taxes are the reason our country sucks.  In fact, the Koch Brothers alone donate to the business schools of over 40 universities around the country on the stipulation that they only teach their approved version of economics, but just look at the data.   Supply side or "trickle down" economics are being disproved over and over.  62% of Americans right now have less than $1000 in the bank.  This proves that when they get any money, whether earned or in a "hand out," they turn right around and pour it back into the economy.  They aren't the ones hoarding the money so maybe we should look elsewhere.  This is just like ignorant arguments against raising the minimum wage.  If you owned a store with a dozen employees, you shouldn't worry that all of a sudden you have to pay them more, you should rejoice that thousands and thousands of people in your community now have TWICE the amount of disposable income and this is what will make businesses thrive.  Sure, it may be difficult at first, but that's why the change is gradual.

       No, Congress doesn't

       it - there's no basis by which the US government could justly assert tax jurisdiction over money made by selling something produced in China in a storefront in London and deposited in an Irish bank. It's not a "tax loophole" - it's a widespread but mistaken idea that somehow, the US government would have moral justification to tax business activities undertaken by non-US citizens in non-US countries for non-US corporations.

       Your argument is currently being disproven. Rich people are rich because they reinvest in their business ( this includes hiring people and giving raises). The largest problem is the employment issue. I happen to believe that people do a better job taking care of themselves than relying on the government to do so. why punish a successful business? Money belongs in the hands of the people and if a few people have a great deal of money then good for them, they earned it. The United States was born on the idea of less government "that government is best which governs least". Maybe a good question would be; how many jobs does the 1% create? How many of those jobs could be here if they weren't taxed so heavily? The socialist ideals that you have display an ignorance of the history of socialism. It has literally never been successful. Remember what JFK said: ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.

       We've been pumping inflated money into the economy for decades, money that isnt worth the 1's and 0's its made of on a computer.  It's been given to business and banks, and even if you gave it directly to the poorest people in the country most of them would BUY THINGS with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People buy things and that money ends up back at the top where it is treated best.  The rich are getting richer, the gap is getting wider, but the poor aren't getting poorer.  The poor in the USA are part of the 1% of the world population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares where money created out of thin air and handed to people ends up in the long run?

       It's actually very untrue that the government makes no money. They make money on land leases and royalties on land. They make money on tarrifs. They make money on patents and licensed technology.

       yes of course, but that's the whole point. That's the reason we created it. The problem is we were all supposed to be part of it, and they were supposed to be the good guys.

       This is just bad logic. Accepting gov't money doesn't make you any less of a libertarian or whatever. Who wouldn't take free money? If someone holds the door, you're not any less of a man for walking through it. The gov't is just retarded for offering the help. As a business owner who has a commitment to himself, his family, and his employees, taking gov't money is a non-decision if they're offering

       But the social security was literally her money.  The government took it from her and now they are paying it back.  Still doesn't make Social Security any better, but it's ludicrous to say cashing the check is hypocritical.

       I would guess anyone who considers taxation to be theft would also view government subsidies as recovering what was unlawfully taken from them. Ya know, because they still pay taxes, too.

       Not my beliefs as I have no problem with the concept of taxation, but supposing I did I would view a partial return on money stolen from me as movement in the direction of justice rather than as some accessory to a crime.

       You don't quite understand what that is saying. They're literally going to not only pay no taxes (which would be zero theft), they're going to be given subsidies from the government directly on top of that. If they 'zeroed out' you could make that argument but from a libertarian perspective this is them being given other peoples money outright since they're not paying in at all AND being given additional funds on top of it.

       Not really all that interested in trying to argue a libertarian perspective on the issue as I do not identify as a libertarian.  To be completely honest I've never been interested in politics in general so I couldn't tell you in what ways they would be similar and in what ways they would differ from the other parties beyond the face value comparisons I see while browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, not paying state taxes doesn't really apply to the question that was asked.  You aren't paying anything with a 0% tax rate, but you also aren't receiving money at a 0% tax rate so why would libertarians view this negatively.  The $195M is a straight handout, but where does $10M per year fall in a comparison to the federal taxes the company currently pays, and where will it fall in 6 or 7 years into operation at this plant when they're producing 10X as many cars companywide?  How will it compare in year 20 of operation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know anything about Tesla's financials but something tells me that the amount of federal taxes the company will pay (provided they don't just outright sink) over the next 20 years will be more than enough to have the company ultimately pay more in taxes than the $195M.

       Taxation is coerced resource allocation, for sure. It's only theft when it isn't voluntary though. In the US govt, it's theft.

        wouldn't this make you a receiver of stolen goods? How does that make you any better than the thief who stole?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, thieves and those who accept stolen goods are not equally immoral or whatever. Thieves are head and shoulders worse. You can't have stolen goods without thieves. Thieves immediately remove the products of another man's labor. The impact to the victim is already done. What happens to the item after the fact doesn't have any effect on the victim. Thus, i think thieves are far worse than receipients because thieves are directly causing harm to others whereas one would argue that accepting stolen property indirectly hurts others via incentivising more thefts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, for sake of argument, we'll say theyre the same. This is the classic dilemma of "is it okay to steal heart medicine for a dying woman who needs it?" Except in this case its "is it okay to take stolen property to feed my family and the families of my employees?" I personally think it's completely fine, but others would disagree and could give a logical argument as to why. I dont think its okay to steal to do the good deed though as this may affect the lives of others

       Lots of people don't pay taxes.  I have a few friends who don't.  The law just hasn't caught up to them.  The government doesn't have the resources to catch up to everyone.

       And let me add for anyone else reading this:
      </p>
      <p>
       When you read the cases about people who won in court with this stuff, you need to understand what they actually "won".
      </p>
      <p>
       When the IRS says you owe them money that is civil.  If they think they have enough to show that you were intentionally trying to defraud them instead of mistakenly taking a deduction that they disallow, or forgetting about some small amount of money you get paid for day labor, they can make it criminal ON TOP OF what you civilly owe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few cases where people went in citing all this stuff on the internet how they didn't owe income tax because they are not corporations and stuff like that and they were acquitted on the criminal charge because the jury concluded that, basically, he actually believed this stuff.  That is, he had no intent to defraud, he really thought he didn't owe.  In every case I have looked at although the guy was acquitted criminally, he still owed the money civilly.

       It's a disingenuous quote.  The government is exchanging the organization of the distribution of goods and services for money.  Fedex doesn't have it's own money, it's got only whatever it collects from people, and they they provide a service in exchange for that money.  So does the government, it works exactly in the same way.  The only difference is that one is compulsory and the other isn't.

       If the debt ever becomes too bad we can just default.  Sure it would have massive consequences, but so what, tons of stuff has major consequences that we also do not give a shit about.  Constant wars on every front for decades, for example, which we just pretend doesn't count even though that means
       <em>
        trillions of dollars
       </em>
       which isn't pumping through our economy... and instead is flowing into the hands of the people who will most want to work towards keeping that hemorrhage open.  So what, it's all fucked, it's fine.  It works.  Stuff gets done and every so often it blows up and we all pick up the pieces and do it again.  It's messy but it works.  It's messy and stupid and inefficient, but it works.  We're goddamned apes, man, and yet we've got space ships.  The system is working.  It's a ridiculous, shitty monkey system, but it gets shit accomplished.

       Elon Musk's money's value is backed by the US Government.  There is a reason why is worth more than the paper it's printed on.

       This is false. In fact, the USD is worth as little as it is precisely because of government meddling a la the Federal Reserve Act and subsequent inflation, as well as a removal of the gold standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USD is "unbacked by any physical asset. A holder of a federal reserve note has no right to demand an asset such as gold or silver from the government in exchange for a note."

       This, by the way, is how Elon made most of his original money (i.e. paypal).  Because money exists at all, and because it's stable and it works and there are well-defined rules for how it can be loaned and used to create interest, all stuff that
       <em>
        requires
       </em>
       a government to exist, he was able to make a profit.  Without the government making sure that money had value, without our taxes paying for officials to do this and paying for police and FBI to ensure hackers don't just change all the values in his databases and get away with it, without all of that
       <em>
        government stuff

       I don't know what you're thinking of but the US government does precisely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to
       <em>
        force
       </em>
       people to "honor the meaning of the currency." If you tell your friend who owes you a debt that you'll accept payment only in Euros,
       <em>
        in open contravention of a US dollar bill's pronouncement that it is "legal tender for all debts, public and private
       </em>
       , guess what - absolutely nothing will happen to you. The Marines will definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       swing in through your windows on ropes and force you at gunpoint to allow your friend to pay off his debt in dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       US dollars are not "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States", which I know you're thinking is true. You're mistaken.
       <em>
        Federal bonds
       </em>
       are what are backed by the full faith and credit - because holding a bond means
       <em>
        holding a debt
       </em>
       that the Federal government owes you, and promises to pay you.
       <em>
        In dollars.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But the US government does
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to make people treat the US dollar as currency. That's not how currencies work. They have value because they're perceived to have value; that's why cigarettes can be currency inside a prison where nobody smokes.

       If you don't like using the bills provided to you by the USA Government because you don't like the way they make you pay taxes, then STOP USING THIER MONEY.  Go use dogecoin from now on, for everything, exclusively.  Get
       <em>
        paid
       </em>
       in dogecoin.  What is the problem?  Oh, you say you say nobody will let you pay rent in dogecoin because it's worthless to them?  Hey, that's your battle to fight, the US Government persuaded them that THIER money is good, you have to do the same.  If you like the fact that the Government has done that work for you, they charge a fee for that guarantee of value, and that fee is taxes.  If you don't like it, don't use dollars anymore, easy peasy.

       Could you describe the time that the US government persuaded you that a dollar had value? Because
       <em>
        that's not something that happens.

       There's no agency in the US government whose remit is "persuading people that the US dollar is good."

       Again, you're incorrect. USD bills don't come from the US Government, they come from the Federal Reserve banking system. Additionally, there are alternet currencies out there which are accepted in many places, however you still have to pay taxes even if you use these currencies exclusively. So no, it's not that easy.

       meh your logic doesn't really compute. Like someone else said, the government is giving away free money to companies, when it should really be an investment in which the gov gets shares of said company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like Tesla, many other companies get away with essentially free money. Look at Walmart for instance, their company would fail if it wasn't relying on the US welfare system to take care of its workers.

       Musk rationalising all the government money he gets
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people wouldn't have a problem with funding pure research. The problem for the government and power elites is that people would also want to benefit from that research they've funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what they've come up with is to use gross amounts of military expenditure as a cover for hightech R&amp;D to keep out public involvement - mention cutting the military budget and people just go crazy decades of indoctrination has gone into making sure people do not question the military or its spending - and of course to enrich the corporations doing it.
      </p>

       Same goes for the national parks preserved for continued use, not so one rancher can go in and ruin it.

       You could just fund some pure research into building a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could devise a missile for a computer to guide. Build not just one missile but hundreds, thousands even. A whole lot more engineering and design. All kinds of extra white collar manufacturing jobs in key electorates. Military jobs for the personal manning and operating them and deploying them. Again and again more cost. Far more money for Boeing and Raytheon and Bell and IBM and whoever. Heighten tensions too but so what thats not their concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government provides the market for the military junk, provides the companies the ability to train their workforce and develop assembly lines and organise their logistics. And then when everythings running smoothly and they've got plenty of pork barrel money they can look for civil applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thats not a hypothetical, thats how we got the personal commuter. Its technology is spun off from the guidance systems on ICBMs and the Apollo program.

       Um "only takes money from the people" keyword only, they can also have forprofit ventures on top of that both domestically and internationally. And we kind of need government for the country to function to have some degree of safety and infrastructure, don't get me wrong I think there needs to be a lot more accountability but there's really no viable alternative to government and taxes.

       governments were able to establish these business, either abroad or domestically, it comes down to government taking money off people and setting up businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't agree with you that we need government to have some degree of safety or infrastructure at all. If you look at how much violence is committed by states and state actors compared to how much private violence is committed, state violence wins by a gargantuan margin. As for infrastructure: all roads, electrical grids and everything else (in my country of England) is built by private contractors paid by public money. The only thing the government seems to do is (at best) mediate the transaction between the general public who actually pays for it and the private businesses that actually do the work. Government is inherently parasitical.

       Let me rundown something that could happen if there was no government. Everything is considered private property either own by a corporation or an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The company that owns the road in front of your house (which is surrounded by other people's houses) charges you everytime you leave your house, they can charge you whatever they want and you can't even leave to get food without paying them. Then some other company comes in and says you aren't allowed on the road period, meaning you are not allowed to leave your house and you starve to death. But wait there's no police so you don't have to listen to them you can use the road for free. They then hire people to kill anyone who goes on the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell could anything work without government, corporations could gouge you at every turn pollute to no end poison water supplies and anyone could kill anyone they want to. Look at places with no government, they have child soldiers and war lords.

       Let me rundown something that could happen if there is a government. Everything is considered owned by the government and subject to its laws.
The political party in charge at the time that owns the road in front of your house (which is surrounded by other people's houses) charges you everytime you leave your house, they can charge you whatever they want and you can't even leave to get food without paying them. Then some other political party comes into power and says you aren't allowed on the road period, meaning you are not allowed to leave your house and you starve to death. But wait there's police so they can force you to listen to them and kill or jail you if you disagree. They then hire people to kill anyone who goes on the road.
How the hell could anything work with government, governments could gouge you at every turn pollute to no end poison water supplies and anyone could kill anyone they want to. Look at places with government, they have industrial genocide and chemical warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say to all this however, that if there was a button to painlessly vanish all the world's governments into thin air I wouldn't press it. This is because everyone has been led to believe that they need government and that they need somebody either telling them what to do, or telling their neighbor what to do. The irony of statism is that we're so  worried by the character of the average person that choose to give the
       <em>
        most untrustworthy
       </em>
       and dangerous people absolute power over our lives.

       That's why we have a democracy so people who do those things are never put into power and if someone is we can remove them from power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong government right now is inefficient, bloated and ineffective in many regards but without it how could you build a highway, what recourse would you have if someone robbed or raped you? How could you build powerlines and prevent corporations from poisoning water supplies on mass?

       I think the ultimate problem comes from the belief that other people have a legitimate right to forcibly control you. If you buy into that it makes sense to believe that if the government you prefer gets into power, then all the other people living in that government's jurisdiction should live by the rules you set for them, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, if I voted for a government because it put a 200% tax on books and it got into power, would it really be fair to you and the bookstore to abide by that ruling even though you both disagreed with it? I don't think so and it's one of the critical failures of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for highways, as I said, governments don't build highways, they employ private businesses to build them funded with taxpayer money. If you have people living at point A and a McDonalds at point B, do you think the lack of a state is going to prevent a road being built? Come on, airlines are almost all privately owned, Musk is building space rockets, is it really so unbelievable to think that roads can be built without government intervention?

       Without government the only right there is is the right to self-defense, so I could shoot you and rape your daughter and laugh and piss on you as you bleed to death with no repercussions because you don't think anyone should be controlled to any extent.

       No it's not fair, but guess what life isn't fair, this isn't about what's fair, this is about what's better paying 200% tax on books or being shot, watch your family get raped and then get pissed on as you bleed to death. I agree with all of the failings of government and democracy you've described what you fail to account for is failings with anarchy.

       Yes here's why for so many reasons I mean first of all without government there wouldn't be corporations for very long but glossing over that glaring fact planes and rockets fly through the air, they don't need any infrastructure roads are infrastructure. In order to build a road you need to own all the land and you'd want a return on that investment and you wouldn't want people using it for free. So it would cost people more to use the roads than it does now and in addition to that, anyone who is poor can't afford it and when you can't even afford to leave your house you turn to crime pretty quick. So you get a spike in crime right after dismantling your police force, how long do you think civilized society would last?

       We both agree with one thing, if the free market is let loose the capitalists are out for one thing, and one thing only: money. If this is true, then why would capitalists seek to price out the majority of their customers and leave them unable to engage in monetary transactions? It seems odd to think of a business that would set prices so high that most of its potential customers couldn't participate in its business. In fact, from my experience, every businesses is obsessed with cutting costs and constantly attempts to drive down its own prices in order to attract more customers.

       Did you know that after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 a lot of people were terrified of starving, because how could they eat if the government was not going to feed them? Socialising food distribution seems ludicrous to Western countries doesn't it? Look at the enormous spectrum of choice available at the multitude of Western markets, it was so inconceivable to Russian premier Boris Yeltsin that he couldn't stop talking about the differences to Soviet food markets.

       Okay first of all there's absolutely nothing to stop the people you hire from doing it, and everyone is going to want that kind of protection (which would be around the clock bodyguards) and nobody is going to want to give that kind of protection (how many people want to die for someone else?) making it extremely costly to the point only the 1% could afford it anyways.

       I didn't think that far ahead when I said that, and regardless you seem to think corporations will survive so it's a valid arguement regardless. Why do you think corporations will survive?

       You have no idea how much a road costs to build and maintain do you? It's a lot, so much so that without government a company would never even spend the money doing it, and that if you wanted returns from just the people using that road within a decade you'd have to charge them a lot.

       The history of the internet comes from computers talking to each other and computers were a private venture, the internet was also a private venture and is quite distinct from the DARPANET or whatever it's called.

       It's the same with telephonic technology: it was brought about by private enterprise but co-opted by states. And the only thing I know about railway technology is that it was invented by a regular man, he wasn't a government employee or anything yet he built a steam locomotive.

       I feel like he's leaving a crucial part out - not only does the government not have any money, but borrows money from the (unregulated) Federal Reserve on interest which creates it out of THIN AIR.

       Private companies take a fuck ton of money from the people, it's called government grants. You think they want to spend their own money on R&amp;D and facilities if they don't have to? Fuck no. And although grants have great potential to help countries out it negates a lot of that potential when companies avoid taxes by holding their money offshore, get grants, make money off the grants and transfer a lot of that offshore.

       For example, his assertion that the government does not have money. A quick look at their budget reports shows this isn't true. It also does not only take it from people as there is a such thing as state-owned enterprises.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government acts in the name of the people. So when the government does something, like fund something, or start a war, the people of the state are the ones doing it because the state acts in their name. That's the basis of a representative democracy... Elected officials represent their constituents.

       The government takes in tax revenue from the people and business entities, but that is not the entire story. If it was there wouldnt be a national debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US federal government also sells US treasury bonds (IOU money with interest) to the (non)Federal (doesn't require)Reserve for Federal Reserve bank notes that say United States on them and have pictures of presidents that worked against private central bank interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       These treasury bonds are then sold by the Federal Reserve on the open market. This is how the US federal government finances its national debt. Taxes are used to fund the government, but they are also used to pay back US treasury bonds with interest to those that bought them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the central bank basically makes dollars, in the form of bank credit mostly, and then exchanges them for debt agreements. The bank then sells the debt agreements for money. The central bank also loans money to the banks that own it at low interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a commodity used as currency has an increase in supply, if other variables remain constant, the value of existing units of the commodity will lose economic exchange value. The value is diluted and the power of it is essentially shifted to the owners of the new supply of the commodity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we understand that this value transfer is occurring? Do we understand who bears the burden? Do we understand who gains the benefits?

       The government doesn't really create jobs, it creates statements of work that need to be paid by your taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The institutions the government creates and the people the government hires generally aren't in a sustainable position - they can't self fund, and always run at a loss - that's not job creation, that's debt creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, not all institutions should be inherently sustainable, but when they say they're creating 20,000 new jobs, they're not, they're really providing short term welfare (for the life of the project) to 20,000 people.

       Government makes the money, no one would have any money at all without government. If it wasn't for taxes money would be worthless, because taxes are what creates the demand for government money. If the government doesn't take back enough money in taxes, then the money supply grows and we have inflation.

       Not necessarily. I love how people always complain about bureaucracy and how much red tape the government has but then try to sum up its faults in simple statements. The government does make money in certain areas, not always off the citizens either. It is far more complicated than this.

       Psychologically, it never feels like we owned that money, so there's no sense of loss. That's why people aren't more up in arms over how it's all spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, coincidentally, is why welfare is fucking evil. You're basically using the threat of violence to take money from someone and give it directly to someone else. It was cool when Robin Hood did it, because he only stole from assholes. But now they're stealing from everybody.

       I agree 100% – – taxation is always theft, by definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I singled out welfare because with other forms of spending like infrastructure, or possibly even defense, you could argue that it serves the public good, that we're getting something back from it. But welfare is literally just a direct transfer of wealth from one group of people to another, with a substantial part of it lost due to waste and overhead.

      <p>
       Well, not exactly. Government borrows money from private financiers who created the money out of thin fucking air based on algorithms that depend heavily on the whims of perceived value and psychology (fiat currency), and gov't borrows using an interest rate scheme that ensures the debt will never be repayed. As I understand it, gov't borrows money, gives it to the people, then takes it back. Circle jerk.

       The government exist because people crave order and structure. This is why religion exist. This is why modern civilization came about. People are social animals and with all social creatures their must be some order. This is the nature of the universe. Down to the subatomic levels. You are made up of the same things as a rock or as a star or a dog or cat. The only difference is its structure and order.  If all forms of governance were eradicated today, some form of organization would come about shortly after. This is what you were designed to do. In fact, this is why we as a species have thrived far more than any other species has on this planet. Our affinity to recognize patterns and use them as an organizational method.  The fact that we are communicating with each other, in a language we invented over a system that we developed with protocols to ensure proper transmission is proof of that. You, like dogs, lions, hyenas and hell even ants seek structure and order.

       This is what a government is. If you eliminated our modern form of governance, what do you think happens. Something takes its place. It will usually start a localized level and structure itself up. Your household has some system of governance to maintain its structure, your neighborhood has some system of governance to maintain its structure and so on and so forth. The whole idea behind a democratic form of governance is that, you the people, are the government. There is no 'they' in government, you are them! This 'they' you speak of is apart of the government, just as you are part of the government. They as individuals (or even organizations) have more political clout than you or I but 'they' individually are as much of the government as you or I.  If anything this is what they want you to believe.  That 'they' alone are the government, the organizational force, and you are not.  If you follow this belief then you have surrendered your power.

       Sure, Elon. Tell you what, how about we all go up to the government and tell them they're going to be taking a pay cut this next year and their spending budgets are horrible, so we're going to be managing their books for them.

       Plenty of people are willing to say it, no one is willing to do it unless others agree to join in with them, otherwise, they're labeled as domestic terrorists. The only real solution is to replace the current government with one of our choosing, violently if need be--and yes, by which I mean armed rebellion and execution of our current politicians for crimes against The People of the United States, as an example to those that come after of what is waiting for them if they attempt to sell us out again.

       Of course. They have a military. It's why they keep pushing to take our guns. Because with them, we have the capability of becoming an armed militia. Once those are gone, there's really nothing to stop them from doing whatever they want with no possible violent repercussions.

       Um "only takes money from the people" keyword only, they can also have forprofit ventures on top of that both domestically and internationally.

        In 2014, Nevada lavished the company with one of the biggest corporate-welfare packages in history: In exchange for building a battery-manufacturing facility near Reno,
        <strong>
         Tesla will pay no payroll or property taxes for ten years and no sales taxes for 20 years, and will receive $195 million in cash via “transferable tax credits,” which can be sold to other companies to satisfy their Nevada tax bills.
        </strong>
        All of this amounts to a $1.3 billion giveaway.

       This is totally beyond taking back what you put in, especially for a business. Musk is profiting off of literally taking money from the government.
