<p>It was for the French speaking North African region. Gaddafi was always trying to pull self serving stunts like this, he was promoting a United States of Africa for a while - with himself as its executive of course. So I&#39;m dubious about how well this would have worked if at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re confusing $7 billion worth of gold with $7 billion in fiat currency. Just as the cash reserves in a bank can be multiplied to lend 100x that amount in loans, gold reserves can be used to support a significantly greater amount of gold-backed currency. Users of Qaddafi&#39;s planned gold Dinar would have known that it was backed by actual gold, and that gold would have supported almost a trillion dollars worth of currency, enough to free much of Africa from depending on European and Western currencies for financial development.</p>

<p>France in particular did not wish to lose financial influence over its former colonies/current puppet states, as the email points out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the gold getting it&#39;s value, you&#39;re not making any sense? If it&#39;s worth $7 billion then the dollar sign before the 7 means American currency. The dinar means nothing if it&#39;s not backed by the world&#39;s currency which is dollars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point here is that &quot;they&quot; didn&#39;t give $525 billion worth of gold to the workers/laborers who worked/built whatever the military bought.  They gave something much more in danger of being near valueless (or reduced in value,) without mentioning that more fiat currency could always be lent from the federal reserve by the government, <strong>when theoretically more gold can not always be lent.</strong>  That bolded part is extremely important to recognize since it is the answer to your question <em>&quot;How is the gold getting it&#39;s value, you&#39;re not making any sense?&quot;</em>  It makes complete sense if you think this through. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not anything special about gold of course; it&#39;s that natural resources have a theoretically limit on existing, and the rarer the better (The trees or hemp which print paper money is too common and easily replaced/grown.)  In my opinion it would make more sense for the natural resource to have as much value unto itself (gold isn&#39;t the <em>most</em> logical for this reason but at least it&#39;s something tangible and limited/rare)</p>
