<p>The world is overpopulated, full stop. You need the prospect of economic growth to fuel ambition and competition to drive research towards moving off-world instead of the same defeatist &quot;WE CAN&#39;T!&quot; bullshit that everyone who&#39;s ever been wrong has said before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the world is overpopulated and that this is the ultimate driver in ecological degradation, but one large reason for that fact is economic and technological advancement that&#39;s fueled super efficient resource extraction (direct degradation) while decreasing overall mortality and survivorship (high resource demand) as well as culminating in a geographic disproportionate sociological effect (low birth rate). To make the argument that increased economic growth will do the opposite is naive at best, unless you&#39;re considering more redistribution of wealth than actual growth, which would result in the innate reduction of births; this too is naive I&#39;m afraid (hope I&#39;m wrong though). But maybe you&#39;re suggesting some level of subsequent social Darwinism that results in an unethical and nonrandom (genetically foolish) annihilation of groups of people? As doubtful as economic growth seems, maybe technological growth alone in a stable state economy would work? Yet,that would require social evolution in cooperative purpose and necessitate current power and control to be given up, or at least sufficed...spiteful as it is, too many wouldn&#39;t dare to even consider it, let alone entertain the idea of such an existence. Sadly, even in the best of scenarios this is all under the assumption that we don&#39;t fuck up in a 100 years...even then its not quite in the sense of ecological viability or quality of existence as it is simple human preservation (see Hawkin&#39;s latest comments)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus. </p>

<p>A stable economy is a growing economy. There is no such thing as a stable economy without growth. Equal distribution of wealth is a complete lie for probably the next 50-100 years before it even stands a chance. Until you have cheap, infinite power, it&#39;s a line of bullshit ideologues spin to jazz up people who want to buy into their bullshit.  </p>

<p>Economic growth and free markets fuel technological advancement, as in optimization of resources (Cadillac CT6 for instance being a car that uses 80% of the resources of its competitors to deliver a resource-optimized body structure), new methods of recycling and synthesizing materials, and the obvious <em>new technologies.</em></p>

<p>The shift from our current economic paradigm to a communist lala land where you will STILL have abuses of power is too extreme to fathom, not to mention puts us at a disadvantage when NOT EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD will get with the program as they have no reason to. </p>

<p>The ultimate answer lies in using the products of economic growth, those technological advancements that brought us to the moon, with the goal of bringing us off world to develop an interplanetary race; the development of which would require significant international cooperation to cover development costs which would eventually lead to the evolution of currency (particularly with pressure from China&#39;s own currency, growing economic might and influence, and from the price of oil have great potential in disrupting the petrodollar system) and an organic transition to the socialist or really communist paradise you&#39;re describing versus the pipe dream of electing a socialist who will never be able to get anything done, just like Obama.</p>

<p>&quot;Well fuck everyone else, they&#39;re obstructionists&quot; isn&#39;t an argument, because unless you live under a rock you know that we don&#39;t live in a peaceful world where we can be allowed to go soft and radically upend and destabilize our country because some overprivileged academics and ideologues in their ivory towers would rather deal in theory than practicality.</p>

<p>You will not win friends from adversaries by suggesting we just be friends. You will not do it unless you have the opportunity for mutual benefit, AKA economic benefit in some form or another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Embedded in your passive aggression and obvious bias is a clear display that you did not understand what I was saying. Where did I depict a socialist or communist purview? Where did I allude to a single candidate, or even mention a candidate or election? This alone is my first sign that you&#39;re projecting, and with great bias and resentment. It&#39;s sad because you won&#39;t hear me, but I must persist. 
I guess I&#39;ll first start with the idea that a stable state has to be a growing state notion. This is simply false. Stable state economics is an idea that has been around a while. Hell, even the economic pioneer John Stuart Mill dreamed about it&#39;s societal benefits:</p>

<p>&quot;It is scarcely necessary to remark that a stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement. There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress; as much room for improving the Art of Living and much more likelihood of its being improved, when minds cease to be engrossed by the art of getting on.&quot;.</p>

<p>Czech and Daly, among others, recently went on to highlight its necessity. (<a href="http://base.socioeco.org/docs/czech_daly_sse.pdf">http://base.socioeco.org/docs/czech_daly_sse.pdf</a>). So, you see, your definitions are wrong, which leaves your premise fundamentally flawed.  </p>

<p>Second, the notion that all this is reliant upon equal distribution of wealth and some socialist or communist aspect is completely unfounded. For one, I was pointing out sequences of logic for population scenarios of forced or ideal reduction, not stating the economic policies inherent to an ideal shift.  To entertain,  however, what we are talking about is a redistribution of wealth that counters a level of inequality that wasnt even seen in the French Revolution....not perfect equality. People always seem to oversimplify and obfuscate this point.
Lastly, you seem to be of what you claim scholars to be...quite ironic to be sure. You convey hastily a cacaphony of thought in such a passionate way that I wonder if you even reread it. What I am talking about is simple logic and many forefathers of economics said the very same. Humanity should evolve to the point that society&#39;s function isn&#39;t solely on economic gain. This is evolution we&#39;re talking about, as a species. What you have done is pessimistically thrown away an observed logical progression as some categorical ideal&#39;s dream. Yet, all simply based on some Hobbsian ideology of human nature and dogma-like regard for a synthetic system. Besides, humanity&#39;s progression to a type 1 civilization will never be from the bequest of economy..any fool can see that such a step will be from a second order shift in humanity&#39;s motivator for innovation. To piggy, I can tell you missed my point on Hawkin&#39;s too.....if we ever make or that far is the key. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so.  </p>

<p>The signs were there in 2008 that Obama, while incredibly charismatic and appealing, was indeed plugged in to the pre-existing paradigm and systems.</p>

<p>He put executives or lobbyists from banking/pharma/lending in charge of regulating their respective industries just like every other President. He was, in almost every way, a pawn to the 1%.  In many ways it&#39;s logical, after all they control most of the wealth and therefore have most of the power,... but it&#39;s not ideal.</p>

<p>This is why we are screwed, it doesnt matter who gets into office. So long as people have a savior mentality nothing will change. Believe it.</p>

<p>When you give something power over your life, you become a slave to a master, its as simple as that. We dont need a central government, we need people on the ground making change without it.</p>

<p>We are in the matrix, the machines are the political figures, and the decption is the political process of central government.

<p>no, you&#39;re not, glad you post this. i remember seeing him on MSNBC a few years ago, he would comment quite often. this was before the campaign, i had heard of him, didn&#39;t know much about him, he was an independent then.</p>

<p>thinking about this the other day; i realized that; <em>that</em> was when he was being <em>introduced</em>. so now here he is, another bringer of (false) hope to the people.</p>

<p>haven&#39;t we been down this road before?  smh, wth happened to short-term memory? it&#39;s like he&#39;s an white/older version of Obama. feel like this is a &#39;new&#39; version of an old show.</p>

<p>i&#39;m so glad i&#39;m not the only person that &#39;sees&#39; this, it&#39;s kinda weird isn&#39;t it? in a fucked up way. people really are mind controlled, if they weren&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t people question this? </p>

<p>Barack Obama was in congress for 3 years before his presidential win in 2008.  Bernie Sander&#39;s has been in congress since 1991.  When you saw him on MSNBC a few years ago he was probably already well established, and you mistook introduced to YOU for introduced in general.  Look him up, he has a real track record and voting history, while Obama doesn&#39;t.  Just because you have done no research on either person doesn&#39;t mean their stories are identical.  All that being said, though, I can&#39;t really bring myself to believe in him because if he were to cross the line and say the things I want him to say he would never get elected.  If he really is earnest, he has to play the game at least until he&#39;s in power, (like JFK) but I have a feeling they keep you playing the game once you&#39;re in power, no matter what. (like JFK)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As an LCD yourself, you should know, right?</p>

<p>Firstly, read a fucking book. It&#39;s border. Don&#39;t be an ignoramus your whole life. </p>

<p>Secondly, let&#39;s say I own a shop and I leave my front door open but my security cameras on. I can see you steal my shit, but what fucking purpose does surveillance serve if you aren&#39;t doing anything to STOP crime in the first place? Most suburban home break-ins happen because PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR DOORS OPEN.</p>

<p>Thirdly, drones are already being used for border security, but seem more logical while they&#39;re not doing and inherently CANNOT DO anything about PREVENTING illegal immigration? Your head sounds like it&#39;s so far up your ass it&#39;s back on your shoulders.</p>

<p>Fourthly, is there only one construction company? In the real world, where real people live, demand creates supply. Companies expand when there is room to. You can build a wall AND rebuild infrastructure. What you don&#39;t want is for the contracts to be awarded to more unions who will continue to do nothing and rape the American public like they already do. </p>

<p>Lastly, fucking Israel. You want to complain about billions? $2b spent on a website that I could make myself. $2b that could have done to border security or have been reinvested into our economy through one program or another. </p>

<p>Yeah, because a wall has never stopped anything. Like in Hungary, where the illegal immigration rate didn’t plummet to nothing when they…</p>

<p>So it’s “more” logical to… keep allowing them in our country instead of disallowing them in the first place. Okay. Enjoy thinking that wasting resources forever is better than using them once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mixed group of barbarians that included Vandals, Alans, and Suebi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_of_the_Rhine">crossed the Rhine at Mainz</a> on December 31, 406, and began to ravage Gaul. The Rhine-crossing transgressed one of the Late Empire’s most secure boundaries–a climactic moment in the decline of the Roman Empire that initiated a wave of destruction of Roman cities and the collapse of Roman civic order in northern Gaul. This occasioned the rise of three usurpers in succession in the province of Britannia: hence the crossing of the Rhine is a marker date in the Migrations Period. Several written accounts document the crossing, supplemented by the time line of Prosper of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>A letter of Jerome written from Bethlehem, which gives a long list of the barbarian tribes involved. Some of them–like Quadi and Sarmatians–drawn from history or literary tradition, mentions Mainz first in a list of the cities devastated by the incursion. This is the sole support for the common assumption that the crossing of the unbridged Rhine was effected at Mainz. Jerome lists the cities now known as Mainz, Worms, Rheims, Amiens, Arras, Thérouanne, Toumai, Speyer, and Strasbourg as having been pillaged. The initial gathering of barbarians on the east bank of the Rhine has been interpreted as a banding of refugees from the Huns or the remnants of Radagaisus’ defeated Goths, without direct evidence. A frozen Rhine, making the crossing easier, is not attested by any contemporary, but was a plausible surmise of Edward Gibbon. On the east bank, the mixed band of Vandals and Alans fought a raiding party of Franks. The Vandal king Godigisel was killed, but the Alans came to the rescue of the Vandals. Once on the Roman side, they met with no organized resistance. Stilicho had depleted the garrisons in 402 to face Alaric in Italy.</p>

<p>Zosimus’ New History (vi.3.1) imputes the usurpation of Marcus in Britannia to a reaction to the presence of barbarians in Gaul in 406: from a fragment of Olympiodorus, the acclamation as Emperor of Marcus, the first of the Romano-Britannic usurpers. took place that same summer.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Adrianople">The Battle of Adrianople</a> (August 9, 378), sometimes known as the Battle of Hadrianopolis, was fought between a Roman army led by Emperor Valens and Gothic rebels (largely Thervings as well as Greutungs, non-Gothic Alans, and various local rebels) led by Fritigem. The battle took place about 13 km (8 mi) north of Adrianople (modern Edirne in European Turkey, near the border with Greece and Bulgaria) in the Roman province of Thracia. It ended with an overwhelming victory for the Goths and the death of Emperor Valens. Part of the Gothic War (376-382), the battle is often considered the start of the process which led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. It was actually fought by the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire, which outlasted the Western by nearly 1,000 years (historians use the term Byzantine Empire to indicate the Eastern Empire after the fall of the West).</p>

<p>In 376 AD, displaced by the invasions of the Huns, the Goths–led by Alavivus and Fritigem–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Adrianople#Background">asked to be allowed to settle in the Roman Empire</a>. Hoping that they would become farmers and soldiers, the emperor Valens allowed them to establish themselves in the Empire as allies (foederati). However, once across the Danube (and in Roman territory), the dishonesty of the provincial commanders Lupinic us and Maximus led the newcomers to revolt after suffering many hardships. Valens (of the Eastern Empire) then asked Gratian, the western emperor, for reinforcements to fight the Goths. Gratian sent the general Frigeridus with reinforcements, as well as the leader of his guards, Richomeres. For the next two years preceding the battle of Adrianople, there was a series of running battles with no clear victories for either side.</p>

<p>In 378, Valens decided to take control himself. Valens brought more troops from Syria and Gratian brought troops from Gaul.</p>
