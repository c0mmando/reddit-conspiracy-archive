    <div class="md"><p>Modern interpretation has it that Egypt expanded so rapidly it was unsustainable, and they tried large-scale farming that their technology couldn&#39;t keep up with.  This accelerated erosion, causing reddish soil to flow into the watershed (resembling blood) and brought on pestilence (flies, locusts etc.)  Crops withered and died, cattle got sick, and the firstborn - who would eat the grain off the top of the silo, which was exposed to the foodborne illness - perished as well.  The story goes that it was Azrael, angel of death, that took the children in their sleep.  Either way it&#39;s assuming this actually happened and wasn&#39;t just a folktale passed down through generations until it ended up in scripture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also heard a theory that climate change caused microbursts, waterspouts sucked up brackish water from estuaries along with frogs and dumped them all over including into the fresh drinkable water.  Similar things have happened in the US where fish and marine wildlife have &quot;rained&quot; on areas further inland.</p>

<p>It may have been the unsustainable farming or the volcanic activity that brought on the changes but we&#39;ll likely never know.</p>

<p>The whole thing happened because &quot;God hardened Pharaoh&#39;s heart&quot; which may have been a metaphor (the whole <em>thing</em> may have been a metaphor for a widespread contagion brought on by Egypt&#39;s unsustainable farming practices) but if you interpret it literally, it&#39;s pretty fucked.

<p>I&#39;ve heard it before, &quot;god&quot; is code for &quot;us&quot; and &quot;lamb&quot; is code for gentile baby.  So god sweeps through Egypt killing the first born of the Egyptians simultaneous to the Jews selecting perfect lambs to slaughter and eat on matza bread.</p>

<p>And they kept doing it for 2000 years...  At the temple in Jerusalem... Thinking they are transferring their sins to the lambs...</p>

<p>Then in walks Jesus saying, &quot;naaa, you guys aren&#39;t doing this shit anymore.  I&#39;m the lamb of God and your going to slaughter me and for all eternity your going to pretend to drink my blood and eat my flesh and this sick cannibalism shit is gonna end&quot;</p>

<p>Huh....</p>

<p>But it could be that they really were killing goats and Jesus was just a Roman political thing.</p>

<p>How we believed that our experts knew <em>everything</em>, and how intellectually lazy everyone else became as a result.</p>

<p>Personally, it is my deeply held belief that in 1000 years there will be but scant traces and clues as to what this world was all about.  Somedays I get the feeling that there&#39;s more truth to the Elder Scrolls than what might be comfortable for us to accept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we are talking about a story and the OP meantioned the Jew&#39;s going door to door killing peoples first born children, I will address this misunderstanding.  </p>

<p>Within tne story the Jew&#39;s were not responsible for the killing of these children.  The story says God made this decision or declaration.  The Jewish people were told to mark their doors with blood so they would be spared.</p>

<p>Also it wasn&#39;t all the first born.  It was all the first born males.</p>

<p>Before making up a conclusions about a story, you might want to get the story right.  Whether its a true story or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not code.  The Bible is very explicit when it comes to wrath directly from God vs the support of His people in their own triumphs. For example, contrast Exodus and Joshua.</p>

<p>From Exodus:
&quot;The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, 2 “This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. 3 Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb[a] for his family, one for each household. 4 If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. 5 The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. 6 Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. 7 Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. 8 That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. 9 Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs. 10 Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. 11 This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the Lord’s Passover.</p>

<p>12 “On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord. 13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</p>

<p>14 “This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the Lord—a lasting ordinance. 15 For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. 16 On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.</p>

<p>17 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. 18 In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. 19 For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. 20 Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.”</p>

<p>21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 22 Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning. 23 When the Lord goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.</p>

<p>24 “Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants. 25 When you enter the land that the Lord will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony. 26 And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ 27 then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’” Then the people bowed down and worshiped. 28 The Israelites did just what the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron.</p>

<p>29 At midnight the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well. 30 Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.&quot; </p>

<p>From Joshua:
&quot;20 When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city. 21 They devoted the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</p>

<p>22 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.” 23 So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.</p>

<p>24 Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the Lord’s house. 25 But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—and she lives among the Israelites to this day.</p>

<p>26 At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the Lord is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho:</p>

<p>“At the cost of his firstborn son
    he will lay its foundations;
at the cost of his youngest
    he will set up its gates.”
27 So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.&quot;</p>
