        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We, as a populace, are controlled by information. The information we&#39;re exposed to informs our opinions and beliefs. If the information flow is controlled, people can be controlled. If certain information is omitted and other info is promoted, we get a biased picture of life. </p>

<p>Cattle are most easily controlled with physical fences, humans are most easily controlled through beliefs. We have proven we will fight against physical fences because they are too obviously controlling, yet we are all ensnared in the psychological fences of belief systems, most of us without even realizing it. </p>

<p>Therefore, the spreading of information that leads people to outgrow old belief systems, leads to the direct evolution of the culture of humanity. I&#39;m not just talking belief in god here, I&#39;m talking about belief in the state, belief in the usefulness of police, belief in a particular political party&#39;s ability to represent the people, belief in the validity of a certain information source or TV channel, belief that McDonald&#39;s is yummy, and so on. These are the beliefs of everyday that make up our minds, that guide our decisions, that cause our behavior. </p>

<p>Often, our media only exposes us to certain ideas, they artificially limit the spectrum of conversation with firm boundaries, but then within the boundaries unlimited argument and discussion is allowed. This vigorous debate gives people the impression of freedom, as if the answer lies in some subtle shade of gray between the two boundaries or extremes presented by the media. This technique allows the media to frame any national discussion in a way such that what appears to be the &quot;balanced&quot; center position is actually biased, and the real truth is &quot;out of bounds&quot;. And it is biased in a way that is chosen, by the people who own the media (and perhaps the people who pay those people), to push the national discussion in a way that benefits them. They&#39;re building mental fences to corral people to certain belief systems, which will create group behaviors that will result in profit (or prevent the loss of existing profit).</p>

<p>So if you really want to help humanity out, fill some people in on this little game that is constantly being played on us. These powerful people know what they&#39;re doing, they&#39;ve been honing their techniques for centuries and passing the knowledge of mass manipulation between each other. Culture often isn&#39;t our friend, culture is often an intelligence test. If we fall for the traps, we benefit the machines of monopolized industry, power, and control. If you fall in to the trap of buying in to one of their ideologies, you lose. Even the ideologies that are against the other ideologies, they&#39;re often traps too. It&#39;s time we grow to see culture as a sparring partner, not a friend. Every idea put forward by culture, regardless of ideology, must be carefully scrutinized. </p>

<p>They try and sell ideologies as package deals, where it&#39;s like cable packages where you have to also accept a bunch of extra shit you don&#39;t want. Christianity is a great example of this. The teachings of the guy named Jesus are pretty great. But what is all this anti-gay anti-abortion nonsense, and why is that just packaged along with it like it&#39;s just assumed to be part of the deal from the get go? These &quot;package deals&quot; are a huge part of how we&#39;re controlled. We&#39;re easily divided and conquered when we see ourselves as part of a limited group that is fighting against all the other groups. If instead, we simply see ourselves as &quot;humans looking at individual ideas&quot; instead calling ourselves by the label of whatever ideological package we buy in to, we would be much better off as a society.</p>

<p>Even this subreddit itself is controlled and pushed constantly. People on here are mostly aware of these narrative control and PR companies that are for hire, that are used all over reddit and all over the internet nowadays to add comments and influence votes. But I&#39;m not sure people yet realize their own power to counteract these pushed narratives. Think about how they actually go out of the way to hire people to fight thing things you say! Think about how you can buy 1000 reddit upvotes for $400. That means every vote you make is worth approximately 40 cents! You could easily do $100 worth of votes an hour, for free, just by expressing your own opinion through your own single reddit account. That&#39;s powerful! </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason people spend so much money and effort trying to steer the narrative of the populace, because it works. People&#39;s beliefs are changed enough that it changes their behavior to an extent that it impacts TPTB&#39;s bottom lines! We, through our posts and votes and speech in real life, also have this power to change the narrative to influence people&#39;s beliefs and behaviors. It&#39;s why I&#39;m writing this right now, as a matter of fact, to bring awareness to our power as individuals when we speak our mind. It&#39;s why you should write your own posts, speak your own words. Because it has a big huge effect! It&#39;s a powerful thing. Every one of our voices is a powerful contribution to the culture at large, even if it doesn&#39;t always seem that way. </p>

<p>We are tricked through these ideologies in to believing that we are generally powerless. We are taught learned helplessness, verbally and emotionally beaten over the brow so many times that we stop trying. This is what school teaches us, this is what media teaches us, this is what work teaches us. To shut up and do what we&#39;re told, and stop acting in ways that don&#39;t conform to the design of the culture. Don&#39;t be weird, or people might not like you. You might even lose your job.  </p>

<p>So people shut up. Well, <em>don&#39;t!</em> This is how we give up our power, by believing we have none. Simply being honest and stating your honest opinion time after time, is a revolutionary act. Possibly the most revolutionary thing a person can do is to be completely genuine in this fake culture. This is the pinnacle of non-violent resistance. This is the deep change that can stop war, that can end an unequal economy permanently. This is what people mean when they say &quot;To conquer the world, you must first conquer yourself.&quot; </p>

<p>Our culture has been infantilized in to silence. We believe ourselves to be helpless confused children, so we are. We are afraid to say something controversial, because we might be wrong. Do you think the people who are actually driving the cultural narrative now care about being wrong? Do you think just by having <em>any</em> inkling towards the honest truth you might have something far more worth contributing to the conversation, then any media or ideological person mechanically interjecting their ideas in to the conversation? Our culture is starving for well-thought-out ideas. If you have one, by all means, please share it with everyone you know, do not hesitate. This is how we grow beyond the shackles of a status-quo culture, by slowly pushing against the boundaries we are given, over and over. It&#39;s not a single act of rebellion that will fix our culture, it&#39;s a change in lifestyle across millions of people that will lay the foundation for a better future.</p>

<p>Imagine if our mainstream culture was organically created by each of us, instead of by a handful of huge companies! We can have this. We simply have to act like it&#39;s ours, instead of being scared of standing out and handing the power of the narrative to them. We have the power! <strong>And more than anything they do not want us to know we each have this power.</strong> Nothing serves TPTB more than being scared in to silence. All that has to happen for evil to succeed is for good to say nothing. Speaking out with your honest thoughts is the greatest and most fundamental way to challenge the system. </p>

<p>We have this great opportunity right now, in this era of the advent of the internet, to speak our minds to the entire world! Don&#39;t squander it, and then in 20 years when the internet is highly controlled, wish you had spoken out. The clock is ticking, this is not a dress rehearsal. Time to evolve. Only by realizing and making use of our own individual power can we flatten the hierarchy. </p>

<p><strong>tldr</strong>: If you see something, say something. If you are caught up in an ideological belief system or twenty, at least be aware of it. Learn how packaged ideologies control our behavior, and inform everyone you know about this because it is highly important. Our culture is biased to make us think we have little power, but it&#39;s time we realize we have lots of power if we each embrace it individually.</p>

<p>I really like this part here. I saw this so clearly when the anti-war Democrats who had been so outspoken against US foreign policy in the Bush years supported the exact same policies when Obama got into office, seemingly out of a fear of diminishing support for their party. I think it&#39;s a natural human tendency to want to be part of a group, and this has been used against us. Yet but doing what you recommend here in speaking up loudly and often, we can promote our own narratives as viable alternatives to the pre-packaged ones.</p>

<p>I frequently see on this sub a cynicism and pessimism that serves no one but TPTB. This game may be unwinnable, or the cause already lost, but acting as if it were is a sure-fire way to ensure that. Only by acting as if we <em>can</em> win, and telegraphing that fact  to others, do we have any chance of success. </p>

<p>I would love for us to co-opt this phrase that has been used to try to turn us into feeble beings, looking with fear and mistrust at our neighbors, and use it as a rallying cry to express our dissatisfaction with the status quo. I&#39;m going to use this from now on, and I suggest others do the same.</p>

<p>I found this very disturbing too. It just shows the power of the 2-party divide and conquer political system. This is what happens when you start rooting for &quot;your team&quot; instead of what&#39;s just generally best. The overvaluing of sports in our media reinforces this &quot;tribe vs tribe&quot; mentality. And of course nationalism does the same on the global scale. Religions do this on a global scale as well. </p>

<p>People get dragged along with things they don&#39;t agree with, to keep siding with their team. That limits free thinking and disempowers people by allowing them to out-source their thinking to abusive ideologies. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Exactly, TPTB aren&#39;t gods. They&#39;re just people who have a lot of money and know a lot of tricks to keep their power structure in order, to keep people in line. It&#39;s very important to recognize the powers TPTB <em>do</em> have, which is what this sub is mostly about, but then it&#39;s important also to take the next step and realize where TPTB are weak, where they <em>don&#39;t</em> have control, and where their power systems are falling apart. Once those chinks in the armor are identified (and acknowledged as existing in the first place), then the next steps can be taken and that information can be spread. Those are the obvious next steps, too many people get caught up in the mindset of &quot;TPTB run everything, therefore I lose and I give up.&quot; and they quit trying. Just like you said, if we act like they have 100% control, then they <em>DO</em> have 100% control. If we instead notice where they have power and also where they don&#39;t have power, then we start to see them as they really are in reality, which then gives us the means to act to change the system because we are aware of how it actually exists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why so many of the founding fathers were against a two party system. They new it would lead to no real choice and the destruction of democracy. I think it was one of the elections in the late 1800s that was the last one in which a president won with something like 30% of the vote. Since that election they have been won with percentages in the high 40s or over 50% with only two parties winning over 90% of the vote. I always use the example of a store with only two shirts one red one blue. If you went there would you feel like you had any real choice? It&#39;s also interesting to think how long a store like that would stay in business. It&#39;s not a good business model and certainly isn&#39;t good government model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. There is ample room for debate over whether the founding fathers foresaw how the two-party system would eventually form given the framework they set up. Washington certainly saw the beginnings and said as much in his Farewell Address, but in some ways that was too late. I think we make a mistake if we ascribe too much wisdom to the drafters of the Constitution; most of them were wealthy land- and slave-owners, and even the drafting of the Constitution as it was done could be considered seditious. </p>

<p>The Constitution itself has no provisions to prevent such a two-party system; in fact I would posit that any government such a document created would eventually devolve into a two-party system. The original constitution did limit the power of the executive branch far more than has been custom more recently, the judiciary as well. I&#39;m not sure if the election you speak of is the one where Teddy Roosevelt ran under the Bull Moose Party, which was certainly anomalous. </p>

<p>Part of the problem is that the US federal government is a monopoly; it allows no room for competition, or even for the states to exercise the power they are rightfully given under a strict interpretation of the Constitution.</p>

<p>I agree with the general thrust of your comment, I just might change this to &quot;recognize your bias, and continually reexamine it.&quot; I think bias is an inherent aspect of human psychology, and those who claim to have no bias are often those who don&#39;t recognize their own, or are actively trying to hide it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While your post is very good, I appreciate a well thought out selfie,  I truly believe that while spreading truth, part of creating change includes hammering on your representatives about how we ARE aware of the truth. Firmly assert your opinion on them... especially if they plan on voting in favor of anything that pro War, Police State, pro Corporate/anti-people, zionist based agendas and super important at this time...anything anti-Iran must be totally fought against by way of calling and emailing your representatives. </p>

<p>Americans did this when the neocons wanted to bomb Syria over lies that Assad used chemical weapons. The American people responded hard and sent the message to their their reps that if they voted in favor of bombing Syria they would campaign against them and get them voted out of office. US government responded by voting against the bombing. It works. </p>

<p>Edit: hopefully someone with more experience with LTE can chime in. My cousin has gotten a number of letters published in my medium-sized city&#39;s biggest paper, but they were either traditionally political or cultural, not as subversive as yours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it better than I could. I agree with everything, but I particularly want to talk about the power of online voting and spreading knowledge. People tend to think this is &quot;just Reddit&quot; like it&#39;s some kind of entertainment tool and nothing else. It could be so much more. I&#39;ve been spending a portion of my free time when I have some spreading knowledge where I can. I try to keep it efficient. The more people, the better. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I make a few carefully calculated comments and 50,000 people view the material. That means I potentially influenced the voting behavior of 10&#39;s of thousands of people for the next election. To give you an idea of the power on this website, if you upload a picture to imgur and it hits the top 25 in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, you will get about 200,000 views on Imgur in 1 day. If you are high up in the comments section on any of those posts, a shit load of people see your comment. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.redditsecrets.com/how-many-people-use-reddit">Last month, reddit had 234,087,448 unique visitors</a></p>

<p>From some r/conspiracy user a while back: &quot;It takes a lot of effort to extinguish all of the candles in a room to create and maintain darkness, but all it takes is one candle to relight them all.&quot;</p>

<p>A single comment could shatter the efforts of millions of dollars in advertising and propaganda for 10&#39;s of thousands of people. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/3nh4gd/never_trust_the_news/cvo0cd4">Here&#39;s one of mine</a>.</p>

<p>Hang out in top/this hour and vote/comment. Maybe even go into the new queue of specific subs. </p>

<p>Exactly. But leaving reddit posts that wake others up could be one of the more important and influencial things a person does in their life, theoretically. I mean it&#39;s kind of stunning that by posting it in 3 places, I got around 2200 views of this little article I wrote. That&#39;s a lot. If even 1% of them had some sort of realization because of it, that&#39;s still pretty big. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are silent because the morality of individualism which permeates our society supersedes empirical fact.  The most widely held value in the U.S., even more than belief in god is personal responsibility.  Abusive inequality is directly corrosive to the liberty of most people on the planet.  80% of the world lives on less than $10/day.  Of course hoarding resources to this extent is absurdly IMMORAL, but in 2016 to how many Americans believe that?  ALMOST NONE</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an ideological package of sorts, and I don&#39;t doubt that many here buy into the whole ideology, but there&#39;s quite a bit of differing opinions on all matter of issues. Some here believe in aliens, some think it&#39;s a government psyop. Some believe Sandy Hook and Boston were hoaxes or false flags; some don&#39;t. Some believe that Zionists control the world; others, Jesuits, Illuminati, Masons, etc.</p>

<p>All the same, I would tell you not to buy into this ideological package. Treat every claim as what it is: something a random person on the internet has said, and do your own legwork to see if it&#39;s true.</p>
