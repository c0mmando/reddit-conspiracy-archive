       World wars are government vs government fights, generally speaking. Why do these governments have millions of followers, instead of being ignored like they should when they start wars?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the ideology of nationalism (or patriotism, as it's called in the US and UK).
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been told we're part of this "team", so if the team wants to go to war, you'd better support it! That's why calling someone "anti-American" is such a tremendous threat socially, because everyone is tripping over each other to see who can support the state the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       We even have it in our language. We say "The US invaded Afghanistan and Iraq". But in reality, it was not "The US". The land itself did nothing. The people who live in the US generally had nothing to do with the initiation of those wars. It's the government, and the people who support the government even when it's irrational and immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government didn't have legions of supporters, there would be no wars, or at least the wars would be much smaller scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're tricked in to thinking identifying ourselves with our nation is our truest identity. People say "I am an American" before they say "I am a Kansan" or "I am a Christian" or whatever identity they have. In modern society, nationalistic identity takes priority. This best serves the existing power structure. It gives them the power to conduct wars and commit crimes in the open. They are above reproach due to nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is further compounded by people who submit to the groupthink of a political ideology, be it right or left. They won't scrutinize the wrongdoings of their own team, and they act as though the other teams are causing all the problems. We do this on a scale of nationalism, and on a scale of party politics. And on many other scales too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Detaching from this web of ideologies is how we unplug from the matrix, how we regain our freedom and stop giving away our power to those who want to control us. People are all too happy to outsource their thinking to an ideology without realizing the full consequences. The less you subscribe to any ideology, the more powerful and aware you are as an individual.

       Banker:  hey shitty desert country. I will give you a huge loan so you can build infrastructure and improve you country and people's standard of living.  You will somehow pay back the loan with interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Country: we can't pay back the loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banker: ok.  I will ravage your country for resources to pay back the loan, and reduce you back to your previous level of squalor.

       If it wasn't inevitably run by the usual elitist scumbags it actually could be an OK thing, instead of pointless wars over dwindling resources we could already be out mining the asteroid belt and exploring the solar system. As there's zero chance of that it won't be though.

       I'm fully aware of this, but do you really think it wouldn't have happened a lot quicker without the appalling waste of resources the military represent? People have looked to the stars as long as they've been fighting over stupid shit.

       We will remain a primitive species until all people are fed every day, all nuclear weapons and nuclear power is eliminated, and all swords are beaten into plowshares.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can pretend all the sophistication and evolution imaginable, but it does not alter the fact that we are the only species that murders
       <em>
        en masse
       </em>
       , by more methods than are easily counted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tribalism called "Nationalism" is effected by governments to control the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until we all learn to see every other human as "person", rather than "other", governments and the powers behind them will continue to manipulate us into war.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we will remain a primitive species.

       Nationalism isn't the problem to war; it's the solution. Globalism is based on the concept of Empire. Empires have always, throughout history, asserted their right to enter other people's territory, kill them and take their resources. Empires are only ever stopped by unified resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unified resistance over a specific territory = a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without nations, empires
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why it's empires preaching for the wisdom of collapsing nation-states.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If only we could have a global power-grid where borders didn't get in the way . . . and where people can't mount resistance if we kill th--- Er . . . uh . . . I mean, unicorns and rainbows. Unicorns and rainbows will sprout up once the people have no means or method to defend themselves from outside plunder."
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is, even chimps wage wars for resources. Clan A will attack Clan B and take what they have. This impulse is hardwired into humans from time immemorial. You will always have unscrupulous people murdering virtuous villagers to take what they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big myth is that "We're all the same" and, if we lower those borders, only love and understanding will flow into our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Europe is discovering, nation-states exist to protect their populaces from predatory outsiders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why this infographic exists:

       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: The reality is, throughout history, raping and pillaging is the norm when Group A enters the territory of Group B. It's not the exception; it's the rule. The modern idea that "We're outside of history and don't need borders anymore" is debunked nonsense. The only people peddling it are members of the empire who want to disarm territories that they intend on taking over. In summation, nations aren't the ones causing wars; it's empires. Which is why the US Founding Fathers were pro-nation and anti-empire. Don't conflate nations with empires. One is the problem; the other is the solution.

       Globalist can mean several things. If you embrace humanity and the earth, that's great. If you think companies should be able to globe-trot and put their HQ in the country with the cheapest taxes to avoid paying, that's BS.

       Ah well I believe that companies should be able to do so ONLY if we move to a socialist system where it doesn't matter. I don't think there should be a starving, hurt or sick person alive. That's what I hope we move into. I don't believe the end of the world is coming anymore. I believe a great change in human consciousness is happening and that we are all witnessing the old Overlords removed and the New Overlords take the throne. (In my vision, good Overlords.)

       I can't disagree, as long as we make a careful distinction between actual socialism including worker-owned businesses, vs communist authoritarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think there will be a transformation of consciousness in the culture of the world as well. But I think transformations are often paired with suffering for those who cling to the old ways. This is why I think there will be a war, because there are just too many in denial and it's going to take a war before they'll wake up to the new ways of thinking. People won't shed the yoke of nationalism until its full stupidity is put on public display, which I don't think will happen until a war, but I may be wrong. Hopefully I am.
