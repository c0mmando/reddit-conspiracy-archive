       I've been doing a lot of research into Judaism. I'm convinced they have, over time, managed to corner the world into bankruptcy and economic collapse. Through the might of the United States (bought like prostitutes by 275 wealthy Jewish organizations), Israel has the world by the balls, and other countries not completely allied with the big banks are rebelling from this Old World/New World order. Most of these "Jews" aren't even authentic Jews; they come from Khazaria, which was the name of Russia before Russians inhabited it. Dark, twisted Jewish Talmudic priests converted the king of Khazaria into Judaism. He made it the official faith over time. These ethnic Slavs of "Scuthians" make up 70-80 of today's "Jews". They are fake Jews. They have faked every major revolution in the last dozen centuries. These people are your illuminati. My question is how will stage one of their final plan develop? Will Israel be destroyed so the Jews behind the scenes can destroy Islam? This could follow/be followed by the continued dwindling of the white race, which by 2050 will be at 50% of what it is today. The Jews want to rule a world of varied people's, mixed races and religions. Whether it's just the Jews or the Jews and other groups, you can't deny their involvement. Look into "Kosher tax" on food. It's a trillion dollar raket for rabbis. The Synagouges and Churches and Mosques of this world are he biggest dens of thieves known to man. Eventually their "Messiah" or Islam's "Al-Mahdi" or "Christ" himself will incarnate on Earth. This person, whoever he is, will unite the world. For good or for evil is the real question. I can promise you this; you don't have any clue what's really out there. Yahweh could very well be a evil, but believe me he is real on some level. What kind of kind God destroys cities with fire and kills babies, slaughters innocents? Not my god. Not my creator. To quote a man who knew little of God, Charlie Chaplin, "dictators free themselves, and they enslave the people"

       No, no. That's completely different. Baby kittens (and puppies) are just

       There are ancient Gnostic Christian texts that refer to Yahweh as an evil deity, and definitely not the ultimate Creator. Not exactly a Satan-type being, but just an old-school dominating, higher order entity, taking advantage of a species that is in it's relative infancy. One that would appear godlike to the barbarians of the day, plenty shows of strength &amp; power to command the reverence of the people, but most definitely not the ultimate, original Creative Consciousness. Really, just another obstacle in the way of humanity as it strives towards it's own higher-order Beinghood.

       It was their way of understanding the duality inside of man. And seeing how we are made in his image, the demiurge must be part of God. According to scripture, he cannot be separate. Or in other words, God can be a real asshole.

       You're looking in the wrong direction. The Jews are pawns and bookies. They have always been. The Vatican (Rome, and some may even say Egyptian influence). There are powerful/rich Jews, however they pay a tithe (either knowingly or unknowingly back to The Holy Roman Empire). Research the Vatican, the Knights Templar, Switzerland and the Tri-Sovereign states. Also, the Jesuits and the Black Pope.

       why wouldn't you say it has to do with zoroastrian occultim? all of the hermeneutic religions are interwoven and i'd say much of it would have to do with a combination of zoroaster and egyptian occultism.
      </p>
      <p>
       jewish people were not always pawns... when christianity came about jewish people &amp; the romans were quite friendly with each other. jewish people were given many favours by the romans. the romans were rather adaptive when it came to other people's religions but from what i understand they didn't like christians because they pushed the whole "god is literal" thing. if you study religion you'd know that religion was always understood to be symbolic, even in isolated tribal communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       i can't say anything about how these hermeneutic religions have interwoven, or when, but they all have similar perspectives which lead back to zoroaster--and he could have been alive anywhere from 500 to 15,000 BCE (the certainty of his article on wikipedia does not reflect the spectacle that is zoroaster!).
      </p>
      <p>
       also if you study semiotics the connections are quite profound...

       I'm aware Freemasonry and the Templars and their history. Your Templars GOT their knowledge of the occult from the Kabbalah (Jewish) when they invaded Jerusalem. They brought the knowledge back to Europe and were excommunicated for it. Then they exiled themselves to Scotland and helped Robert the Bruce free his people from England; this "good deed" eventually led to the Freemason coups in 1688 and 1717 which founded the British Empire, that which the sun never sets on. The greatest empire in history. The rest, is history, and the Jews dominated every corner of it. Russian Revolution, French Revolution, World War I, World War II, what's next? World War III. Albert Pike said it, the Jews and Arabs will destroy this civilization with their war.

       Every religion is the same bullshit. We are the chosen ones, others are bad. Join us or Yahweh/God/Allah will torture you. But one thing i found extremely interesting is that the most recurring themes of humanity is the story that everything will become worse, then there will be a redemption brought to you by OUR GUY. The story usually continues to say that there will be a big battle, OUR GUY will seem weak and it would seem that the BAD GUYS are winning but at the very last moment, because we are the chosen ones, OUR GUY will win and that's because we are the chosen one.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theme is inherent to humanity i.e. it is not cultural or religion. The proof of that is that this story, in one form or another, can be found across many religions and many ages. Hell, it's even in movies, whether it be Lion King where Simba has a big final battle where he has a small chance at success, to Martian where he's about to lose but at the very last minute does something and is rescued.

       I believe in a God who is benign, natural, both masculine and feminine; and manfesting as both good and evil. Other personalities or entities (Yahweh, Allah, Baal, Shiva, Zeus, etc) may be aloud to manifest, but they pale in comparison to this natural, flowing spirit that we all feel, whether we accept it or not. My gods are the ants beneath me feet and the bacteria on my teeth; my god is a dove that flys by when I have given up hope. My God doesn't rule me, it doesn't force me, coerce me, rout me, scare me, dominate me, etc; my god is at peace with itself.

       See if you want to be delusional then go ahead but dont tell me what i fucking feel. If i feel it, i'll let you know. This is the same BS i was taught in school.

       Fair enough haha. If you don't feel the spiritual realm, that doesn't mean you're evil or that it is any less real; it just means for one reason or the other you have chosen (consciously or subconsciously) to "go it alone". I've been there. There is no proof. There wouldn't be. There's too many people, all of them thinking they have it right; they're just bricks in a pyramid, cogs in a machine. At least you have the sense to see through it, but your throwing the baby out the bath water, as they say. There is good out there, my friend.

       You know this isn't true, right? Native nations often warred with one another, often over ideology and beliefs. Entire nations were founded that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the Inca conquered, for example, they forced the conquered to assimilate, nicking just enough of the beliefs of those they conquered to sate them while otherwise converting them to their own belief system.

       The final stage is about to occur , with Israel replacing the unites states as  the ruling state in the world,  but it cannot happen without a collapse of the US dollar and and a great war. 
You should read " Jerusalem in the Qur'an " by Imran Hosein and check out his lectures on the subject (mainly world politics,  Armageddon, the antichrist, the messiah ) .He has some really interesting things to say whether you're a theist or not

       Finally, someone who fully understood my questions and responded in kind. Much appreciated. I'm interested to know more about your perspective on Israel being the next world power, and how that would look to us from the ground? I was thinking more that they (The powerful international Zionist cartel, the Rothchilds and what not) would more likely just turn the U.S. into police state and use our military power through proxy, like they already have been doing. However, I am interested in the perspective of "hard Israeli control" rather than what I would call the current "soft Israeli control". I'm assuming there will be genocide for Arabs, peaceful and warmongering alike. I assume that Greater Israel would become a reality in this case. It really is crazy, I shyed away from doing my research on Jews for too, too long; simply because I didn't want to be pegged as "racist". I can honestly say, I have no problem with Jewish or Arab people, because of their skin; it is because of the religions, which I consider barbaric and cruel, that we have an issue.

       As I was saying, we are about to witness that Israel is going to become the next ruling state in the world. The war will be between the west ( Nato)  and Russia and its allies , and this war is going to devastate north America and Europe , so " how it's going to look to us from the ground " is not very bright.  The Zionists who control the states in NATO want that war , that's why every single provocation that we have witnessed lately came from them ( su24, Turkish fishers, Saudi executions,  low oil price targeting Russia and Saudis not cutting production keeping low price)  , they want that war because in order for Israel to rule the world,  the world has to become smaller,  easier to rule that's why they want this war to take place , so that a man will emerge from Jerusalem and will say:  " I am the messiah " but he will be the antichrist , the one the Jews have been waiting for , they reject Jesus as the messiah.  But in order to have any jew to accept him as "the messiah" he has to bring back the "biblical frontiers " of the state of Israel  , from the Nile to the Euphrates , what people commonly refer as " the greater Israel " . 
As for the genocide of the Arabs , Muhammad prophesied that the Arabs would be decimated by plagues in the end times (which could refer to biological warfare ) thus causing a substantial reduction of population in the Arab world which would facilitate Israel's dominion over the Arabs .

       Interesting. It goes along with what I've seen. If this is true, then we need to get to the Southern Hemisphere, or at least some of us do. The caucauasian race will be exterminated if we don't do something fast though. I plan on staying; I hope for some kind of celestial interference, which would shake things up enough to buy me time to escape to the countryside, but it really is a pipe dream; they have the cities locked down and are just waiting to flip the switch. Either way, the Jews will ultimately fail on this endeavor we're talking about and will be punished by he true God. As we all will be. Then, we can start over.

       First of all, I'm not sure exactly how much each individual item would be taxed for. Second of all, I'm sure your not either. Not to mention it very well could be that low, and they would still make a killing. The point about Kosher is not "oh my god it's hurting me so much" it's "oh my god these assholes can never get enough". Israel has taken 33% of U.S. Foreign aid in the last 50 years. That's more than South America and Africa combined (the neediest places). The point is, at every corner, they fuck us.

       I completely agree with you. Going back and reading my comment makes me see how flippant it was. I was not trying to downplay the amount of money we spend on that tax at all as I meant we get charged on literally almost everything we buy throughout our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to find products without one of the various Kosher tax symbols. For instance, my bread is Russian Rye as it is one of the only bread choices I can find without a symbol on it.

       And I was also jumping the gun, I just am finally realizing some things about religion and it's kind of overwhelming I suppose. That's good that you do that, I don't even know where to begin as far as breaking away from their influence, I work too much to focus on this without costing my personal life. Hopefully when shit hits the fan we'll be ready haha. Good luck

       I'd love to, but I don't know how much the products' costs are increased for the tax. My number was a vague guess based on reading about this many years ago. Whatever the math, it adds up over time, and across millions of people, that is a big number.

       Aha. I certainly understand the difference. I was highlighting their similarities; they're all not me. They all look to an exterior, future savior. That was what I was trying to say. Please explain if I am wrong in some way, that each of these religions stem from the same tradition of Abraham, and all worship Yahweh (changed to Allah in Islam).

       Not at all the same god. Mussulmen believe that Jesus will return... and tell people to convert to Islam. Jews believe that Jesus is boiling in shit in hell. Christians believe that jews will convert en masse to Christianity before the End.

       I understand that they aren't perceived as the same God but they are indeed the same, to me. They are all lies. Jesus being burned in excrement is the most ridiculous thing I've ever discovered in religion. It's all "my team wins" your team "loses". I understand that "Abrahamic" is not the best way to describe them, but it is the term that most people will understand.

       Your right but your also wrong, in spirit; if you ask me. These people, the masses, will never get the truth, will never transcend the wars and plagues and calamities; because they are part of them. They are part of the "problem" you are part of the "problem" as am I. If all 300 million people in the U.S. we're to all the sudden, hit the streets and make sure anarchy didn't insue; by sharing water, food, and shelter (without government intervention), we would win the day! Is that gonna happen? Will it? Can it? No. Because these people have been brainwashed form BIRTH. It takes an incredible amount of intelligence just to begin the process of breaking through this programming. That is why, it is about the individuals. When and if America is attacked, 90% will not survive the first year; that is because most of us are 9-10 meals away from going hungry. I'm just a realist man, but I'm also in touch with the spiritual aspects of this. We have to accept the grim reality and save as many people as we can. Head for the Southern Hemisphere or something. "Educate them on truth"? What have teachers, healers, revolutionaries, prophets, whistleblowers, rebels, etc been doing for the last few millennia? Trying to educate us on the TRUTH, that is up to us to save this planet, that it is up to us to be the best we can be. That's a lot of pressure and most people can't handle it.

       You seem like someone who may lack reason, and compassion; a dangerous combination. But hey, at least you are "awake" so you are "better" than these "sheep". If you think you can stop what's happening with violence, in some kind of revolution, then I would disagree with you. You can make yourself feel better, feel some kind of high or altered state; by killing. But killing will never fix anything. (This is in reference to you pointing out my "running away") I will not be personally running away, though I wouldn't fault any man; no matter how brave, for refusing to live and serve this Satanic, world dominating system we live in, in America.

       You'll have to excuse me, your "peace doesn't solve anything" attitude disgusts me, only because I have these qualities as well and have done what I can to purge them. You are operating from a group mind, a hive-mind. Why does it matter to you what happens way over here? Because humans are so great? I don't think so. Nature is a lot more important than us, period. And I mean the whole of nature. A lot of people would take this as, "oh little me", but the truth is we are a big part of it, or CAN be if we choose. Most people are incapable of "having a little faith" and trusting the universe and the natural Creator, whoever he/she is. Many of the changes we have experienced HAVE come from revolutions, but is it really fair to so that ALL REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS EVER came from violence, or a violent revolution? What about rubber? How about medicine? The discovery of fire? The wheel? The invention of democracy in Athens? How about the Internet? Was that violent? Free energy discoveries usually are "violent",seemingly, because the inventors usually die in strange ways before they present their findings on a world stage. I'm glad you "refuse to serve Satan" but you eat his food, drink his water, and breathe his air. This is "his" world.

       You are misled. You can't save yourself, from yourself. Go ahead, build your fort in the wilderness and stock up with guns and preach about your patriotism or your "will to live" and how awesome you and your followers are; where will that get you? Do you have any of the gold, do you have satellites? Do you have underground bases to protect you from the next ice age, rapidly approaching? How about food and water for 20+ years or however long you wish to continue pretending that you have "done something"? You've done nothing. You've wasted your experiences, you haven't enjoyed, cherished, accepted reality; you've fought it tooth and nail. If you got "suicide" from what I said, then you've missed the point. Do you suicide yourself when you have a cut or a bruise, or a broken bone? No you go through the pain until it heals naturally, all the while making sure you don't do anything to INFLAME the injury I.e. Violence.

       Without a miniaturized treatment setup, you can’t keep water for 20 years. Can’t keep any foods worth eating that long, either. Maybe McDonald’s and Twinkies, but that skirts the definition of ‘food’.

       "Tetragrammaton".  That is what YVWH translates to.  It's on the first page of the bible before it starts.
      </p>

       So you can essentially replace the word 'God' with 'Tetragrammatron' and read the bible again from a different perspective. (paraphrase from Nassim Haramein).
