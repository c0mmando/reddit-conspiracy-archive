        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research into Judaism. I&#39;m convinced they have, over time, managed to corner the world into bankruptcy and economic collapse. Through the might of the United States (bought like prostitutes by 275 wealthy Jewish organizations), Israel has the world by the balls, and other countries not completely allied with the big banks are rebelling from this Old World/New World order. Most of these &quot;Jews&quot; aren&#39;t even authentic Jews; they come from Khazaria, which was the name of Russia before Russians inhabited it. Dark, twisted Jewish Talmudic priests converted the king of Khazaria into Judaism. He made it the official faith over time. These ethnic Slavs of &quot;Scuthians&quot; make up 70-80 of today&#39;s &quot;Jews&quot;. They are fake Jews. They have faked every major revolution in the last dozen centuries. These people are your illuminati. My question is how will stage one of their final plan develop? Will Israel be destroyed so the Jews behind the scenes can destroy Islam? This could follow/be followed by the continued dwindling of the white race, which by 2050 will be at 50% of what it is today. The Jews want to rule a world of varied people&#39;s, mixed races and religions. Whether it&#39;s just the Jews or the Jews and other groups, you can&#39;t deny their involvement. Look into &quot;Kosher tax&quot; on food. It&#39;s a trillion dollar raket for rabbis. The Synagouges and Churches and Mosques of this world are he biggest dens of thieves known to man. Eventually their &quot;Messiah&quot; or Islam&#39;s &quot;Al-Mahdi&quot; or &quot;Christ&quot; himself will incarnate on Earth. This person, whoever he is, will unite the world. For good or for evil is the real question. I can promise you this; you don&#39;t have any clue what&#39;s really out there. Yahweh could very well be a evil, but believe me he is real on some level. What kind of kind God destroys cities with fire and kills babies, slaughters innocents? Not my god. Not my creator. To quote a man who knew little of God, Charlie Chaplin, &quot;dictators free themselves, and they enslave the people&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are ancient Gnostic Christian texts that refer to Yahweh as an evil deity, and definitely not the ultimate Creator. Not exactly a Satan-type being, but just an old-school dominating, higher order entity, taking advantage of a species that is in it&#39;s relative infancy. One that would appear godlike to the barbarians of the day, plenty shows of strength &amp; power to command the reverence of the people, but most definitely not the ultimate, original Creative Consciousness. Really, just another obstacle in the way of humanity as it strives towards it&#39;s own higher-order Beinghood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why wouldn&#39;t you say it has to do with zoroastrian occultim? all of the hermeneutic religions are interwoven and i&#39;d say much of it would have to do with a combination of zoroaster and egyptian occultism.</p>

<p>jewish people were not always pawns... when christianity came about jewish people &amp; the romans were quite friendly with each other. jewish people were given many favours by the romans. the romans were rather adaptive when it came to other people&#39;s religions but from what i understand they didn&#39;t like christians because they pushed the whole &quot;god is literal&quot; thing. if you study religion you&#39;d know that religion was always understood to be symbolic, even in isolated tribal communities.</p>

<p>i can&#39;t say anything about how these hermeneutic religions have interwoven, or when, but they all have similar perspectives which lead back to zoroaster--and he could have been alive anywhere from 500 to 15,000 BCE (the certainty of his article on wikipedia does not reflect the spectacle that is zoroaster!).</p>

<p>also if you study semiotics the connections are quite profound...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware Freemasonry and the Templars and their history. Your Templars GOT their knowledge of the occult from the Kabbalah (Jewish) when they invaded Jerusalem. They brought the knowledge back to Europe and were excommunicated for it. Then they exiled themselves to Scotland and helped Robert the Bruce free his people from England; this &quot;good deed&quot; eventually led to the Freemason coups in 1688 and 1717 which founded the British Empire, that which the sun never sets on. The greatest empire in history. The rest, is history, and the Jews dominated every corner of it. Russian Revolution, French Revolution, World War I, World War II, what&#39;s next? World War III. Albert Pike said it, the Jews and Arabs will destroy this civilization with their war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every religion is the same bullshit. We are the chosen ones, others are bad. Join us or Yahweh/God/Allah will torture you. But one thing i found extremely interesting is that the most recurring themes of humanity is the story that everything will become worse, then there will be a redemption brought to you by OUR GUY. The story usually continues to say that there will be a big battle, OUR GUY will seem weak and it would seem that the BAD GUYS are winning but at the very last moment, because we are the chosen ones, OUR GUY will win and that&#39;s because we are the chosen one.</p>

<p>This theme is inherent to humanity i.e. it is not cultural or religion. The proof of that is that this story, in one form or another, can be found across many religions and many ages. Hell, it&#39;s even in movies, whether it be Lion King where Simba has a big final battle where he has a small chance at success, to Martian where he&#39;s about to lose but at the very last minute does something and is rescued. </p>

<p>So the point being, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All religions are bullshit and the same old story.</p></li>
<li><p>Judaism is another bullshit story like Christianity and Islam. They are only as evil as the rest, nothing special.</p></li>

I&#39;ve been there. There is no proof. There wouldn&#39;t be. There&#39;s too many people, all of them thinking they have it right; they&#39;re just bricks in a pyramid, cogs in a machine.

<p>You know this isn&#39;t true, right? Native nations often warred with one another, often over ideology and beliefs. Entire nations were founded that way.</p>

<p>As the Inca conquered, for example, they forced the conquered to assimilate, nicking just enough of the beliefs of those they conquered to sate them while otherwise converting them to their own belief system.</p>

<p>Basically, just like Christians did.</p>

<p>The Aztecs flat-out <em>murdered</em> in the nation of their belief.</p>

<p>The Mayans did, too, to a more limited extend.</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothings so concrete as you are saying it is.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>Heed your own words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally, someone who fully understood my questions and responded in kind. Much appreciated. I&#39;m interested to know more about your perspective on Israel being the next world power, and how that would look to us from the ground? I was thinking more that they (The powerful international Zionist cartel, the Rothchilds and what not) would more likely just turn the U.S. into police state and use our military power through proxy, like they already have been doing. However, I am interested in the perspective of &quot;hard Israeli control&quot; rather than what I would call the current &quot;soft Israeli control&quot;. I&#39;m assuming there will be genocide for Arabs, peaceful and warmongering alike. I assume that Greater Israel would become a reality in this case. It really is crazy, I shyed away from doing my research on Jews for too, too long; simply because I didn&#39;t want to be pegged as &quot;racist&quot;. I can honestly say, I have no problem with Jewish or Arab people, because of their skin; it is because of the religions, which I consider barbaric and cruel, that we have an issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I was saying, we are about to witness that Israel is going to become the next ruling state in the world. The war will be between the west ( Nato)  and Russia and its allies , and this war is going to devastate north America and Europe , so &quot; how it&#39;s going to look to us from the ground &quot; is not very bright.  The Zionists who control the states in NATO want that war , that&#39;s why every single provocation that we have witnessed lately came from them ( su24, Turkish fishers, Saudi executions,  low oil price targeting Russia and Saudis not cutting production keeping low price)  , they want that war because in order for Israel to rule the world,  the world has to become smaller,  easier to rule that&#39;s why they want this war to take place , so that a man will emerge from Jerusalem and will say:  &quot; I am the messiah &quot; but he will be the antichrist , the one the Jews have been waiting for , they reject Jesus as the messiah.  But in order to have any jew to accept him as &quot;the messiah&quot; he has to bring back the &quot;biblical frontiers &quot; of the state of Israel  , from the Nile to the Euphrates , what people commonly refer as &quot; the greater Israel &quot; . 
As for the genocide of the Arabs , Muhammad prophesied that the Arabs would be decimated by plagues in the end times (which could refer to biological warfare ) thus causing a substantial reduction of population in the Arab world which would facilitate Israel&#39;s dominion over the Arabs . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are misled. You can&#39;t save yourself, from yourself. Go ahead, build your fort in the wilderness and stock up with guns and preach about your patriotism or your &quot;will to live&quot; and how awesome you and your followers are; where will that get you? Do you have any of the gold, do you have satellites? Do you have underground bases to protect you from the next ice age, rapidly approaching? How about food and water for 20+ years or however long you wish to continue pretending that you have &quot;done something&quot;? You&#39;ve done nothing. You&#39;ve wasted your experiences, you haven&#39;t enjoyed, cherished, accepted reality; you&#39;ve fought it tooth and nail. If you got &quot;suicide&quot; from what I said, then you&#39;ve missed the point. Do you suicide yourself when you have a cut or a bruise, or a broken bone? No you go through the pain until it heals naturally, all the while making sure you don&#39;t do anything to INFLAME the injury I.e. Violence. </p>

<p>Why not NOT go to the wilderness instead?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any of the gold</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you have satellites?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hardly think that an individual needs a satellite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the next ice age, rapidly approaching?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey! Great to know that someone else sees cooling in the near future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about food and water for 20+ years </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without a miniaturized treatment setup, you can’t keep water for 20 years. Can’t keep any foods worth eating that long, either. Maybe McDonald’s and Twinkies, but that skirts the definition of ‘food’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve done nothing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey, thanks for magically knowing what I have and have not done, person on the Internet who has never met me and never will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you got &quot;suicide&quot; from what I said, then you&#39;ve missed the point. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Eating, drinking, and breathing is not conducive to your survival” is what you said. So yeah, suicide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>making sure you don&#39;t do anything to INFLAME the injury I.e. Violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. Keep NOT doing anything whatsoever to stop the genocide of an entire people and the destruction of hundreds of cultures. See how far that fucking gets you.</p>

<p>Sane people know the time of violence is rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>So you can essentially replace the word &#39;God&#39; with &#39;Tetragrammatron&#39; and read the bible again from a different perspective. (paraphrase from Nassim Haramein).</p>

<p>All the rest is someone&#39;s opinion on story&#39;s and fables long told. To control civilians and taxpayers.</p>
