       That fact has been widely known for many years...seems that no matter how much evidence is uncovered, the debunkers are ready and waiting to pounce on anyone who disagrees with the Warren Commission.

       Sure would like for it to be more widely known.  Thus my post.  But I realize that gov't propagandists continually fight dissemination of the truth, so it's an uphill climb.

       Sad thing is that a new generation is largely indifferent about the assassination. To them it's old history and boring. But I remember it vividly....how sad everyone was, people in tears for days. depressed then shocked beyond words when Oswald was shot on live TV. There is so much crap going on today that the JFK murder is of little interest any more....and that's a real shame.

       Until its absolutely proven otherwise, newer generations will be told that it was Oswald. I'm 22 and I am almost positive that there is a conspiracy and that Oswald was the fall guy. Have you seen the movie JFK?

       Yes.  I have a very high opinion of that movie.  While it was presented as fictionalized, it was a very accurate portrayal of the coup.  It was based on two excellent books--"On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison and "Crossfire" by Jim Marrs--so Stone totally knew what he was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a very good brief intro for newbies.  A longer newbie intro is "JFK and the Unspeakable" by James Douglass.

       Did you see "JFK"?

       Yes I loved "JFK". Kevin Costner was great in it but aside from his acting the movie as a whole really does make you think. I've never seen "JFK and the Unspeakable" but I think I will watch it as soon as I find it. As far as I know the rest of the classified documents are supposed to become declassified in October of 2017. I'd love to see Oswalds tax records once that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that a lot of people don't seem to care about it now but as I said once its an absolute proven conspiracy when all of the documents are released then there will be a huge upset about the ordeal again.

       They need to understand that a government coup, like the one in 1963, changes things for the worse in ways that dramatically impact us today.  Kennedy was killed by the military industrial complex,  that Eisenhower warned the public about three days before JFK took office, because he was a "peace at any price president" (his own words) yet they wanted war with Russia/Vietnam/Cuba, because he was pro-union in a country that wants to crush worker's rights, because he wanted to eliminate tax breaks for the rich in a country ruled by the rich.

       He wanted us off the petrol dollar and back on a gold standard, that's why he was murdered.

       Here are some of (not all) the reasons for the coup IMO:
      </p>
      <p>
       1-President Kennedy evolved into, per his words, a "peace at any price president" (in his own words)
2-President Kennedy was ending the Cold War with Russia
3-President Kennedy was withdrawing from Vietnam
4-Kennedy made peaceful overtures to Castro
5-Kennedy was pro-union
6-Kennedy wanted to eliminate tax breaks for the wealthy
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these positions were in defiance of the greedy violent unscrupulous military-industrial complex.

       I'm just aware that HW Bush was CIA (before he was director), and his father Prescott created Nixon along with Allen Dulles, so Nixon was the CIA boy, and HW Bush was mentioned in two FBI memos pertaining showing some involvement in the President Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, and there is a photo of someone looking exactly like HW Bush in Dealey Plaza shortly after the assassination.  Is there anything more definitive than that?

       No matter what you are going to get people giving you trouble about the Veitnam withdrawal issue because it was proven that he was planning a coup to remove a certain key figure in Veitnam. Overall his goal was to be out of Veitnam.

       Unfortunately you're right.  He did authorize a coup in Vietnam, which was one of the biggest mistakes of his life--along with posting cold warrior Henry Cabot Lodge as Vietnam ambassador.  I think he greatly regretted his Vietnam mistakes, and his plans to withdraw from Vietnam by the end of 1965 are well documented in NSAM 263 in conjunction with the McNamara Taylor Report (which LBJ then reversed four days after the coup in NSAM 273).  But what you say is true and it undermines attempts to point out his firm plans for withdrawal from Vietnam.

       Yeah I am on your side of this arguement. Thats the one major thing anyone will bring up unfortunately to try to discredit his run and I've met with someone who tried to justify that as his reason for "deserving" to be assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there are tons of reasons for the CIA assassinate him.

       Tons of reasons, including:
      </p>
      <p>
       1-President Kennedy evolved into, per his words, a "peace at any price president"
2-President Kennedy was ending the Cold War with Russia
3-President Kennedy was withdrawing from Vietnam
4-Kennedy made peaceful overtures to Castro
5-Kennedy was pro-union
6-Kennedy wanted to eliminate tax breaks for the wealthy

      <p>
       100% agreed. I also think one of the biggest reasons was the fact that after a year of trying from the CIA and Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kennedy refused to get involved militarily with Cuba and shot down all of the (now declassified: Operation Northwoods. check it out at the nsa archive) attempts to alienate Cuba in Americans eyes to push for a conflict that would benefit war profiting organizations, and that invasion of cuba incident didnt help. So yeah, there's too many reasons for someone to not consider the conspiracy against JFK.

       MLK was likely killed for similiar reasons in my opinion.

       Yes.  MLK wasn't killed until he broadened his focus from civil rights to economic rights, speaking out against war and related poverty.  That was when the gov't pulled the plug.

        Federal law mandates that all known records relating to the assassination will be released by 2017, unless any agency objects, in which case the Assassination Records and Review Board would consider the appeal; but the spokesman said the CIA as of now has no plans to pose any such objections.

        Among the material that remains classified are the files of a number of long-deceased CIA officials who are believed by researchers to have had knowledge about the movements and actions of Lee Harvey Oswald, the president’s assassin, in the months before Dealey Plaza.

       Supposedly all of the results of the HSCA will be declassifed next year.

       The HSCA happened in 1976-1979,
       <em>
        thirteen years after the event

       they investigated. Why would the findings be classified for nearly 40 years afterwards ?

       Yes.  I have a very high opinion of that movie.  While it was presented as fictionalized, it was a very accurate portrayal of the coup.  It was based on two excellent books--"On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison and "Crossfire" by Jim Marrs--so Stone totally knew what he was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a very good brief intro for newbies.  A longer newbie intro is "JFK and the Unspeakable" by James Douglass.
