       TL;DR -- Al Sharpton said "Diamond Merchants" at a funeral 25 years ago and is today popularly known as antisemitic.

      <p>
       At approximately 8:20 pm on August 19, 1991, Yosef Lifsh, 22, was part of the three-car motorcade of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic sect.
       <strong>
        The procession was led by an unmarked police car with two officers, with its rooftop light flashing.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharon Bell, a 28-year-old neighborhood resident, said the trouble began when an ambulance came and the word spread about the three men in the car being attended to before the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       She said that a police cruiser was escorting the car through the intersection when the light changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The cop went through and the car followed, but another car came along and forced it up on the sidewalk," she said.
      </p>
      <p>
       The car ran up on the sidewalk and pinned the two children against an iron grate.
      </p>
      <p>
       7-year-old Gavin Cato, the son of Guyanese immigrants, who was on the sidewalk near his apartment on President Street, repairing his bicycle chain, died instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       His 7-year-old cousin Angela Cato who was playing nearby, survived the hit but was severely injured.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Lifsh believed he had the right of way to proceed through the intersection because of the police escort.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Lifsh later commented that the car did not come to a full stop upon impact with the building, but rather slid to the left along the wall until it reached the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 100 police officers, some in riot helmets, surrounded the accident scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23 pm, followed shortly by police and a City ambulance, which took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32 pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two attending police officers, as well as a technician from the City ambulance, directed the Hatzolah driver to remove Lifsh from the scene for his safety, while Gavin Cato was being removed from beneath the station wagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some members of the community were outraged because Lifsh was taken from the scene by a private ambulance service while city emergency workers were still trying to free the children who were pinned under the car. Some believed that Gavin Cato died because the Hatzolah ambulance crew was unwilling to help non-Jews. There was a rumor at the time that Lifsh was intoxicated. A breath alcohol test administered within 70 minutes of the accident indicated this was not the case. Other rumors circulating shortly after the accident included: Lifsh was on a cell phone, Lifsh did not have a valid driver's license, and that police prevented people, including Gavin Cato's father, from assisting in the rescue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later that evening, as the crowds and rumors grew, people threw bottles and rocks. A number of black youths then set off westward toward Kingston Avenue (0.7 miles (1.1 km) away from Utica Avenue), a street of predominantly Jewish residents several blocks away, vandalizing cars and heaving rocks and bottles as they went.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police set up barricades at several nearby intersections as youths continued to roam the neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the death of Gavin Cato, members of the black community believed that the decision to remove Lifsh from the scene first was racially motivated. They also maintained that this was one example of a perceived system of preferential treatment afforded to Jews in Crown Heights. The preferential treatment was reported to include biased actions by law enforcement and allocations of government resources amongst others. Furthermore, many members of the black community were concerned about the expansion of Jews moving into the neighborhood, believing the latter were buying all of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of the Jewish community did not share this view. Many believed that allegations of favoritism made by black people were not supported by facts; a number of studies disproved the allegations, including one study conducted specifically in response to this allegation. It was widely believed in the Jewish community that these allegations were an attempt to mask blatant anti-Semitism committed against Jews during the riot. As examples, they point to anti-Semitic statements made by protesters throughout the rioting, and comments made at Gavin Cato’s funeral. In his eulogy at the funeral, the Rev. Al Sharpton made comments about "diamond dealers" and commented "It's an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights."
      </p>
      <p>
       Edward Shapiro, a historian at Brandeis University, later called the riot "the most serious anti-Semitic incident in American history".
      </p>
      <p>
       But blacks describe a different atmosphere. ”The Hasidim set up an apartheid situation in Crown Heights,” says Dr. Vernal Cave, a black dermatologist who has lived in the area for 36 years. Cave claims that the Lubavitchers have long received preferential treatment from police and city authorities. In particular, he says, the sect caused resentment in the past by pressuring Jewish shopkeepers in the neighborhood to close their doors on Saturday and by prevailing on police to block off the streets near their synagogues during the Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a funeral on Aug. 26, 1991, Sharpton complained about "the diamond merchants right here in Crown Heights."

       it is a mistake to allow the Hebrew ambulances to exist. They refuse to treat non Jews. How is this acceptable? Emergency services should only be funded by tax money to insure everyone has a right to help when they need it.

       ive seen plenty of nonjews treated by them...also how is it not fair? it's completely funded by donations.  I agree they should help everyone.  But they aren't hospitals and cant serve an entire region.  They are there to help the local community.

       Schneerson was quite a character. He was about as close to a modern day Jewish "Prophet" as they come. Many of his followers believed him to be the long-awaited Jewish Messiah.

       One problem:
       <strong>
        Schneerson was a racist on a level that clowns like Sharpton or the KKK or even fucking HITLER could never DREAM of aspiring to.

      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, don't apply it to the man on a PERSONAL level. He was a Rabbi of the Old Tradition, who clung to and preached the Racist dogma and tenets that have been at the core of Judaism since... forever.

       Below is a snippet from a book titled
       <strong>
        <em>
         <a href="http://www.mailstar.net/shahak2.html">
          Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel
         </a>
        </em>
       </strong>
       by Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky, Pluto Press, London, 1999. (Both of the authors are (were) Jewish).
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out some of the things that Schneerson had to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The ideas of Rabbi Schneerson that appear below are taken from a book of his recorded messages to followers in Israel, titled
        <strong>
         Gatherings of Conversations and published in the Holy Land in 1965
        </strong>
        . During the subsequent three decades of his life until his death,
        <strong>
         Rabbi Schneerson remained consistent; he did not change any of the opinions. What Rabbi Scheerson taught either was or immediately became official, Lubovitch, Hassidic belief.
        </strong>
        Regarding the non-Jew the Lubovitcher Rebbe's views were clear even if a bit disorderly: "In such a manner the Halacha, stipulated by the Talmud, showed that a non-Jew should be punished by death if he kills an embryo, even if the embryo is non-Jewish, while the Jew should not be, even if the embryo is Jewish. As we [the talmudic sages] learn from Exodus 22:21, beginning with the words 'and if any mischief will follow.'" This quoted verse is a part of a passage beginning in verse 2 1, describing what should be done "if men strive and hurt a woman with child," thus damaging the embryo. Verse 22, whose beginning is quoted by the Lubovitcher Rebbe, says in full: "And if any mischief will follow, then you shall give soul for soul." (Some English translations use the wording "life for life" instead of "soul for soul.") The above stated difference in the punishment of a Jew and a non-Jew for the same crime is common in the Talmud and Halacha.
        <strong>
         The Lubovitcher Rebbe continued:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        {quote}
        <strong>
         The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person
        </strong>
        stems from the common expression: "Let us differentiate." Thus, we do not have a case of profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level.
        <strong>
         Rather, we have a case of "let us differentiate" between totally different species.
        </strong>
       </p>

       <strong>
        [!]
       </strong>

      <p>
       {Quote continues...}
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "This is what needs to be said about the body:
        <strong>
         the body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of [members] of all nations of the world
        </strong>
        ... The Old Rabbi [a pseudonym for one of the holy Lubovitch rabbis] explained that the passage in Chapter 49 of Hatanya [the basic book of Chabad]: "And you have chosen us" [the Jews] means specifically that the Jewish body was chosen [by God], because a choice is thus made between outwardly similar things. The Jewish body "looks as if it were in substance similar to bodies of non-Jews," but the meaning ... is that the bodies only seem to be similar in material substance, outward look and superficial quality.
        <strong>
         The difference of the inner quality,
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        {p. 60} {quote continued}
        <strong>
         however, is so great that the bodies should be considered as completely different species.
        </strong>
        This is the reason why the Talmud states that there is an halachic difference in attitude about the bodies of non-Jews [as opposed to the bodies of Jews] "
        <strong>
         "their bodies are in vain."
        </strong>
        . . . An even greater difference exists in regard to the soul.
        <strong>
         Two contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness.
        </strong>
       </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        {quote continued} As has been explained, an embryo is called a human being, because it has both body and soul. Thus, the difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish embryo can be understood. There is also a difference in bodies. The body of a Jewish embryo is on a higher level than is the body of a non-Jew. This is expressed in the phrase "let us differentiate" about the body of a non-Jew, which is a totally different kind. The same difference exists in regard to the soul: the soul of a Jewish embryo is different than the soul of a non-Jewish embryo. We therefore ask: Why should a non-Jew be punished if he kills even a non-Jewish embryo while a Jew should not be punished even if he kills a Jewish embryo? The answer can be understood by [considering] the general difference between Jews and non-Jews:** A Jew was not created as a means for some [other] purpose; he himself is the purpose, since the substance of all [divine] emanations was created only to serve the Jews."** In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" [Genesis 1:1] means that

         [the heavens and the earth] were created for the sake of the Jews, who are called the "beginning." This means everything, all developments, all discoveries, the creation, including the "heavens and the earth - are vanity compared to the Jews. The important things are the Jews, because they do not exist for any [other] aim; they themselves are [the divine] aim."
        </strong>
        {end quote}

        After some additional cabbalistic explanation the Lubovitcher Rebbe concluded:
       </p>
       <p>
        {quote} Following from what has already been said, it can be understood why a non-Jew should be punished by death if he kills an embryo and why a Jew should not be punished by death. The difference between the embryo and a [baby that was] born is that the embryo is not a self-contained reality but rather is subsidiary; either it is subsidiary to its mother or to the reality created after birth when the [divine] purpose of its creation is then fulfilled. In its present state the purpose is still absent.
        <strong>
         A non-Jew's entire reality is only vanity. It is written, "And the strangers shall stand and feed your flocks" [Isaiah 61: 5]. The entire creation [of a non-Jew] exists only for the sake of the Jews.

       Again, this is NOT stuff that Schneerson simply made up. He was speaking as a world renown Rabbi - a scholar of the Talmud, the Torah (Old Testament), the Kabbalah and other works of Jewish religion and mysticism. These are teachings and beliefs that were at the core of Judaism since before Diaspora, and refined during the Rabbinical period of Jewish history.

       So the next time you see hard-core Orthodox Israelis acting so cruelly in their relationships with Palestinians and others non-Jews,
       <strong>
        try to consider their perspective
       </strong>
       : To them it isn't strange at all. Non Jews are not human. Not in body, and not in soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should they be treated as such?

       Everyone who has ever been to NYC knows that the 46th street "Diamond District" is pretty much a Jewish operation, and has many, many Hassidic Jews. You know, the guys with the black outfits, funny little curly hairs, and dandruff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even mentioning a fact is "anti-semitic" - if the accusation of "anti-semitism" is useful for something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Al Sharpton was ok, and supported by most Jews, when he was attacking "White" or "racist Southerners" or "white privilege."
      </p>
      <p>
       But say something about "The Holy Jews" and he's an "anti-semite" because he noticed that the 46th Street Diamond District is a Jewish business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, folks, no one takes it seriously.
      </p>
      <p>

Why would the Jews create Sharpton only to destroy him? Is Sharpton really a robot? Did he have a malfunction? Or is he an alien from space? We need answers.
