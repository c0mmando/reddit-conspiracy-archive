       you're right.  forgive me for lumping you all together like that (i think ill take this opportunity to edit the text post).  What i should have said was, a handful of black people that the media feels like giving the spotlight due to the fact that it advances their agenda of promoting black-white racial tensions.

       Janet Hubert made some very good points regarding the recent Oscars drama and I agree with her. The problem with some black people is that they outright ignore her points and write her off as bitter, I've even seen people label her as a coon. It's sad to see people with differing views being crapped on simply because they aren't on the "cry discrimination" bandwagon. We keep pointing fingers at the mean ol' whites, all the while refusing to look inward and fixing the internal issues that plague black communities.

       Why are the vast majority of African Americans on the internet so sensitive and obsessed with race?
      </p>
      <p>
       I read more derogatory statements about Caucasian people coming from the Black community (where they are generally told it is okay to be prejudice towards whites) than I ever do white people saying racially charged things about black people. Caucasians are being stigmatized to pay for slavery they never benefited from, all over the world in countries that white people never owned slaves. Even if they did it was so long ago that almost every person in the area has no traceable history regarding slavery and are completely unaffected by that history to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not white people trying to cause a race war, in fact I don't think the vast majority of them even care that much. You always have your preachers of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there's nothing disproportionate about the Oscar nomination distribution. Just another example of crybabies used to getting everything they want, using their lobbies and power to push even more bullshit rhetoric into the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many many rich black people and many many poor black people.
There are many many rich black communities and many many poor black communities.
This is not white people's fault.

       How could you possibly quantify that the vast majority of African Americans are obsessed with race?

       And what secret black people meeting were you at where you explicitly heard the leader say it was okay to be prejudice against whites?

       493,000 results for "white people" on twitter. That number includes non-black use of the word and non-pejorative use of the word. It also includes single accounts using it more than once. If you control for all of that, it is substantially less.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 974 Million twitter accounts. 18% of those were black according to twitter. So it stands to reason that even by your own measurement, the number of black people, speaking ill of white people is substantially less than the "vast majority"
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is a flawed metric anyway. It would be like me having you search "men" on tumblr, or "black people" in the youtube or yahoo comment section, or "muslims" on Breitbart. Research tells us that the vast majority of people don't comment on these issues at all therefore what you see can not be taken as representative of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know you personally. So maybe you don't see racism from whites. Maybe you don't see black slurs in the comment section of every relevant comment section. Maybe you don't hear the GOP candidate leading in the polls proposing objectively racist policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if you think it's unfair for black people to assume white people are biased (which I agree it is) then just maybe you shouldn't assume things about the "vast majority" of them based on tweets from a fraction of twitter users.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a deliberate attempt by the media to make you think that black people are a monolith. Don't fall for it. Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton does not speak for all of them.

       I agree with the majority of statements although your calculations are incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact there are 974 million twitter accounts is irrelevant, as is the number % of which are owned by African Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is worth analyzing is the accounts that ARE owned by African Americans and the frequency at which they post anti-white rhetoric. this statistic of course is far harder to measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more interesting is that "white people" is a gross generalization of some of the most ethnically diverse people on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which white people are at fault? Irish? Scottish? Swedish? Finnish? Russian?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a white Irishman supposed to feel white guilt for American slavery?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do people understand that "white" controlled media isn't actually controlled by "white" people?
      </p>

       Number of accounts and percentages owned by Blacks is relevant only because you claimed that "vast majority" engaged in a certain behavior. My only claim is that the "vast majority" doesn't discuss those things on the internet at all. And even if they did it's not showing up with the metric you provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying the existence of anti-white rhetoric. Far from it. I see it often enough. But you can't use a microcosm of tweets as indictment of the "vast majority" of black people. Especially since I doubt you would be willing to take the anti-black rhetoric on social media like comments on youtube or yahoo as evidence as representative as the vast majority of white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I Never said white people should feel guilty for slavery. Even when slavery was pervasive most white people never had slaves. (Note: This doesn't mean it doesn't have adverse effects on black people.) But I certainly don't think every white person should feel accountable.

       I'm black and I can tell you this fact, most blacks don't differentiate Jews from Europeans, from Arabs. If you have white skin and straight hair they kinda just put them in the "White" category which isn't the case at all, once you really realize it White people were getting pimped by the Jews to pimp blacks into being slaves.

       ok, i got that out of my system. many Blacks don't watch &amp; haven't been watching the Oscars for years. what's the point? don't know about you but all those award/talent shows are FOS, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       i love watching movies, think it's a gene that was passed down to me. but seriously, all Black people are different, just like everybody else, some celebs will go along with the program &amp; remain quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       no doubt it's difficult to make it in 'the industry'. imo, it's long overdue. maybe actors of color should try to create their own project (easy for me say) the flip side is that even IF a movie is made, next is the problem of distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       those that have "made it" &amp; have production companies or access to make shit move, should start make something happen; because

       493,000 results for "white people" on twitter. That number includes non-black use of the word and non-pejorative use of the word. It also includes single accounts using it more than once. If you control for all of that, it is substantially less.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 974 Million twitter accounts. 18% of those were black according to twitter. So it stands to reason that even by your own measurement, the number of black people, speaking ill of white people is substantially less than the "vast majority"
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is a flawed metric anyway. It would be like me having you search "men" on tumblr, or "black people" in the youtube or yahoo comment section, or "muslims" on Breitbart. Research tells us that the vast majority of people don't comment on these issues at all therefore what you see can not be taken as representative of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know you personally. So maybe you don't see racism from whites. Maybe you don't see black slurs in the comment section of every relevant comment section. Maybe you don't hear the GOP candidate leading in the polls proposing objectively racist policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if you think it's unfair for black people to assume white people are biased (which I agree it is) then just maybe you shouldn't assume things about the "vast majority" of them based on tweets from a fraction of twitter users.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a deliberate attempt by the media to make you think that black people are a monolith. Don't fall for it. Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton does not speak for all of them.
