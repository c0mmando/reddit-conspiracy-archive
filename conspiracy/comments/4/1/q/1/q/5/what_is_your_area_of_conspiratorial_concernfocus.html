    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been bopping around a bit, 9/11, Oklahoma City Bombings, San Bernardino, the Occult influence on Masons, Jesuits, Qabbalah, MK-Ultra, UFOs, Yitzhak Rabin, CIA funding ISIS... The picture that slowly emerges from all of this is honestly frightening. They are going to tear the world apart to get what they want. Order out of chaos...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got two young kids and am scared thinking about the world they are going to be living in. I am trying to not let it get to me, because I know that they want to rule us through fear. But it&#39;s hard.</p>

<p>I really am starting to feel like I took the red pill. I walk around and can&#39;t figure out how everyone around me can be so unaware and complacent. How I could have been like that until recently. </p>

<p>I highly recommend checking out the work of Mark Passio.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvKEwr0iNA0">The Matrix Decoded</a> - One of my favorite videos of him and a good intro to his work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-ts7t2xBs">What on Earth is Happening- Full 9 Hour presentation</a></p>

<p>I know it&#39;s long, but if you really want to learn, watch this. He packs a lifetime of info into 9 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIEemKcy-4E">Mark Passio: Natural Law Seminar - FULL version</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatonearthishappening.com/podcast?start=150">What on Earth is Happening Podcast</a></p>

<p>The podcast requires a HUGE amount of time, but I&#39;ve listened to every episode in the last year, and it has truly been enlightening. First I watched random videos of his on youtube and loved the content, but then I took the plunge and started the podcast. There are too many topics to even list. Just look on the podcast pages to see all the topics. Definitely start at the beginning if you decide to listen.</p>

<p>I thought I took the red pill, but had no idea how big the lie was until I took in this information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for recommending Mark; I&#39;ve been watching his videos and his simple yet profound explanations are quite thought provoking. I am laughing at his description of the new age, since I followed many of those beliefs for years. I never considered myself religious but according to him, I was right in the middle of one.

    <div class="md"><p>The disinformation in science.<br/>
See also: <a href="/r/corruptscience">/r/corruptscience</a>  </p>

<p>People think that science is truth, well it isn&#39;t. It is led by researchers that are payed by big companies and other wealthy organisations. It is also biased by people that have certain fixed ideas and have their own agendas. </p>

<p>I am looking at the different causes of this corruption. One major problem is that many scientists are too much in their closed minds. They do not perceive emotions, morals. They can not see how they are fooled by others that manipulate them. If you look at some of the powerful people in science, you can see that they show sociopathic behaviour. And that scientists around them find that wonderful. They even copy that behaviour. That is because (as I stated above) they are not very good in social interactions (that require emotions, morals, etc). </p>

<p>You can see that in the conspiracy field. People that are smart, are using their intelligence to lead us away from the problems and crimes that might be occurring. They even call themselves &quot;sceptic&#39;. Very strange for people that belief in a perfect crime-less world.<br/>
They also get angry if you doubt their &quot;explanations&quot;, that are usually different per person. When you add certain observations and evidence, like WTC-7 you get attacked personally. So this field is very interesting.</p>

<p>Also interesting is that there are many planted theories that can are obviously false (at least in the form presented). The intelligence organisations are very active in this area. These false theories become the major focus of attack by scientists. They forget that there are very realistic and founded theories besides them.  </p>

<p>Intelligence organisations are usually neglected in science. People from intelligence are trained to lie and spread disinformation. It is their job. So they are potentially the best place to look for corruption and international crimes. Not as information-sources, since they usually black out anything that can be relevant. But as suspects. </p>

<hr/>

<p>In short: Our understanding of the truth is obstructed by people that are potential psychopaths. Not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t read well.<br/>
I am not saying that they don&#39;t have emotions. Just that the average scientists is less capable in dealing with emotions. That is because they live in their head (most of the time). Plain logic.  </p>

<p>Fun fact: Did you ever go to a group of scientists and ask: &quot;How do you feel?&quot;.  </p>

<p>Additionally, there is some research into sociopaths and brain-scans. It shows that there is not much difference between certain scientists and psychopaths. Very interesting. </p>

<p>Another interesting research is showing that the science community behaves like the mafia. That is because the status is very important and decides if you are in or out of the community.</p>

<p>My conclusion that this is more widespread among science, is based upon the observation of the behaviour of many scientists (in writing and in conversations).   </p>

<p>I would love to add the links, but this is not <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. The place where people have to think for themselves. So do your own research.</p>

<p>I am sorry if you feel attacked by these observations. I do not want to attack anyone, I just want scientists to change their (partially) sociopathic behaviour. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay. It just really seemed like that&#39;s what you were saying considering you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They do not perceive emotions, morals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just making sure that&#39;s not what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: Did you ever go to a group of scientists and ask: &quot;How do you feel?&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a fact. It&#39;s a question. And yes I have and they seem to say the same things most people say. They are capable of happiness, and sadness, and all other human emotions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It shows that there is not much difference between certain scientists and psychopaths. Very interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding the word &quot;certain&quot; before &quot;scientists&quot; makes this statement nearly meaningless. Since there are psychopaths in the general population, there are certainly psychopaths among scientists. So certainly &quot;certain&quot; scientists are psychopaths. I wish this weren&#39;t the case, but scientists are human. Unless you are trying to argue that scientists are better emotionally than normal people (which I think is the opposite of your argument) this statement means nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is based upon the observation of the behaviour[sic] of many scientists (in writing and in conversations).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So these anecdotal scientists you have personally communicated with do not have morals or emotions? What have they done to make you think that?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve spent the last half hour looking for a source to validate your claims, but have yet to find a single source. This doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t one. After all, if you really believe in research, you must have a source for your claims. If you don&#39;t want to share your source with me out of some desire to see me work harder I would understand, but if you were to actually share it with me I&#39;m sure I would be convinced (after all this source managed to convince you). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry if you feel attacked by these observations. I do not want to attack anyone,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t feel attacked at all (I&#39;m not a scientist) and I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t want to attack anyone. I just feel that you are wrong. This feeling comes from my own research into the subject and from my interactions with scientists, as well as the fact that I have been unable to find any evidence of your claims.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying to find information. Let me help you a bit:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instantcheckmate.com/crimewire/11-signs-of-a-sociopath/">https://www.instantcheckmate.com/crimewire/11-signs-of-a-sociopath/</a></p>

<p>Many &quot;skeptics&quot; that appear in the media show some of these signs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Superficial Charm<br/>
Common under certain skeptical people.</p></li>
<li><p>Narcissistic<br/>
The same.</p></li>
<li><p>Pathological Lying<br/>
Many skeptics lie and justify it by telling that the opponents are lying. &quot;We know everything, so you must be wrong&quot;. Is a common lie.</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulative And Cunning<br/>
Very much so. Did you sign your monsanto contract today? It is for science!</p></li>
<li><p>Shallow Emotions<br/>
Black or white. You are with us, or against us. </p></li>
<li><p>Lack Of Remorse, Shame, Or Guilt<br/>
Many skeptics often make other people angry. Which they call &quot;stupid believers&quot;. For science!</p></li>
<li><p>Incapable Of Human Attachment<br/>
Science above people.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant Need For Stimulation<br/>
More knowledge, more science. </p></li>
<li><p>Lack Of Empathy<br/>
Did I kill that animal? It was for science!</p></li>
<li><p>Poor Behavioral Controls / Impulsive Nature<br/>
You don&#39;t agree with me? You are stupid!</p></li>
<li><p>Promiscuous Sexual Behavior / Infidelity<br/>
More in the sense to be the &quot;alpha male&quot;. But they are sometimes associated with rapes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Normal scientists sometimes copy some of this behaviour. Sadly many don&#39;t see how bad this behaviour is.</p>

<p>See also:<br/>
<a href="http://www.skepticalaboutskeptics.org/">http://www.skepticalaboutskeptics.org/</a></p>

<p>Now go talk to some scientists about 9/11 from the AE911 standpoint and see how many give a sociopathic respond. </p>

<p>I want to show real scientists that we should step away from sociopathic behaviour and just admit: &quot;maybe we are not so special. Maybe we do not know everything, let&#39;s see what we can learn.&quot;  </p>

<p>It seems that many people don&#39;t understand psychology / neurology...  and its implications.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already said, it makes sense that some scientists are psychopaths, since some people are psychopaths and scientists are people. One scientist being a psychopath doesn&#39;t make them all psychopaths.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many &quot;skeptics&quot; that appear in the media show some of these signs:</p>

<p>Some examples, or evidence of scientists showing these signs would be nice.</p>

<p>Most scientists don&#39;t claim to know everything. If they did know everything, they&#39;d be out of a job. Why do you think they become scientists if not to learn more about the world through research and experimentation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people on r/conspiracy and elsewhere have been missing the point.  The events themselves are conspiracies ; the fact that it was coordinated, that the square where it happened in Cologne was closed and the attacks happened after the closing ; that still no cctv footage whereas it&#39;s the area in Cologne where there are the most of them ; that we only rely on &quot; witnesses &quot; ; that the media &quot;hid&quot; it but then covered it, if they didn&#39;t want us to know they wouldn&#39;t broadcast it on the MSM at all , but it was a brilliant method and it got everyone on board and even this sub fell for it.  </p>

<p>It was very efficient too because it was a symbol ( and it was not chosen by accident) : &quot; hordes of invaders attacking our women &quot; it&#39;s meant to move people,  make them react. 
Honestly I think we are just being taken for a ride, a strong anti muslim sentiment is being developed,  and all of Europe is going more and more to the right and I personally believe that it is a way of conditioning people and making sure they have a good public opinion to back up future wars.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been going back and forth on this one. At first I agreed with you, then I went back thinking it was real, but now I&#39;m leaning towards agreeing with you. Either way, it is definitely going to have the intended effect. But I actually think it will not only lead to more support for war but also turn countries against the foreign populations and after the coming wave of false flag attacks (wait and see), it paves the way for support of permanent martial law (to protect &#39;us&#39; from the foreign enemies who live among us and threat us -- and especially our women!! -- at every turn). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t read well.<br/>
I am not saying that they don&#39;t have emotions. Just that the average scientists is less capable in dealing with emotions. That is because they live in their head (most of the time). Plain logic.  </p>

<p>Fun fact: Did you ever go to a group of scientists and ask: &quot;How do you feel?&quot;.  </p>

<p>Additionally, there is some research into sociopaths and brain-scans. It shows that there is not much difference between certain scientists and psychopaths. Very interesting. </p>

<p>Another interesting research is showing that the science community behaves like the mafia. That is because the status is very important and decides if you are in or out of the community.</p>

<p>My conclusion that this is more widespread among science, is based upon the observation of the behaviour of many scientists (in writing and in conversations).   </p>

<p>I would love to add the links, but this is not <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. The place where people have to think for themselves. So do your own research.</p>

<p>I am sorry if you feel attacked by these observations. I do not want to attack anyone, I just want scientists to change their (partially) sociopathic behaviour. </p>
