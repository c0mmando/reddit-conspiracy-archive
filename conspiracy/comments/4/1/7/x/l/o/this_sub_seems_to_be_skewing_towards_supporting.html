        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d be cutting my own throat supporting him. While I really like him, his policies, and his general outlook on things, he openly attacks the rich/ruling class. Now, I am no illuminate, but i&#39;m high income. Very high income (recent, over the past 2-3 years). To support someone like this is to cut my own throat and watch my tax on ordinary income (most of my income) go from 39.4 to what? 45%? 50%? I simply can&#39;t support that. Half my fucking money?</p>

<p>Is there a silver lining that the media isn&#39;t presenting? Something that absolves me of paying MORE in taxes? I employ dozens of people, pay their insurances 100%, 401ks, benefits, advancement, opportunity, training. What am I getting for it under a Sanders presidency other than higher tax obligations?</p>

<p>Lots of people are VERY quick to ignore anything good that I do simply because of my income level. If I donated 90% of my income to charity people would overlook it and only see my gross income. It&#39;s infuriating to be rich enough for people to hate, but not rich enough to where it&#39;s &quot;fuck you&quot; money like the ultra 0.01% are. Beginning to see why the rich have such contempt and resentment for the poor. It&#39;s a non-stop barrage of punishment for winning the game.</p>

<p>For all the people in this sub that claim to be critical thinkers with open eyes, there are remarkably few that recognise &#39;Public Relations&#39; when they&#39;re being drowned in it.</p>

<p>There are Trump shills and Trump supporters. There are Hillary shills and Hillary supporters. There are Hillary shills pretending to be Trump shills, and there are Trump shills posing as Hillary shills, and both sides are masquerading as Sanders shills.

    <div class="md"><p>48%/52% on 2m/10m. Fifty fucking percent. Again, going after regular income as opposed to taking a sliver of capital gains (where the people with actual money get income). Fucking ridiculous. If I crest over 2m i&#39;ve got to find a way to lose a million fucking dollars. Ridiculous way to rally people against their bosses, employers, and those who actually drive the economy. Like it or not, guys like me dumping 100k here and 100k there into investment accounts is what drives your piddly little 401k up 6% this year. Can you imagine a scenario where we say fuck it and double-down on loopholes and offshore? I almost hope Sanders does get elected so you idiots can see how much of an effect a socialist president in the US would have. We&#39;re simply not conditioned for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats what poor tell themselves and the rich encourage poor people to think. dude, the world is cruel and it wont change. in your perspective you think certain things are important, and i have different opinoins. i can stroke a check to ASPCA tomorrow for 20k as if it was my lunch check. Furthermore I actually do that too. You can&#39;t. You&#39;ll have a miniscule impact and i&#39;ll make a huge difference in the betterment of the lives of animals. Yet, NONE OF IT MATTERS. Nothing I do will be credited to me simply because I don&#39;t care about my fellow man, or the poor, right? That&#39;s how it works. You have to be fully committed to being what society says is a good person, or else you&#39;re evil. You could find the cure for cancer, but if you think welfare receipients should have their funding cut, nobody would care about the good works you did, because everyone wants to focus on the negative. knowing this is true (it is, you can&#39;t deny it) why would you fight an uphill battle? me giving away my money would be a giant waste. id get no credit then id be poor. fuck that, and fuck my fellow man.

    <div class="md"><p>you dont have to give away your money to do good things.  furthermore, if thats what youve been doing to make a difference. youre mislead.  if you cut a check for 20,000 to aspca, maybe 2,000 will actually go to their cause.  even then, it will be minimal at best.  stop doing that unless youre just doing it for a tax break.  </p>

<p>i can confidently say ive made differences in several lives.  its a perk of my job as a nurse.  i get people when they are at their absolute worst and i genuinely help them and their family.  doing life saving CPR on someone or giving them nitro to stop a heart attack, or even making a hospice patients last days seem not so bleak, you cant put a price on that.  your own health, you cant put a price on that.  yes you can pay for treatments or whatever, but you cant repair a severed spine.  how does money help you get better?  it cant.  you cant pay someone to hold your hand so you dont die alone.  or at least you could, but you can guarantee that the person doing it will be genuine?  you said earlier you dont have kids, but im sure you have family of some kind.  can you put a value on them?  if you can, youre a sociopath.  but i doubt you are.    </p>

<p>there are many more important things than money, and they are not hard to find or hard to obtain, but they are easy to lose.  </p>

<p>it doesnt matter what society says is good or bad.  i used to be a fucking junkie.  id never tell most people that because youre right, people concentrate on the bad.  i live in a very poor area of america, as a nurse i REALLY have a leg up due to my rate of pay, and some people still give me shit for that.  i dont blame them.  theyre struggling.  but i know im not a terrible person anymore.  thats whats really important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>youre angry over being treated like an asshole just because of your success.  its understandable.  you really didnt deserve this, in fact the opposite is probably true.  but the assholes that are angry and poor are not your teachers.  dont retaliate in kind, because thats how you become what you hate.  you have a chance to do a lot of good, and from what youve told me, i think you try.  but shitty people in shitty situations make it seem not worth it.   </p>

<p>as i said earlier, i live in a poor part of the country.  but i drive a 2012 corolla.  people are all the time looking at me sideways thinking &quot;what a rich asshole, i bet he doesnt have to  worry about shit!&quot;  never mind the fact that i work my tits off 45 plus hours a week.  people are shitty, but you dont have to be.</p>

<p>and as far as black being repressed goes,thats complete bullshit.  they dont know repression.  not in this country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re gonna get shit on on reddit.  I&#39;ve watched quite a few people go from rags to riches and also go from singing &quot;fuck he establishment&quot; to &quot;everything&#39;s gonna be alright&quot; .  It&#39;s fine to not want to shake up the status quo when it&#39;s benefitting you.  But at the same time, recognize that a better future is way better for you in the long run,  especially if you have children. As for voting for Burnie?  It&#39;s a crap shoot.  1% chance he gets in,  less than that that he does what he says.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know i&#39;m beating a dead horse trying to get an understanding from reddit, populated by 20 somethings that were suckered into student loan debt and feel entitled to EVERYTHING 24/7. Believe me, I have to hire these kids and when I give someone with a bachelor&#39;s degree in communications 70k/yr with 100% health, 401k, car, vacations, etc they still bitch about not being fairly compensated. However, it&#39;s my life and my money. I earned it and took on ALL the risk. None of the employees&#39; names are on the personal guarantees. They don&#39;t lose their house if the bsuiness goes belly up so they don&#39;t give a shit. So, it&#39;s OK for them to be shelfish entitled twits, but if i&#39;m greedy about holding onto cash i&#39;m literally hitler. I don&#39;t have, and will never have children. They&#39;re just too expensive and anyone having children are very short sighted. Would you want your child growing up from 2015-2100? Can you imagine the state of the environment, crime, pollution by that time? Selfish move just so you can have a legacy or a baby because it&#39;s fashionable or you&#39;re bored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look.  you pay a tax rate of 10% on your first $120,000.  and from then on youre the higher rate.  unless youre making 10 million a year you dont get the good breaks.  heres the thing:  its essentially how it is now.  yes youre paying slightly more in taxes, but they guys above you are getting it even worse under bernies plan.  </p>

<p>the idea is these tax cuts benefit the middle class, and therefore they have extra money to spend.  its a proven fact that when the middle class gets tax breaks, they spend it.  the rich dont do that.  when they get money from tax breaks, they save it.  becuause THATS HOW THEY GOT RICH IN THE FIRST PLACE.  these ta incentives seem outrageous at  first, but they are better for everyone in the long run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why the trickle-down effect is a load of steaming bullshit. You got your cupful, but instead of contributing to the society that allowed you to become wealthy, you bitch and moan and end up putting your money in tax havens so the government doesn&#39;t &#39;steal&#39; it from you. And so does everyone else like you. Now there&#39;s nothing trickling down. With nothing trickling down there are fewer customers to buy your goods or services. With fewer customers you have to cut corners and fire a few employees. Now you&#39;re directly contributing to rising unemployment, and so is everyone else that is just like you. With so many out of work and unable to purchase consumer goods through a lack of income, your businesses suffer further and you have to take out loans, fire more employees and pay the ones you have even less (of course, they&#39;ll understand that sacrifices must be made in this economy). Now the government is getting even less and wants to raise your taxes, but you bitch and moan some more about how it&#39;s just not fair and explain how tax <em>cuts</em> are the solution. And so the cycle continues, with money trickling offshore until the economy collapses, unless someone steps in and does something about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I shouldn&#39;t get to keep what I earned? If you&#39;re going to argue I didn&#39;t earn it, or I don&#39;t deserve that much - you&#39;re not seeing the whole picture. It&#39;s MY name on the personal guarantees, leases, notes, and contracts that will absolutely RUIN ME FOR LIFE if I don&#39;t keep going after more and more. The employees? They&#39;ll just find a new job. Me? I&#39;d be in a cardboard box. This mentality that everyone is only allowed to gain a certain amount of success then hit a ceiling is proposerous, and a great way to ensure nobody tries to get ahead, or circumvents rules entirely, making the problem worse. I&#39;m guilty of generalizing all 20yr liberals as communist socialist gimmie gimmies, but it also goes both ways. Not all rich and successful people like me are misers trying to rule the world. We are FORCED into this position, otherwise it will be stripped from us.</p>
