        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The mod team has received a large number of reports over the course of the past day regarding a submission that was, for all intents and purposes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/45hnrl/hillary_hoards_sensitive_and_unprotected/">a user&#39;s take on a meme</a>; although the post received over 1,500 net upvotes and sparked a few lengthy discussions threads, it was arguably in violation of rule 8.</p>

<p>The submission prompted the modteam to engage in a fairly lengthy discussion about how to handle posts of this nature; specifically those image-macros that are highly upvoted yet also receive large numbers of reports.</p>

<p>Our standing approach has been to only remove image-macros if they have not yet reached the front page, however, we are having difficulty gauging the feel of the userbase on the issue.</p>

<p>There are a host of negatives associated with these type of image macros; in that they encourage low-quality content, require little thought, and frame complex issues in a way which discourages further research. </p>

<p>Conversely, highly upvoted posts bring viability to the subreddit by way of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and encourage discussion of topics that may otherwise not be covered in conventional (or even alternative) news media.</p>

<p>The mods would very much appreciate any input with regards to the manner in which rule 8 is currently being applied on the subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THe problem is that I didn&#39;t upvote it, and I doubt many other legitimate subscibers here did either.  Because I found it difficult to read the meme, it was poorly done, and it&#39;s message was redundant.

<p>I don&#39;t care about violation of rules.  I care about gaming reddit to propagandize.</p>

<p>In light of these things, I believed that some group gamed this particular post with a bunch of artificial upvotes.  I still find it difficult to believe those upvotes are real.  I wish we had a way to verify; or if those upvotes could be weighted more towards people who have a combined karma in &gt; 500 in this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s assume that the r/conspiracy users typically upvote images far more often than any other type of post. Let&#39;s also assume that there are parties interested in what particular links hit the top slot on this subreddit, which goes to the main front page of all 340,000 subscribers. Perhaps tomorrow there will be a post that paints the Federal Reserve in a bad light on the top slot around 2pm EST. All the Federal Reserve shill has to do is log into a few accounts and throw up a couple images they have been saving. One of those images is bound to hit the top slot, especially if they give it a &quot;push&quot; in the beginning with a few extra accounts. </p>

<p>Would you consider this &quot;censorship?&quot; I certainly would, since pushing the top post to the second slot will cut off at least 90 percent of the potential viewers. The mods should keep this in mind if a great post has been displaced by a shitty image. By &quot;censoring&quot; the shitty image, they are actually preventing censorship. </p>

<p>This is a serious website.

    <div class="md"><p>Very well put. I was thinking more in terms of reaching <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, yet this is an even better point. For all those 300+k subscribers, only a fraction probably visit the page daily, but they will see the top post from this sub on their own frontpage. </p>

<p>If we treat censorship as preventing ideas from spreading, then upvoting shit posts to push out well-researched post is absolutely a form of censorship, and in my mind a much more dangerous and insidious form than banning low-effort image macro posts to prevent such abuse.</p>

<p>This makes me even more adamant in supporting the mods to block image macros.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal take is images with words on them aren&#39;t memes.</p>

<p>Memes are things like suddenly clarity Clarence.  Where the image is recycled garbage and the words are nothing more than a joke about something, regardless of if I agree with the punchline or not.</p>

<p>Frequently we have someone who thoughtfully overlays a picture of some historical figure with a quote from that person.  I don&#39;t think of that as a meme.  I think of it as an info graphic or a less boring way to present a thoughtful quote.</p>

<p>I think we should limit our definition of a meme, and the scope of rule 8 to deal exclusively with &quot;sudden clarity Clarence&quot; and similar things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you do a compromise with a mod-flair that points them out as image macros, and allow users to filter them out?</p>

<p>I personally hate seeing them with hundreds or thousands more upvotes than a well-written self.post, or a new source or piece of evidence on a topic of interest. If the post makes it to r/all, the discussion ends up devolving anyway, so my vote is to enforce rule 8 as you have been.</p>

<p>The picture of a person with a quote of theirs is different to my mind; as it&#39;s a good jumping off point for a decent discussion.</p>

<p>The actual CSS would not be that difficult to do if you end up deciding that&#39;s the direction you&#39;d like to take, but again, the mod load might be prohibitive, though probably not much more so than outright deleting the posts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the much bigger issue here; we&#39;re conflating the two.  A picture with a description on it is not a meme.

<p>A picture of soldiers guarding poppy fields and then stats on heroin production dipping on 9/11 is actually an INFOGRAPHIC</p>

<p>Meme != Infographic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should continue to operate as you presently do: ban memes, and use your discretion as to when you will allow them.</p>

<p>Police everywhere use discretion.  Sometimes the written law just shouldn&#39;t be enforced, for whatever particular reason has arisen in the situation.  You will never have a perfect code of laws that should always be applied without exception.  Written laws simply cannot anticipate every possible human situation in advance.</p>

<p>I say: Keep rule 8, and keep exercising discretion when enforcing it.</p>

<p>I appreciate <a href="/u/FlyTape">/u/FlyTape</a>&#39;s view that a macro image can be more like an infographic, and that a meme usually involves the re-use of an image.</p>

<p>In particular, a meme GIF usually involves the re-use of a <em>suggestive</em> image.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Socially-awkward penguin is used to transmit ideas involving a two-step process of awkwardness, then redemption.</li>
<li>Dr. Evil and His Minions are used to transmit ideas involving evil authorities making evil conspiracies and laughing about the impact on the civilians.</li>
<li>I Don&#39;t Always/Dos Equis is used as referential-to-TV humor suggesting that some action being contemplated is not to be taken lightly, but, if it is to be performed, should be performed to the max.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, that list could go on and on, but you see the pattern: the image references a suggestion, the text fits a template of meanings and senses, and, presumably, the neural pathways activated have some neurons in common -- in particular the two-part twist that is used in each thought.</p>

<p>I think it might be worthwhile to ban all macro images that convey a thought-twist or otherwise hypnotizing message.  But, today&#39;s macro image has that property, and wasn&#39;t that bad, really.  It wasn&#39;t that great, either.</p>

<p>Recently, there was an Albert Pike macro-image which purportedly quoted Pike.  It was not a meme: it didn&#39;t re-use an image / it was an image of the purported speaker or writer being quoted; it did not have a two-part-twist / it was just a quote.</p>

<p>But it also wasn&#39;t exactly <em>information</em>.  There was no citation given allowing a person to even verify that the quote was reportedly made in a particular medium or at a particular time.  For example, was this a quote from his purported visionary three world wars letter?  Lack of a citation made the macro image a little bit more propaganda.</p>

<p>Propaganda wants the reader to believe with critique.  The CIA introduces mental &quot;slides&quot; to prevent people from verifying facts.  Extremists in the reality movement tend to use unsubstantiated &quot;facts&quot; or unverifiable references to do the same thing.  Both sides are extremists using propaganda.</p>

<p>So, in short: use discretion.  Be clear what you think a <em>meme</em> is, and don&#39;t disallow info-graphics.  Be clear what you think is the difference between <em>informing</em> and <em>propaganda</em>.  A thing can be wrong, but why would it hide the minimal information needed to converse about it.</p>

<p>This does not mean I think the sub should adopt the Wikipedia affectation of intelligence and skepticism (an oxymoron): {cn} or Citation Needed is not a reddit thing.  I want to reply to comments without wasting my time gathering citations in the ever-changing Internet.  When I want to spend my time doing that, I got to WIkipedia, which is better-indexed and maintained with an eye for information retrieval.</p>

<p>Anyway, carry on, don&#39;t change the rules.  Except maybe ban some propaganda, and revoke Rule 10.  ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think image macros can both be incredibly powerful in their succinct ability to deliver information (and sometimes highlight contradictions - such as the aforementioned Hilary post), but also think that in the same vein, they are most of the time the opposite of thought-provoking and generally do not instigate any meaningful discussions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m torn on this (and have been for my years being active here) - where low-effort image-macro posts sometimes gain the top spot quickly and direct attention away from some very important topics and discussions that occur here (less so than in the past, but that&#39;s another discussion) more often than not.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to hold the community here to a higher standard, but realize that sometimes the topics here can get pretty heavy and a simple image macro/meme post that gets a discussion going can certainly be worthwhile.</p>

<p>We do have <a href="/r/conspiracymemes">/r/conspiracymemes</a>... but I&#39;m not sure how much crossover exists between the two regarding subscribers.</p>

<p>I have seen posts and discussions like this generally slide the sub in a better direction than not - and maybe this type of discussion is all we need. I guess only time will tell. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t cross over exist, James? Both <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> are listed in the sidebar. You know that at least I personally subscribe to and read both subreddits. Maybe you mean something else and I&#39;m confused by what you&#39;re saying?</p>

<p>I should say though I don&#39;t feel comfortable making an attempt to promote <a href="/r/ConspiracyMemes">/r/ConspiracyMemes</a> here because it is already listed in the sidebar. (For those of you that don&#39;t know it can be a HUGE pain in the neck to get sidebar formatting correct and there is a character limit.) I think it would detract from actual discussions taking place and this sub already has enough people doing that for more dubious reasons.</p>

<p>Finally if anyone has any questions relating to <a href="/r/ConspiracyMemes">/r/ConspiracyMemes</a> please feel free to contact me by private message, modmail or whatever way works best. I am a moderator of that subreddit.</p>

<p>Memes alone should NOT be removed, but MOVED to a meme section; however, if the meme is used to support an above statement or article they should be encouraged.</p>

<p>As a web designer i can tell you an image helps increase the length of time user stays on a page which is good, but it shouldnt be the only thing in the post. </p>

<p>So, submit your thoughts or article with a meme :D </p>

<p>When that happens, the mods have to step in and do something otherwise the sub will become an absolute shitfest - Like <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> did before the mods banned memes. </p>

<p>Now if you visit <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> you&#39;ll see actual articles and quality content. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It comes down to whether we want this sub to make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with shitposts, or have good discussions here that don&#39;t make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> as often. I vote for the latter.</p>
