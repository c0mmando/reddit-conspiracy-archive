       I don't believe in flat Earth theory. But if the Earth was really flat, what would be the real reason for lying? Earth is globe, flat, who gives a f***? What would it change?

       I think there is more to it than what you are asserting.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the world was flat it could mean one of two things, both of which would be of overwhelming importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) If the world was flat and encompassed by hostile barriers (cold at the perimeter, hot underneath and lacking air at top) it would imply a creative being, or beings.  These could be super-intelligent "engineers" so to speak, or God, or gods.  Think of this as the "Truman Show" scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a world that has been led to believe that we are an insignificant speck in a limitless universe and that we are nothing special, just a happy accident on a backwater planet.  Suddenly it is revealed that we are unique, created being and the center of attention
to higher powers that we can't comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) IF the world was flat and Antarctica is indeed the edge and barrier, there could easily be more land beyond this barrier once you pass through the inhospitable frozen zone.  This could be the proverbial Atlantis or Lemuria scenarios for example.  Also, think of living in a time before the "New World" was discovered.  Suddenly a group of people found out there was an entirely new world and they could escape and not be controlled by kings etc.  There was suddenly limitless land and resources not controlled by any sovereign nation.  Freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these powers that be had this happen once, and they also knew of far greater lands to the south containing vast resources out of their control, wouldn't they like to prevent large numbers of people migrating there?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if other groups/civilizations are  there and more advanced than we and are the source of many of our technological advancements?  Wouldn't they strive to cover this up and maintain their monopoly on these advancements?
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly was the point of Operation High Jump, a well established military operation in 1947 and not some shady rumor?  Admiral Byrd and James Forrestal weren't exactly fringe players.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is two possibilities why this isn't a pointless discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know what I think anymore lol.

       Those are two really well thought out points to be honest. Flat earth aside, I could see these scenarios existing in some form or another anyway.

       IF the world WAS flat.

      <p>
       The lie would be to hide the creator and maintain a society of content worker bees that think they don't matter and that they are random variations of apes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you understand consciousness from a satanist perspective you know that if a person believes that they live on a globe when they actually do not, then that person is quite literally "unconscious."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a flat-earther and I am not religious.  I am merely answering your question.  Satan and God may not exist but you best believe that satanists do exist.

       Dubay says it better than I can:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This modern-atheist-big-bang-heliocentric-glo­be-earth-chance-evolution paradigm spiritually controls humanity by removing god, or any sort of intelligent design, and replaces purposeful, divine creation with haphazard random cosmic coincidence. And so, by removing earth from the motionless centre of the universe, these masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the earth is the centre of the universe then the ideas of god, creation and a purpose for human existence are resplendent, but if the earth is just one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars and billions of galaxies, then the ideas of god, creation and a specific purpose for earth and human existence become highly implausible. So by surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist sun worship not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If there's no god then everyone's just an accident and all that really matters is me, me, me. They've turned Madonna, the mother of god, into "the material girl living in a material world", their rich, powerful corporations with their slick sun-cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their science, vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, watch their movies, all sacrificing our souls at the altar of materialism.

      <p>
       As far as us having differing definitions, I agree.  I am a layman myself.  I am just trying to point out that the perpetrators of this lie would not be layman, they would be the elite.  The elite also happen to be satanists.  If you are more interested in this check the video I linked.

       I can tell you that the main point of the flat earth psyop is to discredit all conspiracies by lumping them together and therefore making them easy to dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually most conspiracies are based on some covered-up evidence but this one is based on a complete lack of evidence and even plausible reason for its existence.

       The entire point is to discredit the conspiracy community by association. The best thing you can do is
       <em>
        stop giving it attention
       </em>
       . Stop posting about it. Do not reply to it.
       <em>

       I have to say, after watching that video I now have some questions about my own long held beliefs of the earth being a globe. The mind blown moment was seeing - on the image presented in the video - Antarctica as a ring holding in the oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
       That personal revelation aside; I did have the same initial opinion that this debate or questioning of the official narrative will be used to discredit the conspiracy community. REGARDLESS of the truth, be the earth flat or a globe, this will be used to mock the conspiracy community.

       The conspiracy here isn't whether or not the Earth is flat or not (it's not), the conspiracy is to distance us from the truths in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we begin to question the most basic level of our human knowledge, what is left to lose? The flat Earth theory may as well be bigfoot or lizard people, purposefully being stirred into the mix to make credible and factual "conspiracies" seem just as implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't take my word for it. Go buy a drone camera or a weather balloon to record video footage in the sky, it's pretty clear there is a curve to the planet.

       I think the opposite is a better question: Since the Earth has been proven to be a sphere, and really was only considered flat by naive ideologues in the ages before modern science, what is the agenda for insisting it's flat in this day and age?
