        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a prediction: The CIA has acknowledged the USA is headed for societal collapse if we don&#39;t inact some major social reforms. As more and more people become unemployed due to the coming revolution in robotics and AI, unrest will exponentiate. 911Truth goes viral and the gov becomes essentially illegitimate.  Militias and mobs descend on the billionaires and torture some of them (ISIS style).</p>

<p>But there&#39;s some smart ones today who realize this reality and know the only way to prevent this is to eradicate poverty and give all a chance to get the education needed to possibly be a productive part of the economy even if it&#39;s just fixing and programming robots. </p>

<p>And so I applaud this shift even if conspiracy truths are shelved for a few years. Human suffering must stop and education will promote peace.</p>

<p>Should be a good show to see &#39;the people&#39;s revolution&#39;. Sanders is the real deal but also is the frontman for the elites who are scared to death of their otherwise life-threatening future. Guess the people did win after all... Prevent the Burn, instead FeelTheBern</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders probably wont even be nominated. The Super Delegates are all on Hillary&#39;s side. It would take a land slide victory for Sanders to sway that.</p>

<p>If he does get nominated he wont beat Donald Trump. Who by the way if he really was able to do what he wanted, and get our trade deals with places like China renegotiated, and tax imports he could create a lot of jobs, and help fix the economy for many more years to come. Delaying the need for this socialist revolution until the robots really are a problem. Right now wages are so suppressed people are cheaper than robots in most cases.</p>

<p>If Sanders somehow did get nominated, and did beat Trump then he still has to try to get his policies through Republican majority held House/Congress. Good luck. Really i&#39;m sorry to say it but people are wasting a lot of time, and money on Sanders. America is another 20 to 30 years away from being willing to accept Socialism. Though our economy could collapse well before then if something isn&#39;t done to stop job outsourcing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical socialism and the illusion of free money. Bernie wants $18trillion in new spending/taxes with 52% being the top bracket. Jobs will move from the US so quick your head will spin. It isn&#39;t the robots you have to worry about, it is the cheap foreign labor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most important source of New Deal revenue were excise taxes levied on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, matches, candy, chewing gum, margarine, fruit juice, soft drinks, cars, tires (including tires on wheelchairs), telephone calls, movie tickets, playing cards, electricity, radios — these and many other everyday things were subject to New Deal excise taxes, which meant that <strong>the New Deal was substantially financed by the middle class and poor people.</strong> Yes, to hear FDR’s “Fireside Chats,” one had to pay FDR excise taxes for a radio and electricity! A Treasury Department report acknowledged that excise taxes “often fell disproportionately on the less affluent.” <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/how-fdrs-new-deal-harmed-millions-poor-people">http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/how-fdrs-new-deal-harmed-millions-poor-people</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i have to say I actually think democracy serves a major purpose even with the corruption and Diebold vote fraud tends to bend the rules if it&#39;s &quot;a tie&quot;. Bottom line TPTB need social cohesion and the election serves to prove who&#39;s the best to serve up the dish. Maybe Trump will be their man, he&#39;s already talking about Medicare for all and a protective tariff. Right now we&#39;re just seeing the song and dance for Clinton until she finally realizes, like bush, no money, support, or propaganda can make her legit to the masses. Shell cave eventually when she sits down with her real masters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think we&#39;ve ever had democracy?  First of all, it&#39;s matter of factly a republic, not a democracy.  We say, &#39;democratically elected&#39; republic, but it&#39;s not that either, you said so yourself with the diabold frauds....who caused that?  the spooks.</p>

<p>Also, we&#39;ve seen in these last couple of weeks--superdelegates are bought by powerful interests (Hillary), despite and in contradiction to popular support.  So it&#39;s not even a democratically elected public.  It&#39;s a kakistocratically-elected republic.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not even that, since we&#39;re still in a state of emergency and military intelligence community is still allowed to ignore federal laws in order to protect our government.  So essentially it&#39;s some strange hybrid of a deep state cryptocracy and a oligarchically-elected pseudorepublic.  Folks like Chris Hedges call this inverted totalitarianism or an &#39;illiberal democracy&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m certainly no fan, but I think in one year it&#39;ll be madame president.  The networks are clearly in clintons corner.  Wall street wants clinton.  Israel wants clinton.  The debate the other night proved the DNC is doing everything it can to subvert Sanders.  Call me a pessimist, but unless people take to the streets and you see a wave of support sweep the nation, one in which they demand Sanders... it&#39;s not going to happen.  Super delegates can still vote for Clinton in the primary, no matter what the masses want.</p>
