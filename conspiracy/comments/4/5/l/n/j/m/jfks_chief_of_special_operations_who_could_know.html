       <strong>
        L. Fletcher Prouty was a colonel in the Air Force and eventually was promoted to Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under JFK.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       He wrote a book called
       <em>
        The Secret Team
       </em>
       that explains how this country functions. Some quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "At the heart of the Team, of course, are a handful of top
executives of the CIA and of the National Security Council (NSC),
most notably the chief White House adviser to the President on
foreign policy affairs. Around them revolves a sort of inner ring of
Presidential officials, civilians, and military men from the Pentagon,
and career professionals of the intelligence community." (25)
      </p>
      <p>
       "President Nixon and his Secretary of the Treasury, George Schultz, established a
Russian/American organization called the 'USA-USSR Trade and
Economic Council,' in 1972. Its objective was to bring about a
union of the Fortune 500 Chief Executive Officers of this country,
among others, such as the hierarchy of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, with their counterparts in the Soviet Union. This
important relationship, sponsored by David Rockefeller of Chase
Manhattan Bank and his associates, continued through the Carter
years. The bilateral activity increased significantly during the
Reagan/Shultz years of the Eighties despite such 'Evil Empire'
tantrums as the Korean Airlines Boeing 747 Flight 007
'shootdown' in 1983." (20)
      </p>
      <p>
       To non conspiracy theorists:
       <strong>
        these words are from a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was awarded 15 medals for his military service. By refusing to open your eyes, you just hurt yourself.
       </strong>

       L.Fletcher Prouty is one of the most underrated whistleblowers of that era.
      </p>
      <p>
       His audio interviews with David Ratcliffe are a wealth of information. Eg: How Gary powers in the U2 were brought down intentionally to ruin the peace talks, his experiences with Standard oil during WWII just to name a couple of examples. I can't recommend him enough.

       Thank you for sharing.  Victor Marchetti's book,
       <em>
        The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence
       </em>
       , made many of the same points about the structure of power.  And Noam Chomsky has covered this concept in-depth too, most notably in
       <em>
        World Orders Old and New
       </em>
       .

       The interesting thing is that we can name the people who held these open positions in government, like the National Security Adviser.  What makes this more interesting is that we do not know who holds the same position in the shadow government as explained by Richard Clarke - that there is an open National Security Adviser who we can see and there is a secret National Security Adviser who we cannot see, which is repeated throughout the bureaucracy from the C.I.A. to the DOD to the White House and even into the Oval Office.

       If you actually read Prouty's "The Secret Team", you will discover that it is largely a hit piece on the CIA, in an effort to protect and enhance his beloved military. You can view it as a propaganda piece in a turf war between the DOD and CIA in an effort to get funding/budget. This is not to say that many of the things he says there are not true, but to take with a spoonful of salt.

       "1*. Since this was written the British government has taken a series of legislative measures in the fields of banking and finance to guarantee the change to the Gold Standard. Here we seem to have a “great victory” for British capitalism actual fact Britain’s decline is nowhere expressed more clearly than in this financial achievement. Britain was compelled to carry out this expensive operation through the pressure of the gold-backed American dollar, and the financial policy of her own dominions which were orientating themselves increasingly towards the dollar and turning their backs on the pound sterling. Britain could not have accomplished this recent step towards gold currency without extensive financial “aid” from the United States. Bur that means that the fate of the pound sterling is becoming directly dependent on New York” The United States is taking into its own hands a mighty weapon of financial impression. Britain is being compelled to pay a high interest rate for this dependence. The dividends will be charged against an already ailing industry. In order to hinder the export of her own gold she is forced to cut back the export of her own goods” At the same time she cannot refuse to transfer to gold currency without hastening her own decline in the world capital market” This fatal combination of circumstances brings on a feeling of severe malaise among the British ruling classes and gives rise to malevolent but impotent grumbling in the Conservative press itself. The Daily Mail writes: “By accepting the Gold Standard the British government is giving the Federal Reserve Bank (which is in practice in the power of the United States government) the possibility of creating a monetary crisis in Britain at any moment it chooses. The British government is bringing the whole financial policy of its own country into submission to a foreign nation ... The British Empire is being mortgaged to the United States”. “Thanks to Churchill”, writes the Conservative newspaper, the Daily Express, “Britain is falling under the heel of the American bankers”. The Daily Chronicle expresses itself more decidedly: “Britain is in fact demoted to the position of being the forty-ninth state of America”. It could not be put more clearly or vividly! To all these reproaches (which lack conclusions or perspectives) Churchill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, replies to the effect that there is nothing else for Britain to do but to bring her financial system into conformity “with reality’. Churchill’s words signify: we have become immeasurably poorer, the United States immeasurably richer; we must either fight America or submit to her; in making the pound sterling dependent on American banks we simply translate our general economic decline into the language of currency; we cannot leap over our own heads; we must conform “with reality”. – L.D.T."
