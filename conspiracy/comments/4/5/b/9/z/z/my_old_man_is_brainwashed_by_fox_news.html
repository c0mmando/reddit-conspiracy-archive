If someone brings up a political issue from a different angle than Fox News he will completely tune that person out. He won&#39;t argue with the person but he will not listen at all. He used to work for a major defense contractor and I&#39;m convinced he was brainwashed there. It&#39;s humorous in a way but pretty annoying as well because he will have it on all the time and I&#39;m basically forced to listen to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents, too. They play it 24-7 and just try explaining that something said on TV is not true. My Mom is usually pretty receptive to my views, if not in agreement, but my Dad will get crazy angry with me sometimes. It&#39;s really, really weird, too, as they&#39;re generally very intelligent people.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve tried to do is when the TV news states something completely false that&#39;s easy to refute, refute it, and provide sources. Also, one thing Fox does A LOT of is put footage that has nothing to do with the story being told on. Like, they&#39;ll talk about women being raped by immigrants in Sweden and show Ukrainian protests, not Swedish (or show footage of Swedish women protesting in SUPPORT of the immigrants, assuming no one can read the signs, which is quite choice). Point it out when you see it.</p>

<p>Eventually, hopefully, you&#39;ll break through a little.</p>

<p>This political cycle has been a little less stressful, though, because at least we can all agree that Clinton and Trump are The Worst<sup>tm</sup> and there&#39;s some common ground. But when it gets to the Fox News race-baiting stuff or ANYTHING non-cartoonish about Syria (evil, says Fox) or Israel (always right, says Fox) or Saudi Arabia (a great ally, says Fox) or ISIS (no way we or our allies have aided and abetted them, says Fox), all bets are off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that it&#39;s just some confirmation bias shit going on. They were probably raised with, or adopted views similar to what Fox News espouses. Fox is pretty extreme in their views, as are a lot of older people who are interested in politics, and they&#39;re just circle jerking and affirming their beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox News watchers are people who hate &quot;the government&quot; but are dependent on it.  So they think they&#39;re libertarians, but they&#39;re fed neocon talking points.</p>

<p>So he doesn&#39;t like big government, but he makes his money off of the defense industry.    This means his indoctrination is going to be closely tied to xenophobic fear mongerging which right now is mostly anti-islam, anti- russia and anti-china.  Probably not a lot you can do on the foreign policy thing, because he&#39;s too dependent on the war machine.</p>

<p>What you CAN do though, is focus on the civil liberties aspect- places where fox news is hypoctical.  Play up those things.  Focus on the points Andrew Napolitano is making.  Refute the conflicting points that Krautheimer and Hannity are making.</p>

<p>edit:  your father probably dislikes &quot;the blacks&quot; and &quot;the mexicans&quot;, so when I say &quot;civil liberties&quot;, I basically mean that he doesn&#39;t want to pay taxes.  </p>

When his paycheck is dependent on that system then you are going to have a really hard time persuading him to see things from &#39;another angle&#39; and in fact if you could convince him that FOX is a war mongering propaganda machine, it would force him to call into question his whole life.

    <div class="md"><p>Send him videos of Judge Napolitano when he was on Fox Business. He was canned after exposing some deep truths (you could often find his videos on this very subreddit when he was on the air,) but you can still find some on YouTube. Also, another show on Fox Business called <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/shows/kennedy.html">Kennedy</a> is an anti-war, libertarian perspective that could change his views if he&#39;s a pro-war type-a-guy. There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/shows/stossel.html">Stossel</a> on Fox Business, which is the same. Maybe just switch the channel from Fox News to Fox Business when you&#39;re with him. It&#39;s a small step in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that most people are middle of the road types that have a few issues they are passionate about. Then they hear some talking head espousing the same beliefs and begin to identify with that personality. &quot;If (Pundit) agrees with my beliefs on this, what does he/she have to say about X?&quot; Other, more like minded voices are drawn into the average person&#39;s social circle. Then it becomes an issue of groupthink. The average person is lectured on other, more fringe beliefs and is drawn further to a political wing. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a different tactic you can try. When Fox says something that doesn&#39;t make sense, think about it for a while. Then go ask your dad questions about it.</p>

<p>The thing about asking someone questions is that it gets them thinking again. In fact, when you are curious about something or questioning thing, that&#39;s when your mind is really alive. That&#39;s the time when you&#39;re truly <em>thinking</em>.</p>

<p>You might find your dad doesn&#39;t like to answer a question about something on Fox. He might even get annoying at you for &quot;bugging him&quot; with your questions. That&#39;s because his mind is starting to wake up. When this happens, he&#39;ll begin to realize that things don&#39;t quite add up and it will cause some serious mental discomfort.</p>

<p>If this happens, maybe back off with the questions for a while and give him a break. Then start up again a few weeks later. If you&#39;re lucky, your dad will begin to regain his ability to question and think for himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox&#39;s neocon brand of brainwashing <em>is</em> annoying--but far less toxic in my opinion than MSNBC&#39;s brand of race-hate programming and &quot;speech code&quot; indoctrination.</p>

<p>Not to let Fox off the hook, but I don&#39;t see them dignifying race-hate like MSNBC does with Al Sharpton race-hustling and their promotion of anti-European rhetoric with stuff like &quot;white privilege&quot; and &quot;whitesplaining&quot;.</p>

<p>MSNBC&#39;s attempts to instill self-hate into the host-population is (in my opinion) far more toxic than anything Fox has ever done. </p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: And, by the way, I have long since been unable to tell an aging Rachel Maddow apart from CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper. With thick necks, pinched heads and lizard-y noses, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to distinguish one androgynous news personality from another. <a href="http://unicornbooty.com.207-244-69-7.creativehaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/maddow-cooper.jpg">http://unicornbooty.com.207-244-69-7.creativehaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/maddow-cooper.jpg</a> Maybe they represent a new advance away from our traditional binary system of journalists, with male and female anchors. As in linguistics, words fall under &quot;male,&quot; &quot;female&quot; and &quot;neuter&quot;. In the future all our anchors, will be look-a-like &quot;neuters&quot;. That way, stations can save costs on hiring both a male and a female anchor-person for the desk. Just combine them into one, as a cost-cutting measure. CNN and MSNBC are leading the way into the future! </li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I stopped watching MSNBC and CNN as soon as the Michael Brown shit started. Truth is, a multi-cultural society just does not really work. The different races are like different alien species is the way I see it. The idea that they will all live mixed in with each other in peace and harmony is a fantasy. I think we all need to accept each others differences and make the best of it though. Your right in that outlets like CNN that talk about race 24/7, THEY are the ones that are actually being racist no matter how much they try to tell you otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A thing about CNN.  Younger people think CNN is liberal but CNN just goes where the money is and usually is the first to back the  white house.  Look up older CNN reports just after Bush announced the Iraq war.  You will see that CNN was just like Fox is today.  They where the first big network to back the Iraq war and call anti-war activists anti-American. Basically CNN is a chameleon that will shift political sides depending on what party is in office.  </p>

Right wing news has actually been better than the left wing outlets in more recent times (about a year or so). Considering how sneaky right wing media usually is the left has hit new extreme lows. Left wing news does not give a fuck about facts any more, or about the letting you know the truth. The Huffington Post is now less legitimate than Fox.</p>
