<p>Overall I guess I&#39;ll just never understand this desire to keep something of this nature classified from the public, when the have the right to know the truth.

<p>It&#39;s from a physics teacher.  Actually, its the physics teacher that got NIST to admit that freefall did in fact occur for building 7.  Now, you don&#39;t need a physics or engineering degree to understand why freefall is important.  Its because it is the same as saying that all the support across the entire floor of a building is removed simulaneously.  In the case of WTC7 freefall was for 2.25 seconds.  This means that 8 floors of the building was removed simultaneously.  Like all the support disappeared instantly.  Fire can&#39;t do that.  Think about it.   </p>

<p>Second, NIST doesn&#39;t claim that structural damage from WTC1 and 2 caused the collapse.  What they claim is that fires caused &quot;thermal expansion,&quot; which in turn caused the girder on a <em>single</em> steel beam to fail. See question 5 here:    </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm</a>    </p>

<p>Now, stop and really think about it for a second.  How does thermal expansion of a <em>single</em> beam account for 8 stories of the building being removed instantaneously?  Impossible.   </p>

<p>To make this even more problematic they found steel with holes melted in it.  What the hell caused that?  So interesting that was in this building that collapsed, and yet according to NIST had nothing to do with the collapse.  You don&#39;t find steel with holes in it from office fires.  That&#39;s pretty damn odd isn&#39;t it?  Even odder that they seem to think this has nothing to do with the collapse!  Straight from the horses mouth:    </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf</a>    </p>

<p>The point of all this is that if you take the time to look into the <em>facts</em> and actually <em>think</em> about them, you&#39;ll see that the official explanation is impossible.  If someone doesn&#39;t take the time to look into the facts then they shouldn&#39;t really have an opinion on it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t dig into the details any further than that, I agree that it seems plausible. The problem is that the NIST report (i.e., the government&#39;s own technical report/investigation of the collapse) found that structural damage from the towers did not cause nor was involved in the collapse. They claimed that the collapse was only due to fire. This is a steel tower. No steel tower has every been brought down by fire, nor has one since. </p>

<p>And you know what? They refuse to release the details of their computer model &#39;showing&#39; how the collapse happened. The reason they gave was that it would harm public safety or some such bullshit. Really? Because I think if you wanted to make people safer, you would release the details so that we can design steel skyscrapers that won&#39;t fall down due to a fire. But I guess that&#39;s not how the government thinks. Maybe they&#39;re hiding something...? </p>

<p>This quick 6 minute video should be enough to convince you that it was not due to a fire:

    <div class="md"><p>No, in fact you&#39;re wrong. <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/windsor.html">The parts that collapsed weren&#39;t built like the WTC:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, comparisons between the Windsor tower and the WTC Towers are limited because of the very different structures of these buildings. The Twin Towers and Building 7 were both 100% steel-framed, with large wide-flange columns and box columns, some measuring over four feet wide and fabricated of steel up to five inches thick. Severe fires in other skyscrapers which, like the WTC Towers, were 100% steel-framed, have not produced even partial collapses.</p>

<p>In contrast to the WTC Towers, the Windsor building was framed primarily in steel-reinforced concrete, with columns of concrete reinforced by thin sections of rebar.   The concrete pillars in the Windsor building are clearly visible in the photographs showing the intact core exposed by the collapsed facade. The very light construction of the perimeter, described below, makes it clear that the core was the main load-bearing component of the building.</p>

<p>Before examining the partial collapse of the Windsor building more closely, we note that steel-framed and steel-reinforced-concrete-framed structures behave very differently in fires.</p>

<p>Steel is a good conductor and concrete is a poor conductor of heat. Thus in a fire, a steel frame will conduct heat away from the hotspots into the larger structure. As long as the fire does not consume the larger structure, this heat conductivity will keep the temperatures of the frame well below the fire temperatures. The same is not true of steel-reinforced-concrete structures, since concrete is not a good thermal conductor, and the thermal conductivity of the rebar inside the concrete is limited by its small mass and the embedding matrix of concrete.</p>

<p>Fires can cause spalling of concrete, but not of steel. This is because concrete has a small percentage of latent moisture, which is converted to steam by heat. Thus, a large fire can gradually erode a concrete structure to the point of collapse, whereas a fire can only threaten a steel-framed structure if it elevates steel temperatures to such an extent that it causes failures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: And by the way, the part of the building that collapsed had inner supporting beams made of reinforced concrete. The inner supporting columns of WTC 1 and 2 were made of thick steel beams, like the lower portion of the Windsor. And anyway if you look at the part of the Windsor that collapsed, most of the inner support remained intact. You got your facts both backwards and wrong. Keep up the great debunking work!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll elaborate, though: I favor legalization. Not that I&#39;m not worried about people zonked out on really hard drugs driving and stuff. I am. They will. But most of them are doing it anyway. I say legalize, then revisit after some data becomes available.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, I want to be popular and award-winning and rich. But it&#39;s even more important to me to do work that I can feel proud of. So I rank that priority higher.</p>

<p>Anyone who questions the system should expect censorship, abuse and ridicule, and I have not been disappointed. But it&#39;s not like I enjoy those things.</p>

<p>I dont know much about your work but I checked out your website after I saw the picture of your AMA, which was cute. You look like a good guy that cares about the world.</p>

<p>I noticed your cartoons are mostly political and I wondered if you knew or thought our political system is a trap to get people to support they&#39;re own demise.</p>

<p>When the ruling class exempt themselves from laws they expect us to live by and the system in which they operate grows stronger with each crime it becomes a choice to give your power away to that system, by supporting it with your time, money and energy, or stop playing the game.</p>

<p>If our system of government was a rigged game, like a shady gambling establishment that cheats people out of their money, what would you gain by continuing to visit that establishment? Why don&#39;t more people turn away from Representative politics and instead work in their communities to make the world a better place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I appreciate being called cute. At my age, that doesn&#39;t happen often. (OK, it was my photo that was cute, but whatever.) Anyway...</p>

<p>I think our political system has become a big distraction that prevents people from engaging in a real political process that could lead to actual improvement in their lives.</p>

<p>If most people stopped voting, it would lead to real change. We have a political system without politics.</p>

<p>for example:  </p>

<p>Thomas Drake, William Binney, et. al.</p>

<p>Full Letter: <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/">http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...</p>

<p>...“My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....</p>

<p>...“That’s where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...</p>

<p>...“In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSA’s senior leaders took me off the task because they realized – belatedly, for some reason – that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.</p>

<p>“When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They went after <strong>high ranking military officers</strong>. They went after <strong>members of congress</strong>. The Senate and the House - especially on the intelligence committees, and on the armed services committees and judicial. But they went after other ones too. They went after <strong>lawyers and law firms</strong>. Heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after <strong>judges</strong>. One of the judges is now sitting on the supreme court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after <strong>state department officials</strong>. They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House - their own people! They went after <strong>anti-war groups</strong>. They went after <strong>US companies</strong> that do international business around the world. They went after US banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after <strong>NGO</strong>s like the red cross and people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few anti-war civil rights groups...</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the big one. I haven&#39;t given you any names. This was in summer 2004. One of the papers that I held in my hand was to wiretap a bunch of numbers associated with a 40-something year old wanna-be Senator from Illinois. You wouldn&#39;t happen to know where that guy lives right now, would you? It&#39;s a big White House in Washington DC. That&#39;s who they went after. And that&#39;s the President of the United States now. And I could give you names of a bunch of different people they went after that I saw! <strong>The names and the phone numbers of congress</strong>. Not only the names but it looked like staff people too, and their staff. And not only their Washington office but back home in their congressional offices that they have in their home state offices and stuff like that. This thing is incredible what NSA has done. They&#39;ve basically turned themselves - in my opinion - into <strong>a rogue agency that has J Edgar Hoover capabilities on a monstrous scale on steroids</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Intellectual Property seems non existent these days when it comes to the internet. Authors, writers, cartoonists, musicians, filmmakers, etc., are seeing their work stolen and either given away for free via torrents or worse rehosted and monetized without the authors permission and in many cases with little recourse to stop the hemorrhaging of what little money the content creator could have made via AdSense or other pitiful compensation. Ex: Viral videos are ripped from Youtube and posted by celebrities on Facebook for millions of views, but 100% lost revenue for the Content Creator. Or full record albums or movies are posted by 3rd parties on Youtube, who are then able to monetize for their own benefit. The worst part of all is that these companies like Google or Facebook make no attempt to police the work of the small artist/author, instead only occasionally removing stolen content of those with the financial means to fight it in the courts.</p>

<p>I guess at the end of the day, as a small time artist myself, I feel like I&#39;m drowning. I have the public on one side who consume my product for free and don&#39;t care, and mega companies on the other side who will happily make money off me without regard to whether I&#39;m getting paid my fair portion, or at all.</p>

<p>How do you deal with it. It must be hurting your bottom line. Your books are out there being torented. You cartoons are rehosted on Facebook or here on Reddit all the time without links to your sites. What can we as artists do to stop the hemorrhaging and fight back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you such a shill for the airline industry? Airplanes are not possible, as their shape is not suited for lift. The surface area of an airplane is inadequate compared to alien saucers. Are you part of the airline industry&#39;s propaganda, or are you just willfully ignorant?</p>

<p>If you think you are strategically calling someone a shill when all you did was take some personal satisfaction in doing so and denying yourself an answer, go friend. Keep your head up your ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what &quot;last minute resistance&quot; is. It&#39;s rape to anyone who has any sense of a moral conscience. And you chucklefucks also encourage &quot;negging&quot;, which is emotional abuse to literally everyone else. All redpillers need to be put on a government watchlist, not be allowed to own weapons, and should have their voting rights rescinded. </p>

<p>But hey, if you&#39;re going to shill for Roosh V, then be my guest you waste of human flesh.</p>

In terms of last minute resistance, you seem pretty determined shifting the topic away from my first, on topic, observation :D But you can stick to your ad hominem argument and be happy. Preachers ain&#39;t got nothing to learn.</p>

<p>Like everyone else, I want to be popular and award-winning and rich. But it&#39;s even more important to me to do work that I can feel proud of. So I rank that priority higher.</p>

<p>Anyone who questions the system should expect censorship, abuse and ridicule, and I have not been disappointed. But it&#39;s not like I enjoy those things.</p>
