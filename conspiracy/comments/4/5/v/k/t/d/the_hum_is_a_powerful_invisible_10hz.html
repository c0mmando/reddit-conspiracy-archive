       Dr. Bob Beck is a deceased military intelligence physicist researcher who--along with another--investigated a signal causing interference "ticks" in a shortwave radio in the 80s, now referred to as the "Russian woodpecker".  It's now known that the source of this was a
       <em>
        Russian duga radar tower
       </em>
       .  There is a good amazon Prime documentary on this called "The Russian Woodpecker".

       The original Russian Woodpecker signal ceased upon the decommission of the

       However, it is said to be back again from deeper within Russia, a claim put forth in the aforementioned

        and that I've experienced it personally, following a 6 day, daily treatment of 150mg of ketamine in which my consciousness was severely altered and my senses (hearing and sight) were greatly, greatly enhanced for approximately 7 full days thereafter, and declining steadily into nominal sensitivity (ie; returned to 'normal').  Hearing this 'hum' (the aural version of "they live" glasses) put me on a quest to find out what it was, which I will describe further below.

        the hum is a form of psychotronic mind control

       , and as you recall this was my first gut reaction.  I
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/404rq5/amazon_prime_the_russian_woodpecker_2015/cyrk04q">

       regarding the russian woodpecker signal.

      <p>
       This woodpecker signal was originally
       <a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/excalibur/neurophone.htm">
        investigated by William Blise and Dr. Beck
       </a>
       , after complaints were made by shortwave radio operators originating from Eugene, Oregon. "Bob Beck" was a Doctor of Science and physicist for the intelligence community in the 70s and 80s.

         <a href="http://www.bobbeck.com/pdfs/beck-article-elf-waves-and-eeg-entrainment.pdf">
          He was also the signals int maverick who figured out its purpose, after making many different guesses as to the potential use and very real possibility of psychotronic warfare within perhaps the most interesting 17 pages you'll read in years.
         </a>
        </em>
       </strong>
       The conclusion he comes to regarding these Duga Radar Tower shortwave interfering emissions is
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <em>
          They are reconstructing heterodynes.
         </em>
        </strong>
        Let me tell you why we're getting it and they are not: We are on a 60 Hertz power grid. They are on a 50 Hertz power grid, Get that? That's why they're immune.
        <strong>
         <em>
          Every civilized industrial center in America is a potential reradiating weapon of this Psychotronic ELF Field.
         </em>
        </strong>
        In other words, why should they build antennas, re-radiating systems, when all of us have 110 volt systems in our homes; and we are also served with gas pipes, miles and miles of conductors, cold water pipes, etc.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        Heterodynes
       </em>
       are an electronic term meaning to combine two high-frequency signals with each other to produce a lower frequency.  He's saying that the duga tower uses a shortwave frequency having a harmonic that interferes with our 60Hz electricity grid to induce a standing 10Hz wave from any and all electronics around us.  It's ingenious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beck said russians were unaffected because they are on a 50 cycle grid.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Is there a quick explanation of why 60 cycles wilt pick it up instead of 50?" Right. It's a harmonic! (replies Dr. Beck, and turns on his recording of the audio pan of the Russian broadcast) at 5.340 Megahertz. The growl was because we have a voltage control — or rather the VFO on the receiver. That was at 5.340 megahertz and we were listening to — in other words, since you cannot hear the fundamental (the actual ELF wave) we have the local oscillator on the super heterodyne receiver running. It is a global problem
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By
       <em>
        "super heterodyne receiver"

       he means
       <strong>
        <em>
         our entire electrical grid.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: If we are getting bombarded by this duga radar signal, an assertion purported by the film "The Russian Woodpecker (2015)", and which I believe is the phenomenon of the "hum" I experienced in Summer 2014, then we are all getting bombarded by an invisible 10Hz Electromagnetic wave all the time.  And so why is this happening and why is the Obama Administration doing anything about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: A user pointed out the distinction that there are acoustic (sound) waves and electromagnetic (radio) waves.  You cannot hear radio waves.  The low threshold of human hearing is around 30Hz for sound waves, and this 10 Hz wave is electromagnetic (radio wave) so it's neither acoustical (not audible) nor is it within the range of human hearing.

        For the sake of clarity, I am therefore making this claim that the hum is an electrical phenomenon that occurs within the auditory cortex of the brain, not 'heard by the eardrums'.

       This phenomenon is real and there is a product on the market that demonstrates this effect, called the

       I experienced this hum for a week following exposure to medical ketamine treatment.  This hum was everywhere, but varied depending on where I was.  I went into a cave, a steel box and it diminished, which suggested it was not 'imaginary'; it also seemed to come from the NORTH.

      <p>
       After receiving 6 rounds of ketamine near Wall St in NY for 2 decades of treatment resistant depression, I heard a strange 'hum' that sounded like a massive diesel engine idling in the distance.  One thing I should tell you is that I saw an audiologist a year prior to treatment, and I had developed 40% hearing loss in my right ear from various wakeboarding and firecracker injuries in my youth, and a myringotomy (lanced eardrum) decades ago in Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Postoperative ketamine treatement, and my hearing in the right ear is beyond 100% restored.  I could hear people talk again, mosquitos buzzing near me, and of course, this annoying low frequency
       <em>
        'hum'
       </em>
       .  Given the other enhancements, maybe it's a
       <strong>
        high class problem
       </strong>
       , I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon exploring this noise in NJ, I found it was a
       <em>
        'noise rainbow'
       </em>
       , a northerly phenomenon that could never be
       <em>
        reached
       </em>
       .  As I was exploring in my post-K mental-fragility, I found myself poking around an electronic billboard behind WalMart in Seacaucus, when something about 9/11 popped in my head, perhaps from the imagery on the billboard itself, an Ad for the Marines perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that instant, in a bitter knife-twist from angelic, intrepid
       <em>
        pronoia
       </em>
       to abject
       <em>
        paranoia
       </em>
       , 5 goddamned tan chinooks in linear formation emerged from apparently nowhere, in the distance, north of Walmart.  (Actually they emerged from a base there--I saw on google maps later). They turned the moment I noticed them, and came right towards me.  Within minutes, they were not more than 100 feet above the walmart, passing directly overhead, a bay opened with a soldier looking down.  What-the-actual-F.  The chinooks continued on towards, strangely, towards the Wall Street area where I had been receiving treatment (adjacent Fed Reserve bldg).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even want to know what went through my mind, in the magically post psychedelic personally-meaningfulness state I was in.  Needless to say, I had to verify with Walmart employees on their smoke break that what just happened actually did (I was concerned I was maybe having a psychotic break).
      </p>
      <p>
       My immediate thought was, "did my paranoia just manifest chinooks?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Second thought, "did they read my mind and reroute to 'check out this strange possible terrorist', milling around the dirty urban shelterbelt between walmart and the highway looking at wild asparaguses, poking condoms with cattails and clearly looking for something?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Third thought "mind control waves, man." ... That the government, or aliens, or someone was using this nominally-subsensory sound to make people super apathetic, uncritical, cowish.  I had my internal
       <em>
        they live
       </em>
       moment of what-the-
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       .  And
       <em>
        they knew, that I knew
       </em>
       .
      </p>

        </em>
        , made me believe I was not supposed to investigate the hum any further.

       I was not supposed to investigate abusive art such as pre-CCTV surveillance servitors, the hovering gargoyles atop italian rennaissance architecture of gotham city NY or the bizzarely informative,

       I drove home to NC after a mandatory hotel stay (Dr. said subway/bus only--no can drive until 24 hrs after infusions).  Taking a drive-break in Bethesda, MD after an exhausting rainstorm and DC beltline traffic, I stopped off in the "American Plant" nursery (sounds so conspiracy doesn't it?  It's where Holmes-Joker was brainwashed).  My other senses like vision, similarly enhanced by the ketamine
       <em>
        afterglow
       </em>
       , made me extremely intested in an the vibrant display of a multitude of various
       <em>
        Coleus
       </em>
       plants--colors I'm quite sure I've never seen before in my life.  As I'm tripping out on colors, there it is again, that goddamned hum, off in the distance.  Also, northerly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get home in western NC, there it is again, thousand+ miles apart.  Again Northerly.
      </p>
      <p>
       These feelings had me investigate this hum.  I begin to suspect this is either a HAARP thing, some kind of innate human brain phenom that we simply ignore eventually like tinnitus, ELF waves over topography of hills, collective urban noise, or even the shumann response.  I played with my subwoofer and audacity to try to match the hum sound.  I came to the conclusion that it was certainly below 60Hz and possibly 50hz, 40hz, 33Hz or 23Hz.  It was hard to pin down.  Below 18-23 ish Hz I could hear nothing, and it's possible that the woofer likely wasn't capable of a sine or square wave that low as it's not designed for it and also since I didn't even feel silent pressure or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further online investigation led me to the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hum">
        Bristol Hum and Taos Hum

       .  The Taos hum was no doubt caused by the experimental nuclear testing in the area,

       .  The weird horns of Jericho noises on Youtube.  No, it's not this, not that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike Taos's hum, my ketamine-hum you could not move away from.  It was everywhere and at a low intensity, a background hum suggesting a massive diesel engine idling, present at the same intensity everywhere
       <em>
        outside
       </em>
       , you could go inside and it was severely dampened but not gone.  With earplugs inside, you could still hear it but very faintly.  I experimentally verified that moving in and outside changes it's 'volume' like moving a volume knob.

       Still searching online, I ended finding the Windsor Hum of Detroit--no doubt caused by god-knows-what is happening on Zug Island, the location of

       foundry that had sat cold for over a decade prior to sonically driving the low income / black people out the poorer ares of SE Detroit with unbearable noise, and consequently inducing the rest of the Detroit to implode thereafter (this is my original conspiracy theory...you heard it here first).  There was a fully funded documentary that was never made on indiegogo and you will note that
       <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zug-island-the-story-of-the-windsor-hum">
        the contents and details of this film are now gone

        someone archived it on archive.is.

       Of course, you won't hear about this, any of this.  The establishment has managed to have a 'carry on', nothing to see here, about this kind attack.  They want you to think that because we have a convention that it's not happening--either in Russia or by our own government.  Why is it we never heard

      </p>
      <p>
       When Fukushima melted down, was there a duga tower nearby?  What about the massive explosion near Taijin, was there a duga tower near there also?  Or a nearby supercomputer facility?  Did they blow it up or did we?  Makes one wonder.

       To dispell your thoughts, emf waves are not audible except from a radio reciever put to a speaker.  So you are right, it doesn't produce sound. Infra sound however can make sounds in your skull by bouncing the sound inside your skull. So only you hear it.

       That was thinking actually.  That biologically active energy can induce the phenomenon of sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was talking about a radio wave but one cannot hear a 10Hz acoustic sound either.  Anything below 30Hz is inaudible. I was thinking that the 10Hz standing wave was creating the phenom of sound, not that you were 'hearing a 10 Hz radio wave hum' per se.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for pointing this distinction out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have clarified that, or I should go back and clarify it with an EDIT.  There is a link in the above exploring what a 10Hz wave can do, but it's easy to miss.

       This article was a quick kind of disjointed copypasta of another thing I wrote that was stuck at '0' upvotes from a while back about Dr. Beck creating a blood electrification device that kills parasites.  Essentially it's a rife machine he proved worked and made it and the plans available for free since the us patent and trade office and the FDA would not allow it!  I think he gave it as plans for research device or a novelty device.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I own a flanagan
       <em>
        neurophone
       </em>
       , and it uses electrical energy to induce the phenomenon of sound.  So I am aware of the concept.  I also know about post John Lilly research on microwave-to-auditory-cortex research which is all published and available for anyone to see.   My point in this is that it's absolutely a real phenomenon and not a 'what if'  The neurophone is a precedent of the application of this technology availble to consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the Neurophone is wild.  You put it on and you're dumbfounded that people around you cannot hear what your'e hearing.  It seems like the sound is coming from the electrodes, but it's not (well technically the energy
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       ), but the energy is tuned to the auditory cortex of the brain.

       No, that is overruled by new research. The german authority PTB (physical-technical federal office) finalized studies about that last year. They show, that people can "hear" (more feel) down to 1 Hz, but you need insane sound pressure levels as lower the frequency is. At 1 Hz you need 170 dB.
      </p>
      <p>
       And: tonality is missing under about 40 Hz.

       The microwave auditory effect is by itself very interesting, but operates at very (!) high impulse energies normally not found outside in the wild. So i am quite sure that it does not explain the hum.

       You can almost for sure, contest to that they have very operational systems above the 10mW/cm

       limit to fuck with peoples minds. If you start hearing shit, create a faraday hat or protection gear and fuck them back :D It gives the tinfoil hat a new meaning, but I would do it if I was attacked with that capability. Also the microwave range is very easy  to direct with pinpoint accuracy.

       what is going on with that google maps street view? I'm new here so the tesseract's stargate stuff makes no sense to me. Ill try looking up some stuff but if you could explain why the google maps freaks out when you look at that point a little clearer, I'd be grateful.

       That's what I thought, It looks almost intentional that it looks like that. On the other hand it looks it could be a glitch, but then why would they put it up and leave it like that on googlemaps?

       Well as to the reasoning its still there, they'd probably need to send another camera car or direct a satellite to look at that spot (don't remember how they get all the images). Pretty inconvenient fix if it is just a glitch. Even if they do know it's there I doubt they'd be in any rush to fix it, it is just that one spot after all.

       ye, its pretty cool regardless of the reasoning behind it. I wonder if google even realizes its there, as far as I know its really only one point on the map so it'd probably be fairly easy to miss if it is a glitch.

       Good stuff 322. I often feel as if some piercing sound is audible in the late hours of the night, to an uncomfortable level. However I know next to nothing about it, even if I'm only noticing it now because of the stuff I've been researching.

       Heard this hum since I was a little kid. 
I remember specifically asking my mom one day when I was about 8 years old "why do we have the word "silence" when it can never really be silent at all with that constant buzzing sound??" She didn't know how to answer me because I don't think she heard it like I did.
Thanks for posting this, its good to be reminded that what's normal for some (hearing the hum) isn't necessarily what's right and we need to take a stand.

       I'm beginning to wonder if more people are becoming privy to this "hum".
 I watched an Xfiles episode the other night regarding a sharp hum that was torturing the individual effected but unheard to those around them. Got me thinking that they're using these things as plot lines in popular shows now to discredit people who LEGITIMATELY experience that.

       If you are trying to say, "yes there are unshielded devices everywhere in your home that are permeating us with small, mostly harmless electromagnetic leakage ("electrosmog")" then yes, you are correct.

      <p>
       If however you're trying to use sarcasm "oh yeah and there's this AC thing in our houses, DERP"  to discredit or downplay the idea that we're being attacked by conflating it with the above electrosmog concept, then it's a total straw man argument and as a pseudoskeptic, you fail at your aim.

       the first harmonic is 120 Hz and goes up from there to 960hz
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are saying 60Hz is itself a harmonic of another frequency, then you're correct, except that's not factual. We are on a 60Hz system.

       I am not sure if we are talking about the same noise.   Mine I could prove was not inside my head because physical changes in the environment changed / stopped the noise (gun earmuffs inside a gun safe) in testable/predictable ways.  It was not an auditory side effect of the drug with an origin source of the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't waste your time with drug side effect phenomenon. It's not my way to spread disinfo
      </p>
      <p>
       I talked to my doctor about this and according to him it was not a side effect of being fucked up.  I experienced it for a month, most prominently for the first week.  If I meditate deeply, now 2 yrs later, I can hear it very weakly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, there is a K afterglow in which your senses are enhanced.  There is a real physical reason for that afterglow.  It's that the membrane potential of neuronal mitochondria has been reduced, allowing ions to travel across them more readily/easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roughly translated, neuronal signal strength is enhanced, meaning activity is amplified.  Sensorial inputs are stronger, processing is stronger, cognition overall is stronger.  It is quite literally like the film 'limitless'

       Very interesting is the ketamine part, cause ketamine is a strong NMDA receptor antagonist, and the NMDA receptor plays a major role in hearing. So that was a manipulation at the heart of hearing.

       Sure, there is a hum, and i also hear it. It has very distinct characteristics from tinnitus. But i do not think it is a conspiracy thing, at least there are some good explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern civilization has a lot of artificial noise sources not known before. And it has a lot of sources of electromagnetic fields and waves. By now the sources found i know of were steel companies (80 km away from the people), a brewery, wind energy power plants, air heat pumps, high pressure gas pipelines, streets etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the hum is not the sound pressure level, the problem is the signal/noise ratio of parts of it.
