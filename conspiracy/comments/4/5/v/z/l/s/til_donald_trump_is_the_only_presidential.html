<p>But one politician recently made an impression: Donald Trump.</p>

<p>According to Gage, Trump is the only presidential candidate or major public figure who has written the Truther group a custom letter after being sent their DVDs and literature. Trump&#39;s campaign, Gage said, thanked the members of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth for their “continued support.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your book and DVDs,” read the email, which Gage forwarded to me. “Our advisors will investigate the claims made by the architects and engineers more thoroughly and draw their own conclusions from there. We appreciate your continued support. Sincerely, The Trump Campaign.”</p>

<p>Gage and his group were starstruck. “Someone actually acknowledged we took the time to send them something and said they would look at it,” Gage said. “That’s historic at this level of politics, a presidential candidate.”</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>THIS IS NOT A PARODY ARTICLE</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Times">International Business Times</a> (which is a normal, everyday MSM business news website) published this on 9/11/15. About a month later, the parody website <a href="http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/donald-trump-promises-to-reopen-911-investigation-if-elected/">World News Daily Report</a> lifted/stole the above passage for their ridiculously overblown parody article on 10/18/15. </p>

<p>Unlike the WNDR parody article, the IBT article does <strong>not</strong> claim Trump wants a new investigation (or make up quotes from Trump about WTC7), it just claims his campaign team responded to a mail-out Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth sent.</p>

<p>Pretty simple guys</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is a game, theater to convince us that trump is anti-establishment. ae911truth is controlled opposition. trump is pretending to give a shit, when in truth he was part of the 9/11 media operation. </p>

<p>he wrote a book a year before 9/11 predicting osama bin laden attacking. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-911-update-major-terrorist-attack-predicted-book-2016-presidential-2149661">http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-911-update-major-terrorist-attack-predicted-book-2016-presidential-2149661</a></p>

<p>he did an interview on 9/11 (likely in front of a greenscreen) pushing key points of the narrative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXQZlWZvQpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXQZlWZvQpU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump COULD be establishment but the establishment are doing a very hard effort  to knock hom out if he is.</p>

<p>And o dont think Jeb Bush is that good of an actor. Jeb is genuinely getting defaced by Trump amd that os no act.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this  , we are never ever going to have another candidate to come along with better credentials to be a real white knight . It would take exactly what trump has to be that. Independent success outside of government contracting .</p>

<p>So he is the best chance you will ever have to vote for a true outsider so you mightas well do it and see how it turns out.  If he IS the real deal you would have missed a once in a lifetime chance to take the country back and you would feel stupid.</p>

<p>If he isnt then its no worse than now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He could pretty much avoid having the US get into another war by declassifying documents about 9/11.</p>

<p>The truth could very well rip the nation apart but at least historians will remember Trump as one of the more honest presidents.</p>

<p>If trump was zmart he would threaten the Powers that Be with a release of documents that would declassify damning information about 9/11, Aliens,ect.</p>

<p>The way to do it is to set up a server that has a deadman switch,and then have trump release a preview of what&#39;s to come to the Powers that be .</p>

<p>Just imagine the public&#39;s anger of learning about the Pedos who&#39;re in power.
I&#39;m sure the public would love to know that Disney has a casting couch for little children.</p>

<p>The secret service isnt good enough and possibly has members who would help end Trump. Trump needs to also maintain his own personal security group and not share all plans with the secret service. He should also ocassionally test secret service loyalty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why should he deny making a quote reported in a mainstream news source that he knows he didn&#39;t make? Well, because if they just made it up it&#39;s pretty good evidence that the MSM is literally just lying about his organisation, for one. Second, it would show supporters of his organisation he actually cares about his and his group&#39;s reputation. Third, it would discourage other media outlets from doing the same thing. That&#39;s IF his quotes were made up, which I&#39;m almost certain they weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>And yes, the International Business Times is an MSM source with a substantial readership (ranked 1,971st on Alexa), not an &quot;obscure&quot; one. I think you&#39;re confusing it with the satirical website World News Daily Report, which is very low traffic (ranked 86,000th on Alexa). I explained the difference in the OP edit, read it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s very clear that if you read the whole article that Gage&#39;s quote is real. If you have absolutely any evidence it&#39;s not aside from &quot;I think/hope/feel it&#39;s made up&quot; feel free to share</p>

<p>Edit: and as expected, you&#39;ve got nothing.</p>

<p>Trump has more access than you.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be so arrogant to think that you from a distance know more than Trump from up close and personal. You think that Trump isn&#39;t fully aware of Lucky Larry Silverstein&#39;s... shady ventures? OF course he is. He&#39;s more aware than you or I. Unless you think that 99% of R/Conspiracy is so much smarter than Trump that we can figure out something about Silverstein without knowing him personally that Trump couldn&#39;t, with a personal relationship.</p>

<p>So what does that tell you, that he&#39;s friends with him?</p>

<p>THAT is my point. Don&#39;t make excuses for Trump, he&#39;s one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last time I&#39;ll try to explain this. Most of America still sux Israel&#39;s cock because we were/are programmed to do so. Trump is no exception. Whether he knows what Silversteins involvement in 9/11 is open to speculation. If he hangs out on r/conspiracy then ignorance is no excuse. OTHERWISE, we need to give him the possibilty of ignorance on the subject. If not, we run the risk of being an arrogant prick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not buying the Trump shit.  I like him more than Hillary or the other Republican candidates but only because he is, now, opposing every position that he&#39;s held for the past 2-3 decades.  I don&#39;t know if I can rely on that. </p>

<p>I like Sanders because he is the most sincere person who is running right now.  He has a consistent record, he is hated by the establishment and he isn&#39;t funded by any special interest groups.  Some of the shit he says may seem a bit impossible but I&#39;m glad he is saying it.  He isn&#39;t just spouting talking points for votes.. he is saying shit he actually believes.  That is the same reason I was a Ron Paul supporter.  I don&#39;t need to agree with the ideology 100% but if I finally get to see a candidate who is being honest I will support them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Trump is being honest... it seems an awful lot like he&#39;s just appealing to the base voter group who he wants to support him.  His history scares me.  If it came down to him or Hillary there&#39;s no way I&#39;d vote for Hillary but I haven&#39;t heard a single actual policy point out of Trump that is possible.  He just says stuff for applause.  </p>

What are other first world countries doing to solve the &quot;labor crisis&quot; in which jobs are too hard.... They are simply paying a fair wage and hiring legally. I personally would pay more for agriculture/produce and landscape or construction knowing my money is going back into a hard working citizens pocket, just as I can assume the rest of America would do as well.

<p>You may be prepared to pay more for services and products, a large percentage of the population is not prepared for this. Many people couldn&#39;t afford it even if they wanted to. </p>

<p>Also many of these other crop producing countries are not as developed as the USA. Therefor they don&#39;t have to deal with this type of problem as labor is already very cheap.</p>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m not even from the US, just trying to add pertinent information to this debate since far too many people see it as black and white. Ridding illegal labor would have many economical reppurcusions. Recent attempts have clearly shown that the pros do not seem to outweigh the cons.</p>

<p>Food for thought, have a good one.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re dodging the questions.</p>

<p>You also say that you are not American, so why are you trying to convince Americans that we should be ok with illegal immigration?  </p>

<p>But here is a counterpoint to your article:  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/06/georgia-immigration-law_n_3554714.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/06/georgia-immigration-law_n_3554714.html</a></p>

<p>One year later, there were no shortages.  In Alabama, courts gutted the law and all the illegal immigrants came back, however, in Georgia, companies are required to use E-Verify, so most illegals did not come back.  They were replaced with legal guest workers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not dodging anything, I just didn&#39;t feel the need to copy paste my replies.  </p>

<p>If you took the time to read my post it clearly states that I am neither for or against illegal labor. I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone of anything, just adding info to a debate that is largely fueled by xenophobia instead of facts.</p>

<p>Also your article proves my point, legal guest workers as defined by wikipedia:
&quot;guest worker program allows foreign workers to temporarily reside and work in a host country until a next round of workers is readily available to switch. Guest workers typically perform low or semi-skilled agricultural, industrial, or domestic labor in countries with workforce shortages, and they return home once their contract has expired.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically just giving the illegals a work visa so they can keep doing what they&#39;re doing, but legally. It also says in your article that many of the illegals did come back since the new law was not heavily enforced. So either way the jobs were still going to non-Americans, because get this, no Americans want these jobs (ie workforce shortage.) </p>

That sounds like the worker bee mentality you accused me of earlier. Protect it from what? And if first contact, or space exploration of whatever is your priority wouldn&#39;t it be more likely achieved by one strong free(ish) nation rather than a giant world welfare state that would struggle to support itself. Just think about it. A world with no borders would have to be a world with an unimaginable amount of state bureaucracy that would amount to nothing less than global slavery.

    <div class="md"><p>my OP links to the <strong>International Business Times</strong> dude. you just linked to a site called <strong>World News Daily Report</strong>. they&#39;re completely different websites - my link is to an MSM business news outlet, yours is to an obscure parody website. Don&#39;t know where you got that link from but it wasn&#39;t this thread</p>

<p>Or do you think the ibtimes is a parody website too? because their story pre-dates the <a href="http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/donald-trump-promises-to-reopen-911-investigation-if-elected/">World News Daily Report&#39;s obviously false parody</a> by over a month, and <strong>does not</strong> make the same claims (or make up quotes from Trump himself). it&#39;s obvious that WNDR just lifted a passage from the ibtimes story to pad their parody out. Here&#39;s an idea: <strong>read both articles</strong> (and make a note of when they were published) so it becomes very clear that&#39;s exactly what happened. if that doesn&#39;t work, i&#39;ll happily draw you a picture in crayon or something</p>

<p>Anyway, way to be a complete, smug dick about it. I edited my OP in case others make the same dumbass mistake you did. I mean seriously dude, did you even fucking read the OP before opening your mouth?? Im not sure if critical thinking is your problem but maybe reading comprehension and research skills are.</p>

<p>Because his campaign for the <strong>2016 presidential election</strong> was <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/donald-trump-announces-candidacy-for-president.html">well underway</a> by late 2015, when the ibtimes article was written? like hillary 16, jeb 16 and Cruz 16?
