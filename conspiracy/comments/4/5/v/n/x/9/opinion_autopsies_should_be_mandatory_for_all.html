    <div class="md"><p>It would also help prove the negative. The conspiracy theories on this one are going to pot-boil for YEARS. If no foul play, an autopsy would make a huge difference in the amount of time and people spending cycles trying to figure it out.</p>

<p>Read something recently from doctors asking for autopsies for regular people more often - a lot of death causes are never determined because autopsies aren&#39;t commonly done. I understand family members not wanting their loved ones&#39; bodies carved up for data&#39;s sake (and see where certain corporations would NOT want routine toxicology done), but would be good for public health and for justice in some cases.</p>

<p>Anyone got a line on the guest list for the Scalia party yet, by the way? Have a bad feeling about that.</p>

It&#39;s entirely possible (and probably the more likely explanation) that he died randomly because he was an old fat guy, but if you throw in the part where they didn&#39;t do an autopsy, people won&#39;t shut up about it and will assume it to be an indication of foul play (which it very well may be) instead of an indication of stupidity and incompetence by the people who made that decision.</p>
