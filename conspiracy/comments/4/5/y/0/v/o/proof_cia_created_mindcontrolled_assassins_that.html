       Another document dated 10 Feb 1954 describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: "Miss [deleted] was instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep). Failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to 'kill' [deleted]. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted], and then proceeded to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened." (CIA Mori ID 190691, 2/10/54)

        The CIA has declassified over 18,000 pages of documents on extensive mind control programs carried out since the early 1950s. Through the Freedom of Information Act, you can order these documents in the form of three CDs directly from the US government for only $30. Below is a sample of just two of these documents and one scientific article taken from the excellent mind control summary on the informative website

       That is so crazy, that I'd need to see it to believe it.  But reading an internal CIA document obtained by FOIA is the next best thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a thought though... what if that story was fabricated to keep everyone (or Russian spies) freaked out and scared of the CIA?  We recently saw an article about "eye wash" on here, where falsehoods and misinformation were purposefully circulated within the CIA to obscure whatever was really going on from lower ranked members.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't believe in honest-to-God-you're-totally-powerless mind control.  It just doesn't jive with my world view. but if I was the CIA...I'd at least try to convince people that I could do mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course...I don't know jack about the mind.

       The CIA didn't desire or expect these documents to ever become public. If they were giving interviews about it to CBS I'd be more on board with that theory. But, it's a crazy world, I suppose anything is possible.

       After reading the wiki article you posted on Estabrooks, I'm reminded of what I saw in the documentary "Making a Murderer".  In it, a boy of "below average intelligence" was basically hypnotized into confessing to a brutal murder that he probably didn't commit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's not so far-fetched that a weak-minded person could be hypnotized like that. I maaay have to re-evaluate my position on this.

       They're currently trying to use mind-control in television. I urge people not to watch television with US governmental connections. This includes, but is not limited to, any public broadcasting institution, such as PBS. Any time PBS is on, I recommend immediately averting your eyes away from the screen and either turning the television off or by changing the channel. Another medium through which the government is trying to use mind control is through the debates (and the advertisements which are shown during the debates). I recommend not to watch them, and to use alternative news sources from the internet to get information about what was said. I support Trump, but I cannot watch the debates without risk of brainwashing.

       Pls go around thinking that "self-governance" works. This American concept of "freedom" is like a child's concept of "freedom". They can do whatever they want whenever they want. "Self-governance" is what made America fail and government control is what makes Russia such a strong country to be reckoned with.
