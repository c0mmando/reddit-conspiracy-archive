       Buffet has always been a monopolist who hates free enterprise just like his best friend Bill Gates who was convicted of being a illegal monopolist is a court of law.  Its why they love each other so much. They both run the scam of implying they are giving away all their money when in fact they both retain it.  Its all PR while they continue their abuse of the system by extracting monopolistic forced profits in multiple fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time you see a picture of Warren Buffet eating ice cream remember thats PR and he is really eating the retirement savings of the elderly by raising their utility costs and preventing them from avoiding his utility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buffet wants to do this in every state because he made bad investments in public utilities which can only pay off if he kills solar panels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its "who killed the electric car" now "who killed the electric house"
      </p>
      <p>
       Buffet is a bastard asshole and never forget it. His granddaughter said he wasnt what he seemed in the movie "the one percent" .

       Nice post bro... 100% on the money. What these utilities and their political enablers are doing is really fucking criminal to the residents of Nevada. People should absolutely have a right to generate their own electricity and be able to stop relying on "The Grid" which is essentially just another mechanism of controlling the people.

       perhaps you're not familiar with the facts. People still do have the right to generate their OWN electricity and not rely on the grid. If you are selling power back into the system, then you're (by default) connected to the grid. Being off the grid means no selling of your surplus electric energy. I get your point.. but it ignores the facts.

       When it comes to 'rights' I think we have to define the different meanings brought to the discussion. Government doesn't provide any actual rights. They may claim its illegal to disconnect from a power grid and provide your own electricity but I don't believe that negates your right to provide your own energy source. If you have solar panels and they provide more than what all of your appliances require, why should you be forced with threat of violence to connect to the useless grid? I get the point of your statement.. but I think you're equating 'rights' with 'government's permission'.. just sayin. Don't let the government dictate what your rights are.. you will always lose.

       good article. thanks for sharing! its a shame really that the state uses these excuses to keep a person under thumb. I do think the woman seems really bizarre and a potential sociopath.. regardless.. if she wants to live without any obligation to the state.. I believe that is her right.

       also harry ried has made private deals with Chinese investors to build solar fields.. privately run solar fields  meaning no difference in cost to consumer.. but less work overall for current suppliers.

       Yeah, I've never bought his PR. Lots of dicey shit goes down in Nebraska, maybe Omaha especially. I wonder what's underneath that house he's lived in forever. I wonder what he knows about the Franklin S&amp;L scandal and all the pedophile shit that went down with that.

       For those that find interest in following geo-political, socio-economic, military-industrial, big business, big energy, big data, big tech, big media, etc, one could spend countless hours researching how Omaha is intimately connected to national/international affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although you could say this about most major city centers, the thing that sets Omaha apart, I feel, is that it seems to stay under the radar on the national stage, even with its unique connections that locals may and should be proud of: Gallop, Union-Pacific, Berkshire/Buffett, Boystown, Creighton, SAC, College World Series, University of Nebraksa Med Center facilitating treatment of the few US Ebola patients during the breakout in Africa, celebrity/cultural call-outs (Gaga, for one), the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Offutt AFB/SAC alone houses, and is the hub for, multiple one-of-a-kind units that have major play and influence in international peace-time and wartime military affairs, diplomacy, and intelligence (and was Bush's destination on 9/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside, one of these units happened to employ both the military (high-clearance wielding) dad and step-dad of the Von Maur mass-shooter, which happened on a day that the President had previously visited Omaha, an hour after he departed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be sure, with what I've said so far and what I will further present, I'm not attempting to make any claims of collusion between any referenced agency or persons whatsoever (that doesn't already speak for itself on record), nor am I trying to overstate any correlations, I'm just elaborating on what could be seen as notable occurrences in Omaha, all mainstream/textbook/library source-able and research-able.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as far as juicy controversy or intrigue, it could be argued that Omaha has it all, and then some (not that the city would have much interest in objectively airing out its own dirty laundry to its own residents, especially not by way of the Berkshire-owned local newspaper).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it's the Enron scandal, collegiate interaction with clandestine affairs in Afghanistan (especially in the Muhajedeen era), White-House call-boy services associated with GOP rising-star credit union operator turn embezzler (with Iran Contra ties, to say the least), apparent collegiate ties with the Sandusky affair that speak back to local incidents of a similar nature, it's all a matter of public record if one was inclined to seek it out, and that's just a sampling of a trove of scandalous or otherwise deep state intersections with the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Happy hunting, feel free to take anything that may be of interest and disregard the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR 
I attempted to elaborate/expand.

       Fuck what I don't understand with these greedy millionaires who don't want to lose their profits due to another technology invest in change. If you see something more efficient, more environmentally viable on the verge of collapsing your market go with it. Invest in your competitor. Move on to something that has potential to be bigger than what you already have. But no you incompetent fucks are scared of change and in doing so stall the advancement of the use of such technology. God I really hope my efforts in school will allow me to be put in a place where I can make a decision for the better of everyone else and not just myself.

       They use their current profits to buy up the leading companies when they need to. If they can maximize profits now then they will have more money to do this. I'm not saying that it is ethical, but they could probably buy a large portion of the solar industry with a few years of energy profits.

       If those houses are completely disconnected from the grid they should owe nothing, but if the use the grid to sell power to the utility and then consume power at night, they should pay some reasonable fee.

       By that logic then homeowners should be able to charge the utility company for connecting to the homeowners power source..the homeowners solar panels. The power company is getting benefit from being connected to the homeowner who helps the power company meet miday demand so why shouldnt the POWER COMPANY pay the homeowner a monthly fee to stay connected to the homeowners house and the home owners personal electrical grid?
      </p>
      <p>
       That logic works both ways!
      </p>
      <p>
       The homeowner doesnt need the power company at all. Solar systems nowre cheaper than power company prices per kilowatt  with out subsidies (in fact installed systems are more exepensive because they are required to use more equipment which is required to stay connected to the grid whicis required by law for an occupancy certificate from local zoning.  The panels themsleves are cheap.  You dont even need an invertor anymore becuase you can purchase most utensils like ac and dishwashers etc as dc these days becuase truckers use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason ac exists is to travel long distance. Dc is far betteror short distances and avoids conversion inefficiencies.

       The power company doesn't really need to buy the home-generated power, especially at retail prices. If the homeowner doesn't have batteries for night time use, he does need the grid.

       Solar is still coming and Buffet can't stop it. Subsidies actually hurt solar in the long run. They do this by artificially making solar more competitive than it actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       By removing subsidies for solar, the technology is forced to develop and become more competitive in terms of price and efficiency. Solar has been continuing to develop at a rapid pace on both counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple more years and people will be installing solar because it will be cheaper than being connected to a utility. Either utilities will provide the baseline during the evening, or people will have some kind of cheap battery backup in their own home.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll know it's coming when Buffet sells his utility shares and announces a big investment in solar. Kind of like what the Rockefellers did right before the price of oil collapsed.

       this exactly. A lot of the commenters act like people have a right to sell power back into the grid. This is like saying that companies have a right to sell electricity to customers while customers shouldn't be able to opt out.

       What Are You Talking About?  Why Do You Keep Capitalizing Every Word?  Does It Make Everything More Like A News Title??  He worked for dad.  I did the same, just didn't get 20 mil to start.  In fact, put myself thru school.  Trump spent a weekend painting buildings and I spent whole summers doing roofing, painting, siding, carpentry, plumbing, electrical, hauling appliances like fridges, stoves, washing machines, boilers with my dad cause he needed the help.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stood next to grown men 30 ft off the ground on a scaffold when I was 13.  Built a shed the same year and helped tear off the back of the house so my dad could rebuild the back porch again because he didn't use treated wood the first time.    Trump's weekends were years for me.  It takes time to grow callus.  The blue collar can vote as they like, but voting for country club kids, well, they ain't playing in the same ballpark as you.  You can fetch em a hotdog though.

       give it another 20 years or less, a world war and you'll all be a dying breed.  Go Drink Your Redbull.  What Goes Up Must Come Down.  You're all playing King of the Hill.  Enjoy sliding up and down this turd.  Go buy more books written by the lucky, but luck runs out.  Only fools and horses work are the bygone proverbs of parasites.  Be careful you don't kill the host tapeworm.

       Buffet is a business man. Do you think he has anything against solar power? If he could make money from it, he would do so. If he is abandoning it, that's because it's not viable as a business. Solar power does not make sense. It's not an alternative to oil and coal and gas, it's a pipe dream. That's the reality.

       Panels are becoming way cheaper. It might not completely eliminate the need for your electricity company but it does help reduce your bill. It was always expected they would try to stand in the way of it for as long as possible. All dying monopolies do.
