        I'm only an engineering school expelee, but I buy that the stress by the adjacent collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC could have led to cascade failure. But I'm not saying I'm sure either way. I don't know.

       Well why should we question those who invite a political cartoonist to do an AMA because he doesn't think the towers were brought down in a controlled demolition, but not question a person promoting Bernie Sanders for president when Bernie Sanders doesn't think the towers were brought down by a controlled demolition?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to figure out which people are to be discredited for thinking that terrorist brought the buildings down with hijacked planes and which people get a free pass for the exact same belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guarantee you that Sanders answers the litmus test question the exact same way the cartoonist did!

       I don't know man it sounds like you're complaining that he was allowed to do an AMA here because he doesn't subscribe to ae911.

       Would you be more satisfied if he was a Judy Woods exotic space weaponry theorist?

       It's obvious you're using ae91 as a strawman 'punching bag' against my statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       My words are clear; if an AMA candidate steps up to the plate in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and answers a pertinent conspiracy question with an 'infallible' answer that has no basis in Newton's laws of motion (I DO know 1 and 2 WTC were brought down by...), they will be challenged by users who question the Official Conspiracy Theory.

       We disagree on a few points that are... Central to my personal world view.  That being said I wouldn't call you a creep over it, or a bitch.  I would call you wrong on a few subjects but that would be "wrong from my PoV" and not necessarily objectively wrong.
