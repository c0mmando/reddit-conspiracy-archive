        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In an experiment described in a document entitled “SI and H experimentation [16] (25 September 1951)”, two female subjects took part in an exercise involving the planting of a bomb. Both subjects performed perfectly and were fully amnesic for the exercise: “[Deleted] was instructed that upon awakening, she would proceed to [deleted] room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call. Upon receiving the call, a person known as “Jim” would engage her in normal conversation. During the course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word. When she heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation. P. 37</p>

<p>She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would then carry out instructions: [Deleted] was shown an electric timing device. She was informed that this device was a bomb, and then instructed how to set the device. After [deleted] learned how to set and attach the device, she was told to take the timing device which was in a briefcase, and proceed to the ladies room [where] she would be met by a girl whom she had never seen who would identify herself by the code word “New York.” [Deleted] was then to show this individual how to attach and set the timing device and further instructions would be given that the timing device was to be carried in the briefcase to [deleted] room, placed in the nearest empty electric-light plug and concealed in the bottom, left-hand drawer of [a] desk, with the device set for 82 seconds and turned on.” P. 37, 38</p>

<p><strong>The BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE materials establish conclusively that full Manchurian Candidates were created and tested successfully by physicians with TOP SECRET clearance from the CIA.</strong> P. 61

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Legal pot&#39; is just used for cheap political points. </p>

<p>The fact that people think that it&#39;s a massive issue means that tptb have successfully diverted the publics attention away from serious US international/foreign policy abuses to have everyone fight over social issues that have very little effect on real life problems. </p>

<p>Everyone should know by now the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>) Scopolamine makes you do things against your will.</li>
<li>) CIA experiemented with in during MKULTRA and got all they &#39;needed to know&#39;. at that time.</li>
<li>) Therefore, they&#39;ve had manchurians since the 60s.<br/></li>
<li>) Michael Acquino probably had an armoire filled with the stuff in his sex dungeon that held all the nightmares people assumed Michael Jackson was up to.  But we can&#39;t prove it.  So I am not allowed to make that direct accusation.</li>
<li>) You will have a hard time researching Michael Acquino.  Because he won</li>
<li>) Mass murderers who write stuff like &quot;I can&#39;t help it&quot;.  &quot;demons make me do it&quot;.  &quot;I have my demons&quot;.  &quot;I am not in control&quot;, etc.  They probably aren&#39;t.  I&#39;m convinced Aurora joker guy James Holmes was a manchurian</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the scopolamine part, because I am a huge plant nerd and have been a hobbyist psychonaut for many, many years and even had a brugmansia plant that I would ingest in micro-doses from time to time to potentiate opiates (I love drugs,and wierd plants, what can I say?).  Even at higher doses, quite inadvertently I may add, when experiencing mental effects, I never did anything against my will, and was even acting and behaving quite reasonably.  It was just that my surroundings were unreal. </p>

<p>I would be having a conversation with someone, then nod off a bit from the opiates, and come to and the person was gone and I would remember that they are actually at work right now and have been for hours, and I have been sitting in an empty room.  This repeats itself over and over for a few hours.  That&#39;s it.  Even if people are there, I just forget our conversations and keep repeating stuff.  No suggestibility or anything like that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just recently become more active on reddit, does MC get much traction in this sub?</p>

<p>As to history, we were using hypnotic couriers in WWII, and experimentation goes back to the 30&#39;s. By the time I was born in the early 60&#39;s, programs for production of controllable DID systems (torture induced dissociation with amnesia) had been synthesized, and only fine tuning and adjustments were experimental. Survivors I know range in age from 70 to 20. Most subjects never fully heal and spend their lives as slaves. Even so, today, the perps are still desperately working on various techniques to interfere with therapy/recovery.</p>

<p>And yes, the equipment they have now makes creating and reinforcing programming much more effective, new imaging, monitoring, and vr tech, and drugs. </p>

<p>Very true and tragic. They brutalized their own, and continue to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I’ll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a &#39;normal&#39; working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member. All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These documents are some of the biggest pieces of evidence available that almost everyone is entirely unaware of, thanks for sharing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190691.1_assassins_programmed_mind_control">Hypnosis</a> was proven to be successful.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse">just read all of them</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/cia_mind_control_experiments_sex_abuse">Read all the top documents on mind control they put together.</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that most experiments were not even recorded (source is a CIA document from the link above) and a majority of MKULTRA documents were destroyed in 1973 by order of Director Richard Helms.</p>

<p>Its psychopaths all the way down.</p>

<p>p.s. they added my book to the sidebar (lifting the veil) :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. They bring pot in at a time that&#39;s crucial to paying attention, I&#39;ve actually heard people say they don&#39;t care who&#39;s president, as long as weed is legal. This country (and others) is purposely retarded. Also the rise of &quot;politically correct&quot; language has an end goal of creating conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s material on Aquino out there, but not as much as there needs to be and I bet a lot of it is disappearing gradually. But to read &quot;Because he won,&quot; is a sickening truth when stated in black and white like that. He did. So did Jimmy Saville. Both apparently top of the pyramid black magick types.</p>
