       Anything that is intellectually stimulated would be great.  Books about history, wars, leaders, philosophical ideas, sociological ideas as well.  I appreciate the well on knowledge here as well as opposing views.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, anything that is listed above.  Or any book that changed your life and opened your mind.  Thanks!!

       Sounds awesome.  I'm 22.  I'm a honestly a little nervous with the new tpp copyright laws.  If it goes through I'm not sure what I'll be able to get my hands on in the future.  So, just trying to fill up on knowledge that will either be lost or never taught to me.

       Although I don't go anymore, I had a buddy that took me to some John Birch Society meetings. They had a little book rack at the meetings. Some of the titles mentioned here were on the rack. Also, not conspiracy, but have you read early Kurt Vonnegut and Ayn Rand? Highly recommend.

       I have not.  I'm very open though.  I think it's not to wise to only focus on conspiracies as is.  Being educated and well informed on matters from experience or from the source of matter is enough.  Just a little vocab enhancement and new ideas to ponder and build on should suffice.

       There's a wealth of good reading on there, personally I spend enough time reading posts on here that I tend to usually choose light escapism for bedtime book reading, or books about ancient history in the Colin Wilson/Graham Hancock type of theme which were outside of your requested genres.

       I just want to be a bright, well rounded individual.  Being homeschooled most of my life there was a point where I thought I would never know what my peers know.  I've come to the realization that it doesn't really matter if I fit in, as long as I understand what shapes my opinion and beliefs of the world around me.  It's honestly nice to be a bit more of an individual.  At least it makes for interesting discussions with people who are open enough to have those.

       You were incredibly lucky to be schooled outside of the system and not have the peer pressure to conform to the societal norms, not that my indoctrination made a whole lot of difference really. Some of us would never fit even if we'd like to, personally I never had the inclination to even try. Only the people capable of rejecting or transcending the mores of conventional society become innovators or radical creators in my experience. Keep on being you.

       Thank you!  It's a lot of analysing one's self to find what really, honestly is going to make for a better person in the future.  The harder part is dropping habits and ideas that won't be beneficial.  Again, thank you for care and for the reading suggestions.  Enjoy your day fellow human :)

       Because the Quigley book is over 1,000 pages long and a lot of it is pretty dry general history stuff. Joe Plummer takes the length and cuts it down to about 200 pages of the really juicy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plummer's actually been cool enough to put his whole book online, so you can check it out and see what you think:

       Haha, other then my close family I don't really get the chance to talk about this stuff with people.  I only recently started posting here (although I have lurked for over a year).  I have my owns believes that are different than a lot of people here even (For instance I do believe in God).  What I love is that regardless all anyone here (for the most part) wants to share ideas, and thoughts.  Thoughts that shed new light on how the world works.  We aren't here to prove one another wrong.  We have gathered to have an open platform of communication with open minds.  It's just really nice to indulge in talking about your point of view.  You either have your mind challenged by people who feel similar but got there from a completely different way of living.  Much better then people cutting you off and shutting your ideas down.  I dunno, honestly, I can't remember the last time I felt this happy with purpose and reason.  So thank you, and thanks to everyone else!  Keep sharing!

       Thank you!!  Haha, I just like that those don't believe in a Devine creator/those who do can still be very friendly and more importantly open towards each other.  I don't see that a lot.

       On a total side note (although you may not care) I recently "woke up" my best friend.  I talked to him a lot about different things involving corruption and trust in our leaders.  I often would talk about how it's wise to question where and who's funding what.  Then, not to long ago (probably not even a month ago) I found out about MKUltra/mind control.  At first he thought it was a load of hullabaloo.  He refused to talk about it, at all until we got very drunk together.  Then we watched people talk about their experience and I showed him what I found.  He related the experience to "losing his religion".   I brought it up in this reply simply because God was mentioned.
My friend stated that even though he didn't worship money or government he always assumed that he could fall back on it.  That he would be safe.  Now he is questioning the very principal of how to live life.  What's really going on.  He hates it, a lot.

      <p>
       Now, I'm not even sure if I cared to share this...seems like a bit of a ramble.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm trying to say to you, and whoever else may read this...  When someone understand a little deeper of how the world is actually working it is life shaking.  So keep that in mind when talking to people.  Understand it's hard for them to see against the masses.  Patience is a must.

       When I first realized how deeply corrupt and....well...EVIL the controlling powers of this world are, it literally sent me into a spiral of depression that made me physically ill. Took me weeks to get past it. The good thing that came out of it is that it sent me back to church, which as been a huge uplift for my soul.

       It's really amazing how much motivation I found to start doing things for myself.  Today, I spent 3 hours at the Library.  I feel empowered to be myself and talk to all sorts of people.  To research things for rizz, so I can articulate my thoughts and opinions.  Thank you for listening.

       Although I don't go anymore, I had a buddy that took me to some John Birch Society meetings. They had a little book rack at the meetings. Some of the titles mentioned here were on the rack. Also, not conspiracy, but have you read early Kurt Vonnegut and Ayn Rand? Highly recommend.

       Haha, other then my close family I don't really get the chance to talk about this stuff with people.  I only recently started posting here (although I have lurked for over a year).  I have my owns believes that are different than a lot of people here even (For instance I do believe in God).  What I love is that regardless all anyone here (for the most part) wants to share ideas, and thoughts.  Thoughts that shed new light on how the world works.  We aren't here to prove one another wrong.  We have gathered to have an open platform of communication with open minds.  It's just really nice to indulge in talking about your point of view.  You either have your mind challenged by people who feel similar but got there from a completely different way of living.  Much better then people cutting you off and shutting your ideas down.  I dunno, honestly, I can't remember the last time I felt this happy with purpose and reason.  So thank you, and thanks to everyone else!  Keep sharing!
