        [Final update @ 1pm CST - February 11th]
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The standoff has now come to an end, as the last remaining holdout has turned himself over to authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully no further blood was shed over the protest. Their fight isn't over by any means, but now everyone can breathe a sigh of relief that no one else is going to be shot over all of this.

       Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it may be important to listen to this as it's happening live. This is being broadcast live from several bridged phone calls, including a line from the people in the refuge:

       As of this update, AssemblyWoman Michelle Fiore is on the phone with the people in the refuge. She has been asking to be called by the FBI to negotiate an end to the situation. The FBI was refusing to speak to her and was harassing them. It sounds as if Fiori has talked to the FBI finally though, and she is trying to calm everyone down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds as if the FBI asked them to walk out with their hands up, but they are adamant about not going to jail and not leaving without their weapons.

       "now they are talking to friends over the phone right now. The lady keeps talking about how their first amendment right is being taken away and that the American people are not showing them support. They are trying to set up a phone call with the FBI. They seem to be willing to die for their cause . earlier they were shouting back and forth to the FBI I believe"

       Michelle Fiore has said she will arrive to the refuge by 1am EST.

        [10:42pm CST]
       </strong>

       Michelle has stated that the FBI is saying they have agreed not to escalate this evening, and that they will meet in the morning. She was adamant that they want that message to go over the livestream.

       <strong>
        [11:30pm CST]
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no telling how long the livestream will continue tonight. It's also not certain that nothing will happen over the course of the night. If everything goes according to the plan, they will be meeting at 8am to turn themselves in.
      </p>

       It is being reported that Cliven Bundy was arrested this evening in Portland as he was flying in from Nevada to join Michelle Fiore in a news conference. That certainly won't help the already tense situation within the refuge:

      <p>
       Three of the remaining people in the refuge have now left and are in the hands of law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       David is the last holdout, and is refusing to leave. He has stated that he is declaring war against the federal government, and they will have to come in and get him because he is not giving up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        [12:58pm CST]
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Law Enforcement are taking David into custody peacefully now, it looks like this ended without any bloodshed thankfully.
      </p>
      <p>
       David asked law enforcement to say "Hallelujah" before he would come out, they complied and you could hear law enforcement all yelling "Hallelujah" over the phone call.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michelle is in (happy) tears now over the situation coming to a peaceful close. Certainly an emotional event for everyone involved.

       The bros on youtube commenting on this live feed are disgusting. The disconnect they have from reality.. The thing is, I think these kids actually want an Orwellian future. They think that the future is bright. They believe the lies. We have a SERIOUS problem in our country, where the people are completely powerless. I thought that somehow this "movement" of awakened people would be enough, but fuck.. what the hell are we doing anymore. It's happening right before our eyes. These guys agreed to surrender, and I can't blame them, though I can't say for sure I would have done the same. I'm just angry now. And I'm sure many others are too, but it seems nothing will come of it. Literally EVERY route of restoring whatever the hell it is we're fighting for has been systematically shut down. The MSM is the only shot at real change. It is what forms the minds of sheeple. They could literally change EVERYTHING with one newscast, and a continued campaign against the corruption. Thats about all I have to say right now. I'm feeling pretty defeated.

       I've always wondered about RT. They do cover a lot of issues that you'd think would actually cause people to wake up, then again, controlled opposition does the same. Sadly, I literally don't know what to think anymore.

       Putin is relatively moderate. He is about halfway in between western politics and Zhirinovsky's politics. Ergo, it's a fair and balanced news source.

       I remember watching on live TV. You may try to imagine it as ye olden days when there was live TV and genuine journalism. Koresh and his people looked like assholes. Same as these pogues trying to set up a de facto government so they can have free grazing rights to public land. I piss on them for being too dumb to be effective.

       What strikes me is how they seem to fade in and out of their delusion.  Like they get on the right track and say they are peaceful, then they start talking about how they may be "forced" to use their guns.  What a bunch of self important assholes, wasting peoples time with these childish games.

       She literally just asked if they're hungry and dehydrated and to make sure that to think clearly they have to eat. During a standoff with guns pointed at them, she's telling them to eat and drink. I appreciate her effort, but man these negotiators suck.

       That's not really what she's doing. That's the face value read of what she's saying. She's trying to make herself seem like she's on their side. Her job is to have everyone live coming out of this. And she's going to act like their friend, talking about their basic needs, for an edge

       You obviously don't know much about her. She's one of them. She's a fellow enemy of the state. She hates the United States as much as Bundy and the other terrorists who seized the compound. She shares their desire to spark a civil war and bring down our country.

       That's a perfectly legitimate opinion, but it doesn't entitle you to steal federal land or set up your own government while refusing to obey the law or recognize the Constitution, US law, and state law. Terrorists don't get to just take shit over and set up their own country inside the US.

       She's not a negotiator. She's one of them; she shares their hatred for the United States and their desire to overthrow the government. She's trying to help them and make their cause more successful. With any luck, she'll end up in prison with the rest of them.

       I don't see why your description and my description can't both sit side by side as completely accurate descriptions of who she is. She is an assemblywoman. She does believe those things you just said. But she also supports the terrorists, hates the United States, and wants to see our country overthrown by a bunch of far right militant fascists.

       From what I understand the government is trying to get them off the land. The ranchers were charged with arson of the land (they back-burned land to prevent further damage from a fire caused by lightning). They served their sentence. However the government has recently charged them under the Anti-Terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This is double-jeopardy, in addition, the government has labelled them as terrorists, defaming their character.

       When I heard that they were being charged again I was thinking the same thing. Apparently it was found that they didn't serve the minimum time as the law dictates. A judge reduced the amount of time they had to spend because it was understood that they back-burned to save their own property. I think its absolute horseshit that they would be punished at all for doing it in defense of their property. Its something firefighters do all the time in defense of public and private property. It seems that according to the feds these people should have just let the fire consume their entire livelihoods.

       Pretty quick to make a diagnosis there bud.
      </p>
      <p>
       David is disenfranchised, that doesn't necessarily make him crazy.  This is the same reason that we have black people rioting and OWS protests.  People feel hopeless watching their rights get paved over while corporations run amuk doing whatever they want without regard to anyone they effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       David had some good points even though he expressed them poorly, and as far as the FBI being bad ass... Well its not too hard to dominate 4 people in a tent when you have millions of dollars in your budget and armored vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were really all that badass they could have done without killing levoy.  It doesn't even matter if he pulled a gun, they have armored vehicles.  As cold as it was out there they could have sprayed him with a water cannon and he would have surrendered in a few minutes.

       It wouldn't be "bad ass" for you to walk up to a toddler and kick his brain in because you can.  In reality its pathetic and morbid to use force against people who can't possibly defend against you're superior force.  Especially when they aren't actively seeking to harm you.

       They set up a road block and created a conflict, then they killed a guy.

       Government compromises on the law all the time. It's called a plea bargain or a settlement.

       Yeah and they also refuse to compromise all the time.  And they like to "throw the book" frequently which isn't in the spirit of the law.  We should be constantly stretching the intent of a law to have a bigger more serious charge to prosecute someone with.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example the Hammond's being charged with "terrorism", give me a break.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about Aaron Swartz being charged with ridiculous laws by over aggressive prosecutors until he killed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government needs to remember the human.  We aren't all terrorist, we aren't all mastermind crooks. And hilariously enough, the actual mastermind crooks get bailed out for 800 billion instead of actually charged with a crime.  The government digs for reasons NOT charge certain people while they dig for extra reasons to bury different people under the jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ridiculous and everyone can see it clearly.  We all see what's going on regardless of if we are willing to say it out loud or not.

       Ok whatever. Zooming back into the Lavoy shooting here: they broke the law. He's not a Dindu Nuffin. They sped away from one stop and into another where he jumped out of the car and reached for his coat. Every other person involved survived. He made a choice.

       There is a pecking order with our justice system, poor people on the very bottom they can't even not pay a parking ticket with extreme retribution from the government.

       Then the middle class who gets Mulligans for little shit but extreme retribution for any white collar crimes or violent crimes.

       Then we have the upper class wall street types who can sell fake derivatives for years until they literally bankrupt the country and they get a bail out.

       Saudi princes who can literally come here and rape a girl and fly home on diplomatic immunity without even getting their name released.

       I'm sorry the system isn't there to act in equal share to act in proportional share in every case, but in this case there was video evidence that Levon was wrong. Case closed. Let me know when you have footage of the south side of wtc7 available.

       No. Disbelief in the way its being handled. The FBI knows that if they just leave, the whole thing will be over, no bloodshed. Its not like these guys are about to go shoot up citizens once they leave. They know they aren't dangerous. They are defending themselves against the FBI
       <em>
        who are the aggressors
       </em>
       . I don't care that the FBI is "doing their jobs", its fucking lives on the line and they want action. Absolutely sickening.

       You obviously have not been following this story. The aggressors are the people who seized a public wildlife refuge at gunpoint and threatened violence against anyone who tried to take it back. The aggressors are not the ones enforcing the nation's laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the FBI knows that if they let them go this will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be over. The militants said they went to Oregon because they got away with defying the law in Nevada. And the militants were planning to take their show to other locations. They openly stated the lack of legal consequences for their past crimes encouraged them to commit more crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI is doing the right thing: enforcing our nations laws and protecting the public from dangerous armed extremists.

       A moment of history? LOL. it's a moment of justice for a bunch of incredibly ignorant cosplaying wingnuts. It's hilarious they thought they could just declare the law null and void so they could set up their own government. In a state none of them are even from!

       "If this was Braveheart. In Braveheart, Braveheart took it to the end, even when they tortured him. Because he believed that what he was doing was the work of God."

       This is a goldmine.

       Doubleedit: That makes more sense. I misheard that. Probably because of the immediately preceding Braveheart reference.

       For the record, I'm on their side. But their competence echoes that of the government they still claim patriotism to.

       He said Black Lives Matter, not blackhawk down. Even if these people sound stupid, this is what fighting back against a tyrannical government looks like today. Laugh it up if you must, sure he's not well read and cited Braveheart, still it's fucking sad that this is what modern democracy looks like. Americans should be fucking ashamed, all hope is lost. Government is picking on the little guy, and all anybody can do is point and laugh.

       It's really sad man, I am passionate about this type of stuff and I read the posts of the livestream as they fly by the screen with 60,000 people in the same stream, and it's just inundated with people cheering on the death of these innocent patriots. However misguided people might think they are, they clearly have no desire to hurt anyone, and they are fighting for a cause that is just, and that takes more fucking courage than anyone I know. And all these people can do is laugh, and cheer on his death. Bread and circuses I tell ya, they've atrophied our collective critical thought through placation, it's Brave New World with a dash of 1984. I don't even know how to process all of this. What happened to live and let live? 9/11 is what happened, and the patriot act which eroded any semblance of our civil liberties. I'm surprised they're not dead yet, but either way, they will not see the light of the sun for years to come for a simple act of peaceful noncompliance.

       Yeah. That's the guy who earlier said the militia should come to Burns and kill any police who try to stop them. He directly called for the murder of police on livestream, with his face pointed directly at the camera. He is going to be in prison for a very long time.

       You're right in that you can't blame it all on one thing. But you're wrong with the "they're crazy" dismissal. That's at least as reductionist of an ascription as what I wrote.

       Actually it's what right wing talk radio and the American conservative movement produces. Public education never encouraged anyone to threaten civil war, threaten to murder police, or seize public land by force and make plans to give it away to rich ranchers, lumber companies, and mining corporations.

        The FBI has their hands tied by the threepers because now that can't summarily execute these protesters.

        The FBI controls all the communication in and out of the refuge.

       That isn't how this 'man in the middle' attack works. Stinger type devices act as a repeater and the data can be manipulated in real time. They can deny access to certain devices.. I am 100% certain of it. It's comparable in a way to using a wifi repeater and filtering certain MAC addys at the repeater hardware and has nothing to do with the AP (provider tower)

       Right, but in the same context of the wifi AP... you're
       <em>
        assuming
       </em>
       the phone associates with your Stingray device and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the normal tower. Given they already have acquired a tower (and are on an active call), there's a good chance it wouldn't try to find the Stingray instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some people may have CDMA vs GSM, so now do you cover both spectrums? There's a lot of variables there, it's a far more complex situation than standard 802.11.

       yes I know. I was using the wifi repeater idea as an analogy. The Stingers over-power the tower.. and I'm pretty sure because of the way cellular systems work (just guessing honestly) that phones can switch towers mid-convo.. which means their phones can be switched to the Stinger without the speaking parties' knowledge. Again.. I am just guessing based on what I've read about cell systems.

       I kinda thought that too. Who is Michelle? It sounded like she was laughing half the time. Was that a lot of chatter I heard in the background? I'm confused about much of this, gonna have to re-listen to the audio when I know more of the backstory.

       Michele Fiore is an assemblywoman who was mediating between FBI and the "patriots". She did have a good bit of awkward laughing to attempt to add humor to the situation, which I felt VERY out of place. The whole thing was dehumanizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as her driving to them, she kept saying she's on her way and about 3 hours before the stream ended, she said she was 4 hours away. Then somehow they came to the conclusion that they were going to surrender and meet her and some others at 8am tomorrow. I heard absolutely NO road noise, car doors, turn signals, traffic, nothing. It sounded like she was in a room by herself. The whole thing was confusing, and the way the reverend and everyone was talking, was insulting. You can tell in the tone of voice that they were disingenuine at best. To me, the whole thing just sounded like the diffusing of a hostage situation where you will say ANYTHING including lying about lying to get what they want. And they did. Surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't want these guys hurt over this, but they were right when they said as soon as they surrender and go to jail, its all over. Media will reinforce the disgusting kids and bros who were rooting for the FBI to "kill some idiots", and the very thing they fought against will continue full steam ahead.

       Yeah. We need more people laughing at these idiots. I have to say it has been genius how the FBI has handled this whole armed occupation of the wildlife refuge. At first they took a ton of heat for letting the terrorists come and go. But it gave the public a chance to hear them speak and see how dangerous, crazy, and ignorant they are. Public opinion has shifted dramatically against the militants.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now this live stream. Jesus. If there was any doubt before these guys are dangerous and radical extremists, it's gone now. The FBI let them hang themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize people on the far right who hate America worships these militants. But normal Americans just think they are crazy, stupid, and dangerous.

       So far they are just talking back and fourth with the FBI. Shit could go down at any time
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: now they are talking to friends over the phone right now. The lady keeps talking about how their first amendment right is being taken away and that the American people are not showing them support. They are trying to set up a phone call with the FBI. They seem to be willing to die for their cause . earlier they were shouting back and forth to the FBI I believe

       Don't call me a troll because i don't agree with these dumbass rednecks who use guns to take over a building then cry about being shot and killed by police. Calling me a troll just shows you're conviction that anyone who does not agree with you must be crazy, trolling, stupid or part of the conspiracy.

       Thats the problem, you think it is as cut and dry as a bunch of hillbillies taking over a building for no reason.  Shows where your level of understanding is, and anyone reading your response will also think it's as simply as you portray it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then on top of that ignorant comment, you are OK with advocating for those people to be shot on site.  How ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can disagree, no problemo!  But saying its cool to just waste these people is asking to live in a world where the people in power get to make you disappear when they feel like it.  Like you're in fucking Korea disobeying the deal leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were right and these people were outright foolish criminals, then you try them in court and they GO TO JAIL.  See how that works?  What you're advocating for is unrestrained tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people dont want to be shot, not like Lavoy Finicum with his hands in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like you're about 12 years old and have watched too many movies.  A perverted view on how the world should work is what you are asking for, it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes time for you to stand up for what you believe in, you better hope the only option for you isn't only a firing squad or you will come to that realization pretty quick, and then you will regret what you're asking for today.

       Lots of assumptions made here. Your hypocrisy is incredible. No one said they should be shot on sight, you just made that up. I said they used guns and force to overthrown a building and when one of them gets shot they are crying injustice. That type of statement and reasoning just isn't going to wash with anyone who is of average intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The audio from the live stream clearly shows police telling the terrorists that they can come out now with no consequences, to which these hillbillies replied that they are ready to die and kill people. So you have evidence here that these guys have refused a safe escape and are threatening to kill people. They have the choice of NO court and no repercussions if they simply back down and come out with their hands up but they choose the road of violence.

       It is blatantly clear you are blinded by your own bias as you have just shown.

       When gun toting thugs threaten the natural rights of a human, they violate the non-aggression principle and thereby the duty that others have (the gun-toter's previous negative right) to observe their natural right is forfeit. Insofar as one defends themselves against an aggressor, they are restoring peace and order.

       When I heard that they were being charged again I was thinking the same thing. Apparently it was found that they didn't serve the minimum time as the law dictates. A judge reduced the amount of time they had to spend because it was understood that they back-burned to save their own property. I think its absolute horseshit that they would be punished at all for doing it in defense of their property. Its something firefighters do all the time in defense of public and private property. It seems that according to the feds these people should have just let the fire consume their entire livelihoods.
