       “Voting, the be all and end all of modern democratic politicians, has become a farce, if indeed it was ever anything else. By voting, the people decide only which of the oligarchs preselected for them as viable candidates will wield the whip used to flog them and will command the legion of willing accomplices and anointed lickspittles who perpetrate the countless violations of the people’s natural rights. Meanwhile, the masters soothe the masses by assuring them night and day that they — the plundered and bullied multitudes who compose the electorate — are themselves the government.” ― Robert Higgs

       Great post OP, have mine on Sanders.

       He's grossly ignorant of economics. He has constantly flubbed the most basic facts; one that comes to mind instantly is his ignorance of the reasons why student loans differ from car loans or mortgages

       He's a huge warmonger. He tries to disguise this by playing dumb about foreign policy and deflecting to climate change and his irrelevant economic stump speech whenever he's asked about it, as he knows the truth would alienate his "progressive" base, but his history is one of consistent cow-towing to the war lobby:

       He promises all the "glorious" free handout programs of Europe, yet neglects to mention the extremely regressive taxes, the key differences in culture and population size, and the fact that none of those countries actually fund their militaries because they rely on us to fight for them (freeing up money to go towards their welfare states instead). He also leaves out the part where nationalist parties and conservative welfare reform parties are becoming more and more popular in Europe because they're finally realizing that socialism doesn't work in the long run. Even scarier than his deranged views are the Modern Monetary Theory kooks he surrounds himself with.

       This is the most well put together critique of Bernie Sanders I've seen; thank you. I am all too aware of his "wolf in sheep's clothing" disposition but I don't really know how to verbalize it because he really is superb at hoding it. This helps. The whole thing about Europe's depending on us for military protection is SO blatant. Thank you. I hope he doesn't win, but then again, I hope no one wins. Sadly, I feel like he will.

       1) I have to say that you use this quote to discredit Sanders, but I think you've made the opposite point.  I'm with Sanders on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Among that short list, all those monetary contributions are under 15,000.   Hillary made several millions speaking at one engagement.  Again, you're not making your point of corruption here.  Politicians
       <em>
        do need to accept some money to run for reelection
       </em>
       and it looks like Bernie took a very humble amount...like bare minimum.  Which means he's a very desirable candidate to go so far on so little.  Again, gaijinfag, you've undermined your message.  You can keep the gold though for research.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) This point is a reprise of the last point, which is a weak nonpoint.  Sanders took either 15k, 19k or 20k from the sugar industry according to this article.  I've probably given the sugar industry that amount of money in my whole lifetime with all my soda drinking in my 20s.  So I cancel it out.  Isn't that how it works? lol. no. But my point is that's not a lot of money.  You're trying to pull the sugar of corruption out of the beets of nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The nuclear dumping article is real interesting because you're making a mountain out of a nothing hill.  In fact, I've been near to
       <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@31.225313,-105.4485067,30049m/data=!3m1!1e3">
        Sierra Blanca
       </a>
       in Hudspeth, Texas looking to buy land there.  It was like the surface of mars, desolate, dry arid nothing land.  It made everything in my soul cry out in agoraphobic fear unlike anything I've experienced except perhaps eastern Montana which is equivalently terrifying.  The terror comes from the fact that if your car breaks down, you're very likely to die.  This is what a desert is, there's nothing there, no one around to help you, no one would be caught (not) dead there, and theres no water whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point is:
       <em>
        After hearing both sides of the arguments, Sanders, considering the scientific data and reportage from both sides (he heard the activists points), is some kind of ecological racist because made the 'obstinate' decision to put nuclear waste in the most desolate, non-occupiable-for-human-life area in the united states.
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         WOW Good point Gaijinfag
        </em>
       </strong>
       He's a rascal all right.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) You have a
       <strong>
        <em>
         strong point
        </em>
       </strong>
       with #5 about war
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Notably he supported NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, a stance which caused one of his staffers to resign in protest.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While it's true he voted against the Iraq War, he also voted in favor of authorizing funds for that war and the one in Afghanistan. More recently, he voted in favor of a $1 billion aid package for the coup government Ukraine and supported Israel's assault on Gaza
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yep, he's a goddamned shiester for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       6)  Without reading your source I can say that whatever arguments you make about paying for social services I have already been convinced are totally invalid and wastes of time quibbling over details that aren't even relevant.  The red flag was the 'ignores differences of scale of population'.  Problem is that math scales, so that argument that perennially pops up is prima facie a canard. It's not like we're talking about wifi attenuation!  Its infrastructure and we know how to do it, we've had lots of practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Im with Sanders on bringing back immigrants whose children were abandoned here.  That policy to deport them was evil to begin with.  Either the whole family gets uprooted or they don't.  Halfway breaks the family, which then fucks up the immigrant childrens life (and they are in fact, completely blameless in that btw).  If we claim to care about children so much, why are our policies fucking up their lives?  No.  Again your number 7 undermines your claim that Sanders is a bad candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows he's got scruples unlike the others he's competing with.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Overall gaijinfag, you've made one really strong point and I reject the others.  It's that Sanders is NOT being honest about his war record, and that he's a shitty asshole of a hawk as well.  So anyone thinking he wouldn't start or continue wars is being misled.
