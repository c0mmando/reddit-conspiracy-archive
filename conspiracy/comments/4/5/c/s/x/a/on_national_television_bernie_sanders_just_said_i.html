    <div class="md"><p>He is relaying valid and documented historical facts.  They are not pleasant historical facts though.  The power center that caused the mess in Indochina and who held the interests that Henry Kissinger butchered millions for are still around today.  Speaking truth to power is a dangerous game to get involved in.  While Senator Sanders has been playing the game for a long time, it is only now that his stock has become known to the electorate on a wide scale.  Invoking and fanning populism is a very threatening adversary to the small percentage of people who hold an inordinate amount of power relative to the population as a whole.  They would prefer to keep the status quo, and they are quite resistantly combative to change.  And the fact that we&#39;re already seeing difficulties in the electoral process is unsettling enough by itself.  So while I prefer the truth, as Senator Sanders laid out, I nevertheless recognize the burden of that truth when uttered in such a capacity; it is absolutely necessary but it is at the same time incredibly dangerous.  The next few months, I think, shall prove very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are people siding with you?  Are they really as ignorant as you are on this subject? I mean really.  This is controlled opposition stuff.  Listen to this and educate yourself.  Brussell was a researcher who used mainstream sources.  It&#39;s all right there in your face, you just don&#39;t see it.  This will help:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a single individual in this thread made any such insinuation as the one you are accusing me of making.  Officials indeed are not even elected in the primaries.  Do &quot;democratic&quot; superdelegates have the power to cause the party to nominate an unpopular candidate?  You bet they do:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=presidential+primaries">https://www.google.com/search?q=presidential+primaries</a></p>

<p>Clarity (in case you dropped out of high school or something):</p>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/10/will-hillarys-democratic-establishment-superdelegates-back-bernie-now/">http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/10/will-hillarys-democratic-establishment-superdelegates-back-bernie-now/</a></p>

<p>Tl;dr:</p>

<p>Superdelegates are party insiders who don&#39;t have to vote in line with the people.  Rather they vote &quot;independently&quot; and as Secretary Clinton is the establishment candidate, she has already secured 362 of their votes.  This means that even though Senator Sanders lost Iowa by less than 1/4% and won by a landslide in NH, he is still FAR behind Secretary Clinton in total delegates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the point here. It&#39;s not that he won&#39;t get elected due to him not having enough votes or whatnot.  That&#39;s not the issue. 
   It&#39;s that, at least IMO anyway, TPTB are going to pick whomever they want to win. The next POTUS has already been chosen.
 Voting is just for show now. The vote count will be rigged of course, and there will be no way for any of us &quot;peasant&#39;s&quot; to prove such...not that MSM would listen anyway. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll be busy reporting the same old tired bullshit about &quot;hope and change&quot;, or whatever the new hook is ...Just a different face with a new name,but the game is still the same one they&#39;ve been playing for centuries. </p>

<p>Get a clue man, and Wake up already. You seriously think that voting changes anything? 
   IF that were the case, and our votes genuinely counted, it would&#39;ve been outlawed already,Made illegal and new laws written into the books, under the guise of &quot;Protecting american citizens and/or American interests&quot; from &quot;Terrorism&quot; or some other bullshit Propaganda. </p>

<p>Because after all, The government knows whats best for you, and they have your best interests at heart, and are simply here to protect you from you. And to make sure we all remain &quot; citizens of a free world.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, Sanders doesn&#39;t have the youth of JFK. He won&#39;t be in it for the long haul (at least as far as I can foresee) and he doesn&#39;t have the charisma say a propagandized, sensationalized, covered first-female-president does. Even if she is an old bitter bitch and does represent what Sanders looks like which is the status quo of old white men. </p>

<p>I like what he has to say but then again I actually read and question things.</p>

<p>Most of America is either caught up in the hipster Socialist revolution and have their heads up their ass swimming in the decay that is their offensive smelling bullshit, or they are imported labour given a voting card by the same government enabling them to destroy national unity, or they are uneducated morons captivated by slogans and or forced to vote along party lines because the alternative is to join people who despise them.</p>

<p>Even if electing a good leader was possible, which it isn&#39;t in parliamentary government, Americans couldn&#39;t do it because of the divide.</p>

<p>I still believe the US should be split up into South-Southwest and Northeast but that won&#39;t happen because 1) the divide is important to American war and the confusion they need to get things passed and 2) the chaos keeps the population busy on trivial matters that could be solved with a returning of land to the people by region.</p>

<p>Sanders is the last of a dying breed. You won&#39;t see many more like him. And he won&#39;t be president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to hold my breath. I believe that the only way for America to move forward is to spill a little blood. Right now, the people are letting the corporate elite and the politicians know that they will take it up the ass as long as things don&#39;t get bad too quickly but gradually. If you want to send the lobbyists a message, kill a bunch of them and their puppets in office. If the government won&#39;t uphold the law and prosecute treason, and won&#39;t take responsibility, it has to be forced by outside bodies. They aren&#39;t going to self-regulate.</p>

<p>I know right now there has been a backlash against talk of revolution, so I&#39;ll wait for after Sanders loses and then mention it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While things are bad and needed reform is not occurring, bloodshed would undoubtedly be a terrible disaster.  The government would respond with the hammer just as other countries have experienced the world over since civilized society was created, including America itself.  The federal government would win the 2nd civil war too.  Stalinist-like in-your-face totalitarianism is behind that door.  A mass nonviolent protest movement is much more preferable to the start of a bloody lost cause.  We demand change in peace until we can&#39;t anymore.  In other words, we don&#39;t start the fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A terrible disaster is tens of trillions of tax dollars going missing and not helping the people but rather being secretly spent on drugs and war and death across the planet, used to train terrorists and buy governments and cause death.</p>

<p>People are dying every day in America and overseas because of the US government and their corporate masters. So spilling a little more to finally solve the problem doesn&#39;t bother me.</p>

<p>I find it sickening that the population can sit by and watch as the US murders children from the sky and does nothing to help the hundreds of thousands of people at home who could use the DOD&#39;s money more than the pentagon. The spending in the US needs to be contained, the government needs to be dismantled, the order of things needs to be reset. That can&#39;t happen with a vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything has been clear it is that I agree that things are bad, are not being adequately addressed and that something needs to be done about it.  The AP ran an article today talking about the Oregon standoff - in the headline it states that people agreed with the cause of the standoff but disagreed with the tactics.  Most everyone should be on-board with that when it comes to violent confrontation with our government.  Besides the devastation it would sow, the people would not win that fight.  I don&#39;t know about you, but I would prefer that American towns and cities don&#39;t get bombarded by B-52&#39;s, F-16&#39;s and drones or be occupied by ground troops.  A bloody encounter with the government is a surefire way for that to occur.  We ought to avoid that as much as possible.</p>

<p>My political education has brought me to the conclusion that no one is suited to rule anyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because first of all, it&#39;s what has integrity.  That path has a heart.  Something too many americans lack: integrity and heart.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe in a thing, if at least 51% of the population agrees with me I advocate using deadly force to ensure their compliance&quot; damn dude that&#39;s some integrity</p>

<p>Secondly, because it sends a message.</p>

<p>The message &quot;I advocate harming people to enforce my beliefs&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thirdly, so that when we finally overturn the corrupt order, we know who to drill up the ass with a spire in the public square and who not to.  And who we want leading our country thereafter.</p>

<p>There you go advocating violence again</p>

<p>This implies that the person you&#39;re talking to shares your belief in democracy as non oppressive. It&#39;s funny how you bring up Stockholm syndrome while advocating working within the confines of a system you&#39;ve been victimized by your entire life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So they&#39;ll rig an election but they won&#39;t alter the numbers to make the tax cattle feel like they weren&#39;t cheated, right.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the most important part of your whole post. You don&#39;t believe in killing people but you advocate for a government which only exists because we are all aware it monopolizes the use of deadly force. What writing are you reading? The shit I&#39;m reading says you should look into a gun, because if you want change is not going to come from electing a dude who wants the government in charge of more parts of your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I thought you were actually trying to be clever and say that invading New Zealand would make an invasion of Australia easier. Instead it&#39;s just some random &quot;let&#39;s invade a pointless country for no reason&quot; sort of thing. OK, that&#39;s cool I guess. Historically, and even now, any country contemplating an invasion of Australia would definitely invade PNG. New Zealand is too far away, and has zero assets worth taking by force. Invading them because they kind of appear similar to Australians seems about as retarded as it&#39;s possible to get. My point about Norfolk Island stands. Oh, and just fyi, New Zealanders have a pretty long history of punching above their weight militarily, and I reckon would fuck the US war machine for WAY more than it was worth, with 100% help from their brothers over the Tasman sea I might add.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt.  Having served myself, I&#39;d like to see a Commander in Chief that uses his security services wisely.  After all, we&#39;re not G.I. Joes to be moved about willy nilly.  And while we ought to retain our military primacy, an audit is badly needed.  I think Senator Sanders would be the kind of Commander in Chief who would look at what big business charges government to build it the hardware and software our nation needs to defend it properly with and renegotiate terms so that the government and therefore taxpayer are not on the hook for outrageously inflated contracts. </p>
