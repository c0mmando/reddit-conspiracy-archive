I think there likely is a very small gap, maybe 95-99 cents on the dollar after accounting for the very relevant factors such as career choice and time spent out of the labor market raising children, etc., but the 79 cents figure Sanders quoted is clearly not the whole truth.</p>

<p>There is a 79 cent to the dollar issue. It is very clear to see. That we can explain this issue does not make it go away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not comparing apples to oranges then. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap#United_States">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the United States, the gender pay gap is measured as the ratio of female to male median yearly earnings among full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers. The female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2012, meaning that, in 2012, female FTYR workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers.[27] In other words, women in America make 77 cents for every dollar men in America make. Women&#39;s median yearly earnings relative to men&#39;s rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (from 60.2% to 71.6%), and less rapidly from 1990 to 2000 (from 71.6% to 73.7%) and from 2000 to 2009 (from 73.7% to 77.0%).[28][29] More recent statistics show in 2014 that women&#39;s median pay has increased to 79 cents, according to the Institute for Women&#39;s Policy Research.[30]</p>

<p>The raw wage gap data shows that a woman would earn roughly 73.7% to 77% of what a man would earn over their lifetime. However, when controllable variables are accounted for, such as job position, total hours worked, number of children, and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken, in addition to other factors, a U.S. Department of Labor study, conducted by the CONSAD Research Group, found in 2008 that the gap can be brought down from 23% to between 4.8% and 7.1%.[31]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me ask you this--should two employees, working for the same company, in the same position, be paid the same amount of money if one employee has taken 2 years out of their employment time, while the other has worked those 2 years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes</p>

<p>But I&#39;m probably not the correct person to talk to this about as I&#39;m sort of a communist. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s try turning the argument around. Why is it society puts more value in the work men do? Is it because men are better than women? Is it because women are stupid? Maybe they are just lazy? Is it because they don&#39;t like money?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to get at is that the wage gap is there and it is deeply imbedded in our societies. We simply ascribe higher monetary value to the average male. </p>

<p>You can find all the explanations and excuses you want but that doesn&#39;t make the wage gap go away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you&#39;re going - but your argument rings hollow because you don&#39;t give clear examples of <em>WHY</em> we should not ascribe higher monetary value to the average male (despite the average male&#39;s likelihood to actually work a higher % of their lives due to not having children). </p>

<p>A somewhat reasonable argument for your future use:
A man and a woman start the same job on the same day. Same incoming experience. Same salary. Same raises based on performance. Same opportunities. Same everything except gender. </p>

<p>Your argument is: 10 years down the road, their salaries / pay <em>SHOULD</em> be the same.
Right?</p>

<p>Lets say they are not the same. Let&#39;s say the woman&#39;s salary is now less, because 3 times over those 10 years, she took the generous maternity leave provided by her company (and therefore did not <em>actually work</em> during those times - therefore she has less experience and has contributed less to the company than her male counterpart who did not take maternity leave). So her wages and raises, benefits now reflect this fact that she did (slightly) less for the company and now has (slightly) less experience doing her job than her male counterpart.</p>

<p>This is the actuality of the &quot;real world&quot; right now.</p>

<p>You seem to be arguing that &quot;its just not fair for that to happen&quot; without actually trying to justify why it&#39;s not fair.</p>

<p>What you should be arguing is this - The woman still has the same qualifications and understanding of the job requirements and how to achieve them. By taking time out from work to raise and bond with her children she has taken on <em>NEW</em> responsibilities and learned <em>NEW</em> skills - which could actually bring fresh new perspectives, ideas and approaches back to her working life/environment. Meanwhile her colleague&#39;s &quot;additional&quot; experience has likely merely been &quot;daily grind&quot; type stuff - it&#39;s unlikely he experienced anything truly <em>NEW</em> during this time - so it&#39;s unlikely his extra work time has brought anything new to the table. Thus his value is diminished even though he did more &quot;actual work&quot; for the company. </p>

<p>There is a wage gap, it doesn&#39;t go away because you feel you can explain it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are misunderstanding me. (or I&#39;m being unclear whatever)</p>

<p>The gap is a fact, as you yourself mention.</p>

<p>There are explanations for this gap, but that doesn&#39;t make it go away and it certainly doesn&#39;t make it a myth. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s try this another way. Why is it women generally choose careers, educations and jobs that make less. Is it because they are stupid? (I can help a bit, you are going to answer that it is because they value other things higher)</p>

<p>Okay. So why is it society puts a higher monetary value on the things men like to do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the gap is sold as if it was just because of some magic sexist reason.
as i can see u already know the anwser? women choose a more balanced lifestyle, they are not as drawn into working 24/7 as many men are. they wanna have kids more than men do. many high paying jobs are dangerous (oil and stuff for example). women take part time jobs more often. </p>

<p>u said because they are stupid. maybe most  women just dont want to have these jobs actually? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that we are talking averages :)</p>

<p>I won&#39;t call these reasons sexist, but there is an underlying assumption that women should use more time at home, taking care of the kids and the man should provide for the family. </p>

<p>This leads a lot of men to work to hard, which I find to be a bigger problem than the wage gap. (because I&#39;m a dude working 60 hours a week and overworking is really dangerous) </p>

<p>But these are just explantions. The wage gap is still there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did consider that, but I think my point is that the deck is stacked in many ways. </p>

<p>One of them is that &quot;traditional male jobs&quot; are just payed better than &quot;traditional female jobs&quot;. I see this as a cultural relic from the time of mass production (where women were providers of necesities for the workers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called supply and demand. Highly technical jobs are a scarcity and also are lucrative as to what they build and contribute. Kindergarten teachers, councilors, and bank tellers are not scarcities whatsoever. And this goes hand-in-hand with the trades and why certain trades are more auspicious than others, simply because there is a shortage in expertise in specific fields (elevator operators, welders, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all the supply and demand thing is really a myth. </p>

<p>When that is said try lloking at the average wage for a nurse (4 years of training where I live, mostly women) against the average wage of a carpenter (also 4 years of training, mostly men)</p>

<p>It might be different where you are living but here the the carpenter makes almost 50% more. There are rational explanations for this, but they are not morally sound. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supply and demand is not a myth, you cretin. The more there is of something, its value goes down; there less there is of something, its value goes up (this of course is determined by the demand of a skill/product). There are a number of factors in which determine the wage rate of professions. Also, the level of expertise within a profession determines the hourly rate. I can assure you that the average carpenter starting out is not making the same rate as a nurse. And are those numbers being extrapolated from both union and non-union wages? </p>
