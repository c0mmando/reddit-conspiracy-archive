<p>The thing he&#39;s doing, which for me, is the most underated &amp; valuable is reminding the people along with the MSM, Top 1% etc ... that the systems of goverment we have in place currently rely implicitly  upon our widespread compliance, and probably wouldn&#39;t survive otherwise.</p>

<p>He&#39;s consistent on the issues which resonate with me and I think the majority of the American people...D&#39;ya think Citizens United or a 10+ year war in Iraq would have happened if this man was steering the ship? ....Nah</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t take political money...  I sppose then, he can&#39;t be pressured or coerced into changing his mind, what leverage would they have?...Fossil Fuel, Gun, Wallstreet...Doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>He still pickets for various causes, majority of which you just never hear about in the news. He understands the importance of Collective bargaining and unions, for millions of people.</p>

<p>Trade Agreements...Funny, the Gov/MSM traditionally hails them as monumental breakthoughs... I get the impression our dear Bern gets how devastating it can be for American workers to compete with $.03 $1.50/ hour...only one winner unfortunately... Profit motive!</p>

<p>Racism... still evident in our institutions... innocent people getting shot by police, harrassed &amp; put in jail. I know as a white person I&#39;m instantaneously given a free pass based on perception and cultural bias.
Another 30 somthin yrs of consistency regarding racial equality from the Bern.</p>

<p>Sexual inequality..only male politician I can think of who has consistently fought loud and clear on this issue... loud and clear for a looooong time</p>

<p>Education...The only extremist, radical who wants to join the rest of the world and give all people a real chance of acquiring academic success by choice, not if they can afford it.</p>

<p>Medical: Honestly, I don&#39;t know how this still even exists.. it&#39;s embaressing; when I tell my family and friends abroad... they just kinda laugh and say whaaaat? Really?? How much?
Universal Healthcare/ single payer... says the Bern..well what dya know?</p>

<p>Am I jaded and very suspicious of this paradoxical ray of sunshine? Yep, with good reason , considering the I&#39;ve been lied to, treat with contempt and completely ignored before...BUT ...I just can&#39;t argue with reason and reconcile empathy, I&#39;ll dust off the spurs, put my money where my mouth is...and...Fuck it, FEEL THE BERN!!!!

<p>Yeah, I’m not paying for you to get a fake degree in “Gender Studies” and then paying for you to be on the dole the rest of your life because no one is stupid enough to hire you.</p>

<p>Because you don’t even remotely comprehend the simplest concepts regarding the healthcare system or the problems inherent therein. The solution to an expensive system is not to <em>force</em> people–under penalty of death–to pay for the system, you economically illiterate [word redacted because for fuck’s sake]. The solution is to actually fix the system. Healthcare is not health insurance.</p>

<p>...you were also lied to here, by him. Now why don’t you educate yourself on the relevant topics and help us <em>actually</em> make America great again?</p>

<p>Oh, wow. Great rebuttal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no Sanders opponent has offered a remotely adequate argument against the man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>His desired economic policy has universally failed everywhere on Earth it has been tried under every government system it has been tried and at every technological level at which it has been tried.</p>

<p>He campaigns for unconstitutional allowance of citizenship to 30 million illegal invaders, whose entire purpose in this country is to drive a psychological wedge between the people thereof, thereby causing balkanization. All studies of group homogeny and heterogeny prove that the latter breeds distrust and unrest.</p>

<p>His plan for the healthcare industry is outside the mandate of the government, first and foremost, but also soundly refuses to actually address any of the problems therewith. Only someone with a criminal lack of understanding of financial matters would believe that forcing people to buy something they cannot afford is a better solution than making it affordable.</p>

<p>His delusions on racism (“racism”) stem from a concerted effort, again, to destroy both homogeny and the foundational tenants of the country itself. His beliefs thereon are unconstitutional. He does not care that his statements are universally false–the point is <em>not</em> to tell the truth.</p>

<p>His delusions on the sexes (there are two and only two, by the way, and they can never be changed), similarly, are founded in unconstitutional beliefs as well as blatant lies disproven by all scientific studies into the matter. When I say ‘all studies’ and ‘sexes’ I mean not only to reference the workforce, I mean to reference his support of genocidal and mentally ill behaviors such as who may “marry” whom.</p>

<p>What else, what else… I described education already. If there’s something else I’ve forgotten, let me know. Oh, and regarding more information on the individual points, as well as citations as to Sanders’ delusions… I’ll take you down to the absolute fundamentals of the beliefs themselves and rip them to shreds, burn the shreds, and then have a horse piss on them. Then I’ll bury the shreds in the desert east of Las Vegas, where things go to be forgotten. The man is not only a danger to America’s survival, he is a danger to the survival of the concept of sanity and mental health itself.</p>

<p>Now do you want to have your beliefs destroyed by me, MKUltra-style, or would you prefer to do your OWN research, elsewhere, into just why he’s completely delusional?</p>

<h2>Now, Bob, I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to point out that my &quot;rebuttal&quot; is just as good as your unqualified &quot;the irony here could stop a bullet train&quot; rebuttal, but I guess self-awareness is not your strong suit. I gave you the opportunity to qualify that statement and you never did. You just lied later about it and said that you claimed there was no difference and told me to read more carefully. Well, here&#39;s the rest of your comment: </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>His desired economic policy has universally failed everywhere on Earth it has been tried under every government system it has been tried and at every technological level at which it has been tried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Bob, let&#39;s compare Sanders to communist countries vaguely that really aren&#39;t an accurate comparison, especially when you <em>don&#39;t actually name them</em> as you&#39;ve done. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He campaigns for unconstitutional allowance of citizenship to 30 million illegal invaders, whose entire purpose in this country is to drive a psychological wedge between the people thereof, thereby causing balkanization. All studies of group homogeny and heterogeny prove that the latter breeds distrust and unrest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s hardly anything to argue against in this statement because it&#39;s just more vague bullshit. &quot;Their entire purpose,&quot; says you, is complete unqualified, yet again. You have trouble with backing up your statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His plan for the healthcare industry is outside the mandate of the government, first and foremost, but also soundly refuses to actually address any of the problems therewith. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite a statement and, yet again, one without any qualification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only someone with a criminal lack of understanding of financial matters would believe that forcing people to buy something they cannot afford is a better solution than making it affordable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally have no idea how it will pan out, but you are going to go on a rant against it, anyway. The fact is, most other western countries have a healthcare system as Bernie is proposing and it works much better than ours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His delusions on racism (“racism”) stem from a concerted effort, again, to destroy both homogeny and the foundational tenants of the country itself. His beliefs thereon are unconstitutional. He does not care that his statements are universally false–the point is not to tell the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, more hot air without substance or qualification. Racism is a huge problem in this country, but what are Sanders&#39; &quot;delusions&quot; about it and where is the evidence for your claims, once again? More random blabbering without substance or qualification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His delusions on the sexes (there are two and only two, by the way, and they can never be changed), similarly, are founded in unconstitutional beliefs as well as blatant lies disproven by all scientific studies into the matter.

<p>Qualify what in the fuck you&#39;re talking about and why the hell anyone should give a shit. I am beginning to think you&#39;re a Bible-thumping white guy afraid of your world changing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What else, what else… I described education already. If there’s something else I’ve forgotten, let me know. </p>

<p>Not really. The mandate of the government is quite plainly outlined and such behaviors fall outside it.</p>

<p>I know exactly how it will pan out because I’m cognizant of the history of all socialist nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize the message Bernie&#39;s sending is a nice one. People have compared it to the beginning of a society leaning towards star trek and other such fanciful notions. The truth is, he&#39;s going to be more of the same, just as Obama was. Aside from that, Bernie&#39;s &quot;new socialism&quot; is just communism by a more popular name, and again, as we all know, <em>communism does not work</em>.</p>

<p>Oh man.</p>

<p>Watching his speech I had a weird reaction. I&#39;m as cynical as the average poster here, I know that the very golden promises he&#39;s exposing are the very reasons he won&#39;t be elected, still... hearing those impassioned cries for the most basic decency, the base justice that is sorely needed to heal this fractured country, hearing those words out loud gave me a brief glimpse of hope. And a second later, an incredible sadness, sadness at seeing how the wheel spins again, how we are lied and fooled again, how we will pick up that rock and grab it to the top of the hill again...</p>

The very promises and statements he made are similar to Bernie&#39;s. And people finally are figuring out what a self serving liar obama has always been. I have no doubt Bernie is better than Hillary, my dog would be, but he may not be the best one offered to reshrink the government and restart an economy that hasn&#39;t been recovering 1/10th of as well as we are told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, come on. If there&#39;s a conspiracy in this year&#39;s primaries, it&#39;s Bernie Sanders. He was set up to make Hillary look good (which is why Joe Biden didn&#39;t run) all while preaching about free stuff and socalism so he could get donations to his presidential campaign. After a politician retires, they can transfer all of their campaign donations to their personal bank account TAX FREE, which is what Bernie&#39;s going to do once he&#39;s done after the convention and endorses the establishment whore Hillary Clinton, even though his campaign is all about being anti-establishment. </p>

<p>He is not and never has been a serious candidate. Why don&#39;t you think he&#39;s harped on Hillary about her emails? He could have at least easily won California.</p>

I doubt they&#39;d have an &quot;insider&quot; like Bernie exposing paid speeches, corrupt financing of elections and being vocally against the big banks... he hasn&#39;t made Hillary look good at all, closed a huge margin and is more favorable than she is, especially going up against trump in the polls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re taking an incredibly strong position on him because he&#39;s a marxist, please just offer 1 coherent similarity that&#39;s based in fact and we&#39;ll talk, throwing names is easy &amp; weak.

And to further disappoint you he&#39;s doing well nationwide. 42% currently and likely to go up... oh and it appears the group of people who fu#!ed this country are scared of him...</p>

<p>In future don&#39;t use figures that are counterintuitive to your argument, it does you no favors..He gets donations from groups representing millions of American workers... many of which will struggle financially every year. Hillarys donations are 10 TIMES THE SIZE and from single corporations representing a board of insanely rich people...I don&#39;t remember the $700 billion bailout for the International order of electrical workers. Oh and his current campaign is funded by the average donor. $27 buckaroos </p>

<p>I&#39;ll ignore your racism comment, you utter fool.</p>

<p>Sexism, cry me a river....men have been ahead forever, it not even a question of inequality chick&#39;s need equal pay.DONE.
In what ways are men Severely disadvantaged?? No example yet</p>

<p>I agree people shouldn&#39;t be able to take Mickie mouse courses that don&#39;t offer anything on the flip side, got my BA in Business  Studies....Bernie is going to use tax money on wallstreet speculation, offshore holding of profits etc. Your selfish reasons aside, it actually benefits the country down the road, it&#39;s an investment if we have a higher number of intelligent well educated people, given we have to compete with other emerging countries constantly, dumbing down this country would tear it apart from the inside.</p>

<p>I lived in the U.K for 19 years, I&#39;m pretty fucking clear how a single payer system works...and the disparity between theirs and ours in the U.S. is massive...Sure you may wait longer than you&#39;d like in seeing a doctor but at least 40 million people will also be able to as well... Maybe people won&#39;t have a terminal disease in the family and be in debt for life...  Grow up...and join the rest of civilization, show some compassion for you fellow person.</p>

<p>You strike me as I&#39;ll informed mid to late 50&#39;s vehement republican.. you bought the line about Bernie taking away all your money in tax and scary words like socialidn.You hold onto the word marxist like a prized weapon, hoping it makes you sound smart and present really inadequate evidence to your claims.</p>

<p>Only to finish with....I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!</p>

<p>Yeah, done centuries ago. There is no pay gap and there never has been a pay gap. <strong>Prove me wrong or don’t reply.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In what ways are men Severely disadvantaged?? No example yet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Women are treated better in the legal system.</p>

<p>Men are significantly more likely to be victim to violent crime–including rape. Domestic violence is committed equally; men are more likely to be arrested. Depictions of violence against men are humorous, against women are vilified.</p>

<p>It is legal to circumcise males against their will and illegal to illegalize it. Women cannot be circumcised.</p>

<p>Men pay higher premiums for auto, life and disability insurance, though discrimination according to race or other legitimate criteria is prohibited.</p>

<p>Male workplace deaths are 20x higher. Male suicide is 3x female and 80% of youths. Men are incarcerated 20x more. Men falsely accused of rape have their names published. Their accuser is protected and usually not charged.</p>

<p>Men have no reproductive rights. Men have few parental rights. A woman can name ANY man as the father. He receives a letter informing him of this. If he does not prove otherwise in 30 days, he is liable for support.</p>

<p>A boy victim to statutory rape must pay child support to his rapist. A man who is raped while unconscious must pay child support to his rapist. A man who fathers a child and wants custody can have his child adopted (kidnapped) against his will.</p>

<p>Men have a 10x higher risk of homelessness. Government spending is 8-50x greater to women than men.</p>

<p>Female-owned businesses get government support. Male businesses do not. Harder physical entrance criteria for men in many occupations, such as the army, police and fire service. Requiring men to be physically stronger than women in these occupations leaves men responsible for a greater share of the physical work, for no more pay.</p>

<p>In some countries, men have to pay more income tax than their female counterparts. E.g., in India, the income tax exemption limit for men is Rs 150,000 and Rs 180,000 for women. Some airlines ban men from sitting next to children.</p>

<p>Men are illegally convicted of rape on university campuses if the board finds the chance of rape is greater than 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Selective Service.</strong></p>

<p>Male prison sentences are longer.</p>

<p><strong>PROOF FOR THESE STATEMENTS IS AS FOLLOWS</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There’s nothing to suggest this will happen, since he wants to perpetuate the same economic system that created this mess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your selfish reasons aside</p>

<p>And what reasons were those, exactly? It’s selfish for me to want to keep what I earn and NOT selfish for you to want to steal it from me?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, a 90% income tax and forcing people to pay for others’ worthless degrees helps nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dumbing down this country would tear it apart from the inside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet that’s what you want to do… The problem with the cost of education is the government loans themselves, not the lack of them. Never mind the ‘free range’ nature thereof. A government loan should only be accessible if entering a major the government finds the nation NEEDS. Engineering, mechanical science, physics, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>at least 40 million people will also be able to as well</p>

<p>You need to look me in the eyes and believe me when I say, “I DON’T GIVE A SHIT.” They have no right to something for which they did not pay. They have no right to steal our medical services and not be citizens of our country. There are people who don’t have insurance BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT IT. <strong>Insurance is not healthcare.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe people won’t have a terminal disease in the family and be in debt for life…</p>

<p>So why do you want to implement a system WHICH FORCES EVERYONE TO DO JUST THAT?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Fuck off with your fallacies.</p>

<p>Pro tip: socialized medicine only works when someone else is footing the bill. We’re footing Europe’s bill.</p>

<p>Have some self respect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You strike me as I’ll informed mid to late 50’s vehement republican..</p>

<p>YEAH, how silly of me to believe something that HE HIMSELF SAID.</p>

<p>English not your first language? This has happened a few times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well here goes..</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you keep saying he&#39;ll raise income tax to 90%...Both state and federal tax combined is 73% not accounting for wider income. After 73% revenue generated falls so raising the tax rate further causes a loss, not a gain in revenue.
This tax increase is going to apply to income earners at $10 million and above, don&#39;t get me wrong... I don&#39;t believe in retrospective punishment or scapegoating the rich, clear evidence exists. Over the last 40 years a combination of Tax breaks, Trade Agreements and deregulation of industry in conjunction with tax avoidance has led to income moving toward the top 2% bracket, look at the revenues of our largest corporations....oil, tech companies and their relevant tax deductions....minimal. Meanwhile... the U.S. workforce is working more hours than any other country &amp; the middle class fight over a few annual GDP%. Fact...we currently pay double other countries per head in medical costs.....what for? We have the money,we have the need so why can&#39;t we do it.. If you want to view universal healthcare as forced slavery like rand Paul..or stealing another&#39;s democracy... I feel bad...you don&#39;t care that another human could would die because a small number of people are greedy for money.</p>

<p>You have no evidence to suggest he is bankrolled by TPTB... If you can find some, I&#39;ll consider changing my mind. Please don&#39;t recycle the argument that everyone is owned, he takes public donations because the public gives it to him..... what he is putting on the table has mass appeal. If you think it&#39;s all a clever charade, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help you.</p>

<p>Male circumcision... I think you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree on this one... You&#39;re Better off having a talk with organized religion about its constant disregard for moral behavior. Where you&#39;re confused is your understanding of equality ...I agree women are disproportionately favored when it comes to custody of children &amp; needs changing. He&#39;s not trying to take anything away from men, it&#39;s called an even playing field. As for the violence, rape and humor associated with such, what? Where does it say bernie condones this? Again the word is equality.</p>

<p>Israel.. Who protested when the republicans illegally invited Netanyahu into the house for a speech? If you look at bernies position, he believes in a two party state with full autonomy and recognition of a Palestinian state. Again he&#39;s been clear on speaking out against Israel policy. Your mind is on a loop...&quot;he&#39;s an American Jew, he must be involved in the Zionism conspiracy&quot;.... Again I can&#39;t help you...</p>

<p>If you stopped listening to Fox News, Alex Jones and a whole host of professional spin doctors on television, we could find common ground...extreme conservative views are outdated, we can have security, prosperity and equality in the U.S and I believe Bernie is taking a step towards that. Difference between us...One of us is excited &amp; optimistic... The other resentful and afraid...if we&#39;re all screwed no matter what, then so be it. Look up what fear and distress do to the human brain.</p>

<p>I don’t know why you keep saying he&#39;ll raise income tax to 90%...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://louderwithcrowder.com/bernie-sanders-wants-to-tax-americans-at-90-his-reasoning-is-priceless/">Because he said so.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fact...we currently pay double other countries per head in medical costs.....what for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Better healthcare than the rest of the world, one, and two because of the problems with the system. Which, AGAIN, are not solved by <em>forcing</em> people to pay for the broken system in the first place. Force competition within the system and prices go down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have the money,we have the need so why can’t we do it..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you don’t understand the “money” or the “need”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to view universal healthcare as forced slavery like rand Paul..or stealing another&#39;s democracy... I feel bad...you don’t care that another human could would die because a small number of people are greedy for money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Few things.</p>

<p>1) It’s slavery to have your work stolen from you and given to another.</p>

<p>2) We’re not a democracy.</p>

<p>3) You’re damn right I don’t give a shit. I am an altruist; that’s WHY I don’t give a shit. I will willingly give of myself to help others. I don’t take kindly to being forced into it. Keep your appeal to emotion to yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have no evidence to suggest he is bankrolled by TPTB...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proved it, in fact. Listed a link of his donors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he takes public donations because the public gives it to him.....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, of course. That’s not in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what he is putting on the table has mass appeal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among economic illiterates, social illiterates, and governmental illiterates, yes. Let it not be said that stupid people don’t exist! Anyone with any knowledge of the relevant fields knows that his beliefs do not work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Male circumcision... I think you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree on this one... You’re Better off having a talk with organized religion about its constant disregard for moral behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, since a government is fully capable of banning the practice, since they’ve done so with female circumcision. Notice that only jews circumcise as part of their religion. What the fuck should we care about what 2% of the nation wants to do? Why is it forced on men? Start thinking why that is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where you’re confused is your understanding of equality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, see, the word ‘equality’ has one meaning. It can’t be misconstrued. It can’t be altered. And it can’t change. I know exactly what it means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s not trying to take anything away from men, it&#39;s called an even playing field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s literally demanding that the last rights of men be taken from them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where does it say bernie condones this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I question your comprehension of English. It’s perfectly fine if it’s not your first language; just say so that I may understand WHY you don’t understand me.</p>

<p>I did not say anything about Bernie’s support of or belief in, regarding that list of things. The list was merely to highlight the rights of men as taken from women IN GENERAL. Sanders would FURTHER this inequality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel.. Who protested when the republicans illegally invited Netanyahu into the house for a speech?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, a republican, did. Fuck the zionists. Fuck the neocons. Fuck the dual citizens. They need to be expunged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you look at beanies position, he believes in a two party state with full autonomy and recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sanders is a jew. Do NOT kid yourself. He does not support two states. He supports the genocide of Palestinians and the creation of Greater Israel. Note that my distaste for Israel, et. al. does NOT mean that I support Palestine, et. al. Neither is in the right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he’s an American Jew, he must be involved in the Zionism conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, his actions dictate that. Brother Nathanael, for example, <em>was</em> a jew, but is certainly not a zionist. <em>His</em> actions dictate that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you stopped listening to Fox News, Alex Jones and a whole host of professional spin doctors on television</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t watch talmudvision. Since this is the only “argument” you have, it says quite a bit about <em>your</em> position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>security, prosperity and equality in the U.S and I believe Bernie is taking a step towards that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I have shown you that there will be no security (open borders), no prosperity (tripling of taxes), and no equality (further misandry) under Sanders. Your beliefs are meaningless in the face of fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Difference between us...One of us is excited &amp; optimistic... The other resentful and afraid...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I</em> am the former. <em>You</em> are the latter. Stop projecting your emotions onto others. The marxist must ALWAYS be in fear of the people until his rule has been secured by the sword. Then he must REMAIN in constant fear of their uprising, cutting them down at every turn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look up what fear and distress do to the human brain.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently, some people here believe the Illuminati or some other conspirators found a man committed to the same ideas for 40+ years who&#39;s shown unflappable commitment to his decidedly unusual ideals as far as American politics are concerned, which happen to be ideals that would hurt the 1% very much, as a matter of fact. After they found this man in Bernie, they got him to run as the underdog candidate while he racked up small independent votes and individual non-corporate contributions in a massive grassroots effort while the media completely ignored him and dismissed him as a non-serious candidate. The mainstream media continued to ignore him and dismissed him as quickly as possible when his name started to come up due to his success and popularity, even despite mainstream media blackout, right up until the primaries. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/11/13/455812702/clinton-has-45-to-1-superdelegate-advantage-over-sanders?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=social">And Hillary Clinton enjoys a 45-to-1 advantage in superdelegates</a> ... because that&#39;s just how insidious this conspiracy is!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you did not reply to me at all about the two topics we&#39;ve discussed in both exchanges. Topic one was the difference between labor unions and banks. You said that you already said there&#39;s no difference, but you didn&#39;t actually, and you didn&#39;t produce any more thoughts about that statement. Topic two was the idea that the globalists <em>want</em> all the things Bernie wants, which you did not post about here nor the other exchange where you failed to discuss labor unions vs billionaire banks.
