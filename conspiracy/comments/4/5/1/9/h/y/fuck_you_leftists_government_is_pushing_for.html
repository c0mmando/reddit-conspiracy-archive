<p>The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended mandatory depression screening for all Americans. The task force wants to force health insurance companies to pay for the screening. Basic economics, as well as the Obamacare disaster, should have shown this task force that government health insurance mandates harm Americans.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Government health insurance mandates raise the price of health insurance. Consumers will respond to this increase by either choosing to not carry health insurance or by reducing their consumption of other goods and services. Imposing new health insurance mandates will thus make consumers, many of whom are already suffering from Obamacare’s costly mandates, worse off by forcing them to deviate from their preferred consumption patterns.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Mandatory depression screening will not just raise insurance costs. In order to ensure that the screening mandate is being properly implemented, the government will need to create a database containing the results of the screenings. Those anti-gun politicians who want to forbid anyone labeled “mentally ill” from owning a firearm will no doubt want to use this database as a tool to deprive individuals of their Second Amendment rights.</p>

<p>———————</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gun control seeks to block people with &quot;mental issues&quot; from being able to exercise second amendment</p>

<p>government wants to mandate &quot;mental health screenings&quot;</p>

<p>government will keep a database of these screenings</p>

<p>government will extend definition to implement gun control</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s even worse.  Singlepayer would be literally the government controlling your healthcare.  Then you can say hello to fitness trackers being mandatory, I called this as soon as they started coming out with the fitbit type trackers.  Its like the progressive insurance module that they track your driving habits with. Its a great way to &quot;save tax dollars&quot; in regards to single payer, if someone doesn&#39;t exercise the required amount every day they are penalized(taxed more) or their benefits could be cut(suicide pills aka &quot;death with dignity&quot;)</p>

<p>For who?  If you couldn&#39;t afford health insurance there is something called medicaid/medicare.  No one doesn&#39;t have access to healthcare, its a totally bogus argument.  Hell, illegals can come here and get all the healthcare they want, FOR FREE.</p>

<p>I would take no healthcare over giving the power to the government.  Giving them control over healthcare is giving them control over you living or dying for the &quot;common welfare&quot;.  </p>

<p>bull.  fucking.  shit.  i didnt have health insurance from the time i wss 21 until i wss 30 because i didnt make enough to pay to private payer but too much for medicaid.  i didnt get health insurance until after i graduated and i could pay for private payer.</p>

<p>LOOOOOOOOOOOL  i dont think you quite understand how laughable that is.  homie was living off of about $15000 a year.  the only time i could qualify for medicaid was if i was having some kind of acute episode.  so surgery, some terrible chronic condition etc. these are the circumstances i could qualify.  but doctors visits, emergency room visits, ambulances, no, i didnt qualify.  see, everyone can qualify for this kind of medicaid.  they might even telly you &quot;yeah, you can get covered for this and that,&quot; but when it comes time to pay up, you get stuck with most of the bill.  </p>

<p>let me ask you this: if you qualify fo medicaid then why didnt you take it?  i mean, youre already paying for it if you work.  its taken out of your check.  so why not take it?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re only making $15,000 a year then you are more than eligible for medicaid.  You&#39;re also a loser.  That&#39;s literally minimum wage, $7.50 an hour.  So you&#39;re lying about not being eligible.  Because that is literally the baseline of full time employment.</p>

<p>i live in one of the poorest areas of america.  i do significantly better now, but i have never been exactly lazy.  and btw, when all this happened minimum wage was $5.25 an hour.  </p>

<p>and as i said, i WAS eligible for medicaid, but only in dire circumstances.  you tell me you didnt take because of principals.  bullshit.  you didnt take it because medicaid FUCKING SUCKS!  youre work plan is way better im sure.  nice of you trying to make yourself feel better by trying to make yourself look superior.  if you need to do that to feel good about yourself, go ahead.  but just know you would never make it where i live.  you would be just as poor as the rest of us here.  probably on pills or meth because you cant reconcile your ambition with your reality.   </p>

<p>You know, before you go spouting off about &#39;ists&#39; and &#39;isms&#39; with your heavily opinionated and edited copy/paste from a forum, that was originally copied from Ron Paul&#39;s website. Ron Paul is never alarmist about anything, right? Nahh...</p>

<p>Nice bait, m8.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the government knows what&#39;s best for you.  Just accept it, citizen.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re against this, it&#39;s like you&#39;re saying you want people to be depressed.  That&#39;s just silly.  Think of the children.</p>

<p>But seriously - Any time you let the government start interfering in your life like this THERE IS NO END.  People need to realize this.  There is no point at which the government will say &quot;well, that&#39;s enough taking care of people, time to let them be free.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man that&#39;s a terrible question.  Here&#39;s another one: &quot;How will you know that my serotonin uptake is appropriate?&quot;</p>

<p>Seems obvious, but it really isn&#39;t because SSRI&#39;s actually causes a widespread <em>depletion</em> of serotonin in the brain until the raphe nuclei gets exhausted (which takes a few weeks).</p>

<p>edit: by &quot;terrible&quot; I mean &quot;awesome&quot;</p>

<p>so if you were making more than that you could have easily afforded health insurance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOOOOOOOOOOOL  i dont think you quite understand how laughable that is.  homie was living off of about $15000 a year.  the only time i could qualify for medicaid was if i was having some kind of acute episode.  so surgery, some terrible chronic condition etc. these are the circumstances i could qualify.  but doctors visits, emergency room visits, ambulances, no, i didnt qualify.  see, everyone can qualify for this kind of medicaid.  they might even telly you &quot;yeah, you can get covered for this and that,&quot; but when it comes time to pay up, you get stuck with most of the bill.  </p>

<p>let me ask you this: if you qualify fo medicaid then why didnt you take it?  i mean, youre already paying for it if you work.  its taken out of your check.  so why not take it?</p>
