       According to
       <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4748923,00.html">
        this article
       </a>
       , back in 2000 Yossi Cohen, who was recently appointed the new head of the Mossad, "decided to take an unpaid leave from the organization in favor of private business and in order to dedicate more time to his children... In 2002, Cohen rejoined the Mossad in a new position, head of Junction's Special Operations Center..."
      </p>
      <p>
       LOL, taking more time to spend with the family is the oldest canard in the list of political excuses and cover stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much you want to bet that he took a "leave of absence" to plan and oversee the Mossad's contribution to 9/11? Being a "private businessman" would have given him cover to travel as needed in the US without necessarily arousing suspicions. If he were caught, it would have distanced him from the organization and offered some plausible deniability. Lo and behold, 9/11 was a big success (for its perpetrators), and he was rewarded with a promotion. Why would they promote someone who had just taken a 2+ year leave of absence? I smell stinky socks.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW,
       <a href="http://vho.org/aaargh/fran/livres11/OSTROVbywayofdecep.pdf">
        I posted a link
       </a>
       earlier today to a book by a former Mossad agent "whistleblower." Though he doesn't have anything to say about 9/11...
      </p>
      <p>
       And FYI, the "Mossad" in Hebrew means the "institution." Very Orwellian sounding if you ask me.

       Well, it definitely took longer than 4 months to plan 9/11. And it definitely took more than one person. Maybe Cohen was his second in command? Or maybe Cohen's leave of absence was just another co-inkydink...

       How is it ridiculous? Because I used quotation marks around the phrases quoted directly from the article I linked to? I simply stated the facts. He took a leave of absence to pursue private business. And he did so during the same period as the events of 9/11 were being planned and carried out. Of course this assumes that the WTC towers were brought down using controlled demolitions. If you don't agree with that premise, well then I can understand why it seems so 'ridiculous' to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be that as it may, I don't really care if the subreddit gets a bad rap because other people think it's silly to consider possibilities, however unlikely they may be. It's that kind of fearful thinking (and fear of thinking) that keeps the truth suppressed. Why should I care if people who have been brainwashed and are sleepwalking through life think I'm ridiculous? You should really ask yourself why you are trying to censor the limits of acceptable thought.

       He doesn't make anything sound ridiculous, this is written in a very casual, readable way, and it's pretty clear to anyone who even glances at the first couple of pages in that book that the Mossad either has its hands behind many diabolical plots, or they know about it and supervise to help it happen.
