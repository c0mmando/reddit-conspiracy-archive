       , too. I don't think Rall is a 9/11 truther--but at least he does question the "Official Story."
      </p>
      <p>
       The last AMA Rall did was in r/books--he hosted it with 2 of Snowden's attorneys. Ted Rall has also worked with author Chris Hedges. I'm pretty sure Ted Rall supported the OCCUPY movement as well...

        2004 book discussion
       </a>
       in which Ted describes both his visit to Afghanistan and his opposition to the post-9/11 wars.  Within the first 10 minutes of the 2004 video, Ted explains his view:  that on 9/11 the U.S. was attacked by mostly ethnic Egyptians, 15 of whom held Saudi passports, and were funded by Pakistanis and the Saudis--yet we attacked Afghanistan...(sound familiar?)

       <p>
        When audio experts cleaned the garbage interference on the tape, the LAPD and LA Times accusations fell to pieces.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my surprise – and Rall’s glee – the crowd that Rall had allegedly "fantasized about" suddenly came alive – with three women shouting, “Why’d you handcuff him?” and “Take off his handcuffs!”– the handcuffs that were supposedly fabricated by Rall.  (One woman helpfully suggested to the officer, “Don’t forget to ride his ---hole!”)

       I dont know much about your work but I checked out your website after I saw the picture of your AMA, which was cute. You look like a good guy that cares about the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed your cartoons are mostly political and I wondered if you knew or thought our political system is a trap to get people to support they're own demise.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the ruling class
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008#Rationale_for_the_bailout">
        exempt themselves from laws they expect us to live by
       </a>
       and the system in which they operate
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act#Notable_or_controversial_NDAA_legislation">
        grows stronger with each crime
       </a>
       it becomes a choice to
       <a href="http://caulds.blogspot.ca/2016/02/populism-electoral-politics-and-war.html">
        give your power away to that system
       </a>
       , by supporting it with your time, money and energy,
       <a href="http://new.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/decentralized-revolution-states-standing-against-federal-government/">
        or stop playing the game
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If our system of government was a rigged game, like a shady gambling establishment that cheats people out of their money, what would you gain by continuing to visit that establishment? Why don't more people turn away from Representative politics and instead work in their communities to make the world a better place?

       Intellectual Property seems non existent these days when it comes to the internet.   Authors, writers, cartoonists, musicians, filmmakers, etc., are seeing their work stolen and either given away for free via torrents or worse rehosted and monetized without the authors permission and in many cases with little recourse to stop the hemorrhaging of what little money the content creator could have made via AdSense or other pitiful compensation.  Ex:  Viral videos are ripped from Youtube and posted by celebrities on Facebook for millions of views, but 100% lost revenue for the Content Creator.   Or full record albums or movies are posted by 3rd parties on Youtube, who are then able to monetize for their own benefit.   The worst part of all is that these companies like Google or Facebook make no attempt to police the work of the small artist/author, instead only occasionally removing stolen content of those with the financial means to fight it in the courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess at the end of the day, as a small time artist myself, I feel like I'm drowning.   I have the public on one side who consume my product for free and don't care, and mega companies on the other side who will happily make money off me without regard to whether I'm getting paid my fair portion, or at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you deal with it.  It must be hurting your bottom line.  Your books are out there being torented.  You cartoons are rehosted on Facebook or here on Reddit all the time without links to your sites.  What can we as artists do to stop the hemorrhaging and fight back?

       I'd like to know what he has to say about the online plight of his peer Ben Garrison, a libertarian leaning cartoonist who was viciously and repeatedly defamed and vilified by Israel-firsters and pro-war authoritarians both here on reddit and especially on anonymous forums like 4chan.

       I had never heard about this...I'd imagine political cartoonists get attacked quite a bit--especially if they are critical of U.S. or Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I thought Ted Rall would be a great AMA for the sub is that he is always questioning.  I don't think he's a 9/11 truther--but at least he actively questions some of the "official story."
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of U.S. militarism--it would be hard to find political cartoons which are more scathing than Ted's.  He has also actually gone to Afghanistan (and

       Hi Ted.  I used to actively follow your cartoons and essays.  I still enjoy them, but no longer so actively.  I think the last time I looked at rall.com, the background was black and el busho was still generalissimo.  Just wanted to write that I'm glad you're still around and kicking.  I hope you never get a return of the

       What are your thoughts on "silent censorship" (as I call it)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning the artist is free to produce his art but he is cut out of the public by corporation/state using various methods that don't appear to be censorship at first glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, google algorithm may chose to ignore dissent websites or links that points to artist work. This is made by google target search result that is supposedly based on user history search (which is funny, I'm constantly searching for alternative media, yet google ignores it :) and gives me always mainstream results) . There is a similar behavior of facebook off course.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit is quite infamous about censorship also. I'm not sure is you are familiar with Matthew Inman
       <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">
        http://theoatmeal.com/
       </a>
       At some point, every time he created a comic, you could find a link to his creation on reddit front page (if you are not familiar with reddit this means most of the user will see what gets on frontpage and you get massive exposure for your message).
      </p>
      <p>
       He was quite popular till he got involved with "Tesla revival" (Tesla was a genius and Edison a dick basically) Well after this no more front page for him. He was gone. There was no announcement about "Hey this guy is unwelcome here because we said so" Nope, just silently out of public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so what are your thoughts on "silent censorship" and did it ever happened to you?

       How do you address accusations of racism in your work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some seem to think that your caricatures are drawn in a racially insensitive way. Personally, I don't feel that way. Just playing Devil's advocate.

       The cartoonist in question seems quite fond of smearing people as "racist."
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that "anti-racism" is the official ideology of the current authoritarian regime, the cartoonist in question being smeared as "racist" is kind of ironic, if not downright amusing.

       Racism is ugly and unpleasant. The vast majority of empathetic people condemn it and therefore it's used frequently by myriad people as a rhetorical attack during arguments, sometimes without justification.

       "Racism" is a common accusation by authoritarians against their political enemies, not particularly different than how the term "reactionary" was used in the Soviet regime or "capitalist roader" was used in Communist China.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cartoonist in question has made a number of accusations of "racism" against his political opponents, and he himself was accused of "racism" by his detractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's rather humorous, a bunch of people engaged in a circle-jerk, accusing each other of "racism." Like a bunch of old, religious ladies accusing each other of "lust."
