        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s no mystery that there is racial tension in America between the white and black demographics because of a lot of police killings, the #BLACKLIVESMATTER movement, etc. Now I was noticing how the media periodically bashes down the a prominent figure in the African American community, it happened with Michael Jackson and a more recent example of this would be (please bear with me) Bill Cosby.</p>

<p>Now I know there are some who genuinely believe he drugged these women and carried out horrible acts, but let&#39;s look at the proof. The very nature of the act of rape is so emotionally stimulating to our society with the advent of &quot;Political Correctness&quot; that envelopes it, we magnify the crime&#39;s reception by 10,000. The media knows this, and the media plays on it. So accuse a front running black man of rape, you don&#39;t even need to present viable evidence rather than a few &quot;detailed descriptions of what happened, from first hand accounts of the victims&quot; and people will be riled up, the masses will chatter and produce their own vocal evidence, the media can very easily form our perspectives and we don&#39;t even realize when it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>The Cosby scandal bears so many earmarks that are all-too-familiar to the black psyche: contempt for black success, the taboo of black men sleeping with white women, mixed with more contemporaneous issues such as the overzealous contempt for President Barack Obama in Red State America, and the last six months of civil unrest regarding the killing of unarmed black men at the hands of police. These are all things that black and white culture clash over, and the media has painted it all.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;d say why would there be a motive for a conspiracy against Bill Cosby? Well.. aside from igniting further tension between African American culture and white media, and the American justice system to provoke an even <strong>LARGER</strong> divide between groups in America to quell any possibility of rising against TPTB, and combating socioeconomic injustice among other things.. Bill Cosby was trying to buy NBC.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/29/business/the-media-business-bill-cosby-trying-to-buy-nbc-from-ge.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/29/business/the-media-business-bill-cosby-trying-to-buy-nbc-from-ge.html</a></p>

<p>Now why would they have to prevent him from buying this media outlet? Well my friends.. that&#39;s why we&#39;re here. To discuss the possibility of the man in the shadows pulling the strings. Is it coincidental that all of this Black White stuff is happening more and more everyday as presented in the media? And that we have another black man at the front of African American culture socially suppressed by being accused of something like <em>rape</em>? I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the white man putting down the black man, that&#39;s what they want you to think the argument is about, the argument is in reality that they&#39;re trying to separate us, social groups, cultural groups, and demographic groups. Divide and Conquer is a real and valid strategy, and it&#39;s being executed now, they want us to think color actually matters, and are capitalizing on that among other things. It&#39;s well thought out plan, at least from my perspective. </p>

<p>So what do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll repost something I found earlier.</p>

<p>Cosby goes his entire career without a single accusation. Decades flawless, completely unblemished.</p>

<p>In 2005, Cosby goes on a massive tirade against thug lyfe yo culture.</p>

<p>Actually, here’s the full text of it:
    They’re standing on the corner and they can’t speak English. I can’t even talk the way these people talk: Why you ain’t, Where you is, What he drive, Where he stay, Where he work, Who you be… And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. And then I heard the father talk.
    Everybody knows it’s important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can’t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. In fact you will never get any kind of job making a decent living. People marched and were hit in the face with rocks to get an education and now we’ve got these knuckleheads walking around. The lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids.
    $500 sneakers for what? And they won&#39;t spend $200 for Hooked on Phonics. I am talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit. Where were you when he was 2? Where were you when he was 12? Where were you when he was 18 and how come you didn&#39;t know that he had a pistol? And where is the father? Or who is his father? People putting their clothes on backward: Isn’t that a sign of something gone wrong? People with their hats on backward, pants down around the crack, isn’t that a sign of something? Isn’t it a sign of something when she has her dress all the way up and got all type of piercings going through her body? What part of Africa did this come from? We are not Africans. Those people are not Africans; they don’t know a thing about Africa.
    I say this all of the time. It would be like white people saying they are European-American. That is totally stupid.
    I was born here, and so were my parents and grandparents, and, very likely, my great grandparents. I don’t have any connection to Africa, no more than white Americans have to Germany, Scotland, England, Ireland, or the Netherlands. The same applies to 99% of all the black Americans as regards to Africa. So stop, already! With names like Shaniqua, Taliqua, and Mohammed and all of that crap. And all of them are in jail.
    Brown or black versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person’s problem. We have got to take the neighborhood back. People used to be ashamed. Today a woman has eight children with eight different “husbands”–or men or whatever you call them now.
    We have millionaire football players who cannot read. We have million-dollar basketball players who can&#39;t write two paragraphs. We, as black folks, have to do a better job.
    Someone working at Wal-Mart with seven kids; you are hurting us. We have to start holding each other to a higher standard. We cannot blame the white people any longer.</p>

<p>Liberal assplosion of buttflustering rivals the eruption of Pompeii.</p>

<p>Not even a year later, the first rape accusation surfaces.</p>

<p>It’s a massive spectacle, but NO other victims step forward. NONE.</p>

<p>Cosby isn’t even charged, due to absolutely NO evidence. None, zero.</p>

<p>Ten years pass.</p>

<p>Trayvon happens, Brown happens.</p>

<p>Cosby is still telling blacks to stop killing and raping each other while not speaking properly or wearing properly sized pants.</p>

<p>Suddenly, 40 victims step forward, all claiming they were raped by Cosby 30 years ago, all telling the exact same story.</p>

<p>NO charges, because there’s no evidence in ANY OF THEM.</p>

<p>Butthurt, they instead try to sue him for slander.</p>

<p>EVEN THAT DOESN’T WORK BECAUSE THERE’S NO EVIDENCE FOR EVEN THAT.</p>

<p>The accuser count is now over 100. Over fucking 100. And no charges yet because EVEN IN 100 ACCUSATIONS OF DRUGGINGS AND RAPES, THERE IS NO PROOF. IN 100+ CASES, IN NOT ONE OF THEM IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE. NONE.</p>

<p>Suddenly, judges claim “the statute of limitations starts when a woman claims she first remembers it!”</p>

<p>And yet, STILL no charges, STILL no evidence.</p>

<p>After two years of this, they find the one single case in which the statute of limitations isn’t up, and do everything they possibly can to charge him with it, despite no evidence at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One woman alleges Cosby sexually molested her in 1969. In the early 1980s, she told a reporter about the incident, but the reporter decided not to write about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John Milward, a freelance reporter and author, confirmed that Tarshis told him about her Cosby allegations in the early 1980s, though he never wrote about them. And, Tarshis said, she never contacted the police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some Playboy bunnies discussed Cosby sexually assaulting them in 1996:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Valentino was contacted by another former Playboy Playmate, Charlotte Kemp, Miss December 1982, who said she was writing a book called “Centerfold Memories,” which is due out in February.</p>

<p>In an interview, Kemp — whose real last name is Helmkamp — said she videotaped an interview with Valentino during which she talked about her alleged encounter with Cosby. Helmkamp said the account she gave matches the account Valentino provided to The Post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quotes from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bill-cosbys-legacy-recast-accusers-speak-in-detail-about-sexual-assault-allegations/2014/11/22/d7074938-718e-11e4-8808-afaa1e3a33ef_story.html">WaPo</a>. </p>

<p>So it looks like you have at minimum, allegations from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s that were at least out there before this &quot;conspiracy&quot; to hunt down Bill Cosby. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I know it sounds crazy, but how easy is it for me to say that in 1993, I, a journalist, was brought a story by a woman who claims to have been raped by Cosby, and I decided not to go through with it and announce it. The fact this is all coming out at once is what makes this a sus situation. The media didn&#39;t inflate these claims for some reason, and all of a sudden they are the focus of celebrity culture. That is what&#39;s confusing and thought provoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of my post was more to just point out the plain inaccuracy of the parent comment. He said Cosby went decades without allegations which is false. He also said no criminal charges have been filed, which is false. Basic facts in his post are wrong, so we probably shouldn&#39;t assign much weight to the rest of it. </p>

<p>To your point. I&#39;m not sure I buy that this is the media or something else coming after him. If you remember, the comedian Hannibal Buress, who most people probably hadn&#39;t heard of before his Cosby bit went viral, was the one who basically reignited this story.</p>

<p>So I dont think the question is who tried to reignite the story, but instead why it caught on this time. And I think the answer to that is just our culture. Rape and sexual assault are looked at a lot differently now than they used to be. Bill Cosby joked about date raping girls in the 70s, and people laughed. How would a joke like that go over now? Another example, before the 1970s, spousal rape was not a thing in the US. It was legally impossible for a husband to rape his wife. </p>

<p>Compare that to today where California a few yeas ago passed a law that requires you get affirmative consent from someone to have sex with them. </p>

<p>Attitudes change over time. And I think thats what happened here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solid points. I&#39;m saying that as well, because of our culture being so reactant to rape and sexual crimes this day in age, it is a good tool to utilize to spark controversy on a figure who you&#39;d like snuffed out, lack of concrete evidence doesn&#39;t matter when people slander you as a child diddler, or a rapist because a lot people within society no longer believe in innocent until proven guilty if it involves rape (in most cases). It&#39;s also a really fine line between saying that, and &quot;victim blaming&quot; which is what <em>everyone</em> tries to avoid out of fear of being looked at as someone who supports these types of crimes. It&#39;s a whole shitshow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow I&#39;m so glad you showed me this, I didn&#39;t even know about his movement against the dumbing down of his culture, and fought against that and tried to awaken the masses of those black people, they really wanted to keep this guy out, and about the 100+ accusers.. Holy fucking shit.</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>ALSO</strong> this could be why he wanted to buy NBC.. to use a major media outlet to promote his views and hopefully wake up not only black America but America as a whole, and mount a personal campaign for true societal change. THERE IS THE MOTIVE PEOPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You left out OJ Simpson.  Yeah my first call of it was &quot;they are just trying I destroy a black hero&quot;.</p>

<p>Consider that Bill&#39;s son Ennis was senseless murdered at random; was that an earlier attempt to destroy Bill? </p>

<p>Another thing is, if you followed this sub for the last few years, there was a coordinated wish by white nationalists to ignite a &quot;Race War&quot;.  it was spoken of before the Trayvon verdict, and then we were told around 2nd half of 2014, that there would be &quot;race riots&quot; in the coming year, which, if you consider Baltimore and St Louis, there effectively were, but they were a few months later than predicted (/planned). </p>

<p>Why? It&#39;s the &quot;Palestinianization&quot; of black Americans.  The racists don&#39;t want integration, they want to keep the &quot;other&quot; people separate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Cosby was part of a network of powerful people that were able to protect him and scrub bad press and &#39;problems&#39;.  I&#39;m sure he did rape &#39;some folks&#39;</p>

<p>But similar to Tom Cruise&#39;s doctor friend in EYES WIDE SHUT, who had Cruise nurse a hooker back to life, only to be witness to her cultic &#39;disappearance&#39; (they killed her later for &#39;taking his place&#39;), Cosby was free to do bad for a long time.</p>

<p>However, I think Cosby did something and got kicked out from being &#39;in network&#39; (let&#39;s call it &#39;the boule&#39; for lack of a better term), and as an outlier, they threw him to the dogs and all kinds of holy hell rained down on him.</p>

<p>Maybe he started to talk about Jesus and/or went against God in some way (Jabulon -- lucifer the demiurge the grand architect is their gnostic God), or maybe he revealed some important secrets of theirs...a sentence normally punishable by ripping out the tongue and burying you to the neck at low tide; but cosby is famous so instead they destroyed his life, his image, his career, his memory</p>

<p>they killed his son as a warning</p>

<p>except that in his past deposition, he admits to giving all the women he didn&#39;t&#39; rape roofies #fact -- because, you know how much women like to be drugged unconscious before they get fucked.</p>

<p>so, it&#39;s not that there is &quot;NO&quot; evidence... it&#39;s whether or not the evidence that DOES exist is submissible in court.</p>

<p>Cosby goes his entire career without a single accusation. Decades flawless, completely unblemished.</p>

<p>Except this isn&#39;t true. Tamara Lucier Green&#39;s accusations surfaced in 2005, yes, and others followed, but there were several accusations before that. Joan Tarshis told a reporter in the 1980s. A reporter declined to do the story.  Victoria Valentino accused him in the 1990s. It went nowhere. Lachele Covington in 2000, which included a police report. Andrea Constand in 2004, a year before the date you set for Cosby becoming a target, and also involving authorities.</p>

<p>Basically, your entire premise is flawed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I WAS THINKING ABOUT TUPAC TOO! HE WAS BASHING THE MEN IN THE SHADOWS SO HARD. Even in his interviews he talked about revolution. His music later capitalized on change, societal change to be exact. The song Changes is a prime example of his vision! &quot;Both black and white are smoking crack tonight..&quot; man, I swear. You guys understand this perfectly. We need to do something about all of this, even if it&#39;s just a try in the dark. We&#39;re intelligent, we know the message these people were trying to get out, we know they were snuffed out. They can snuff out one or two, or even three, but can they quell thousands without looking suspicious? We have nothing to lose by rising up. That is the message Tupac was putting through his music and his interviews, and his conversations with people. He was a true visionary.</p>

<p>That said I dont&#39; think the issue is this simple and I do believe there are multiple unknowable conspiratorial aspects of this cosby story.  It&#39;s very fishy, and I&#39;ve always thought so. Keep digging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bill Cosby story was disseminated to distract the public from the earlier Bill Clinton &quot;Rape Island&quot; scandal, where the former President was busted hanging out with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Three underaged girls wrote out sworn depositions that Clinton slept with them. Just as Hillary was gearing up to kick off her campaign, the media spiked the Bill Clinton story and replaced it with Bill Cosby.</p>

<p>Once the (far-less-egregious) accusations about Cosby came out, the media developed amnesia about the former President and the news cycle shifted from one Bill to another.</p>

<p>I remember none other than Chris Matthews at MSNBC covering Congressman Larry Craig&#39;s scandal regarding gay dalliances in bathrooms and saying, &quot;Wait! This stuff is three years old. Why is it coming out <em>now?</em>&quot; He cagily knew that the Powers That Be have files on people, and, when that person crosses them, they leak the material to the press.</p>

<p>So if the Cosby allegations were decades&#39; old, why did the press choose to break the story <em>now?</em></p>

<p>Answer: Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I take it Jimmy Pedoville, the white Bill Cosby in the UK if you like, was also framed for trying to lift the lost youths in backward mining villages to higher moral and cultural standards through god honest entertainment ... Ha.</p>

<p>Here in my country, not the UK, the exact same thing happened with the presenter of a knock-off &#39;Kids say the darnedest things&#39; show. Oh, the ironic coincidence ...</p>

<p>This shitbag was caught in the act in Thailand by the police. Allegations in his native country were made prior to the raid but never believed ... and afterwards too. He fled abroad before going to trial ... guess where: fucking Thailand.</p>

<p>Let me tell you this much: Cosby has the exact profile of a kiddie fiddler considering the 2 examples I just gave. In fact, the similarities are nothing short of completely obvious. </p>

Having said this, I believe that same establishment is bringing us all down by this &#39;divide and conquer&#39; race-baiting you are alluding to. as without this, a united America in 2016 could indeed cause trouble for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! Thanks for this.  I think for sure Bill Cosby was smeared.  Think of all the things that go down in Hollywood.  Plus I don&#39;t hear the same media crying about Polanski where the girls were even younger.  </p>

<p>There was a similar racial bias to the Clarence Thomas nomination.  The whole &quot;pube on the coke can.&quot;. Think about what a short hair from a African man&#39;s head looks like and try tell me those accusations weren&#39;t using Thomas&#39; race to make him seem worse then he actually was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people who put on a front of clean upstanding status always turn out to be the most depraved degenerates. It&#39;s always the politician who claims to be the most upstanding christian straight anti-gay, anti-drug views, that gets caught having gay sex in a truckstop bathroom, high on meth. So when Bill Cosby, a comedian known for his clean comedy and his upstanding Dr. Huxtable character, turns out to be a roofie rapist, I am not surprised at all. It&#39;s the people who are open and honest about their kinks, that are the most trustworthy. When someone pretends to be perfect, I can almost guarantee they have some serious skeletons in the closet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your entire argument there boils down to &quot;da wyte maine tryin ta keep da black maine down,&quot; which we&#39;ve been hearing for <em>years</em>. How about the fact that most media outlets <em>ignore</em> black crime, fail to describe the perpetrators accurately when they <em>do</em> cover it (&quot;youths&quot; for instance, is almost a meme at this point), and only really put any effort into covering it properly if it&#39;s someone rich/famous like Cosby?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t hear about black crime statistics in the media. Some negroes shoot up the hood and half a dozen gangbangers die, along with a few black people from &#39;the ghetto&#39;? Sheeeiiit, that&#39;s a Tuesday as far as news media is concerned. White cop shoots armed black thug? HOLY FUCK, stop the presses, this man has committed a hate crime! Latino man shoots a young black thug casing his neighborhood in an act of self-defense? Call him white, put up pictures of the &quot;child&quot; from when he was 12 (because all the recent ones from his facebook show him acting like a thug), put up pictures of the &quot;white&quot; <em>alleged</em> murderer in his prison orange jumpsuit, paint the entire thing as a racial hate crime... and oh wait, as it turns out the <del>criminal</del> youth in question might actually have been involved in a series of break-ins in the neighborhood? Well, no longer newsworthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he did. Either way he brings up the legit point that the media is not just in the business of &quot;keeping the black man down&quot;. It&#39;s also in the business of &quot;making the white man look racist&quot;. In a way he is not even disagreeing with the whole divide, and rule theory that this topic is pushing. </p>

<p>The divide, and rule tactic has been used as far back as the Romans to keep the lower class in line. It&#39;s not conspiracy it&#39;s just a blatantly obvious reality that it&#39;s happening right now in the USA. As for whether Cosby is guilty or not I have no idea. He probably is though since like someone else said most of these rich people do all this crazy shit because they feel untouchable. And they are until they piss off someone else who is richer.</p>
