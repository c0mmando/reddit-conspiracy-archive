Doesn&#39;t it always feel like when you&#39;re discussing something like government with people who are less receptive to alternatives that you&#39;re speaking two different languages?? That&#39;s because we literally are, people talk as if they have agreed on the definitions of the words they are using but that&#39;s a tragic misconception...</p>

<p>There&#39;s no socialism, democracy, communism, etc... those are all just terms people use to convince themselves that at some point their consent was required. Well guess what it wasn&#39;t. Government is fucking slavery and no I&#39;m not being overly dramatic, I just wanna call things by there proper names  and we need to start calling these politicians what they really are, psycopaths</p>

<p>I HIGHLY recommend everyone that cares about actual change give this video series by Mark Passio a watch, I personally felt after viewing it like I had been given the tools to properly articulate the principles I have been trying to live by. I can&#39;t think of a better feeling than that, if we can&#39;t even properly name, pinpoint and describe our perceived greivances with the government in it&#39;s entirety than how can we ever hope to fix anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a bible thumper in any way. Read about the tower of Babylon in the king James bible. Basically, some leader thought he was so powerful he could build a tower so high that he could rival God&#39;s power. God, in return, made all the slaves and workers start to speak different languages so they could not organize the labor efforts. The construction was forever ended. Just a parable, but it shows exactly how old this strategy is. In my view, I think politicians use this reason for immigration, to keep people from being able to &quot;unite&quot; against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that you mention this because I used to attend catholic school when I was in junior high and I will always remember how blown away I was by the implications of the story of the tower of Babel, not only did i realize what a bitter asshole God is made out to be in the bible, but I had also never considered how strange it is that people speak so many different languages and how much potential information wasn&#39;t being shared between language barriers because of this. It was definitely the catalyst to my interest in linguistics! </p>

<p>I too also believe that politicians use linguistic double speak to deceive people in a much less obvious and therefore more pervasive way. It&#39;s not a war its a military conflict, it&#39;s not torture its interrogation, Its not theft its taxation. No wonder they have to deaden our minds with public school regurgitated factoid nonsense for 12 years. Once you know to call these men what they really are, pathological liars and psychopaths, the world makes a lot more sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply. Lutheran school for me. Just need to go to court on any given day and see the 6 different translators needed in traffic court to know how bad language barriers are. One reason I am such a hard ass on immigrants that refuse to learn English, and more so on Americans who support them not having to learn it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, english is a very structured language, it affects peoples&#39; perception as well... earlier languages, the way that they were used, were much more poetic. &quot;let&#39;s smoke together for a while&quot; would translate to something like &quot;let&#39;s watch the air from our bodies play as friends do&quot;, and of course the connotation of &quot;air&quot; here would be like a &quot;soul&quot; shared by every thing in the universe.</p>

<p>so yeah linguistical anarchy would also require a change in perception. &quot;let&#39;s watch the air from our bodies play&quot; sounds silly and foolish, but it is also deeply resonant with what is infinite and &quot;absolute&quot; in terms of our relationship to this world and each other... there&#39;s a real sense of kinship and integrity behind <em>that</em> translation compared to &quot;let&#39;s smoke together&quot;.</p>

<p>I personally found this page describing Thought Terminating Cliches to be absolutely fascinating:</p>

<p><a href="http://jorgenmodin.net/index_html/wikpedias-now-deleted-page-on-thought-terminating-cliche">http://jorgenmodin.net/index_html/wikpedias-now-deleted-page-on-thought-terminating-cliche</a></p>

<p>Once I realized the purpose they serve (a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to propagate cognitive dissonance) and how unbelievably prevalent they are (“Everything happens for a reason.”
“Don&#39;t judge.”
“Why? Because I said so.&quot; etc..) I began to appreciate how thorough our language control has become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no socialism, democracy, communism, etc... those are all just terms people use to convince themselves that at some point their consent was required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. These -isms are just ideas. They don&#39;t actually exist in the real world. A 200 year old piece of paper with fancy writing can&#39;t make any body &#39;equal.&#39; The only thing that backs up <em>any</em> constitution, no matter how lofty its ideals, is <em>force.</em></p>

<p>People think American democracy = freedom and equality. Um, what about the lobbyists, tax-exempt foundations, oligarchs, (certain) multinational corporations, and secret societies that exist outside of the democratic process? What about the major Wall Street players, the federal reserve, and the international banks, none of whom are effectively regulated by Congress? Or how about the rogue elements of our military and intelligence agencies that time and again have shown they are above the law? The truth is that tons of power, perhaps even all of it, flows through private channels in this country. We have never been a democracy. </p>

<p>Just for fun, let&#39;s pretend for a second that somehow a Communist utopia actually happened and everyone had the exact same amount of money, there was no longer a ruling class, etc. Besides the fact that this state of affairs would never last, it&#39;s important to realize that people <em>still</em> wouldn&#39;t be equal. Tall, good-looking guys would still get more attention from women. People with knowledge and skills would still be highly in demand to fix things. Talented people (artists, writers, etc.) would still gain fame and renown. Lonely people would still be bitter. </p>

<p>Equality does not exist in nature, and obviously cannot be granted by an -ism premised on one group being given a monopoly on the use of force/violence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you said is just so on the money for me it&#39;s really nice to know other people feel the same way. This part in particular really resonated with me though:</p>

<p>It reminds me so much of conversations I&#39;ve been having with some of my friends about the TPP. Some of them are fretting over it being signed into law and what some politicians may or may not do to stop it, and I&#39;m constantly trying to convey to them that their is absolutely no significance to a bunch of old rich men and women meeting in a room and signing a document with literally any amount or arrangement of words on it other than the significance we give it. These are all just rituals they perform and then broadcast to us through various mediums (TV, Radio, Internet) People see it, they see the signing or whatever it is being done and they know from that ritual and symbolism that the deed is done and boom you&#39;ve just manufactured consent. We literally would have no clue about any of these people or events if it weren&#39;t for the state&#39;s various mouthpieces forcing it down our throat, but we don&#39;t have to buy what they are peddling if we understand our true self-evident rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You don&#39;t get to pretend you are empowered by your weakness now. If you want to present big ideas to the general public, be prepared for big criticism. If you said what you think you meant, that is what I would have understood. What you said is that big words scare you and smarter people are evil because you are not as smart as they are. It is a pathetic opinion, and I have no qualms about telling you that. If you can&#39;t take harsh criticism, keep your half baked opinions to yourself. If you want to be free to speak your mind, allow others to do so, even if it hurts your feelings. You have a right to be hurt and you also have a right to go cry in the corner about it. </p>

<p>Right here. Words scare you and smarter people scare you.

<p>Yes, we agree on that point. My angle is that you are making big bold claims about language, and how it is used &quot;against us&quot; when in fact you are just struggling to understand the language and how to use it on others. Hench I am not picking up what you think you are throwing. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve provided absolutely no evidence for this so once again making childish assumptions/accusations.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you get this notion of &quot;people who know more than you do&quot; I&#39;m saying that we all have different personal definitions for everything. These differences are just the outcome of enviromental variables amongst other things I&#39;m not implying anyones smarter or more in the know, simply different.</p>

<p>If I say my favorite color is red, but in my mind red is actually what most people would perceive as green, then that person I&#39;m talking to is being given a complete false impression as to what I&#39;m attempting to communicate, and this is what I see occurring so pervasively in many conversations especially those dealing with politics. I don&#39;t know how to break it down any simpler for you but I will honestly try if you need me to.</p>

<p>Not to mention, what&#39;s so absurd about the idea that people who as you said &quot;know more than I do are speaking a different language&quot; I fail to see what would be absurd about proposing that (which I didn&#39;t you did through your incorrect assumptions) for consideration, especially in a conspiracy sub of all places? Are you really that opposed to considering new ideas, actually you don&#39;t have to answer that its pretty obvious lol...</p>

<p>Hmm so what is a psychopath, guess we gotta agree on a definition to even talk about this huh? Kinda like I was saying Huh? okay I guess I&#39;ll just spoon feed this info to you, I&#39;m just gonna look up  a definition quick and that&#39;ll make do for the moment let&#39;s see here Wikipedia is telling me these would be some traits of a psycopath HERE COMES THE AIRPLANE:</p>

<p><strong>Psychopathy Checklist-Revised: Factors, Facets, and Items</strong></p>

<p><strong>Facet 1: Interpersonal
Glibness/superficial charm
Grandiose sense of self-worth
Pathological lying
Cunning/manipulative</strong></p>

<p><strong>Facet 2: Affective
Lack of remorse or guilt
Emotionally shallow
Callous/lack of empathy
Failure to accept responsibility for own action</strong></p>

<p>These are the traits necessary to get the &quot;power&quot; you refer to, by power I&#39;m assuming you mean being immune to the repercussions of breaking the laws you create, facilitated by wielding the violence of the state (although I doubt you appreciate this)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s pathetic. You haven&#39;t found enlightenment, you&#39;ve found ignorance.</p>

<p>Yet more angry blathering with no argument provided.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And what meaning would that be? What is a basic meaning, what does that even mean? Are you seriously not getting it yet man, this is EXACTLY what I was talking about we all have different (even if not by much) personalized definitions for EVERYTHING. Your title of &quot;basic meaning&quot; is abitrary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am purposefully being rude to shock you into realizing how naive and immature your position is. </p>

<p>Hows that working out for you so far? I&#39;m genuinley curious, is this how you typically go about having discussions? Does it yield the intended results ever? I can&#39;t imagine it does anything but make you unpleasant to discuss with luckily I&#39;m resilient and I wanna help you.</p>

<p>...they reveal how fucking stupid they really are. Your personal definition is not the definition. You did not create the language.

<p>I love this because you prove my point so well here and you still continue to miss it it&#39;s almost too perfect. Are you gonna tell me that someone who has learned a second language is going to be talking the exact same language with no variations in understanding as a native born speaker or ANYONE for that matter. Yet again how are you missing this, I&#39;m not talking about whatever dictionary definition your mind is stuck on, obviously these personal defintions are exactly what this whole conversation was about. I hope you re read all of this and finally get it man. Best of luck, and way to cop out I&#39;m dissapointed I wasted my time with you, intellectual cowardice smh</p>

<p>Simply put, yes you simpleton. When you learn any language besides English you will realize not every language has broad meanings and multiple meanings for every word. All your big talk and condescending bullshit doesn&#39;t help your case. You don&#39;t know what you are talking about because you only speak one language. Everything you are saying is in terms of English only and you just can&#39;t know any better because you don&#39;t know any other languages. I have not proven your point once... your point is idiotic. You can&#39;t just make up your own definitions for things and blame the language for your confusion. It&#39;s your fault for being dumb! </p>

<p>Yes, exactly! That is why I pointed this out. OP&#39;s opinion should be taken as an example of how NOT to be. A learning experience for those who may be heading down that ignorant path. People should not live in fear of what they do not know, they should seek to understand their fears, and conquer them that way. </p>

Maybe you can find another YouTube video that makes you feel like you learned something nobody else understands and feel empowered again. I find it funny that stupid people can&#39;t accept that they are dumb and just assume they are being called names. Nope... not the case... you are just not bright, and tried to make a profound point which fell flat. </p>

<p>lmao I literally knew you&#39;d bring that up this was more of a test to see how you&#39;d respond to me answering this first because I knew you&#39;d be dodgy and call me names yet again. No Mr. grumpy you&#39;re not getting off that easy I&#39;ll see you a few comments up</p>
