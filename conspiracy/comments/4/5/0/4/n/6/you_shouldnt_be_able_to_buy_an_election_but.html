        Argon hypoxia.

       Takes less than a minute, is virtually free, is painless, and is guaranteed to work. That’s literally all the more complicated capital punishment should be. Not this stupid combination of chemicals, not a firing squad (WAAA PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA FROM THE SHOOTERS; get over it), not a guillotine (though that’s actually the second most humane way of executing someone), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s the ultimate “we’re better than you” to those who deserve the punishment. Dispassionate, swift, impersonal.

       Although, for any other crime I would agree, to the point I don't believe in capital punishment due to the issues surrounding the current judicial process and the false positives that are overwhelming higher than reported - for her type of crime, where the sum of her suffering would be negligible at best compared to the harm she's directly or indirectly inflected upon others.

       I know this isn't a popular position, but, I really hate governmental corruption, I think it's the most deplorable crime against the citizenry.

       I have a feeling the Bureau is waiting for their moment to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       twist the knife on Hillary. I know that if she was military, she would've certainly been tied to a post and shot. Apparently the leaks were a little worse than a oopsie and I can't imagine powerful people are happy about it.

       On a different note it actually blows my mind the Democratic party (let alone any American) would be comfortable letting someone under a criminal investigation make a bid for presidency.

       for all the good Obama has done over the past seven years, he or they allowed the SOCOM types to do all the drone killings and assorted wars.

       Presidents are remembered for the traumatic bad things, not the good they did. take Hoover for example, his legacy is the 1932 and the bank collapse and the depression. GWB 9/11 and two failed wars. Carter a rabbit...

       I hate to say it, and I mean REALLY hate to say it.. But I honestly thing the FBI isn't going to do anything about it.  They have enough evidence right now to lock her up for good.  Get, they're not doing anything about it.

       The problem is that the FBI can't indict someone. It presents the evidence to the prosecutors office, in this case the DOJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama appointee Loretta Lynch has already said that she doesn't see enough evidence to convict. As you said, one Obama appointee will not indict another Obama employee if there is any wiggle room to not do so.

       Doubtful. VERY doubtful. The FBI is more goodie two shoed than the CIA. It would be easier for them to just dig up dirt on her than have her killed. Plus having people killed isn't just an easy thing to do. With all the sand being kicked up from the JFK assassination they would have to be more careful.

       I really don't think she will do anything to the FBI. I also dont think the FBI would do anything to her. I agree not many like her, but love or hate her, people would definitely be suspicious instantly.

       Just read this:
       <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/10/hillary-clintons-emails-classified-or-not/">
        http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/10/hillary-clintons-emails-classified-or-not/

       Here's an ELI5: Let's say you work at the Pentagon. It is illegal for you to copy, say, US Navy fleet movement plans, to your personal hard drive - as these are marked from classified to top secret, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not so much a specific statute, more of a litany of laws. She could probably be charged with some of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       18 U.S. Code § 793 – Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information
18 U.S. Code § 798 – Disclosure of classified information
U.S. Code § 1924 – Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the big one is 18 U.S. Code § 1519 — Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations, because she knowingly had the server destroyed, so there's no way of actually proving that the files were in fact "removed" or "handed over".
