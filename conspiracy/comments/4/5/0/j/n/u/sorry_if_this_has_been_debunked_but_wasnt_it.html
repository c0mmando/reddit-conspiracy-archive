<p>Ignorance is bliss.</p>

<p>IMHO, he died a natural death in Dec. of 2001 was buried in an obscure grave in a private ceremony and then the entire burial site (Mountain!) was blown to hell.</p>

<p>Come at this like this was your son, brother, father?</p>

<p>The U.S. justice system is called &quot;adversarial.&quot;</p>

<p>This means that there is &quot;examination&quot; and &quot;cross-examination&quot; and the accused gets a day in court.</p>

<p>The Big Trick of the FBI and the Deep State:  Circumventing this adversarial system via &quot;Commissions&quot; and &quot;suicides&quot; and convenient death.</p>

<p>People who never had a day in court:  Oswald, the 19 hijackers, &quot;Anthrax Killer&quot; Bruce Ivins, Osama Bin Laden, Al-Awlaki &amp; his son.</p>

<p>So much easier to have a Commission than a trial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me personally bigger question is The Whole Afghanistan war - Why?</p>

<p>USA ask for OBN - Talibans refuse (for whatever reasons) - USA parks Navy Carrier south of Afghanistan - gathers info - when you know where he is , Special Forces go in take him out - boom job done.</p>

<p>He was taken out in such action from Pakistan in the end (according to official story at least) , so the whole war on Afghanistan was unnecessary as it seems , but nobody ever asks this question. </p>
