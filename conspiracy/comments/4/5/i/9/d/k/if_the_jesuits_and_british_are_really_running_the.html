       Disclaimer, when I say Jewish media, I don't mean most Jews are responsible, I just mean media owned by a small minority of Jews. No one group owns a monopoly on evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, after much research, here are my orientation points with this conspiracy.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A Zionist faction that believed themselves God's chosen people in accordance with the Torah, many originating in England as England Jews
       </li>
       <li>
        A British Israelite faction who believed the Torah was talking about them, and didn't much care for Jews, who supported Zionism because it would give them millions of "British agents" in the middle east, and put Israel under the banner of the rightful rulers in their minds, the British
       </li>
       <li>
        Great Britain was going to lose WW1 to Germany before the Zionists and British Israelites came up with the idea to give Israel the Zionists, and in exchange the Zionists would use their media in the US to get America into the war on the English side. This worked and England won the war, which led to Germany surrendering in very humiliating and difficult economic conditions, leading to a bad German economy, lots of resulting anger, and the rise of Hitler in Germany who felt the Jews betrayed the Germans. Some Zionists and British Zionists then funded and helped Hitler initially because they were having trouble getting Jews to move to Israel, so they had to create a nightmare for Jews in Europe to scare them into moving.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In this way, the conspiracy makes some sense to me as a Zionist/British Israelite conspiracy that was ultimately overtaken by the Zionist Jewish wing when Britain was on the verge of collapse in WW1 and had to reach out to the Zionists and Rothschild for help. If that's continued to this day, it would explain why both Great Britain and the US are under attack of cultural marxism, two Christian/White countries, and with Russia, another white Christian country, being under sanctions and military threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the mass psychology aspect of this conspiracy that they're using to impose cultural marxism and brainwash western countries through television with cultural marxism, and I read straight from the source of Freud's letters and writings, Freud being the father of psychoanalysis, that he was a Zionist, Jewish supremacist, and anti-gentile and certainly anti-Christian. He said he'd had fantasies since his childhood centered around Hannibal's attack on the Roman empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all of that fits. And the TV media constantly being filled with Kaballah symbols fits with the idea that Talmudic Jewish Zionists are in control of this. The stats you find that Jews own all six major media corporations in the US and over 95% of all media also fits with this. And really my biggest source of confusion around the idea that Jews are just being used as a front by a Jesuit/Angulo-Aryan conspiracy is why then are the white countries being flooded with third world immigration, anti-Christian satire, and Zionist flavored cultural marxism in the vein of Leon Trotzky?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a Protestant (English) and Jewish partnership against the Vatican that Jews eventually took over would make sense. But a Vatican and Protestant partnership against pro Christian and Protestant nations, entrusting trillions of their dollars to Jews to pull it off, makes a lot less sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy also makes sense as Zionists believing they have the right to rule under a descendant of David, or the British elite believing they have a right to rule since they believe themselves descendents of David, although again it makes little sense that they'd be destroying their own country if they were in charge. But by the same token, if Jesuits or Christians were in charge, it would make sense that they could try to rule believing themselves Christ's vicar on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all three of those options rely on normal interpretations of the Bible, the "good" interpretation, where they are fulfilling the Lord's covenant or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then on the side of these three options that would make sense, you have those Aleister Crowley groups and Skull and Bones (with their numbers 3:22, Genesis 3:22), about men becoming God, where the serpent is actually the good guy and God was keeping man prisoner. That doesn't fit with either traditional Jewish conspiracies (where they try to fulfill God's covenant, not the Lord's) or Christian/Jesuit conspiracies, where it's the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have these disparate religious beliefs that various people mention in their theories: Zionism/"Chosen People" beliefs of Jews and British Israelites, Christian beliefs supposedly of the Vatican, Satanist beliefs of Crowley groups, and then all the other occult stuff like Helena Blovatsky and the Thule society in Nazi germany. What's the common thread?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then politically, you have a number of groups. Zionism and British Israelism, which share a common thread, the Jewish communists of the Bolsheviks and the German Nazis, and the Protestant English and Catholic Jesuits. What is the common thread? Right now if you look at who is under attack of cultural marxism and immigration (America, Britain, Christian countries), Christianity itself, versus who is not allowed to be criticized, it seems like the Zionists are running the show against those other groups, not that they're all the same and the other groups are running them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone take me from British Israelism, through WWI and the onset of Zionism, through Hitler and all these occult societies, through the Cold War, to now, and explain the common thread, who is in charge, and the motivation?

       Hurr durr it's just a global mafia pretending to be Jesuits, British, Jewish etc. What, you don't honestly think they actually believe the shit they say? To them, it's just a game of rest; who can rest on the highest point of the pyramid. They do whatever they gotta do, say whatever the gotta say.

       But then why do they put clues to what they will do ahead of time in movies and such? If you're not aware, the Talmud says that if you tell others of your sins, your "sin is lifted." They seem to be operating by some sort of code or religious beliefs otherwise I don't think they'd expose themselves like that and put so many symbols into movie, TV, and music videos. Why would the global mafia risk discovery like that if that wasn't based on religious beliefs? And if you watch Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, tons of symbols there used in that. I'm not saying that means she's in charge, that's where the confusion is, but the religious aspect definitely seems to be there.

       Thanks for replying, but could you specify? Vagueness is the problem here in understanding so vague replies only leave more questions! If they don't follow the Talmud, what do they follow? You say they follow a metaphorical language but that's extremely vague. Let me ask it plainly:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1. Who specifically is behind the socialist conspiracy (the Vatican? Zionist Talmudic Jews? British Israelites believing they're God's Chosen People? Luciferians? Sabbatean-Frankists? And if it's more than one, THEN PLEASE QUICKLY MENTION THE HISTORY OF HOW THEY'RE RELATED TO EACH OTHER and working for the same thing)?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2. What motivates them to want to rule the world? Obviously power, but what belief system do they use to justify their rule?
       </strong>
       Because as you said, they do have a belief system that ties them together, otherwise they would all be fighting each other, rather than grouping together in their belief system and fighting everyone else.

       Exactly, they're vague, that's the problem. The only way to accurately identify them is to be vague, its how their language works. Certain patterns of vagueness can make a word.

       Who? These are merely symptoms that you've noticed, it doesn't mean they make up the entire machine. You'll find it's the collective interest of things which shape the world. The Global Mafia is just an intricate business, they're just the ones that are naturally selected due to their ability to adapt and exploit.

      <p>
       Nobody really rules anything because control is subjective. The Global Mafia are not interested in ruling the world but merely ruling themselves which can currently be achieved by exploiting everybody else. The common system of beliefs among them is the pursuit of interest in a vague reality. They understand that everybody shares the same interest so they strive to achieve this interest at whatever the cost.

       And how would you define the interest that everybody shares, that they try to achieve? And what do you mean a vague reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       And even vague or complex philosophies can be defined in some way. "Postmodernism" is vague but if you go to wikipedia you can find an article that does its best to describe it, and gives a lot more detail than what you're saying. Are you saying you don't know exactly what they believe? Whether it's vague or not, it would be helpful if you tried to explain it the best you could, rather than settling for "it's vague their language is vague." Who is they? What is their language influenced by? How did this vague group come together around a vague language if not through some sort of secret society or religious group? You could name those, and then go from there...

       patterns of behaviour. For example, we're able to know that much of our legal processing descend from that of the Romans, because we've been able to observe the legals processings of the Romans. Now if you observe a certain but undefinable pattern of behaviour you've noticed the
       <em>
        apex
       </em>
       , which is effectively a point (think about it, a point is
       <em>
        infinite
       </em>
       ). 'Tis here where the imagination is used, and is where people can
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       ignore logic and
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       realise whatever they imagine. For some it pleasure, love, success, happyness, wealth, power, freedom, knoweldge, god, whatever. The point is, all of those words are just another way to say that anything is possible.

       Yes but our laws were founded 300 years ago based on a very old system. That's the system itself and you can trace it back to Rome, but who is using the system now, and to what ends? As for how you should be able to know, you can look at what groups appear to have monopolies on places of influential power, what groups have supremacist doctrines that justify them oppressing other people, and so on. You can read their biographies and their books. It's like trying to determine what Aleister Crowley believed, he wrote about it. Then you can look at who influenced him, where did he spring out of, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what I'm trying to do, but I'm looking for others here with knowledge I haven't acquired yet to help put the pieces together.

       Wrong.   Watch "Ring of Power" it will help explain that the global conspiracy is the "Empire of the City" -- a tripartite empire of 3 city-states with london as primary.  London-city corporation is the top of the pyramid held up by DC (District of Columbia) city state and Vatican city state.  This is the real pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you accept this as true (do your homework..it's beyond the scope of this discussion), doesn't the rest of it fall into place?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Freemasonic network and affiliates move information around secretly and provide plausible deniability and anonymization for the 'rulers': the clergy, the crown and the spystate (secular government).
       </li>
       <li>
        Jesuits are assassins, agents provocateur, project managers embedded in missionary outreach programs.  With the cover-story of their missionary clergyhood, they gain access to many places inaccessible even to journalists and certainly other citizens.  You also don't kill them, because it's more of a problem if you do.  Jesuits == Spies for Empire of the City.
       </li>
       <li>
        Jesuits have people embedded in the freemasonry network in the order of knights of malta
       </li>
       <li>
        These groups have confabulated people into thinking the jesuits have either controlled or created the freemasons, or subverted and subsumed them, but none of that is true.  They all work together for the same goals.  They all share common goals, which is to justify, support and perpetuate the city-empire which gives them wealth, secrecy, elitism, privileged access and entitlement.
       </li>
       <li>
        Knights of malta have been embedded in the OSS (pre CIA) and CIA as well as intergovernmental NGOs (UN), think tanks (API) and of course belong to secret societies such as the freemasons and the various secret fraternities like skull and bones accessed exclusivelly via the american ruling class ivy league schools.  Examples are the Dulles bros, Clintons, Kissinger, Noam Chomsky and nearly everyone in politics with the possible but unlikely exclusion of Bernie Sanders.
       </li>
       <li>
        Knights of malta's symbol is the cross inside the crown, showing the 2 loyalties.  Guess who's not included?  You and me!
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       How does Israel fit into all this?  Well these secret societies recognize no geopolitical boundaries and swear
       <em>
        no legitimate loyalties to their country
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        if their loyalties go to the secret societies
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         first
        </em>
       </strong>
       (and this is a
       <em>
        requirement
       </em>
       of initiates into Freemasonry--sorry.  Fact check this).  Israel controlling the media is simply acting as an outsourced social management company for the empire, basically transnational pirates who don't care about people at all.  At all.  At all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crown created Israel so they are endebted.  If they fulfill this obligation, Brittain (and the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other crown properties) will support Israel forever.

       Ok, I don't know how this explains why I'm 'wrong'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of what you said is more or less true but Israel is not special it is just another extension of the Triumvirate's joint influence. It is important to note that the prominent jewish 'plutocrat' dynasties are related, either directly or indirectly, to the European Aristocracy and particularly the British Crown. They're not exactly an independent pirate state, more so they maintain a guise of unpredictability that
       <em>
        implies
       </em>
       independence, but it's merely a guise.
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't necessarily support Israel, it depends on how it performs in completing its goals, and so far it's been a hit and miss. There have been some major delays on their end with the ethnic partitioning of the middle east, particularly in Egypt where they have so far failed to initiate Coptic Separatism. Their existence will depend on how they perform when everybody eventually decides to gang rape Saudi Arabia.

       Could you elaborate on what the Mithra people believed in and how that evolved into Hebraism? I know the Talmud was written in captivity in Babylon so was Mithraism something they worshiped in Babylon or...? On wikipedia it says Rome, but Hebraism didn't originate in Rome I don't think so how does that connect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm not familiar with the Phoenicians at all. Were they Babylonians or? I'm just looking for a quick timeline or relationship summary of who the groups were, and how it went from Phoenicians to Mithraism to Hebraism, retaining some of it all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as for where they got their beliefs, I know a lot of it is sun worship and such, so that's probably where they got it.

       I've encountered lots of bloodlines stuff, but since I think the Torah was written as a political document and most of the characters weren't real, they were based on other older myths, it's hard to know what to make of the bloodline theories. But then again just because it's not true doesn't mean the elites don't believe it. When you're sober write up a full reply if you can about who is at the top of the conspiracy now, and whether they are motivated by believing themselves the chosen people of the Lord, the chosen people of the serpent/Satan, or something else.

       I think all 3 groups can be happening and competing simultaneously. I think Zionists have the upper hand now, but maybe the Vatican/Jesuits did 200 years ago. They're all trying to be #1, but it's hard to hold that position for long in historical terms.

       But is it "the Vatican" or "Nazis" or Aryan "British Israelites" who believe white people are the chosen people, similar to what Nazis believed, who are in charge of the conspiracy now, or is it primarily a Talmudic Jewish conspiracy?

      <p>
       If I had to make a guess connecting everything, it would be this: many say the people running the conspiracy believing in the old mystery Babylon religion, or the Egyptian religion, and what's the most prominent surviving known religion that practices that religion? That's what much of the Torah and definitely the Talmud were influenced by was the Babylonian religion. So when someone says they practice the Babylon religion, maybe without realizing it they are still implicating Talmudists.
      </p>

       And then you also have Christianity, which still follows the Old Testament as well. So they have a Babylonian element to their religion. And the Roman Empire mixed it with paganism and probably other Babylonian concepts as well in terms of Catholicism, so that may mean some Christians, aka certain "Christian Zionists," would be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       That still doesn't explain the whole 3:22, men shall become as Gods, the serpent is the good guy thing. And since the Talmud says non-Jews are like beasts, and includes Christianity and insults Christ, I don't understand how Catholics could be working with Talmudists at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why, with all I know currently, the only version of the conspiracy that fully makes sense to me right now is a Jewish Zionist, or British Isrealite, conspiracy, based on the chosen people idea. But they were still the chosen people of the Lord, not Satan, so I don't understand how that turned into what Bill Cooper talks about which is the belief that the Lord in the Bible was an unjust God who kept man prisoner in the garden of eden. That has no basis in the Torah and I'm not even sure it does in the Talmud?
