        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a question for fellow truthers. In my journey I&#39;ve seen a lot, and nothing is so mind numbing as the possibility of what I call &quot;hard&quot; mind control. We&#39;re all suffering from what I call &quot;soft&quot; mind control; symbols, subliminal messages, electro magnetic frequencies, 440 hz music, and so forth, but those effects can be mititgated by a strong person. Real mind control exists too, and seems prevelent especially in Hollywood and in politics. Let&#39;s not forget all these shooting suspects throughout the years who share all same traits, and lead us to the same conclusion in the media; &quot;take the guns&quot;.. My question is, how deep does it go? How many people are suffering from &quot;hard&quot; mind control? How many people believe they&#39;ve been given a &quot;message&quot; from God or have been &quot;chosen by aliens&quot; to spread their message. I&#39;m telling you, I suspect there are well over a million in America alone, potentially several million. Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a well-crafted &quot;soft&quot; brainwash is much more effective than a &quot;hard&quot; one. If you can insert an idea into a person&#39;s natural thoughts and convince them that they came to their own conclusions, they&#39;re much more useful and reliable. It&#39;s like Inception, they have to believe it and not see it as an implant. This is also because a &quot;hard&quot; brainwash leaves you with a broken shell with your commands inside, basically a human golem. You&#39;ve obviously read the reports of the shooters and such- you see odd, erratic behaviors, borderline autistic speech capabilities in some. You have an obedient zombie, but it&#39;s still just a zombie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what your saying and your really spot on. I guess we haven&#39;t seen the culmination of the subliminal messaging yet because there&#39;s still food on the table, and money in the banks. But, when that status quo gets shaken up, the masses of selfish, confused Americans will show their true colors. There are two types of people I see right now; fools, and cowards. I despise both. I&#39;ve also subscribed to the notion that there is very little we can do for them, but try to break their programming through poilite, patient conversation. This works maybe 5% of the time and even then, they&#39;ll just go back to watching tv. I agree about the &quot;hard&quot; mind control victims being easier to spot, but I still think their the more dangerous ones at the present time, for obvious reasons. What do you think about celebrities? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see fools and cowards when I forget that most of us never had a chance to have our own thoughts before we were taught what this world supposedly is.  You addressed that well.  Basically be nice to people and slip them some of your views that they maybe able to see.</p>

<p>I think my parents managed to give my brothers and I a lot of info and alternatives without saying anyone of them was is right.</p>

<p>In West Texas bible belt they managed to raise and accept three pretty free thinkers.</p>

<p>Somehow they never locked us in the Plato&#39;s cave of their belief and world views.  Though I know there&#39;s always a different way to see the shadows cast on the wall.  And I don&#39;t know that anyone ever makes it to the true source of the shadows.</p>

<p>TV stole and sold the world.  It has always been happening, but TV sealed the deal.</p>

<p>The internet is allowing many more people to break the spell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Celebrities don&#39;t need to be brainwashed. The allure of fame is enough to make most people do ANYTHING. Casting couch, etc. If you offer people enough money and glory, most will do what you want.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen it, there&#39;s a scene in Netflix Daredevil where Kingpin pays a cop to betray his partner. The guy goes &quot;but we&#39;ve been friends for ten years!&quot; And Kingpin responds, &quot;how much is each of those years worth to you? In round figures, please.&quot; Chilling and so so poignant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting question. Over a million sure seems like a lot, but on the other hand...worldwide? It seems possible. </p>

<p>You would probably like McGowan&#39;s <a href="http://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/01/12/david-mcgowan-programmed-to-kill/"><em>Programmed to Kill</em></a></p>

<p>But there are many other forms of direct mind control, as u/curiosity36 posted. Also this: <a href="http://targetedindividualscanada.com/">http://targetedindividualscanada.com/</a></p>

<p>And according to Harald Kautz-Vella, we are being controlled not just at the level of the mind, but at the level of DNA, which controls the secretion of various proteins/neurotransmitters:

    <div class="md"><p>Over a million IS a lot. Haha. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve heard this number tossed around as far as the number of people who have experienced being &quot;abducted by aliens&quot;. I see a correlation between the two, considering the fact that the government fakes, at least, the vast majority of these occurrences. One other thing, think about people who are preachers, cult leaders, Ponzis, intelligence plants, etc; they are leading many more millions into direct mind control. That&#39;s where my number is coming from, not to say that one million people have for sure been kidnapped; though it&#39;s certainly possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other than torturing someone until they break, or using a scopalamine injection (or similar psychotropics), or some strong directed biologically active energy weapon, I don&#39;t believe that this hard mind control is actually employed that often.</p>

<p>Instead I think they use blackmail leverage more.</p>

<p>You have members of secret societies who get to &#39;higher ranks&#39; by doing horrible horrible things.  Like raping a woman, or a child, or a dog; and killing someone, or cutting breaks on someone&#39;s car; staging a false flag mass shooting event or robbbing a bank. things like this.  </p>

<p>The secret society will then have a record of this wrongdoing and hold it as blackmail leverage and force members to do stuff.  Which they will gladly do, because they&#39;ve already taken that first &#39;wicked&#39; step, so any other steps are easier to do.  (They say once you kill a person, it&#39;s easier to kill subsequent people).</p>

<p>So the idea is you are inculcated into their ranks by doing something wicked, which gets you &quot;benefits of the network&quot;, fame, fortune, sex, power, job placement, special skills training, special privilege, security/protection, secret knowledge or all of the above.  If you dare defy them, they will ruin your life COSBY style.  And so with this blackmail leverage they are able to get people to do amazingly horrible things.</p>

<p>I think this is really the &#39;mind control&#39; you&#39;re going for; because the other methods are much less reliable.</p>

<p>Another mind control is the &quot;Nick of Time&quot; approach.  You kidnap someone they love and then force someone to do a horrible thing to spare them.  It&#39;s not enough to hold a gun to someone&#39;s head. It&#39;s much more effective to hold a gun to their dogs head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what your saying but I&#39;d like to expand your perception of what &quot;mind control&quot; might mean. For instance; &quot;chemtrails&quot;, electromagnetic waves, and nanotechnology. These things effect our DNA, which is the real prize within the body. If you have a thought implanted, it might be hard to get rid of, but you can do it. If you have an electric signal resonating within you DNA, informing your BODY what to do, it&#39;s much harder to disagree. They have saturated the environment with plasma and electromagnetic signals to where essentially the entire planet is a massive set antennae. They can kill us with cancer, or have suicidal thoughts implanted. I&#39;m not saying the stuff your saying isn&#39;t true, but it&#39;s (as crazy as this sounds) the surface. Even THOSE people are mind controlled, in fact, they&#39;re the most controlled because they&#39;ve gone along with it somewhat knowingly. People like us (spiritually and mentally sound) have more of natural defense to this kind of thing because we are aware and against it. However, even this can&#39;t protect us from what they can do to us physically. All I&#39;m saying is, it&#39;s even worse then what your saying. What your saying is terrible in itself, but it&#39;s almost human nature (dark side). The scientific and medical dishonesty is the real threat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not sure exactly which direction I should go with this but I&#39;ll try to lay it out as I see it. The human body is a machine, a very powerful machine. There are trillions of micro-organisms floating around in there, each with various duties and agendas. Spiritually, you could look at each individual human as a microbe on Earth. We are all the same life energy, or electromagnetic field. The solid world you see is but an illusion, in fact everything is made up of energy. &quot;They&quot; learned this lonnnnnnggg ago, and coded the information into various spiritual and scientific chapters of human history. They can TRY to break the human spirit but we have power over ourselves in various way. Only when we become unconscious and don&#39;t take responsibility for our own actions (95% of the populace) do we become vulnerable to these invisible microwaves. Someone who is grounded in their independence as a human and aware of these things has a real, quantifiable chance at avoiding some of the effects. It&#39;s all under the radar, you gotta remember that. Now don&#39;t get it twisted, they could kill any of us at any second; easily. The simple fact is they don&#39;t have to until we gain enough influence, and if they did it more than they already do, questions would start getting asked by people with lower IQs. Can&#39;t have that. Does that at least wet your appetite as far as what I&#39;m saying goes? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Victim of electronic warfare via wireless computer to brain. Suggestion is a powerful thing....but it only works if a target doesn&#39;t know they&#39;re a target. You can convince somebody of almost anything, trauma such as fears, threats, exposing weaknesses, and insecurities acutely (over a short period of time) or slowly (gradually over a long period of time) but if they know it&#39;s a trick the game is over. So...if I wanted to wash your brain....keeping you from becoming aware of the man behind the curtain is imperative. Otherwise...it&#39;s just a long joke and I&#39;d be wasting my time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over a million IS a lot. Haha. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve heard this number tossed around as far as the number of people who have experienced being &quot;abducted by aliens&quot;. I see a correlation between the two, considering the fact that the government fakes, at least, the vast majority of these occurrences. One other thing, think about people who are preachers, cult leaders, Ponzis, intelligence plants, etc; they are leading many more millions into direct mind control. That&#39;s where my number is coming from, not to say that one million people have for sure been kidnapped; though it&#39;s certainly possible. </p>
