       Black Op Radio's Len Osanic did an amazing interview with Paul Schrade after Sirhan's February 11, 2016 parole hearing. Schrade is furious about the ongoing cover up, and the treatment of Sirhan the patsy. 
Schrade was there when the second gunman shot Robert Kennedy. 
He knows what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Paul doesn't say, but what is well known, is that Thane Eugene Cesar is Robert Kennedy's murderer.  Cesar is currently living in the Philippines, retired from his years of government service.

       Paul worked with Bobby in the 1960 presidential election of John Kennedy
Paul was a board member of the United Auto Workers union
Bobby won the California primary the evening of the assassination
The party went into the pantry, Bobby shook hands
Television lights blinded him, he fell, struck by a bullet in the head
There was evidence of a second gunman, definite physical evidence
Sirhan was never behind Bobby, Bobby was shot in the back
Paul did not want to get involved, he began investigating
Test bullets could not match the Sirhan gun
The police and D.A. covered up and destroyed evidence
A photograph of bullet holes in the door frame
Proving over eight shots, proof of a second gunman
It took until 1988 to get into the evidence files
Sirhan did wound four people
Evidence of LAPD framing Sirhan, no evidence of a third gunman
Philip Van Praag examined the Pruszynsk recording (shots at 5:23)
There were 13 shots on that tape, two guns
Van Praag was able to discern two makes of weapons
LAPD presented test bullets from another gun
Parole boards don't discuss evidence
Sirhan's execution would have been murder
He has no chance, they give him another five years
Paul made the case that he couldn't have shot Robert Kennedy
He had the right to parole in 1981, they denied it
There were two board members there yesterday
Paul wanted Sirhan to know that he was not guilty
Sirhan, I forgive you
The board were petty, amateur psychiatrists
I wouldn't shake the head of the boards hand
William Pepper and Laurie Dusek, they're philosophical about it
There's no perfect crime, there's no perfect cover up
Even if he had his memory, he's still not guilty
Hypno-programed, probably true, it doesn't work with the public
Prosecute the prosecutors who convicted without evidence
The FBI criticized the Van Praag analysis
Five shots heard over the eight from Sirhan
L.A. County D.A. Jackie Lacey innocence project
Back to his brother's or back to Jordan
It is possible to visit Sirhan
They know they sent him to the death chamber without evidence
They can't accuse me of being a "conspiracy nut"
Find a good strategy to break this case wide open

       I don't think there was ever much doubt that RFK's assassination was a scripted affair. No one believed it from the get go. -ridiculous -
      </p>
      <p>
       But that was 50 years ago. It's not news any more.

       First of all, is English your second language? 
Do you have a first language?
Do you know what "succinct" means?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, the CIA murder of a presidential candidate--brother of the CIA assassinated President of the US--is a big deal.  Crimes like this allowed the current regime to immerse us in a perpetual war for profit.

       Maybe you're too lame to see that.  But many people are smarter than you.
