        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed a lot of videos on youtubes and articles here about Illuminati symbolism in today&#39;s music and videos. My suspicion is that the music industry knows all about these theories. So they deliberately go and load up their videos with a bunch of crap knowing that it&#39;s a great gimmick for getting people&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>That does not mean there&#39;s no conspiracy going on in the music industry itself though. Take the term &quot;music industry&quot; itself as an example.
Music is art, or at least that&#39;s what it should be. But what we&#39;re getting is a product, not art. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s a product that&#39;s being pumped out on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>There are very few &quot;artists&quot; in the music business any more. What we have now are just performers. No big deal right?</p>

<p>There is a difference though. Real artists have passion and they often have hopes dreams and ideals. These usually serve as inspiration for their art... which in this case is music.
The powers that be don&#39;t want random inspiration getting loose and messing with their agenda. They don&#39;t want an entire generation of young people being exposed to someone else&#39;s hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we don&#39;t have artists any more. We have plenty of talented performers. People who do what their bosses tell them to do and never say or do anything controversial or original.
Meanwhile, the music industry peppers it&#39;s music videos with phony bullshit symbolism to keep people from seeing what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>The sterilization of music itself and the censorship of true artistic expression from our culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 100% sure underneath all the glitz and hype its basically a huge escort service for the ultra-rich. I first started thinking this when those celeb nudes got &quot;leaked&quot;, and some of them, like Jennifer Lawrence, looked like they were in a professional studio, strange. I don&#39;t know if they are picked for some reason beforehand and then groomed for these roles or what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, but have several theories:</p>

<p>1- Some people are groomed from birth via Satanic/Luciferian families. There&#39;s a lot of that in Holly Wood, dynastic families like the Barrymores, Bridges, Fondas, etc. 
ASIDE: I&#39;d love to have a 100% honest conversation with Bridget Fonda, a third generation movie star whose career was still on the upswing when she suddenly disappeared from the screen -- I wonder what she learned or knew)</p>

<p>2- Others are offered opportunities based on their willingness to do what they are told -- suck a cock, get fucked in the ass, permit professional studio quality nude pix to get out -- and ascend the steps to stardom accordingly. </p>

<p>All that &quot;Fappening&quot; stuff seemed at least partially planned to me -- hasn&#39;t hurt Jennifer Lawrence&#39;s career AT ALL, and she&#39;s had her cake and been able to eat it too: Tell people how she was taken advantage of while probably secretly getting off on how many guys are jacking off to her. I mean: Who took those pictures? Why are they so professional looking and posed? </p>

<p>Holly Wood is the distraction </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Groomed at birth via satanic and luciferian families? lol. Care to give a source? Why would they be satanic? Why would they give a fuck about all that horseshit? Are you one of those people who watches those videos every Super Bowl, that analyzes the halftime show and &quot;explains&quot; how it&#39;s related to the occult and the illuminati? </p>

<p>And why are aristocratic families a conspiracy to you? Of course there&#39;s going to be prolific and powerful families in Hollywood, just as there is in sports, politics, business, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised your on r/conspiracy with such a mainstream, eyes-wide-shut viewpoint. </p>

<p>Have you seen the videos of Jay Parker? Listened to Mark Passio? There are all kinds of sources out there-- you can believe it or not, but I&#39;m not pulling this stuff out of my ass.</p>

<p>They &quot;give a fuck about all that horseshit&quot; because it&#39;s a force for control of EVERYTHING, which is what they want. Evil rules this world, but it does not control it. They want to control everything.</p>

<p>Believe me or don&#39;t, free will makes that entirely up to you. But if you&#39;re taking all this on face value, you&#39;re on the wrong sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, saying that they&#39;re satanic and they &quot;groom them from birth&quot; seems very extreme to me. Like, well known celebrities are pushing this satanic agenda for what reason? How does subliminal messaging of eyes and triangles and symbols of demons and whatnot help &quot;control&quot; people? Oh and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some fucked up artists out there who are all into dark shit, demons, all that jazz, but a global elite who wants that agenda pushed so hard that they take babies at birth and design them to be messengers for their (still unclear) message? To me, that&#39;s reaching. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;d steer you to Jay Parker and others who have escaped the Satanic/Luciferian family network(s). </p>

<p>Let me ask you: Why does somebody who has a billion dollars want five billion? Why does someone who has five billion bucks want 25 billion? </p>

<p>But beyond that, in the supernatural realm, it&#39;s about gathering souls. I really think that&#39;s what it is. That&#39;s why the message is to pursue pleasure &amp; profit at all costs, don&#39;t think about the future or afterlife, etc., etc. </p>

<p>And, again, I&#39;m sure it sounds like a reach. It&#39;s not easy to get where I&#39;ve gotten on this matter. But if you dig and dig, you may end up where I am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that comes down to your beliefs, and I&#39;m definitely fuzzy on the afterlife and supernatural realms. I mean, who isn&#39;t! That would be amazing if it&#39;s a con to gather souls for their afterlife empire (for lack of a better term). Who knows, maybe I&#39;m not looking far enough into it. But yes, thank you for not being an ass and discussing it with me. Likewise to you.</p>

<p>Edit: added some links. The connections between the music industry and &quot;the illuminati&quot; (or more generally The Powers That Be) run very, very deep. It&#39;s all part of a grand deception and masterful manipulation of the human race. Welcome to the Matrix.  </p>

<p>Newer music lacks a quality of timelessness and soul that the older classic stuff does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainstream music in my opinion has a shit load of programming put into it. All the big &#39;artists&#39; don&#39;t write their own music, it is made by someone in a studio then they sing over it and that gets edited.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of trends, shitty traits in youth, and the dumbing down of people are a direct result of programming in music, specifically frequencies. But I agree, mainstream rappers have an insane amount of symbolism in their videos.</p>

It does appear,at times, to be a case where it&#39;s being used in a bury &#39;em in bullshit kinda way.<br/>
Then there are times where they&#39;re is definitely more then meets the eye in how they are being used.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s kinda hard to have this convo because &#39;real art&#39; and &#39;talent&#39; at the end of the day are completely subjective notions.</p>

<p>The deeper issue is with the commodification of art in general, what&#39;s the &#39;purpose&#39; of art? Why do we make art? Is it &#39;right&#39; to make &#39;art&#39; strictly for the intention of making money? If so, can we make a differentiation between &#39;authentic&#39; art and &#39;kitsch&#39; or &#39;economically-viable&#39; art? What is that distinction? Why?</p>

<p>I feel like ultimately, you can&#39;t make objective statements about art because it has a different value &amp; definition for everybody.</p>

<p>I just watched their &quot;Downtown&quot; video. It&#39;s catchy and commercially appealing, but I don&#39;t see much here that challenges the status quo.</p>

<p>If anything, this is a perfect example of safe, art-free entertainment that doesn&#39;t rock the boat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should&#39;ve started with his most popular song, Thrift Shop:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrift_Shop"><em>&quot;The song illustrates Macklemore&#39;s interest in buying cheap clothing from [thrift shop]s, disdaining [designer label]s and trends. He claims to enjoy donning &quot;your granddad&#39;s clothes&quot; and impulsively buying a sharp-looking but dubious-smelling fur [Stole (shawl)|stole] just because &quot;it was 99 cents&quot;. Macklemore spoke to MTV News about the meaning of the song: &quot;Rappers talk about, oh I buy this and I buy that, and I spend this much money and I make it rain, and this type of champagne and painting the club, and this is the kind of record that&#39;s the exact opposite,&quot; he explained. &quot;It&#39;s the polar opposite of it. It&#39;s kind of standing for like let&#39;s save some money, let&#39;s keep some money away, let&#39;s spend as little as possible and look as fresh as possible at the same time.&quot;</em></a></p>

<p>You should&#39;ve then gone to his bio, where you&#39;d find: </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macklemore"><em>&quot; Interested in reaching a younger generation through his music, he was a part of a program focusing on education and cultural identity called &quot;Gateways for Incarcerated Youth&quot; where he facilitated music workshops&quot;</em></a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macklemore"><em>&quot;He said in a 2012 documentary that he spent most of his twenties trying to combat his addictions and destructive way of life, saying &quot;I want to be someone who is respected and not just in terms of my music. I want to be respected in terms of the way that I treat people... Music is my creative outlet in terms of expressing what is important to me; what has importance, what has a value. And I want to be respected for that&quot;</em></a> </p>

<p>You might&#39;ve even stumbled on this article reading his bio: </p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t even be bothered to check out his bio or his most popular song. If that&#39;s all you found then this is a waste of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so you&#39;re a Macklemore fan and I respect that. But where&#39;s he rocking the boat. A little bit of safe controversy speaking out against excessive materialism?</p>

<p>Yet when I watched his video it seemed like the only real difference is in the lyrics.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m asking is where are the protest songs? Where&#39;s the songs speaking out against endless war and the NSA spying on everyone? The only real protest music we&#39;ve had was early Rap... and look what that got turned into. Ads for expensive crap and/or recruiting videos for the prison system.</p>

<p>All we get today is videos trying to get me interested in Taylor Swift&#39;s titties or Beyonce&#39;s ass. TV shows like XFactor, American Idol and The Voice all just focus on someone&#39;s talent as a performer. Artistic merit is not emphasized at all. They only care about originality insofar as a performer has some kind of novelty about them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to use a current musician as an example  of someone who is a true activist because there <em>aren&#39;t any</em>.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of the kind of songs I&#39;m talking about</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX7V6FAoTLc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX7V6FAoTLc</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX-JeV37Uqw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX-JeV37Uqw</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzGoDtmTllg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzGoDtmTllg</a></p>

<p>The first two are antiwar songs and you can make up your mind about the third one. My point is, nobody comes out with songs like this because they simply aren&#39;t allowed to.</p>

<p>Music can be a real force for change because of the way it can inspire people at an emotional level. That&#39;s the reason why today&#39;s top acts suck so bad. Their music is the art equivalent of junk food.</p>

<p>ps. I suppose Macklemore is better than average. But I would also say there&#39;s a limit on what he can say or how far he can push things if he wants his music career to continue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve moved the goalposts. </p>

<p>Your initial post lamented the lack of artists these days with passion - People that cared about what they did. Macklemore is a prime example of that. You don&#39;t have to be a fan of his to see that.</p>

<p>You never mentioned they had to have a strong anti-war/NSA message throughout their songs. </p>
