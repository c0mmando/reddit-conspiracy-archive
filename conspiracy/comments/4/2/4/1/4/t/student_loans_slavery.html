Yes, the students are in part to blame, however I think the government take over of the student loan industry has exacerbated the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in a situation where the school refuses to grant me the degree I earned while keeping all of my gov&#39;t loans. I can&#39;t discharge my loans and the 70,000 i borrowed is now due and they don&#39;t care about hte schools actions. </p>

<p>With interest being so high I am not faced with a 20 percent wage garnish for 10 years if I work for the gov&#39;t or 20 years if I am not. It is slavery wrapped in a scam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know someone whose been working for the DoD trapped in this exact same situation. They were told after a few years a youll get a pay raise. It took about 5 years, and thats when they were told the position was in another state. So then they moved. Gets to work and come to find out theres a 9 month probation period. After that this person finally got the raise but they&#39;re qualified to hold titles several positions up but they kept raising the requirements to get promotions to where this person HAD to go back to school. At this point they&#39;re only a few credits away from earning their second masters </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the reply but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s similiar. When your loans are due you either pay the full amount or a percentage of your paycheck. The loans can&#39;t be discharged unless you are more then 50 percent diasbled for life and without the piece of paper saying I completed my academic program. I cannot pursue my chosen career. </p>

<p>The repayment options allow me to have my debt forgiven if I work for the gov&#39;t in some fashion after 10 years. If I work in the private sector, it&#39;s 20 years.</p>

<p>So I think of it as jail time  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its similar in that they were offered debt forgiveness in exchange for working for the government as well but I see what you&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>How is your school able to hold your degree??? That doesnt sound legal at all. If you covered your costs with loans then that takes the school&#39;s ability to claim you owe them anything out of the picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a state University, hence the Limited Sovereign Immunity defense shortening the statute of limitations. LSI shortens the statute of limitations, thus preventing the court from reviewing the case, even with authenticated exhibits. They are getting away with this on technical/procedural grounds. </p>

<p>And in my situation it was that simple. The teacher of the class occupied all of the required administrative positions to do it and the school admins covered up their own negligence to avoid getting in trouble with LSI. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s easier to understand, The school currently has seven attorney&#39;s on the case and spent 120,000 dollars of tax payer money. Why spend all that dough and people&#39;s time instead of being a school and educating people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s difficult to believe the situation and in living it I have had to wonder, did i make this up to protect my ego? Am I crazy? </p>

<p>Sadly, as I perceived I had  graduated and moved across the country to attend job intereviews. The entire episode was handled via email and correspondence thus providing a paper trail. My exhibits include the falsified grades, the assignments in question submitted electronically, the instructors positions on the matter, my student records before and after audit by the instructor. etc etc.. </p>

<p>I have been told to go to the FBI as they have the only means to investigate this further and I am waiting to see if the school is successful in blocking my ability to appeal before doing so. </p>

<p>All this to stop someone from being a librarian.. :( </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more to the story on either yours or the schools part you&#39;re leaving out, and since it wouldn&#39;t make sense for you to leave something out about the school I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re leaving out apart of your story. Schools don&#39;t just falsify student records and then sue the shit out of them if they did and you have the proof you say you do you could take that to the media and smear the school reputation. Anyways I&#39;m just going to be honest and say I&#39;m not really interested in the story anymore so I wish you good luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what sort of legal education you have and I have nothing to gain from convincing you of anything. I went to the media in hawaii and they refuse to run the story and smear their local university . </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything more then the what I put into this discussion and there is a court record full of exhibits which was dismissed under statute of limitations. </p>

<p>The statute controlling my case is six years however limited sovereign immunity shrinks it to two. Only the state has this power and if it was a private business, individual or school then limited sovereign immunity could not prevent a review of my authenticated exhibits. </p>

<p>Again, there is an paper trail documenting everything but it doesn&#39;t matter if the time period you can take action in is exceeded. </p>

<p>Thanks for your time </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps a better term is &#39;asset stripping&#39;.</p>

<p>But it gets even better later on. If the student loan borrower manages to land a decent job, then they often buy a house - 30 years of mortgage payments. More asset stripping.</p>

<p>At the end of life some 40 or 50 years later if that same person ends up in long term care, the state forces them to sign over all assets to pay for that care (including the house they paid the bankers for, for 30 years).</p>

<p>Americans are now asset stripped early in life for education, in the middle years for keeping a roof over the heads of their families, and then for health care in late life.</p>

<p>End result? The wealth of the labor of the working class is channeled to various private cartels via government regulation, and to the bankers.</p>

<p>Nothing is left for future generations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree, no one forces you to take out loans, but it is impossible to attend a college without loans unless you have 5-9K a semester lying around. I believe society needs to be responsible for our own actions, and this means paying back the loans, however the belief that not only is Education a RIGHT, but everyone should and MUST go to school is force fed to us, and I think this is not true. I also feel that there needs to be more clarity in the student loan process, the reality is most 17-20 year olds do no understand the concept of compound interest and how it could very well ruin your financial stability for life.The best solution is getting government out of the student loan process completely, allow banks to compete for loans from students by offering a variety of options, this would result in schools closing, and at least 60% of the so called students, these days not being admitted to schools. College is not for everyone, a college degree ( unless in the medical field, or very specific fields) is worthless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they forced them, that&#39;s a strawman.  I&#39;m saying that they are predatory on young students.  I&#39;m saying that they BOTH bear responsibility for the problem.  Is that so difficult to understand? Or are you acting like lenders are totally innocent? I don&#39;t owe anything to anyone.
