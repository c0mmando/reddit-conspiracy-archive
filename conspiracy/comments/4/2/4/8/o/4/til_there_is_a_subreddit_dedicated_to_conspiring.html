       So this little gem of a subreddit awards people for making it harder to spread awareness to important subjects that are already hard to expose. They post your thread then all rush over to downvote you to oblivion. This is better than government counterintelligence because they are useful idiot slaves!

       are u saying i was part of that? im confused.  the only time i ever went in there was to check it out because someone brought them up.. considering how large reddit is  it really isnt that many subscribers.. those numbers have according to some been falsified anyway.. i read some of the comments in there and there isnt a whole lot of substance.   im not going to worry about them.

       reported as spam 12 posts in

       dominate discussions in other subs by submitting the majority of comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       They downvote to zero posts. Reddit removes zero voted posts from the front page and from reddit's search engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts were being removed in both subs I mod,
       <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">

       and
       <a href="/r/electromagnetics">

       [Censorship] Automoderator automatically hides comments by redditors with negative comment karma. Downvote brigading, cyberstalking and bullying cause negative karma which causes censorship.

       Top minds members seem like they themselves are a bunch of conspiracy theorists who are afraid to come out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of them are, in their own way, just as knowledgeable about various conspiracy theories as we are. The only thing that separates them from us is their mocking/criticizing attitudes.

       and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       from time to time. I am not a conspiracy theorist at all. I find them fascinating, and love to learn about them, but I believe in essentially none of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of my interest comes from a desire to keep an open mind and challenge my beliefs. I want to alternatives to the mainstream narrative. I just almost never find myself convinced by them. But the other part is pure entertainment. It's fun to laugh at the complete failures of logic and reason that conspiracy theorists often put forward.

      <p>
       So yes,

       in conspiracies. But I wouldn't say they are closet conspiracy theorists.

       Hi! I lurk mostly in TMOR and followed an NP link here but as with previous posts, I thought you deserved an explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was duped by a friend of mine into believing in quite a few conspiracy theories, but when I started getting challenged on these beliefs I took the time to research them fully. Something like 11 years later here I am not believing any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way I read these forums to remind myself how I have changed, but also because honestly some of the nonsense posted in this subreddit is hilarious. Especially the Flat Earth stuff. That's something any basic astronomy textbook and a few simple experiments with friends would resolve. People figured out the answers to the questions with the most basic shitty telescopes and nothing but dedication and precision.

       I think then that you currently have a dangerously naive and trusting worldview. Plenty of things posted here are serious and very real "conspiracy" issues. UK officials and their child molestation cover-ups, for example.

       I think he meant the flat earth stuff you may have heard about comes from CIA agents posing as flat earthers in order to stir up doubt and confusion about other conspiracy topics and create infighting between people in the real discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, someone can post flat earth stuff to this sub, and then someone else (like you) will come along and say this sub is a joke. Now you have just discredited an entire sub and all of the ideas therein based on one silly theory that may have been posted by an imposter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty easy, wasn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, BipolarBear0 did some things like this to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       before. He would post hate threads under a throwaway account to "prove"
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was racist, anti-semitic or whatever. Here's a thread on TopMinds about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/3rmdkw/you_have_to_to_hand_it_to_bipolarbear0_he_proved/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/3rmdkw/you_have_to_to_hand_it_to_bipolarbear0_he_proved/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think about this. He could have just as easily created OTHER accounts to support his fake hate thread in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Surely his buddies in IRC could have done the same. This wasn't some kind of noble experiment to prove
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is corrupt, it was an underhanded as fuck tactic that carries no merit, very shady for a moderator to behave that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, one of the users who was calling out their behavior
       <a href="/u/TheGhostOfDusty">
        /u/TheGhostOfDusty
       </a>
       is now a new moderator of this sub. He runs a sub called NoLibsWatch. He can correct me if I got any of these details wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems there has been an ongoing feud between this sub and TopMinds.

       That's about right. Here's an archive of the confession which was deleted a week or so after he posted it. It proves by his own words and screenshots that he shared links to his black propaganda racism to ~90 of his IRC friends within seconds of posting them.

       They link to other peoples posts and then they use 2nd accounts. I have -15 posts on serious conversation trying to spread awareness of Targeted Individuals getting tortured to living shit all day with synthetic telepathic torture. I proved tons of proof and if anyone had half a brain and did the research of terms I posted, it would not get that many downvotes. Look I am seriously trying to expose the most evil shit going on in the US that effects thousands of people with no media coverage. 4 years of my life trashed by evil datamining CIA MKULTRA type of project.

       EDIT: Once you get posted there, they check your recent posts multiple times a day and continue doing it. You get blacklisted after you get posted there. Either government OP or useful idiots censoring info which benefits GOV.

       Well I was very respectful. You think I should be respectful to trolls? Don't go around saying the government isn't fucking people over. You need to get educated on the crimes against humanity the CIA is doing. MKULTRA, Thousands of US citizens being tortured with mind reading technology and "Voice of God weapons. They are call "Targeted Individuals" Been dealing with this torture for 4 years every minute of the day. I know it is unbelievable that is why I spent hundreds of hours collecting DAMNING evidence which I made available.

       Let me tell you something, I think higher of rapists than the people censoring important information in "TopMindsOfReddit" They band together and stalk your posts for their stupid internet posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your instinct is to brush me off as mentally ill but if you actually took the time to look at what I have said, research my post history links, you would agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA has unlimited funds and works on infiltration. Sorry if you believe otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance is bliss until your bloodline is destroyed like mine was in the most evil datamining operation in the history of humanity.

       I never accused you of being mentally ill. I disagree with everything you say, but I've been very respectful and not invalidating at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, you should be respectful toward people, even if you do believe they are shills. You need to learn how to disagree with people without personally attacking them. Obviously, it is worse to be a rapist than a shill. I'm not even going to argue that point because it is not a conversation worth having.

      <p>
       There are THOUSANDS of "Targeted Individuals" being tortured. If you disagree, I have NO WORDS. There is FLAWLESS mind reading tech that CANNOT BE IMPROVED. I experience it nonstop for 4 years. My messages are comming from a very frustrating place. People contradict me because they are trolls without a brain. Go hang out with them. Birds of a feather...

       If you disagree that there are thousands of innocent US citizens being tortured every minute of the day with mind reading and sound beamed in their head for the purpose of finding the best way to torture people, then you are ignorant by definition. If you saw my previous posts that is, I linked best proof possible but it will take time to research.

       Why wouldn't you just chill in a Faraday cage? No signals can transmit,  and they can stop an EMP. So why wouldn't that be a solution?  If you claim they can thwart signals from a cage, then I'm calling you a paranoid schizophrenic.

       No.  They work on a very simple principal,  and we use very crudely constructed devices in our laboratory to protect specific equipment,  that work 100%. It's like claiming a lightning rod or a ground for power, have to be thousands of dollars to work. That's not how this works, and a small Faraday cage is extremely cheap to make. Want to know if it works,  try catching a wifi or cell signal in one you make.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe you haven't done the due diligence in seeking a remedy for what you claim to be a real problem.  It's the answer,  if your problem is real. I'm doubting your intelligence significantly,  since you seem to not understand the basic principal and overall function of how a simple cage works.

       identify the manufacturers and the specifications of the 'very crudely constructed devices."  How do you know the faraday cages work 100%. Upload a meter measuring report including the strength of the EMF outside of the faraday cage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manufacturers' websites and many online retailer websites specify the effectiveness of the shielding materials and shielding fabrics. The effectiveness includes the power of the electric field or magnetic field that is shielded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weaponized DEWs have tremendous power. Some DEWs, like ultrasound and sonar weapons, do not use EMF so faraday cages will not shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faraday cages cannot shield extremely low magnetic fields. Russian Woodpecker, HAARP, etc. generate exremely low magnetic fields.

       You are a crazy person.  You have undoubtedly alienated yourself from your family and refuse treatment.  You can't even keep your own conspiracy straight.  You claim there are tiny chips in your brain,  claim to be an expert,  and now you're saying instead of radio waves, they are using radar to mess with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I never have the tragedy of having to deal with a loved one with a severe mental illness,  like you are experiencing.  The saddest part of all of this is what you put your family through.  You are what I fear the most with having children.  I would rather have a child with downs syndrome than a schizophrenic.   I hope you are living in a group home and not burdening your family any more at their home.

       I never wrote instead of radio wave they are using radar. Radar is radio waves. Radar is a method of geo-stalking. Radar is not a DEW. DEWs and radar are deployed.

       You are probably correct.

       I've been pointing it out lately, they do the same thing as GMOMyths, smearing anyone who questions GMOs, pesticides and Monsanto, sending in the silent down-vote brigade and mocking you on their sub.

       Yesterday I warned another user that he might be talking to a sock puppet account from TopMinds that was specifically made to harass and confuse him. He made a thread about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4246xb/disinformants_up51mike1980_and_possibly_his_alts/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that whole situation very interesting, because it shows how far these TopMind users are willing to go. It's funny because that sock puppet account was deleted after just one day, exactly like I said it would happen. And it was created to make it look like a genuine user changed his mind entirely about the topic. It's highly manipulative and disturbing, makes you wonder why someone would spend their time doing this...

       "TopMinds" is a mockery of people. It is slang for "conspiratard" and both are ignorant bullshit terms. If they are not the bullies, then why do they link here to get more shill friends to downvote? If you think they do anything but blindly downvote truth-tellers, your are braindead.

       No this is straight CIA COUNTERINTELLIGENCE. You can tell because people blast it all over Targeted Individuals youtube videos. People tortured with synthetic telepathy torture constantly fighting against flat earthers. Flat earth purpose is to make people say "ok these people are crazy" and go do something else.

       But you said that if /TMOR makes threads about you, you're doing something right.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make threads about flat earthers, so following your logic, the flat earthers are doing something right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is it that flat earthers are doing, that is right? Welcome to flawed logic.
