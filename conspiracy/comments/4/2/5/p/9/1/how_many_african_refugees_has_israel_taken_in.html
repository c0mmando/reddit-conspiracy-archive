    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see anywhere where it says international law is that a country must accept refugees. International law doesn&#39;t really mean anything in the current organization of international politics. Sure other countries may  say bad things, say you&#39;re illegitimate, etc. but no one is going to do anything serious to affect Israel&#39;s sovereignty.  Which is why I don&#39;t think they&#39;re at all obligated to take anyone in. Nor is Italy, or South Korea, or Costa Rica. No one. It&#39;s up to them. </p>

<p>And this is why I think we&#39;ll start to see a trend worldwide that&#39;s against admitting refugees. Because in no way shape or form do they help the country that takes them in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_from_Africa_to_Israel">Here is the relevant Wikipedia page</a></p>

<p>Note that they only built a fence across the border with Egypt for the entire length of the border about a year and half ago to stem the rising tide of refugees coming mainly from Eritrea and Sudan. So now it is down to a trickle. Basically what Trump says he wants to do with Mexico, Israel has already done along all its borders, especially south and east. </p>

<p>Oh, and they&#39;ve rounded up as many of the Eritrean and Sudanese refugees and put them in what is essentially a prison. They are a signatory to UN conventions on refugees, but they are getting around that by basically not interviewing the refugees to see if they are eligible for refugee status. It&#39;s really shameful.</p>

<p>At the same time, <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2015/07/21/how-an-israeli-hospital-builds-bridges-with-syria-by-caring-for-the-wars-wounded/">Israel has been treating Syrians injured in the civil war.</a> This has been controversial, since some of the people they have treated are from Al Nusra front (Al Qaeda in Syria). This was recently stopped due to controversy, though it probably still continues. </p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.677464">here is a critical article from Ha&#39;aretz</a>, a relatively left-leaning Israeli newspaper, about the Israeli attitude toward the Syrian refugee crisis. Hope this gives you some of the perspective you were looking for. </p>

<p>Of course, this is all the official story and part of a sham debate and should not be mistaken for the &quot;Truth,&quot; whatever that is exactly.  </p>
