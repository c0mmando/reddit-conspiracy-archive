       I really doubt it's Bernie suuporters downvoting him, as Rand is the most reasonable GOP candidate. In fact most Bernie supporters ideal debate after primaries is Sanders and Paul, as such a debate would be about issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is either the people in charge of reddit manipulating the score, or a super PAC hiring an outside firm (like in China) to downvote the thread en masse.

       Yeah but that might just prove how full of shit the other campaigns are so they can't have that. Not to mention they would most likely debate shit that people SHOULD be thinking about as opposed to shit that they WANT us to be thinking about.

       Bernie fans often see rand paul as another example of a consistent candidate (not as consistent as his father) who is beholden to principles rather than special interests.  Don't threads just lose votes over time?

       Bernie seems like a well meaning man, but I do not think he can handle what he is getting into; they would put a chip in his head, slowly feed him antifreeze, and you would never know what happened.

       Right. No one can defend Bernie's brand of socialism. Except Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, England, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, and every other country that has socialized medicine and free or reduced cost college.

       Scandinavia is not socialist.  It is called Nordic Capitalism/social democracy a.k.a. The Nordic Model.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is from an earlier post I made when faced with the same rebuttal:
      </p>
      <p>
       *The Nordic Model invokes economic capitalism with social democratic policies. Please check out "Scandinavian Unexceptionalism", a book by Swedish scholar Nima Sanandaji, if you still do not understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because Bernie said it, doesn't make it true.*

       From my post: "Bernie's brand of socialism"
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that Scandinavia isn't pure socialist. But Bernie has said time and again that he wants to model his policies on Scandinavia's policies. Therefore, when I said "Bernie's brand of socialism," I was referring to the Scandinavian economic model.

       I respect your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is power and power is means.  When someone controls your money, they control you.  Socialism controls your money; capitalism liberates it.  Of course, this is understandably simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have watched Bernie, and he seems like a genuine guy.  However, my arguments are directed at the successors of power that socialism entitles.  A good example is 'from Lenin to Stalin'.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people mean well, but some do not.  Socialism has the potential to give great power to a$$holes, and this is why it is dangerous.  You have got to give power to the individual, and socialism does not recognize the individual as the smallest minority.

       My opinion is we need someone who can't be easily bought and sold. We've tried that time and again and the people always lose. Maybe having someone shake it up a little, for just 4 years, would be a good change of pace. If it doesn't work out we can always vote in someone who loves the lobbyist's check book, per usual. Honestly I don't think Bernie cares about money too much, and THAT should be one of the most important factors in The Leader of the Free World. Once again, that's just my take on it.

       This happens with every big post on reddit and is part of the vote fuzzing algorithm.  They will lose votes as the post gets older.  I looked at it when it was around 7k and it had a similar percentage then.  Same conspiracy theory happened with the Bernie AMA.

       I don't think 5 is adequate but I'm really ok with a few percent more, even 15. If you threw in getting rid of all the wasted spending it would definitely be enough revenue from the taxpayers. Mine is more like %30 as it is.

       Finding that data may be difficult. It takes them two or three years to put out those reports, so no one ever has current active data. Well, except them.

       Edit: I get the glorious benefit of paying both business and personal so I can say from that perspective, small business owners get fucked.

       Oh. Sorry. Freezing out here in the 30mph wind.  Small business owners would definitely be better off with a flat across the board tax. They could also benefit from an organized system of paying and reporting. Currently we contract some of it to third parties which sucks. Similar to the whole use turbo tax, it's free thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes we currently get fucked. The tax code has over complicated itself in order to allow certain types of people and corporations to benifit while at the same time assuring that the public pays as much as it should just to stay afloat.

       Ok. I was just wondering because your wording insinuated that one did not work democratically while the second did. State and local taxes wouldn't be affected by a flat tax, which might result in some unforseen results. City's and states are already becoming quite hungry when it comes to taxes.

       Your right. I agree. The fed tax code is mind boggling in its current state. To the point I'm certain no human being could understand or comprehend all of it. That says something. Every time you turn around there's a new one because guess what, we spent the money. We need more. It's like a child with a heroin addiction, you want to help but at some point it becomes enabling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: every time a tax goes up or a new one comes along, the king's deer comes to mind. You must be taxed to hunt the king's deer. When it comes to being taxed for everything we might change it. 
 Double edit: smart phones are not smart at all and Hitler invented the whole auto correct auto fill software.

       What do they owe me personally? Nothing. But should they pay their fair share in taxes? Absolutely. There is no way the NFL should be able to exist as a non profit nor should Walmart be able to pay their employees so little that they need welfare which likely ends up being spent back at Walmart anyway. Do you feel corporations should be tax free?

       Yes I am a citizen. If I'm paying my fair share of taxes why shouldn't the big corporations? NFL claimed they were a non profit. Do you actually believe the NFL doesn't make money? But I just did some research and the NFL is actually losing its tax exempt status this year so that's a step in the right direction.
Walmart is one of if not the biggest corporation in America. Having them set precedent by working their employees 38 hours a week instead of 40 so they're not forced to give these employees benefits is a shady practice and not something we as Americans should stand by and be ok with let alone give them huge tax breaks for. Again these are just 2 examples there are plenty of other companies who have mastered tax evasion and we end up with less money to spend on roads, infrastructure, etc. How about the move Zuckerberg just pulled with placing a huge portion of his wealth as a charity so it's tax exempt? It's estimated that we miss out on around 200 billion dollars annually from corporations using off shore hubs to transfer their money. Are you a citizen? Do you not think they should pay their fair share?

      <p>
       all you have done here is call me a name in a chickenshit ambiguous way without adding anything to the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are getting upvoted for calling people names while i am getting downvoted for asking questions and referring to facts and reality.

       you and everyone else in this country can simply stop voluntarily throwing your money at these giants. it is stupid to give them all your money voluntarily, and then complain about them having too much money.  we gave it to them fair and square.  we as citizens are not missing out on anything other than the money we could have spent more wisely.

       Let me "splain" something to you real quick. Places like Wal-Mart have created a monopoly for themselves giving us little choice but to spend money there or not buy at all. I have a Wal-Mart and Target to buy shit from. Next town over? Wal-Mart and Target. This isn't a free market, and it needs to me.

       What kind of fool believes every law in this country 1. Has the best interest of the people in mind and 2. Is as efficient as it can be. We shouldn't blindly follow laws just because they are laws, especially when the people writing and passing the laws are corrupted by the same corporations who have destroyed the free market.

       He's pro business. He's free market. To me, corporatism has always been the corruption of a presumably free market to resemble, in effect, a fascist state. Corporatism is about bribing the FDA and the SCC and trying to get a Goldmann friendly president into the oval office.

       Almost every republican and most of the democrats are corporatist sell outs. Rand's platform offers far more than a curtailing of privacy rights infringement. He's as anti-war as republicans get.

       Same here. Bernie supporters are all over him for his health care plan, more than anything. Well, his tax plan and giving the government oversight over the nation's health care is going to bite him in the ass. You don't want the government handling your private health information.

       Yup. Let's compare a government controlling the lives of 300 million people to any corporation.

       Let's compare deaths to unjust wars, bombing of civilians, agent orange, etc.

       Big government is bad news. Do you really want the government to know your health issues? Why they can deny you a pistol permit. Why they can ban gay marriage at the federal level. Spy on your phone calls. Or, better fucking yet, look up "sneak and peak FBI" and realize that shit is legal. Right now.

       i sincerely doubt you have literally no way to provide for yourself other than shopping at wal mart.  you are a slave to convenience, if that is your mentality.

      <p>
       also, i trust the government zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the government is so dubious, why do you assume the best thing for everyone is to let the government take everyones money and redistribute it in the first place? the second half of your comment was just putting words in my mouth, so i don't know what kind of fool believes that, but it's not me.

       Finding that data may be difficult. It takes them two or three years to put out those reports, so no one ever has current active data. Well, except them.

       Edit: I get the glorious benefit of paying both business and personal so I can say from that perspective, small business owners get fucked.

       Oh. Sorry. Freezing out here in the 30mph wind.  Small business owners would definitely be better off with a flat across the board tax. They could also benefit from an organized system of paying and reporting. Currently we contract some of it to third parties which sucks. Similar to the whole use turbo tax, it's free thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes we currently get fucked. The tax code has over complicated itself in order to allow certain types of people and corporations to benifit while at the same time assuring that the public pays as much as it should just to stay afloat.
