<p>I know that Scandinavia isn&#39;t pure socialist. But Bernie has said time and again that he wants to model his policies on Scandinavia&#39;s policies. Therefore, when I said &quot;Bernie&#39;s brand of socialism,&quot; I was referring to the Scandinavian economic model. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your argument.  </p>

<p>Money is power and power is means.  When someone controls your money, they control you.  Socialism controls your money; capitalism liberates it.  Of course, this is understandably simple.  </p>

<p>I have watched Bernie, and he seems like a genuine guy.  However, my arguments are directed at the successors of power that socialism entitles.  A good example is &#39;from Lenin to Stalin&#39;.</p>

<p>A lot of people mean well, but some do not.  Socialism has the potential to give great power to a$$holes, and this is why it is dangerous.  You have got to give power to the individual, and socialism does not recognize the individual as the smallest minority.  </p>

<p>Thoughts?  </p>

<p>My opinion is we need someone who can&#39;t be easily bought and sold. We&#39;ve tried that time and again and the people always lose. Maybe having someone shake it up a little, for just 4 years, would be a good change of pace. If it doesn&#39;t work out we can always vote in someone who loves the lobbyist&#39;s check book, per usual. Honestly I don&#39;t think Bernie cares about money too much, and THAT should be one of the most important factors in The Leader of the Free World. Once again, that&#39;s just my take on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh. Sorry. Freezing out here in the 30mph wind.  Small business owners would definitely be better off with a flat across the board tax. They could also benefit from an organized system of paying and reporting. Currently we contract some of it to third parties which sucks. Similar to the whole use turbo tax, it&#39;s free thing. </p>

<p>And yes we currently get fucked. The tax code has over complicated itself in order to allow certain types of people and corporations to benifit while at the same time assuring that the public pays as much as it should just to stay afloat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your right. I agree. The fed tax code is mind boggling in its current state. To the point I&#39;m certain no human being could understand or comprehend all of it. That says something. Every time you turn around there&#39;s a new one because guess what, we spent the money. We need more. It&#39;s like a child with a heroin addiction, you want to help but at some point it becomes enabling. </p>

<p>Edit: every time a tax goes up or a new one comes along, the king&#39;s deer comes to mind. You must be taxed to hunt the king&#39;s deer. When it comes to being taxed for everything we might change it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am a citizen. If I&#39;m paying my fair share of taxes why shouldn&#39;t the big corporations? NFL claimed they were a non profit. Do you actually believe the NFL doesn&#39;t make money? But I just did some research and the NFL is actually losing its tax exempt status this year so that&#39;s a step in the right direction.
Walmart is one of if not the biggest corporation in America. Having them set precedent by working their employees 38 hours a week instead of 40 so they&#39;re not forced to give these employees benefits is a shady practice and not something we as Americans should stand by and be ok with let alone give them huge tax breaks for. Again these are just 2 examples there are plenty of other companies who have mastered tax evasion and we end up with less money to spend on roads, infrastructure, etc. How about the move Zuckerberg just pulled with placing a huge portion of his wealth as a charity so it&#39;s tax exempt? It&#39;s estimated that we miss out on around 200 billion dollars annually from corporations using off shore hubs to transfer their money. Are you a citizen? Do you not think they should pay their fair share? </p>

<p>if the nfl did not meet non-profit requirements and is losing that status, then good.  </p>

<p>and i don&#39;t see wal mart at fault because, again, they are within the law.  you are singling them out because they are successful.</p>

<p>let me &#39;splain this to ya real quick:  every penny that wal mart or facebook or an nfl player has, was given to them voluntarily by us, the consumers.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t have facebook, buy nfl products, or shop at walmart.  i choose not to.</p>

<p>you and everyone else in this country can simply stop voluntarily throwing your money at these giants. it is stupid to give them all your money voluntarily, and then complain about them having too much money.  we gave it to them fair and square.  we as citizens are not missing out on anything other than the money we could have spent more wisely.</p>

<p>edit: you fucking commie brigading fucking dipshits can suck my ass</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me &quot;splain&quot; something to you real quick. Places like Wal-Mart have created a monopoly for themselves giving us little choice but to spend money there or not buy at all. I have a Wal-Mart and Target to buy shit from. Next town over? Wal-Mart and Target. This isn&#39;t a free market, and it needs to me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dont see walmart at fault because they are within the law.</p>

<p>What kind of fool believes every law in this country 1. Has the best interest of the people in mind and 2. Is as efficient as it can be. We shouldn&#39;t blindly follow laws just because they are laws, especially when the people writing and passing the laws are corrupted by the same corporations who have destroyed the free market. </p>

<p>You trust government too much. </p>
