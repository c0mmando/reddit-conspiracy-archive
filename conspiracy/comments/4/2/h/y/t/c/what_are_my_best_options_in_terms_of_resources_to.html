<p>My problem is Im not educated enough about whats going on to have coherent opinions on matters. Im basically just like, yeah Fractional reserve banking, yeah thats bad stuff, were all slaves to debt&quot; Like a babbling idiot.</p>

<p>Basically I&#39;m looking for the best places and resources to educate myself about how the world REALLY works, and not what we&#39;re force fed to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can start by checking out <a href="/r/shills">/r/shills</a> </p>

<p>There you will find a compilation of information designed to help you understand how narratives are set and manipulated online. In the past, the news media was the primary tool used by the government and corporate entities for information control. People started shifting towards the internet for information/education, so it needs to be controlled as well. </p>

<p>That should help you wade through this sick sea of manipulation. I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for. </p>

<p>Edit: I should probably steer you in the right direction as well.  I usually have an issue with most journalists and news organizations. You&#39;re better off going with NPR and BBC as a source of information, but stay alert. Other than that, Ben Swann is an excellent journalist. He&#39;s very fair and reports on some very controversial stuff. </p>

<p>You will find tons of interesting stuff here: <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/</a></p>

<p>One of my favorites: <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/20010430/">http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/20010430/</a></p>

<p>Then there is the issue of news organizations selectively promoting certain scientific studies and ignoring others. What I do is set aside some time each day and go to a science news publishing service like sciencedaily or eurekalert. There you can see a bunch of the studies published each day and you don&#39;t have to listen to others tell you what is or is not important. Along with this technique, you&#39;ll need to be aware of the massive amount of bias and outright fraud in science. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/3zqatd/you_cant_trust_what_you_read_about_nutrition/cyoliq4">I compiled some information on that right here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That guy has been harassing me all day. PMs and whatnot. That&#39;s normal for me. I actually used to be bothered by it and had to keep deleting accounts to stop the flood of PMs. </p>

<p>I simply don&#39;t care anymore. It&#39;s almost like a badge. </p>

<p>Anyway, you are correct. I do not care about the subscribers. If people can see the information and can easily find what they are looking for, I&#39;m happy. It&#39;s also easier for others to share the information, although it seems I am doing this mostly alone. I really should just post all of this on medium.com or something so these annoying parasites stop using that same, tired attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just keep in mind, we all started somewhere - and don&#39;t beat yourself up about how much you believe you do or don&#39;t know about a particular topic.</p>

<p>The important part is you&#39;re willing to hear different opinions about a topic - that&#39;s the first step, because it&#39;s often through comparison of information that incongruence&#39;s are exposed, but always remain a sceptic in the things you hear.</p>

<p>Try and find the source yourself, this isn&#39;t always practical, but try and find the original source of the assertion - has it been taken out of context? Has it been altered? What was the discourse behind the words, don&#39;t just look at the words themselves.  </p>

<p>Compare narratives to real life, compare them to common sense - ask yourself with the information at hand can I objectively conclude a point? Or am I just being asked to conclude a point based on narrative told me and the emotions said narrative elicits.</p>

<p>Be very wary when arguments are made on emotional appeals - there&#39;s a reason they&#39;ve chosen to avoid logical conclusions and factual statements.</p>

<p>Be grounded, we all struggle with this, it&#39;s human nature to be sure of yourself, you may be wrong though, be open to that - after all, we may all be wrong about certain topics or all of the topics in question.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a contrarian - don&#39;t be against something simply because it seems like other&#39;s are for it - be against something for a reason, I know this seems self evident.</p>

<p>Try not to get swept up in group think, it makes us all dumber.</p>

<p>Lastly, you, never, stop, learning - Don&#39;t ever believe you&#39;re at the end.</p>
