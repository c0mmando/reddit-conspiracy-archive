       So this is my first time posting a sort of "out there" theory, but what if ADD/ADHD is a human evolution in response to the increased level of information we have to absorb daily? I say this because I have ADHD, and I've found that if I try really hard I can concentrate without medication, but I still have all the other "overloading" information on hold, in a way. I have a better understanding of everything going on around me and can react to things better, it just takes a lot of focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the conspiracy of ADD/ADHD isn't that it's a made up disease to sell drugs and dumb people down, but ONLY to dumb people down because of this rising ability? Maybe ADD/ADHD is the first step, maybe in a few decades our children could become incredibly smart but the medication is a way of making sure only a few get to carry on the trait?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I know this is out there, and maybe it's just my imagination running wild, but i think it's plausible.

       ADHD is made up which was admitted by the actual founder on his deathbed. ADD on the other hand is very real, and I definitely have it (as I think many great minds of the past had it (not saying I'm as brilliant as they were)).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an agenda to pacify people with ADD, because they do not want thinkers, they want workers. So, yes, they drug these people to sedate them, just like the other worker drones. People with ADD are some of the smartest/most successful people I've known, who learned to harness it, like those brilliant in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think you have ADD, try listening to classical music (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc) and see how focus you become.

       It was apparently stated by him in an interview with Der Spiegel. I mean if you type it into google, you will see a tonne of links. Seems the interview has vanished, idk.

       This is so bizarre.  I was diagnosed with ADD at a pretty young age.  I was medicated throughout middle school and elementary school.  It was not that I was not intelligent, it was just that I did not care about most of the material so I was a bad student.  I never really felt that there was anything wrong with me but I felt like I processed information fast and I always question everything.  I started listening to classical music about 5 years ago and now "classical solo piano" is my go to Pandora station

       That's the same experience I had, except I was introduced at a young age to classical music. My parents were more open minded and skeptic of doctors/psychology. I thank them to this day. The classical music is like giving your subconscious a puzzle to solve, while the conscious mind can focus on the here and now. That is how it's been explained to me.

       Cheers friend.  My journey was a struggle young.  4 or 5 psychologist by the age of 12.  There was such a nasty stigma associated with being medicated at that age.  I went though virtually all the genres before discovering Helen Jane long is my favorite artist.

       No problem! I find this topic very interesting because, as I've said,  I have ADD myself. I consider it a gift to harness, not to medicate away. Also, no worries, and take your time. I got a lot of stuff going on myself, also.

       So I've heard. Never tried it myself (wuss/noobie). I think if drugs were legal, I'd experiment a little more, which is why they are not legal.... That needs to change!

       It's an interesting thought. I'd like to add my two cents as someone who has taken a pharmacology class. ADHD medication has a similar action to drugs like caffeine. Many people with ADHD have success managing their symptoms using drinks like coffee. A person with ADHD will be calmed by a drink high in caffeine, where-as an average person would become stimulated and excited. Every ADHD drug that I'm familiar with is a type of stimulant
      </p>
      <p>
       This is purely anecdotal but when I was growing up one of my (adult) Youth-Group leaders at church had ADHD and constantly was drinking coffee. Literally all day, because it helped keep him calm.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I also want to add that there must be evolutionary reasons that the traits which cause ADHD have been carried on for millions of years and not weeded out. My point being that YES there may be advantages to having "ADHD" but in our modern lifestyle many people will have trouble managing the symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous hereditary diseases that require double recessive alleles to become active, but if you only have one recessive allele there is a benefit. One example being sickle-cell anemia, people who only carry half of the gene are actually more resistant to malaria than the average person. But if you carry two of the recessive alleles you have full-blown sickle-cell anemia. Very interesting imo.

       I do not think it is a sign of evolution at all, it is in fact I believe it to be a symptom of probably something much more serious involving society and environmental concerns.

       What about pre natal testing for Downs? Some stuff I've been reading says that in the future, we're going to upgrade our DNA to 46 &amp; 2 chromosomes. If we're prenatal testing for Downs, are we potentially aborting some of these new babies that are coming in with healthy extra chromosomes?

       Exactly. It's such a hard subject to make an opinion on, and even though this is probably reallllyyy bad of me to say, I don't think we should do anything about people with certain "disabilities". Nature mutates and changes shit all the time, we can halt our own evolutionary process. But then again, there's no guarantee that it would lead us down a successful path, so, eh, you know?

       But the ADD thing definitely bothers me, because it's a thing that I really feel could just be taught to be controlled and put to good use, here and now.

       My problem with this is that human beings dont have a huge load of selectivity going on.

       Do you mean selectivity in respect to choosing a mate? Well, I think that's true, but also we don't know how that could affect the evolutionary process because it doesn't really happen in nature the way it does to us, so it could have an affect that we haven't even seen. I'm no scientist though, that's just my two cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then there's also epigenetics, and in the world we live in where so many of us are exposed to so much info, epigenetics could have just sort of changed our genome as a whole and skipped the weeding out process of breeding evolution. Again, not a scientist, but it seems plausible.
