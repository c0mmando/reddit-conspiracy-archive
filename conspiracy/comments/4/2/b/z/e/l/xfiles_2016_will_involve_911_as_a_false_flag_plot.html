<p>It&#39;s more &quot;conspiracy theory taint&quot; / <em>transfer agit-propaganda</em> from the establishment to protect itself.  They are really scared if they have to go this far.  We should keep laying on truths, because it causes them to spin their webs as fast as they can, producing quality tv shows in the process.  Love the spectacle, live the spectacle.</p>

<p>If we truth hard enough, perhaps they&#39;ll reboot firefly and dollhouse to <em>sciwash</em> isis and mkultra respectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ships acquire the magnetic field lines (polarity) of the dockyard they are constructed in, degaussing removes the effect, they are no longer a massive bar magnet. they become neutral.</p>

<p>degaussing requires monstrous cables wrapped around the ships hull, and large generators providing an alternation currant.</p>

<p>this technique is used on hand tools in some industries,  and circuitry used to be installed in modern CRT televisions, either there was a button to do it, or the TV would do it on start up or when some sensor signalled. CRT TVs would adapt to the place and rotation they were used in, so when moved or disturbed they needed degaussing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It all depends on the strength of the induced field. The whole idea is to create an opposing field that resets or cancels out the ships normal one. From <a href="http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/degaussing.htm:">http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/degaussing.htm:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the ship moves through the water, this field also moves and adds to or subtracts from the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. Because of its distortion effects on the Earth&#39;s magnetic field, the ship can act as a trigger device for magnetic sensitive ordnance or devices which are designed to detect these distortions. The degaussing system is installed aboard ship to reduce the ship&#39;s effect on the Earth&#39;s magnetic field.</p>

<p>Spoiler below:</p>

<hr/>

<p>They covered a lot of ground in one conversation, mixing truth with bunk, which is their intended aim.  They connected 9/11 to roswell, turning us into ultimate consumers with bad food and water and nearly every conspiracy you can think of rolled into one...including fema camps...and alien replica vehicles that Mulder witnesses as real examples of using zero point energy and antigravity.  That&#39;s when I knew they were basically winking at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, making a mockery by mashing it all together.  Then scully interrupts as a the pseudoskeptic establishmentarian and tries to run away until she sequences her dna and another girls&#39; somehow to disover they both have alien dna in them...she sequenced them in the matter of hours, apperntly using advanced turbosequencing that&#39;s not been invented yet.  Also, she doesn&#39;t know her nurse-servants name, which is lame.</p>

<p>In another scene, Mulder talked about a climate change scenario that forced the cryptoelite fascists into breakaway civilizations that are preweaponized against the hoi polloi</p>

<p>In fact, I was pretty damn sure that Gaiam&#39;s David Wilcock came in his pants watching XFile&#39;s new Pilot, as it seemed as if it was the voice of the Establishment, confessing &quot;The Disclosure&quot; Wilcock&#39;s been saying was coming for over a decade.  Of course, they mixed in some undesirable  brazil nuts of conspiracies into the party mix (fema camps, alien stargate stuff, breakaway civilization stuff, holograms, etc) to make regular non-conspiarcy theory believers (most of the public) realize that this whole thing may sound true but is a fiction--all of it.  Even the 9/11 stuff.</p>

<p>You see that&#39;s the whole point of the Xfiles reboot.  It&#39;s not just to make money but it&#39;s to make a conspiracy salad that you can hide a brazil nut like 9/11 truth into, so it sinks to the bottom and gets coated with wet dressing mung and addon bits, so you leave it alone in a meh puddle of abandon.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they had a few CIA consultants on the show working with the writer Chris Carter; or even if the CIA financed the whole miniseries (this season (10) is 6 episode a miniseries btw)</p>

Further, I wouldn&#39;t know David Wilcock from Adam. I prefer to read (always between the lines) histories and biographies and investigative (corruption) reports. That said, you&#39;re a <em>good</em> writer...<strong>original</strong>...and I get the feeling that you&#39;ve cracked your own share of hard nuts (Brazilian or Wal-nut), too. Otherwise, keep up the good script, and please do give us a heads-up if you ever run into any fo&#39; real body snatchers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I saw the announcement for the new x-files I was certain that it was simply going to be used as a means to distort the original message into one much less believable and more on the lines of &quot;crazy and irrational&quot;.</p>

<p>Its a consistent theme among many &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; where you will see a legitimate concern over a series of events and then a documentary or an article will appear distorting the original message. For example, there are documentaries out there saying that during 9/11 the planes never actually hit the towers, or that it was jet fuel that caused the tower to collapse. ( the original concern as to whether or not jet fuel could melt steel was a result of molten steel at the base of the tower, not as to whether jet fuel could melt steel beams.)</p>

<p>But this... this is using the truth to tell lies. Sketchy business. I hate how smart they can be. </p>
