    <div class="md"><p>I know most of the hijackers were Saudis but to be honest I do not see a motive for the House of Saud to attack the US. The country has been given everything they want since the Oil shock of the early 70s. Hell even the Saudis say release the documents!  The only damage the documents can cause is how much the US intel groups knew prior and/or were involved.  Governments do not hide stuff to protect sheiks with billions, they hide stuff to protect themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i believe if it wasn&#39;t for the media manipulation, Ron Paul would be our president right now. they always twist his views to make him seem like some kind of radical nutjob, when in reality, he was the smartest guy in the room.</p>

<p>i wish he would have gave it one more go, he&#39;s only been validated more since 2012. more and more people are aware of the bullshit that is the US government. i really think if he ran again he would have a legitimate chance of winning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I imagine that Rand Paul grew up very admiring of his father. Why else did he go into medicine? Why else did he go into politics? But for all the admiration of the guy&#39;s belief system, Ron Paul largely failed to achieve any of the things he would have liked to. Ultimately, Ron Paul is probably more interested in communicating ideas than he is being in power. That&#39;s part of the purity of the guy that makes him appealing, but if Rand is looking at starting a career in politics I can see why he&#39;d say &quot;There&#39;s no point in spending my whole life being right about everything but never getting anything done. I want to achieve what my father couldn&#39;t&quot;.</p>

<p>If he succeeds, I think they&#39;ll be looked at as a one-two punch one day. Almost the way people see Goldwater as the precursor to Reagan, but I think this would be a more salient example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know Rand has had a problem being lukewarm. He is a sharp guy and in a lot of ways his head is in the right place, but he tries too hard to straddle the middle without going all in for the liberty minded, hard working, middle class, in this country. The way his dad did. </p>

<p>Not to mention that the Israel worship, and his stance on immigration are both deal breakers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the idea of Paul being lukewarm is a bit of a common misconception. His stances do not fit the normal bipolar paradigm we Americans are used to candidates following. </p>

<p>His policies may fit in the middle of the Democrat/Republican philosophy; however, Rand has a solid voting record and has maintained an extremely consistent political view.</p>

<p>The few &quot;flipflops&quot; people argue over show that even though he is strongly focused on his ideals, his message evolves with his real world experiences.
This is important because, too often, politicians are unwilling to admit when they are wrong.</p>

<p>The way the two parties have divided has subjected the American Citizens to tyranny. </p>

<p>In order to fulfill their own greedy special interests, both republicans and democrats have generally agreed upon the ideas of big government and crony capitalism, </p>

<p>The only real difference in republicans and democrats has been that democrats have been more socially liberal, while the republicans have been more socially conservative.  This leaves no place for other political ideas and has left us to bicker over relatively unimportant issues like terrorism, mass shooting, and political correctness.  The truth of the matter is these issues have affected less than ten percent of the population, but they take up 90 percent of the talking points. This is obviously a distraction technique.</p>

<p>The specific people lacking proper representation would be the so called &quot;middle ground.&quot; 
Both Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders fit perfectly in this middle ground; therefore, you would think they would be quite friendly towards each other since they are both in the &quot;middle.&quot; 
The truth is they are nearly polar opposites in philosophy. They just happen to agree that the government has been treating the people unfairly. 
Rand wants to fix this by reducing the power of the evil government, while Bernie wants to fix the government with more government.</p>

<p>To summarize, the political spectrum has been purposefully manipulated to trick people into excluding the candidates that want to fix corruption. Rand is not lukewarm because the &quot;middle ground&quot; is a misnomer. He has fought hard for liberty and is the only republican candidate trying to find real solutions including the other party as a part of active discussion and not backroom deals.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t true. He has attempted to cash in on the good will his father banked with the libertarian/tea party crowd, but while still worshipping (((Our Greatest Ally))), pushing for immigration, supporting the cultural Marxist/Black Lives Matter narrative, and still being a bit of a war hawk. What is more likely than his &quot;consistency&quot; is what I said; that he was trying to play both sides for political gain and it just simply didn&#39;t work judging by his poll numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only real difference in republicans and democrats has been that democrats have been more socially liberal, while the republicans have been more socially conservative. 
While I will agree with you that there is very little difference in the stances of mainline republoodlicans and democrips there is a massive difference between the leftist and rightist <em>citizens</em> in this country. The left believes that the solution to most everything is more government, more spending, more central control and planning. While the average rightist believes in less intervention, more economic liberty, less taxes and market principles. Acting as if these two are just sides of the same coin is plain wrong. They are two vastly different approaches to the same problem. </p>

<p>This leaves no place for other political ideas and has left us to bicker over relatively unimportant issues like terrorism, mass shooting, and political correctness. The truth of the matter is these issues have affected less than ten percent of the population, but they take up 90 percent of the talking points. This is obviously a distraction technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think those three issues are actually much more important than you realize and our responses have a large impact on the future of the country. Our response to terrorism dictates both our foreign policy and immigration policy. Our foreign policy has the power to shape the future of the globe and decides what type of spending and debt we will be forced to suffer under. Immigration is probably even more important because it determines the demographics of our country and, as anyone who has studied history know, demographics shape countries. Look what happen to Rome when they allowed unchecked immigration and multiculturalism. Hint: they fell. This is something Rand is terrible on and this is a big reason why he was a non-factor. Mass shootings are extremely important because they determine the future of gun rights which as you probably know is the last check on tyranny. Finally, political correctness is really the fight against cultural marxism, tyrannical-regressive leftism and relativism. How we handle this assault by cultural marxism will dictate the future of our country. It is an incredibly powerful tool used to divide and conquer, and whether we submit to this division will determine if we are ever able to unite enough to make real change ever again.</p>

<p>Last thing I need to point out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both Rand Paul and ((((((Bernie Sanders)))))) fit perfectly in this middle ground</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NO, no, no no no no no... Someone pushing for Free college, healthcare, and almost doubling the minimum wage is not the same as a free market Republican in the tradition of Ron Paul. Moving towards full social democracy (or whatever the purists are calling it) would be the single most disastrous move for Liberty and the American economy in the history of the republic. You think college is expensive now? You think degrees are worthless now? You think we have a lot of debt now? You think we have a lot of unemployment now? You think taxes are high now? You think healthcare is bad now? Just wait until we make it &quot;free&quot; We will have these important institutions run by the same people who make going to the DMV such a joy. Degrees will be worthless when everyone has one, hospitals/universities will be able to charge whatever the fuck they want because they have a captive market because of the government, and unemployment will skyrocket keeping the most vulnerable groups out of the labor force because they simply aren&#39;t worth 15 an hour. You can&#39;t just fiat that people are worth more per hour than they actually are. It&#39;s basic economics, when you set a price floor (which is what minimum wage is) You will have an oversupply of a good (in the case labor) with less demand. </p>

<p>To sum it up, Rand is not in the middle he has tried to pick and choose parts from the libertarian and neo-con basket with very little effect. Whereas his dad was ideologically pure and libertarian and he made a fantastic run. Still, Bernie/Rand are nowhere near each other. Rand believes in the market and he believes in the individuals right and ability to make the best decision for himself about his own life/finances/health/etc... and Bernie believes that the government is the best decider of how how resources should be allocated. He believes in the generosity of taking from someone by force (taxes) to give to someone else (redistribution). </p>

<p>I would spend some more time studying this stuff especially economics, and your understanding of politics will begin to get more nuanced.  Specifically look up the &quot;Law of Unintended Consequences&quot; It basically establishes that any intervention in the marketplace (such as bernie is pushing for) will have other consequences not initially intended. For example make healthcare free increase the demand for healthcare exponentially. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, did you even read my post? I must not have communicated effectively because if I did, you would have realized that I agree with most of what you say. Especially about economics and Uncle Bernie&#39;s outlandish promises.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t like that Rand is playing the political game a little more than his father, and you prefer a pure libertarian?</p>

<p>Here is another way to describe the point I was trying to make. 
Our choices are too limited by the dominate two party system.
Most of the candidates being elected from either party are for a bigger government nowadays.</p>

<p>What we need is a vanilla libertarian, so to speak. Someone to help usher into a greater age of liberty.</p>

<p>Maybe one day Americans will be ready for a president exactly like Ron Paul. But right now we need his son to help make that happen.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m not getting. Ron Paul had a legitimate shot at the nomination. Rand Paul wasn&#39;t even close I don&#39;t think he ever broke 8%. Ron, if he didn&#39;t get sand bagged by the media probably would have won the nom. Again, Rand is barely in the top tier, Ron was a contender. I&#39;m not being facetious, but maybe you are european or you were too young to watch the race when Ron was running?  </p>

I have the right to use a drug if I choose to do so, and fuck you if you say otherwise. The only drugs that should be illegal would have to be incredibly dangerous drugs, such as PCP, heroin, and synthetic marijuana.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. When we were attacked we were very dependent on foreign energy sources. People mistook our kindness for weakness. They might say the US is an empire. True. But has the standard of living gone up across the globe? One thing that bothered me was Bandar and GW were photographed on the roof of the Whitehouse smoking cigars on 9-12. Bandar published it in his autobiography.  However, Woolsey said and lectured for a long time post 911 that we were one-dependent on foreign energy but we were going to become independent and then he would say with a,stark warning KSA we are coming for you. We weren&#39;t ready to bomb the shot out of our resources. Now. No dependancy on foreign oil so much. We have sought to get our bases covered. We are getting our ducks in a row. And when we have our Death Star powered up we are going to take the blinders of the eagle, hold our wrist high and that eagle is going to hunt down and put them on their knees and scream as it comes down talons fully exposed. The west built them up. The west taught them everything they know. We are in the long game with them. They are hypocritical and evil. We hold grudges. Ask Iran. We now have Shiiete oil flowing. It won&#39;t be long. All our past deals with former kings have been honored. This wacky one dies and when the new king is crowned it&#39;s over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People that were standing near the towers minutes before they fell never heard anything until the buildings were practically gone so its highly unlikely that there were explosives/a crash involved. It wouldve taken a crew of airmen and a bulldozer to destroy <em>every single floor</em> and turn it into the mounds of rubble we&#39;ve all seen. My guess is that those papers are about the towers themselves. <em>Hold on to your silver hats, Cue incoming wave of speculation</em>: the buildings were always meant to come down. The towers were built with certain materials that, once triggered, would allow the structures to collapse on themselves with little to no damage to the surrounding area. Whether they were supposed to have people in them during deconstruction... I really hope not.</p>

<p>False claim, there is vast amounts of evidence of explosions, this is indisputable.</p>

<p><strong>Bombs and Explosions documented on 9/11</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Hundreds of Firefighters and witness testimony to BOMBS/EXPLOSIONS ignored by the 9/11 Commission Report. 9/11 Commission Report bars 503 1st responder eyewitnesses and 118 Firefighter witnesses to explosions. From video footage it’s clear to see ‘squibs’ and waves of explosions ripping down the side of the Towers. Many Firefighters witnessed “Explosions in the lobby and sub levels”, ‘Oral Histories’. NIST failed to follow NFPA 921 guidelines for fire and explosion investigations.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When we got to about 50 ft from the South Tower, we heard the most eerie sound that you would ever hear. A high-pitched noise and a popping noise made everyone stop. We all looked up. At the point, it all let go. The way I see it, it had to be the rivets. The building let go, there was an explosion and the whole top leaned toward us and started coming down.
&amp;gt; &quot;I stood there for a second in total awe, and then said, ‘What the F_____?’ I honestly thought it was Hollywood.&quot; - CEE News (02/13/02)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NBC reporter Pat Dawson</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The chief of safety of the Fire Department of New York City told me he received word of a possibility of a secondary device -- that is another bomb going off.  He tries to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place and according to his theory, he thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building.&quot; - NBC</p>

<p>I invite you to use your search engine of choice to look for &quot;WTC Building 7&quot;. There is a 2000-member strong group Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth that is dedicated to rooting out the underlying facts of this incident. The issue of Building 7 is backed up by literally dozens of independent videos coming from CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, Fox, what have you. There are dozens of on-camera interviews with people who said the collapse of Building 7 was preceded by explosions--their words. On this subject, I feel not a molecule of doubt based on the widespread evidence from many reputable sources.</p>

<p>False claim, there is vast amounts of evidence of explosions, this is indisputable.</p>

<p><strong>Bombs and Explosions documented on 9/11</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Hundreds of Firefighters and witness testimony to BOMBS/EXPLOSIONS ignored by the 9/11 Commission Report. 9/11 Commission Report bars 503 1st responder eyewitnesses and 118 Firefighter witnesses to explosions. From video footage it’s clear to see ‘squibs’ and waves of explosions ripping down the side of the Towers. Many Firefighters witnessed “Explosions in the lobby and sub levels”, ‘Oral Histories’.

At the point, it all let go. The way I see it, it had to be the rivets. The building let go, there was an explosion and the whole top leaned toward us and started coming down.
&amp;gt; &quot;I stood there for a second in total awe, and then said, ‘What the F_____?’ I honestly thought it was Hollywood.&quot; - CEE News (02/13/02)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The chief of safety of the Fire Department of New York City told me he received word of a possibility of a secondary device -- that is another bomb going off.  He tries to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place and according to his theory, he thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building.&quot; - NBC</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the idea of Paul being lukewarm is a bit of a common misconception. His stances do not fit the normal bipolar paradigm we Americans are used to candidates following. </p>

<p>His policies may fit in the middle of the Democrat/Republican philosophy; however, Rand has a solid voting record and has maintained an extremely consistent political view.</p>

<p>The few &quot;flipflops&quot; people argue over show that even though he is strongly focused on his ideals, his message evolves with his real world experiences.
This is important because, too often, politicians are unwilling to admit when they are wrong.</p>

<p>The way the two parties have divided has subjected the American Citizens to tyranny. </p>

<p>In order to fulfill their own greedy special interests, both republicans and democrats have generally agreed upon the ideas of big government and crony capitalism, </p>

<p>The only real difference in republicans and democrats has been that democrats have been more socially liberal, while the republicans have been more socially conservative.  This leaves no place for other political ideas and has left us to bicker over relatively unimportant issues like terrorism, mass shooting, and political correctness.  The truth of the matter is these issues have affected less than ten percent of the population, but they take up 90 percent of the talking points. This is obviously a distraction technique.</p>

<p>The specific people lacking proper representation would be the so called &quot;middle ground.&quot; 
Both Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders fit perfectly in this middle ground; therefore, you would think they would be quite friendly towards each other since they are both in the &quot;middle.&quot; 
The truth is they are nearly polar opposites in philosophy. They just happen to agree that the government has been treating the people unfairly. 
Rand wants to fix this by reducing the power of the evil government, while Bernie wants to fix the government with more government.</p>

<p>To summarize, the political spectrum has been purposefully manipulated to trick people into excluding the candidates that want to fix corruption. Rand is not lukewarm because the &quot;middle ground&quot; is a misnomer. He has fought hard for liberty and is the only republican candidate trying to find real solutions including the other party as a part of active discussion and not backroom deals.</p>
