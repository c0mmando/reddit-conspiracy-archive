       I watched the premiere of the X Files miniseries tonight, and its overall point was that there was a giant conspiracy about  basically everything this subreddit has discussed (martial law, massive corruption, big pharma and govt not looking out for our well-being) and I just wonder if it is the govt trying to tell everyone "hey, this is actually happening, revolt so we can imprison you.". What do you guys think?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. I loved the show back when it was on in the 90s and Early 00s. Added fuel to my beliefs that big brother isn't so nice. :)

       are crapping on the premiere for its conspiracy talk, but that's what the whole show has always been about. I thought it was a good episode and it was interesting to see them talk about stuff like 9/11, FEMA camps, Project Bluebeam, chemtrails, etc. O'Malley is definitely supposed to be like Alex Jones. They got pretty political about government surveillance and whistleblowers.

       Why do people respect Alex Jones? He is a total retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty obvious that he is controlled opposition and that he is  into these topics just for the money.

       William Cooper was a completely different story.

       I don't understand how every conversation about Alex Jones the person always mentions William Cooper.
      </p>
      <p>
       I very much doubt that you've actually read his book where he says that the Bilderberg Group and Soviet Union meet at least once a year under polar ice caps in nuclear subs because it is impossible to bug and that he just happened to read about it in a classified file that was laying around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that his theory on JFK was that the driver was the gunman.
      </p>
      <p>
       His book is just filled with trash talk of other researchers and crazy things he read in classified documents that just happened to by laying around.

       Fucking died in a shootout with marshalls, one of the few we found out was a real believer. Alex jones is a schill. I put my trust in clyde lewis, that is when I have to trust one of those guys.

       Either that or they want it to be out in the air talked about publicly but as science fiction. So when the soccer mom or car salesmen father of 4 hear talk about conspiracys they will think that's crazy Xfiles stuff its not like it's real.

       They pretty much say as much in the first movie(I think it was the movie. I haven't watched the show or movie in a few years). Fox meets up with a conspiracy author who has info he needs. When Fox finds out the author is writing a new book about Fox's theories about the truth the author says "why do you think they lead you to me. I need a new book and they know everyone will think of you as a loon if I write about you."

       Really cool to see it back on Tv. But I've seen it started already though, people dismissing real concepts mentioned in the show, being written off as fantasy. There is a complex perception game of association. Muddying the waters.

       Yeah I agree with you. Although, I do like seeing these topics mentioned on national tv and seen by the masses. It brought up real topics going on. Honestly, I interpreted as a warning and instilling the idea of society breaking down soon. They seemed way too specific about martial law and how the banks would probably announce on a Friday that assets would be frozen and trading halted. Could just be me though.

       It actually was kind of interesting talking about the NSA, 9/11, Wikileaks in a hour long show.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just another thought after watching the X-Files.  We typically take the NSA or FBI spying as a one-off surveillance without checks and balances.

      <p>
       But the X-Files premier had me thinking, why would they do this?  Maybe there is a conspiracy in the government pushing for these programs?

       Actually, about a month ago, an act called the CISA (Cyber Information Security Act or something like that) was smuggled at the back of a bill about NASA and space. It basically states that the govt can spy on you and compile data on you and do it completely unhindered. It can request that your Internet Service Provider give over your data, and they are required to as a result of this law. Hope that clears this up a bit :)

       It is interesting why the program is being put back out there.  My guess is that conspiracy theories are so main stream now that TPTB are working to control the direction they take and ensure further science fiction ridicule. Thus the topics the X-Files covers are officially sanctioned as acceptable and being directed. What the show refuses to dive into might be more interesting to note.

       Hmm I have not seen it. I remember the 90's one mostly focused on Alien invasions so it was more a for fun show that makes conspiracy theorist look like nuts. If the conspiracies in the new one are more realistic then yeah that makes me wonder about the intentions of the show.

       As far as the theory it's to encourage revolt. That has been a big theme in media in recent years. Just look at the movies aimed at the youth. Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze runner, etc. A lot of them involve some kind of revolution at some point.

       Eh, kinda. It hinted at bigger machinations than just aliens. And yeah the medi everywhere have been suggesting it. And I highly suggest you check the new one out. It expands on the alien deal and goes in detail at the machinations that were hinted at.

       with mistrust of the government at an all time high, congressional approval rating at 13%,  and an increasingly growing poor and angry class the idea of conspiracy theories has entered into the realm of pop culture.  its no surprise that a show like x files would do well right now.  it hits home with a lot of people.  particularly the joe average people that have a small inkling  of whats going on.  this show will do their thinking and some research for them.  people like it when they dont have to think.

       Watched it tonight and thought it was great.  Tad's mini-speech stood out in particular.  I already know the contents of what he was talking about but it was his "it will start on a Friday" that caught my attention because of an advertisement I saw several times during the Panthers-Cardinals game: the upcoming
       <em>
        Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice
       </em>
       movie is due for opening on March 25th in the U.S., which is a Friday.  Why is that relevant?  Because I remembered the scene in the Will Smith movie,
       <em>
        I Am Legend
       </em>
       when it showed this:
       <a href="http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/i-am-legend-batman-superman.jpg">
        http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/i-am-legend-batman-superman.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more than likely nothing, but if shit does indeed go down on March 25th, I want you to remember that you heard it here first.  ;)

       it always starts on a friday.  because markets are closed and people unplug/ don't pay as much attention to the news over the weekend.

       This goes on in blockbuster movies also. Check out the plots to "iron man 3" and "winter soldier". Not exactly subtle anymore, are they? 
They want a revolt.  And they will get one. Things are getting close to snapping point.

       No one wants a revolt. The writers of the movies are using post-9/11 message board conspiracies and bringing them into the mainstream market. Probably because they are all out of original ideas.

       No denying that their creativity is running short. But there is lots of less controversial material to pilfer.  Why make movies out of corny comic book heroes, but then have these provoking undercurrents, that raise doubt and suspicion in even the most drowsy people.

       X-files along with another long list of shows that hit a little to close to home, similpy equal plausible denie ability. Discredit the idea by inserting said idea as a plot in a television (program). Now if some one was to believe the idea BOOM idea shut down by less informed people, They will believe your idea came from the show, instead of the original being true

       I didn't get this at all, to me it was more of a 'soft disclosure' to get these ideas out to the masses. Think about it, I mean it aired immediately after the NFC championships. The original X-files always beat around the bush about these sort of topics but in the first 10-15mn you get it all laid out in a very cogent manner.

       I watched it with the same friend I watched the originals with. (F...I am getting oooold)  I love that they crammed the show full real data. I don't like the speed and the spin. It feels very much like a whitewashing and minimisation.  But we shall keepwat hing and see what happens. The friend who I was watching with was a field investigator for mufon back before they got totally co-opted. I think we will be rewatching this and then dissecting it. Will report back.

       I just got into the x files a few months ago, I just finished it.  I thought it was great!  It reminded me of Stargate SG1.  There were actually a lot of the same actors in both.  But I look at them as dispersing hints of truth, so then when something does seem to come to light, it can be blamed on the show.  "You're crazy, that doesn't happen in real life, that was on that tv show!" but IRL maybe it went the other around.

       Nice to see the gang back togeter! Still watch the original on Netflicks.. It will be interesting to see where Chris Carter spins this in just six episodes? So far it reminds me of a Infowars rant but I will remain open minded.

       I don't think every organisation is controlled by the bad guys. I'm sure some TV and film can come from the good guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as how the bad guys will leak shit to get into our minds so can the good guys. In either case they might not realise it's true but they've open it as a possibility even if fake.

       careful, they also want you to talk about it, so they can identify you as a dissident. big brother sometimes does things that you don't like, but it's for your own good. They are winning, not because they are corrupt and abusing power, but because they are committed and they clearly see the end goal. God himself was threatened by this before, why was it evil? I don't think it was evil.

       I just cant wrap my head around why TPTB would want people thinking about the things they brought up in this show. I mean sure it could be wrapping truth in the ridicule of the fiction of a TV show, but if they're actually revealing at least some truth, it seems like they're shooting themselves in the foot.

       Also, it was a way to get people to buy the whole season on amazon video streaming, with the temptation of a theme of government disclosure.  However, instead then they did a cheapshot bait and switch, going for 'cheap' creature feature episodes culminating in episode 3, a lame attempt to parody Grimm and being somehow
       <em>
        worse and more cringeworthy
       </em>
       .  So now that amazon has my money, I am seriously considering asking for it back, telling them that pilot episode was so different from the other episodes that it might as well be a different show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll report back if they allow it.

       Just watched the episode its just too good. The intro monologue + opener alone gave my an orgasm.
Scully still hot and Mulder still burning for the Truth. Even Joel
Mchale as Alex Jones was good.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need more than 6 Episodes. Sheeple need to see the Thruth. Even if they think its fiction it still works and provokes thought. Its the ultimate call for the search for Truth. Every last one of us has to become Mulder or Scully.
