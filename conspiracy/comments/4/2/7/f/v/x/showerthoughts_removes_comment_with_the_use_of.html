        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-01-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/StonedJaguar.html">StonedJaguar</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was recently a post in the Showerthoughts subreddit about how Eminem cusses in his rap lyrics and has a more mentally stable child compared to Will Smith who does not cuss in his rap lyrics and has less mentally stable children.</p>

<p>There was a post about how Jada Pinkett Smith was a poor/weird mother. I then said Jada was a strong black woman when she used to associate herself with 2pac. That brought a lot of backlash.</p>

<p>In one of my comments people were bashing on 2pac&#39;s character. I then responded by saying &quot;2pac was loved by nearly everyone. He had a lot of friends in the Music Industry (except for the record label &quot;Bad Boy&quot;), Hollywood, and the fashion industry. He was hated by the Establishment.</p>

<p>The crazy part is that there were other posts under my main comment I thought were worse and deserved removing, but that particular comment involving the use of the term &quot;The Establishment&quot; was deleted. Maybe it was the content in my post, maybe they wanted to control the narrative. I do not know. Regardless it was deleted</p>

<p>I came to the realization, there are people within Reddit(even within this Subreddit) destroying the dissemination of information, true information that no longer falls in the Realm of imagination or to many conspiracy. All I can say is that everyone should follow the principles of not having fear or death of poverty. It will stop from commenting on what society needs the most, the truth. </p>

<p>It was once said the war of the future would not be with guns in battlefields, but a war of information. That war is happening now, and we are the warriors to help bring light to the lies being told the unaware masses. Keep fighting to spread the real truth and destroying manufactured lies to the masses. I will end this by saying.</p>

<p>I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees.</p>

<p>Peace and love to everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kept reading and agree with the last two paragraphs. I don&#39;t think the points about the rappers were appropriate to this venue unless you want to get into Illuminati, Cabbalists, and Satanists. The stuff you were spouting was more like fan-boy observation as meaningful as floating dust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know how 2pac did it, but his lyrics pushed me to seek the truth and expose it. In his lyrics he discussed the very issues we are experiencing today. I would not be going down the path I am going down if it was not for him. But at the same time I acknowledge I could be a fan-boy and not even know it. or how about this, I am a fanboy. But being a fanboy led me to the stating of those last two paragraphs, so good or bad? Was the context relevant? I dont know but at the end of the day i expressed my thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth is truth no matter the source but when you start with multiple rapper names you will usually get dismissed pretty fast. It would be better to quote a few of those lines. In this way we&#39;ll see if you are on a good path. Believe me these people will let you know, usually not to gentle, and the worst treatment will be received when you do expose the beasts in the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, try this. Quote a line from Tupac but ask people what great philosopher said it. My problem with rap is the excessive bragging. I suggest that the producers throwing money at these guys have a different agenda of division not unity. At such point as Ebonics become indistinguishable from English, or the lifestyle described in the &quot;song&quot; becomes too foreign, almost alien, people posing in convertible Cadillacs, women as whores, foul violent imagery, they lose me completely, and that&#39;s by design. </p>

<p>We are not a big sub, but our technology is a new open source money which may eventually threaten a lot of powerful people.  I&#39;m definitely a real person, and as long as I am a mod, I&#39;ll try to encourage open discourse about our currency and how it relates to the world.  </p>
