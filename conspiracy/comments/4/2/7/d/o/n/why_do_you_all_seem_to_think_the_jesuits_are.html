        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not here to argue with anyone, I am just genuinely curious as to why a great number of people have collectively agreed that the Jesuits are some sinister cult. I have seen a number of videos and the like upon Jesuit conspiracy theories, even one recently posted that involved a Yale grad and World Bank staffer. I realize that someone with an impressive resume can carry a lot of weight with their words, but to regrettably use the word I see thrown around here so often, they seemed like a &quot;shill&quot;. </p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I am not a practicing Catholic or anything like that, but I have spent the last half of my life in Jesuit schooling. I understand that many of you are thoroughly convinced of this matter, so I wanted to hear what sort of solid proof that the same people that ran my high school, undergraduate, and law school are a power-hungry and nefarious bunch bent upon world domination and absolute control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I obviously wasn&#39;t educated about them to the extent you seem to know, but they still taught us about failed attempts at assimilating indigenous populations in South America and Asia that ended up badly for all parties involved. I&#39;ll have to take a look at more of what you linked, but Catholicism has a pretty bad rap in general for trying forceful conversion...so that&#39;s kind of par for the course for pre-20th century, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>Not really, because that&#39;s not their only job. Yeah, converting people is a part of it, but a cover for their more profitable jobs. Like I said, they are their to protect the Vatican/Holy Roman Empire&#39;s supremacy, at any/all costs. They are still at it today. The interesting part is, the current Pope is the first Jesuit Pope. I find that very interesting, for many reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I finished the two articles you linked, and it didn&#39;t really jive with what you seemed like you were attempting to convey. I&#39;m not denying that there were disputes or allegations regarding the Jesuits; however, the second article stated pretty plainly that their suppression and conflicts arise primarily out of a cultural shift to secularism and a disdain for foreign and religious groups gaining favor with the local population. Even when they were originally suppressed, the investigator said the reason for this was because they were close with whoever were the suspected assassins, which isn&#39;t very damning since they don&#39;t actually know who the perpetrators were and at best the Jesuits were a 3rd party to it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying what you claim isn&#39;t possible, what you have presented just isn&#39;t very persuasive in my opinion -- there&#39;s a lot of conjecture going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are literally wrong about that.  Several of us here have posted many times about Jesuits and the freemason connection to the Vatican and international intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>edit2: hah this got downvoted ad TL;DR</p>

<hr/>

<p>And yes, I believe it.  The current pope <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis">Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio)</a> was the highmost Society of Jesus / Jesuit aka Superior General aka &#39;black pope&#39; (see &#39;previous post&#39;: &quot;Provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina (1973–79)&quot;) and now he&#39;s the White pope, which is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3wc3e2/did_you_know_pope_francis_is_the_first_black_pope/">unprecedented in history.</a>  This fact, of course, says nothing on its own.  However, let&#39;s put it into context.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus">Jesuits</a>, whom you almost never hear about, are explained away by Catholics (I was catholic for 18 yrs) with the trite explanation that they are the &#39;military branch&#39; and &#39;outreach branch&#39; and &#39;missionary branch&#39; of the Catholic Church.  What&#39;s a military branch, you might ask?</p>

<p>The Jesuitical history goes back to founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola">Ignatius de Loyola</a> who emerged in the counter-reformation of the catholic church to combat the protestant reformation (to destroy the protestant church), thus starting a long lineage of relgious spycraft that would continue a cat and mouse game of assassins, intrigues, secret societies to fight secret societies, false flaggotry and world chessboard statecraft with covert agents embedded within political offices underpinning key decisionmaking.</p>

<p>In order to bury the connections between the church and state so either would be blameless and unquestionable, there needed to be a certain amount of anonymity to create plausible deniability.  That anonymity was created through secret societies; speaking strictly about the Vatican, it was through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller#cite_note-autogenerated1-4">Knights Hospitallier</a>, which became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_John_(disambiguation">Order of St. John</a>), then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta">Knights of Malta</a>,  ultimately <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_masonsknightstemplar05.htm">the Knights Templar</a>.  Templars controlled Jerusalem for a time, were privateers, fabulously rich upperclass elites and were <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3wmoe5/the_greatest_story_never_told_what_the_practice/">the alchemists</a> an activity for which--among other things such as worshipping baphoment and harboring the mummified head of John the Baptist--they were <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3sr8p6/knights_of_malta_being_founded_in_1113/">burned at the stake by King Philip IV</a>.</p>

<p>Those alchemist templars who escaped persecution continued on to found the Rosicrucian order, upon which the Freemasony is based.  The rest is history.</p>

<p>Freemasonry network&#39;s ultimately grew in strength and popularity, incorporating occultic ideas from Blavatsky&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy">Theosophy</a> and Ordo Templi Orientalis OTO or Aleister Crowley&#39;s esotericism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">Thelema</a> to some degree (&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&quot;), although I believe Crowley&#39;s purported influence to be greatly exaggerated in freemasonry.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, Freemasonry now--as in 21st century--represents the ecclectic admixture of many different occultic traditions from mystery schools of Egypt, Rome, Greece, Babyonian, Zoroastrian, Manichean, Buddhist, Islamic, Judaean mythologies, traditions and mysteries, most notably that of the Kabbalah, Essenes, Eleusinian, Orphic, Delphinian, Alexandrian and Mithraic mystery traditions; brought into a modern occultic framework of Sacred Geometry, Numerology, Astrology, Astrotheology, Platonic Metaphysics, Alchemy, Kabbalism, Demonology, Paganism (Herbalism and Witchcraft (western shamanism), Semiotics, Mythology, and Transcendental / Transpersonal / Archetypal Jungial Psychology and consciousness work; taken together as one thing we can put under one unifying umbrella of <strong><em>Gnosticism.</em></strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So in this way, <em>Gnostics</em> have been the curators and collectors of religiousbestof teachings throughout the ages, and they eschew uncritical dogma.  This makes the study interesting, but also open to interpretative relativistic morality, which is the trap and danger of uncheked gnosticism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freemansony has since splintered into several different branches of concern and honorific designation, eventually creating an Order of the Knights of Malta for those at or above the 33rd degree of freemasonry.  Of course, I just covered about 1000+ years and a 1000 teachings in few paragraphs so its really just a gloss but I think it&#39;s mostly true.  Challenge me with citations, I love learning new things and being made wrong about stuff somtimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It really boils down to the fact that there are really only 3 basic players on earth at any one time.  The Church, the Crown and the People.  The People always lose, except when they win (french revolution, american revolution), and it&#39;s usually very ugly.  The Crown and Church are perennial frenemies: they are locked in battle, but join forces against the people until equilibrium is reached or violence happens with a clear winner or two losers for a time.  For example, the athiest, socialist countries (Russia) and some dictatorships represents the People, whereas the UK, Canada, Saudis and colonies represent the Crown; and free-market republics so-called &quot;democracies&quot; are actually controlled by the Church, primarily, except in an illiberal democracy with an internationally-coordinated intelligence community in US and in UK (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes#Future_enlargement">nine eyes</a></em>) in which case it&#39;s being run by both Church and Monarchy against the People, as it is the case in the USA today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The freemasons use the symbol of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cross+and+crown+of+freemasonry&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=709&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVr4Da9b7KAhXB9h4KHRxXCRAQ_AUIBigB#safe=off&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=cross+and+crown+in+hoc+signio+vinces&amp;amp;imgrc=_">cross through the crown</a> as the symbol of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar_(Freemasonry">Knights Templar Freemasons</a>), <em>an indication of the two loyalties they have.  Note that the third player, the People, is absent.</em>  </p>

<p>Note also that wikipedia says that they derive this name from borrowing, but <em>does not claim a direct lineal descent from the original Templar order.</em>  But the problem is, I just did show a lineage, if not by bloodline or organization but by beliefs and gnostic teachings.  It really doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s not like people are vampires that live forever so you can put two people 1000 yrs apart in the same room and call it a crime.  No, people &quot;reboot&quot; things, just like JJ Abrams rebooted star wars and star trek, but what you end up with is a lineage of ideology, motivation and thinking....</p>

<p>If you have doubts about who the freemasons are, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2yltg6/question_are_there_any_good_conspiracy_theories/cpbahfc">read this post.</a>.  Maverick conspiracy researcher, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3wc0lx/mae_brussell_on_knights_of_malta_the_actual_world/">Mae Brussell, spelled out who the knights of malta are in the modern era and their activities in assassinations of JFK</a> and others. 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/40sqmd/how_the_cia_over_threw_the_united_states_of/cyxc89p">Extending Mae Brussell&#39;s work and my own research on reddit and books, I made this comment that goes into detail on how Knights of Malta are involved in intelligence via freemasonic network.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>So you may ask: why?  Why would a pope create or allow the creation of a sinister alchemy based secret society to flourish?  Answer: to control the bad guys by running them.  Putting them to use.  Getting the freemason network to inculcate Protestants (Catholics, NOT allowed in freemasonry)...so baptists, check, episcopal, check, anglican, check...etc.    They join thinking they are going to do good in the world, creating burn wards for children and building shrine hospitals.  They do, in fact, do a lot of charity work to throw people&#39;s attention off their more sinister things in which they engage at higher levels in the degrees of freemasonry (controlling demons through rites and rituals), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_Child_Identification_Programs">siphon off unclaimed children</a> through shriner hospitals to elite pedo networks,  and supply the world with heroin they get us to pay taxes to protect via the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Politics-Heroin-Complicity-Global/dp/1556524838">marines in poppy fields in afghanistan.</a>.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s that all about then, trying to pervert Protestants...is the Vatican pulling a massive 500 yr psyop-spyop to get Protestants to go to hell or come back to the church, while all the while doing these terrible things?  Answer: yes.  </p>

<p>Why?  Well because maybe the Catholic church is not what you think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So have you actually looked at the history of those guys?</p>

<p>So what you went to a Jesuit school that doesnt mean anything.</p>

<p>Do you find it interesting that Francis is a black pope?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was taught their history while in attendance at my high school and undergrad. I also mentioned that I have read, watched, and looked into a number of supposed proofs posted on this subreddit regarding them. </p>

<p>I asked if anyone had solid proof or a reason to mention on why they are so sold on this idea, thanks for passively attacking me and reminding me that I&#39;m not an expert solely because I went to Jesuit school -- I already said that myself.</p>

<p>Regarding the black pope, why does it matter whatsoever that he&#39;s Jesuit? The Jesuits are a religious organization of Catholicism, why does that make him so suspect? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not, it&#39;s AMDG. They might use LDS but it&#39;s certainly not the official motto. Also, how does a Latin phrase meaning &quot;praise to God always&quot; bear relevance to my post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is that Jesuits are very intellectual and intellectualism involves asking questions and that is anathema to conservative leaders religious or secular.  </p>

<p>The Jesuits believe in seeking knowledge and that is of course also anathema to those who prefer an uninformed and unquestioning population for easy exploitation and manipulation.  </p>

<p>The Jesuits seem to believe that one can be deeply devout to the spiritual ideas of Jesus as presented in the religious texts and seek knowledge about our physical world. Religious and political  leaders consider this dangerous to their own power.</p>

<p>*I am typing this as a non-religious asker of questions who believes good answers always lead to more questions.</p>
