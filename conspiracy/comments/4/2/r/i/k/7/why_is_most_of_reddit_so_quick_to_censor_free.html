        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t understand this - nearly every time I express a valid, provable viewpoint in a civil discussion that goes against social norm, it gets removed by the mods or I get banned. Now, I don&#39;t particularly care about this, and I&#39;m not whining (I do have a real life) - it is simply interesting to me that free thought and unpopular views seem to be discouraged on all popular Reddits. </p>

<p>In addition, I see no substantial subreddit for true philosophical quandaries or free-thinking - at least not one that has over a few hundred thousand subscribers. r/philosophy will not allow a serious philosophical discussion or free thought to take place, unless you&#39;re essentially citing existing famous philosophers. Posts are banned that are clearly in no violation of the rules, and no response is given as to why they were removed. </p>

<p>Is it possible that, at the highest levels, Reddit is controlled by the CIA or NWO agents, or that only agents can become mods in reality?</p>

<p>Please share your experiences and opinions on this. </p>

<p>(if this post gets removed, the removal in itself will be proof of my statements)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but you can&#39;t &quot;PROVE&quot; bias.  They just set up vague rules and interpret them how they please.  My issue has always been with frontpage subs, where mods rule unwieldy power.  How many mods of r/science work for monsanto and can decide on a whim to delete a comment with no accountability?  This is essentially an editorial authority for one of the most powerful media organizations in the world right now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we have to appreciate anti-censorship mods and programmers like AAT and go1dfish who have worked tirelessly around these folks to bring a semblance of transparency to an easily corruptible process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you can, but you have to do a lot of logical arguing and citing examples, and even then, it&#39;s not like proving a mathematical formula - it&#39;s more like proving a court case. And in this case, the judge works for the very biased side you&#39;re trying to prove your case against, so no matter what, you lose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is owned by marxists. Everyone on the left censors anything that hurts their feelings. Reddit’s purpose is to destroy freedom of speech. How do you not comprehend this?</p>

<p>You can be banned at any time for saying something. You can be SHADOWbanned at any time for saying something. You can have your subreddit deleted because the admins don’t like it. You can have your comments deleted any any time for saying something.</p>

<p>Your ABILITY TO POST AT ALL is predicated on what other people think, not on truth. People can downvote you so much that a timer kicks in on your account and you can’t post for ten fucking minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a gem from u/boundlessmind8 that got past the new world order and cia: </p>

<p>(Reply on AskReddit to &quot;what conspiracy do you think you have solved?&quot;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grey Aliens. They are not aliens, or demons, or extra-anything. They were created by the CIA or a joint multinational agency through genetic engineering to ensure that our elite rulers have complete control. Any depiction of them as anything but our own creation is false. There will be a false flag integration or invasion sometime in the future. 
Be wary, and on your guard. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like it. More believable than aliens, more sinister, cant be disproven. But obviously false, since our elite rulers didnt delete it and brainwash you.</p>

<p>Agreed, I&#39;m banned from there too. I got a warning once because my comment wasn&#39;t &quot;long enough&quot;. So I started giving long thought out comments, and I got banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but there is also no way to promote your subreddit to a massive audience (promotion is considered spam, and will get you banned almost everywhere online)- unless, of course, you make it a default subreddit, for which you would have to control Reddit itself. </p>

<p>Edit: My point is that you can clearly see controls in place that effectively prevent free thinkers with revolutionary opinions from reaching a wide audience.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...this is technically a conspiracy subreddit - not a free-thinking subreddit. There is a difference. The stigma surrounding the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; is what keeps this subreddit from having millions upon millions of followers. </p>

<p>Having just come to Reddit, I am utterly shocked that there isn&#39;t a &#39;newideas&#39; subreddit or similar with a gazillion followers. Complete freedom of expression should be a given on a site like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s not correct and it reads as anti-semitic.  I know some jews and they aren&#39;t going around shilling.  In fact I know for certain that it&#39;s some veteran mormons that are shilling.   But you see how that&#39;s offensive also, because it&#39;s like I&#39;m saying all mormons are a big problem.  No.  The problem is the bad elements of the international intelligence agencies (cia, mossad, mi5, isi, sis, etc) of which many are mormons AND freemasons AND Veterans.</p>

<p>It&#39;s veterans. Its mormons.  It&#39;s people doing their job.  People being paid to do a bad job.  The &#39;outsourced&#39; agents.  Our whole military is a task utility contractor for kings and popes.</p>

<p>Their job is to come here and fight the truth and the soldiers that make up this army feel justified because their superiors are war heros and veterans working from some social media battlestation in salt lake city--since they are veterans, they feel they are just doing their job, which is to follow orders, which is what they were trained to do.</p>

<p>The problem is you have to go higher up.  What&#39;s higher up?  Potus.  Beyond that?  The crown, intenrational bankers and bilderberg members who have much more money and power than Obama.  Kissinger very likely has much more power than Obama.  (boy how I&#39;d like to see them duke it out!).  Beyond that, spies have more power because they are independent, anonymous agents culled from and working through secret society network connections, and because of that, they protect each other (jesuits, knights of malta freemasons).  </p>

<p>Above the secrecy networks is the Pope and the Ruling class (ivy league, ceos, kings, bankers).  It&#39;s not about Jews, or even Zion.  Yes they control the media but they aren&#39;t making the content...that&#39;s coming from higher up.  Because they can be assassinated on the pope&#39;s or the queen&#39;s or david rockefeller&#39;s, kissinger&#39;s or the king of saudi arabia&#39;s word at any moment, they aren&#39;t the actual root of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the people online are liberals (sitting at their desks trying to find a way to be heroes in order to gratify their basic emotions and to bolster their image while they drone on for their masters) following their religious doctrine set forth by corporate foundations. They think they are saving the world and helping every immigrant and sexual deviant find god in the holy lands of the West. And this site is owned by a holy organization, in terms of being an innovator and contributor, that promotes censorship of unholy expression or anything free of the status quo. This site is a gathering of corporate churches and their followers. And then there is the paid slanderer who runs around arguing worthless ideas backed by righteous indignation. These are the zealots.</p>

<p>What people don&#39;t understand is that we are making Zero progress as a human race, biologically and socially. And this is for a reason. </p>

<p>The ruling elite want to manufacture consent so they use good causes to cover up their crimes of social engineering for the purpose of control and distraction. This site is just a small cog in the vast war machine. A war of world resources and world power and a war of economic sustainability. </p>

<p>And then there is the biological factor. They want lower wages and more workers with less intellect. So naturally they promote the import of savages and superstitious groups and call it diversity. They also convince people that miscegenation is good in order to dilute the gene pool and further provide the masses with those basic emotional satisfactions of being progressive and helpful while simultaneously destroying national unity and any chance for rebellion.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t just a victim of misunderstanding and ignorance, you&#39;re a victim of manipulated surroundings. These clergymen and useful idiots and zealots are the same as they&#39;ve always been, only it&#39;s been transferred to the internet instead of the local church and their message has changed with regards to the cultural value system of many groups. This is a meeting place for the various foundations and their flocks to ensure the survival of that which keeps the ruling class in power.</p>

<p>I find it amusing that people believe that we are making progress while everything else on the planet in terms of humanity has stayed exactly the same for thousands of years. We are still killing each other and being greedy. But somehow, our foundations and charities are making a difference. The same foundations backed by corporations that profit on the war waged by the same countries that presume they are enlightened. The same foundations that pocket that charity money and use it to buy influence or hide their money from taxes.</p>

<p>Greed and death blanketed in hope and love. It&#39;s all the same old story. We are still living in the age of the crusades.</p>

<p>The internet is not immune to this. It&#39;s just another platform for corporations to give their sermons.</p>
