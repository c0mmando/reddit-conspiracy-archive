       I don't understand this - nearly every time I express a valid, provable viewpoint in a civil discussion that goes against social norm, it gets removed by the mods or I get banned. Now, I don't particularly care about this, and I'm not whining (I do have a real life) - it is simply interesting to me that free thought and unpopular views seem to be discouraged on all popular Reddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, I see no substantial subreddit for true philosophical quandaries or free-thinking - at least not one that has over a few hundred thousand subscribers. r/philosophy will not allow a serious philosophical discussion or free thought to take place, unless you're essentially citing existing famous philosophers. Posts are banned that are clearly in no violation of the rules, and no response is given as to why they were removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that, at the highest levels, Reddit is controlled by the CIA or NWO agents, or that only agents can become mods in reality?

       Please share your experiences and opinions on this.

       this is worrisome in r/philosophy, but even more worrisome in r/science, which will remove comments (using citations) that question the official narrative, while leaving comments without citations that affirm.

       There should be a rule for mods to be completely unbiased, if there isn't one already - but alas, there isn't even an official r/suggestions  or r/sitesuggestions to propose this idea. The subs exist, but they are unoffficial and have an unbelievably low number of subscriptions.

       but you can't "PROVE" bias.  They just set up vague rules and interpret them how they please.  My issue has always been with frontpage subs, where mods rule unwieldy power.  How many mods of r/science work for monsanto and can decide on a whim to delete a comment with no accountability?  This is essentially an editorial authority for one of the most powerful media organizations in the world right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we have to appreciate anti-censorship mods and programmers like AAT and go1dfish who have worked tirelessly around these folks to bring a semblance of transparency to an easily corruptible process.

       The problem is mods of subreddits feel like they own the subreddit. I've gotten into arguments with multiple mods about this. They believe they can do whatever they want; and to an extent they can but they often over step their interpretation based on their own ideas and beliefs.

       Well, you can, but you have to do a lot of logical arguing and citing examples, and even then, it's not like proving a mathematical formula - it's more like proving a court case. And in this case, the judge works for the very biased side you're trying to prove your case against, so no matter what, you lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is truly sad to see people with new ideas being driven out of the mainstream online media and into the deep web, where they usually get swallowed up or overshadowed by the mass of shit and falsity that exists there.

       not at all.  r/science doesn't tell you which mod deleted your comment.  the mods don't want to discuss in public/ transparent forum- they tell you to "message the mods".  you're in their world and you play by their rules.

       If you stick around in this sub for any length of time you will see all sorts of posts about how most of the big subs are ridiculously censored. It's no surprise; reddit is a huge website. Mod accts are bought and sold(people have posted PM offers here before) and you can google "upvotes for sale" for days.

       Reddit, perhaps to a lesser extent than Wikipedia, is controlled by "shill mentality." Of course there are actual paid shills, with their

       , but many people who have been indoctrinated into a given field will freely volunteer their time to uphold the status quo, neutralizing anyone skeptical of the "official explanation" with a barrage of ad hominem attacks. They have come to identify so much with this "knowledge" that they have been required to memorize, that it replaces free thought. When someone questions this indoctrination, they are attacking these people's very sense of existence.

       I'd suggest you read or listen to some Chomsky.  The best propagandists aren't agents or shills, but true believers.  They aren't generally working for the NWO or anything specifically, but their worldviews and habits of expressions are aligned with the NWO approved intellectual truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And reddit has gotten big enough that it might have some direct NWO type influence coming from the top.  It's a major global media hub, and is important for influencing minds the world over.

       It's funny, because Noam Chomsky is a complete shill. Of course, he is perfectly willing to talk about "manufactured consent" while strategically avoiding the issue of who exactly is manufacturing it. Have you seen him talk (or, rather, avoid talking about) 9/11?

       Reddit is owned by marxists. Everyone on the left censors anything that hurts their feelings. Reddit’s purpose is to destroy freedom of speech. How do you not comprehend this?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be banned at any time for saying something. You can be SHADOWbanned at any time for saying something. You can have your subreddit deleted because the admins don’t like it. You can have your comments deleted any any time for saying something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ABILITY TO POST AT ALL is predicated on what other people think, not on truth. People can downvote you so much that a timer kicks in on your account and you can’t post for ten fucking minutes.

      </p>
      <p>
       (Reply on AskReddit to "what conspiracy do you think you have solved?")
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Grey Aliens. They are not aliens, or demons, or extra-anything. They were created by the CIA or a joint multinational agency through genetic engineering to ensure that our elite rulers have complete control. Any depiction of them as anything but our own creation is false. There will be a false flag integration or invasion sometime in the future. 
Be wary, and on your guard.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I like it. More believable than aliens, more sinister, cant be disproven. But obviously false, since our elite rulers didnt delete it and brainwash you.

       I don't bother contributing my alternative views on Reddit due to the feverent backlash I see so often towards others on here that try to offer "unconventional" information. And as was noted, downvoting because you disagree is against the official posting terms, yet it is widely practiced to suppress. Shame.

       True, but there is also no way to promote your subreddit to a massive audience (promotion is considered spam, and will get you banned almost everywhere online)- unless, of course, you make it a default subreddit, for which you would have to control Reddit itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: My point is that you can clearly see controls in place that effectively prevent free thinkers with revolutionary opinions from reaching a wide audience.

       ...this is technically a conspiracy subreddit - not a free-thinking subreddit. There is a difference. The stigma surrounding the word 'conspiracy' is what keeps this subreddit from having millions upon millions of followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having just come to Reddit, I am utterly shocked that there isn't a 'newideas' subreddit or similar with a gazillion followers. Complete freedom of expression should be a given on a site like this.

       It's because when people assign their entire identity to something, they will defend it to the bitter end. Science is becoming more of a dogmatic religion more than anything nowadays.

       That's because it's not correct and it reads as anti-semitic.  I know some jews and they aren't going around shilling.  In fact I know for certain that it's some veteran mormons that are shilling.   But you see how that's offensive also, because it's like I'm saying all mormons are a big problem.  No.  The problem is the bad elements of the international intelligence agencies (cia, mossad, mi5, isi, sis, etc) of which many are mormons AND freemasons AND Veterans.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's veterans. Its mormons.  It's people doing their job.  People being paid to do a bad job.  The 'outsourced' agents.  Our whole military is a task utility contractor for kings and popes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their job is to come here and fight the truth and the soldiers that make up this army feel justified because their superiors are war heros and veterans working from some social media battlestation in salt lake city--since they are veterans, they feel they are just doing their job, which is to follow orders, which is what they were trained to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is you have to go higher up.  What's higher up?  Potus.  Beyond that?  The crown, intenrational bankers and bilderberg members who have much more money and power than Obama.  Kissinger very likely has much more power than Obama.  (boy how I'd like to see them duke it out!).  Beyond that, spies have more power because they are independent, anonymous agents culled from and working through secret society network connections, and because of that, they protect each other (jesuits, knights of malta freemasons).
      </p>
      <p>
       Above the secrecy networks is the Pope and the Ruling class (ivy league, ceos, kings, bankers).  It's not about Jews, or even Zion.  Yes they control the media but they aren't making the content...that's coming from higher up.  Because they can be assassinated on the pope's or the queen's or david rockefeller's, kissinger's or the king of saudi arabia's word at any moment, they aren't the actual root of the problem.

       Most of the people online are liberals (sitting at their desks trying to find a way to be heroes in order to gratify their basic emotions and to bolster their image while they drone on for their masters) following their religious doctrine set forth by corporate foundations. They think they are saving the world and helping every immigrant and sexual deviant find god in the holy lands of the West. And this site is owned by a holy organization, in terms of being an innovator and contributor, that promotes censorship of unholy expression or anything free of the status quo. This site is a gathering of corporate churches and their followers. And then there is the paid slanderer who runs around arguing worthless ideas backed by righteous indignation. These are the zealots.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people don't understand is that we are making Zero progress as a human race, biologically and socially. And this is for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ruling elite want to manufacture consent so they use good causes to cover up their crimes of social engineering for the purpose of control and distraction. This site is just a small cog in the vast war machine. A war of world resources and world power and a war of economic sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there is the biological factor. They want lower wages and more workers with less intellect. So naturally they promote the import of savages and superstitious groups and call it diversity. They also convince people that miscegenation is good in order to dilute the gene pool and further provide the masses with those basic emotional satisfactions of being progressive and helpful while simultaneously destroying national unity and any chance for rebellion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't just a victim of misunderstanding and ignorance, you're a victim of manipulated surroundings. These clergymen and useful idiots and zealots are the same as they've always been, only it's been transferred to the internet instead of the local church and their message has changed with regards to the cultural value system of many groups. This is a meeting place for the various foundations and their flocks to ensure the survival of that which keeps the ruling class in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it amusing that people believe that we are making progress while everything else on the planet in terms of humanity has stayed exactly the same for thousands of years. We are still killing each other and being greedy. But somehow, our foundations and charities are making a difference. The same foundations backed by corporations that profit on the war waged by the same countries that presume they are enlightened. The same foundations that pocket that charity money and use it to buy influence or hide their money from taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greed and death blanketed in hope and love. It's all the same old story. We are still living in the age of the crusades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is not immune to this. It's just another platform for corporations to give their sermons.

       I really don't want to start this here (the mods should also be kind enough to reply personally to the message I sent them), but the post you are referring to actually didn't even break rule number one. It was a serious discussion with serious arguments and spawned fruitful, civil interaction between members. It looks to me like the moderation is biased against my statements, or has an agenda - but again, I really don't want to have this discussion in the middle of this comment section, as it is a personal matter and too far off-topic.
