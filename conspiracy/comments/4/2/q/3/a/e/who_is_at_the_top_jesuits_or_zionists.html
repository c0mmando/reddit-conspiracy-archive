        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A disclaimer, not all Jews are Zionists, and many innocent Jewish people have been harmed by this conspiracy same as other groups of people. I support all good people regardless of what group they are. Here is my question.</p>

<p>At the center of this conspiracy is the Talmudic, Babylonian, Satanic world view, which can be tied to Zionist Jews because the Talmud is a Jewish book that I believe was based on oral traditions passed down from when the Jews were in Babylon. So it&#39;s easy to trace the Talmud and Babylon to Zionism.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s also the documented fact that Zionist Jews in Great Britain, and some British non-Jews who wanted Zionism, supported Zionism. Some Jews supported it because they wanted to claim Israel, and the British wanted &quot;agents&quot; in the region who would be pro-Britain and give Britain control over the Suez canal.</p>

<p>So when people talk about the European monarchies being part of the conspiracy, it&#39;s easy to tie them to Zionism as well, at least the British and I assume others through the British.</p>

<p>But then there are these other claims people make that it&#39;s really the Jesuits at the top of the conspiracy, not Zionists, even though those people also say the Jesuits aren&#39;t Christian, they&#39;re Satanic, Talmudic, Babylonian.</p>

<p>So my question is, how? We can tie Zionism to the Talmud because it&#39;s a Jewish book. But how would the Jesuits have become Talmudic outside of being taken over by the Zionists, in which case Zionism would still be pulling the strings? There is no Christian or Catholic book that I know of similar to the Talmud that you could find in Catholic churches like you find the Talmud in Synagogues. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also heard people say the Jewish encyclopedia says the Rothschilds are the Guardians of the Vatican bank, which they say means they have to work for the Vatican. But that could just as easily mean the Rothschilds control the Vatican through their money supply, so it&#39;s still Zionism at the top. Why would the Jesuits let a Jewish family control their money supply unless the Jesuits were also taken over by Zionist Jews, or unless the Rothschilds weren&#39;t actually Jewish?</p>

<p>See what I&#39;m getting at? These talking points from both sides of the debate that &quot;The Rothschilds are the bankers for the Vatican, so... (and then substitute in either that means the Vatican controls them, or that they control the Vatican)&quot; are extremely shallow. There has to be better research out there available than that. </p>

<p>And what about Ignatius Loyola? I read that he was a crypto Jew, and also that the Borgias were crypto Jews, and that a Borgia and Loyola founded the Jesuits. If that&#39;s true then is the mystery solved? In the US the Zionists dominate everything, and the one counter argument to that is that the Jesuits may be above them, but if the Jesuits were also founded by Jews, then you have Jews at both sides of the equation and the mystery is solved... </p>

<p>Is it that simple or is someone going to tell me Loyola wasn&#39;t actually Jewish, or that there&#39;s something else to it? Please reference sources if you&#39;re going to make new claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re going all over the place, mate. But, you are asking good questions. The Jesuits were founded many years after the establishment of The Vatican (Holy Roman Empire). Josephus, a Jew was brought in by the Flavian&#39;s of Rome, to write the new testament (Based on the old testament), qualm the revolts/convert Jews to a docile religion, and solidify the Flavian&#39;s as Caesar status. The Father (Vespasian), the Son (Titus), and the Holy spirit, (The father Vespasian who was deceased). Much of this changed, after Mark Antony and Cleopatra&#39;s bloodline, fled Egypt, to what is known as the Britain. In this time, the Roman Empire, fell, but really didn&#39;t. They reorganized. Rome (Vatican) and now into Britain. Enter Switzerland and Knight&#39;s Templar. </p>

<p>The Jews are pawns, have always been. Depending on how you interpret the two bloodlines of Cain and Abel, one could conclude, such has been the case. The Vatican is the top of the pyramid, but below it, are some interesting people. As above, so is below ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so instead of saying the Jesuit connection to Babylon and the Talmud is from Jewish infiltration, which would have made Zionist Jews the top of the pyramid, you&#39;re saying the Babylonian connection the Jesuits comes from Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Can you give sources on how their bloodline escaped Egypt and made it to England or Rome? I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong at all but I&#39;ve read a lot about the massive Sabbattean, Zionist movement which is just a couple centuries old, and this is the first I&#39;ve heard of Cleopatra&#39;s bloodline being involved. What&#39;s more likely, a few centuries old conspiracy by a group known for nepotism, or a conspiracy carried on directly from the time of Cleopatra?</p>

<p>Also why is it in vogue, with the Hollywood movie at the Oscars now, to expose the priests pedophilia, and to make fun of Christianity all the time, but not expose any crimes committed by Zionists or Jews? And why is American banking, the Fed, and Hollywood run apparently by Jews? If the Jesuits are at the top, how do they benefit from putting so many Jews in power? They wouldn&#39;t be worried about getting turned on?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to understand the master plan and why a Zionist World Order has basically been created since WWII if it&#39;s not actually Zionists in charge. You may be right but I need way more info to understand this. It sounds like you might know the whole story, assuming you&#39;re not a disinfo agent, so please share it! Not just a two paragraph response, put the whole thing down once and for all because if you go on youtube, no one else knows the answer to this it seems. There is still massive debate about whether the Zionists or Jesuits are in control so if you actually know the history, you&#39;re one of the few. Please share it! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are living in the NWO, there&#39;s no future thing.  Or rather its just going to get more flushed out but believe me, we are in it: right now.  It&#39;s also not a Zionist thing.  There are plent of people in Israel that similarly don&#39;t know WTF is going on.    </p>

<p>I believe--and there&#39;s loads of evidence for this--that there are 2  basic competing interests--the ruling class and the Pope-- that have joined forces to fight a common enemy: the lumpen global citizen.  It&#39;s a joint effort of the ruling class (anglophone country ivy leaguers, bilderber group members, queen of england, king of saudi etc) and the Pope.  The &#39;zionists&#39; who matter (owners of the us media, controllers of the entire us phone metadata, financial bankers) are part of the ruling class; they&#39;ve seized control of the systems that literally manufacture money and move it around so of course they have it all.  Meanwhile, they get our military to &#39;liberate&#39; all the iraqi and libyan gold, which probably ends up, at the end of the day, with the Pope. It&#39;s not in fort knox, nor is it under the WTC any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going to have to challenge this. </p>

<p>You seem to be forgetting that there was a &quot;wise teacher&quot; who lead a group that followed the essential teachings of Jesus. Josephus claims to have studied under them. He usurped the teachings and co-opted them for the purposes of Rome, but that doesn&#39;t take away from the teachings themselves. </p>

<p>And this is important because the pyramid is built on the teachings which can then be used to circumvent the power structure and destroy the Catholic Church from within as was seen in the reformation. </p>

<p>The reformation just didn&#39;t remove the works of Paul as Josephus&#39;s writings had been removed before. </p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Vatican is the top of the pyramid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is wrong. Jesus is at the top and the more people can distinguish between the authority provided by Jesus and that which was usurped by the Church, the weaker the Church becomes and the stronger the individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loyola was not a Jew, and in fact he said he <em>wished he were one</em>. </p>

<p>Borgia not a Jew.</p>

<p>Alessandro Farnese not a Jew.</p>

<p>Gasparo Contarini not a Jew. </p>

<p>No one associated with the founding of the Jesuit Order was Jewish; rather they were all of Italian and Spanish lineage. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how would the Jesuits have become Talmudic </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They aren&#39;t Talmudic, rather they are masters of the occult and Kabbalah which are also tied in with Freemasonry, the latter of which the Jesuit Order took over beginning in 1753.</p>

<p>Just look at where the most important people in government are trained. You will see Jesuit Universities notably Georgetown listed as their alma mater and that includes Jews. Why is it that no far-right white supremacists talk about JINSA which is the most powerful Jewish policy group in America? I wonder if it has something to do with the head of its policy board being Jesuit-trained from Georgetown. </p>

<p>The Rothschilds were known as the guardians of the Vatican treasure and are Papal court Jews; the first Rothschild banker was a court factor for the Holy Roman Empire. They are just Masonic/Papal Knights like Jacob Rothschild is a mere Knight Bachelor OBE meaning he is below the Queen who herself is a Knight of St. John (&quot;Protestant&quot; branch of the Knights of Malta) and a member of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece which is considered the most prestigious Chivalric Order in Europe; the head of the Order of the Golden Fleece is the King of Spain and guess where he received training? Georgetown. His father, the former King Juan Carlos even claimed the title &quot;King of Jerusalem.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides modern day Israel, Jews have not ruled anywhere since the start of their diaspora and even before then,the Sanhedrin said &quot;they have no king but Caesar&quot; and to drive this point home, today the Vatican owns &gt;60% of Jerusalem since the signing of the Oslo accords. Furthermore, Israel was started by the Jesuit-controlled Labor Zionists who were in league with the Jesuit-controlled Nazis. They were ghettoized in many places in Europe including in the Papal States for over 300 years. It is also a misconception that Jews dominate finance and media. The most important bankers are Roman Catholic Gentile Knights of Malta like the heads of the New York Federal Reserve bank, which is where all of America&#39;s gold is stored. The Federal Reserve is owned by banks that are the class A stockholders and those Banks are controlled by the Knights of Malta and Jesuits, like Avro Manhattan says in his work, <em>The Vatican Billions</em> that the Jesuit are the majority shareholders in Bank of America. Manhattan also writes about how they control the Defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.</p>

<p>Given this information, it is really a no-brainer.</p>

<p>The more complicated part of this is their endgame which will see them bring forth the anti-Christ whom will be a Pope of their making.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying. I&#39;ll check out Rome Rules. I wanted to ask, I thought Protestants and the Vatican were rivals. If Queen Elizabeth is in a Protestant order, how is she in league with the Vatican?</p>

<p>Also can you give any sources about JINSA being more powerful than all the other Jewish lobbies, about the Rothschilds being subordinate to the Vatican (they run the Vatican&#39;s money and a Rothschild was quoted saying as long as he controlled the money, he controlled the monarchs and cared not who they were), and any sources that say the Jesuits controlled the labor zionists which founded Israel? I read that Britain was responsible, Jews and Protestants in Britain. And the Jesuits own 60% of Jerusalem? How?</p>

<p>You also mentioned some shareholders and someone who went to Georgetown, but how does this explain how the actual heads of the FED have all been Jewish, and how the six major media corporations are owned by Jewish people in the US, and how Hollywood is dominated by Jewish people? And I&#39;m not a white supremacist or far right wing at all. You brought some interesting information, barring the sources, but it still doesn&#39;t answer why Jews represent 0.2% of the global population but occupy 70% of high positions in the global government, or all the other points brought up my sites like this. <a href="http://renegadetribune.com/if-its-not-the-jews/">http://renegadetribune.com/if-its-not-the-jews/</a></p>

<p>And why is Catholicism ridiculed all the time in the US but not Judaism? You brought up a few instances of Jesuit power but you still haven&#39;t explained the far, far greater number of positions occupied by Jewish power. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Historically, yes. But now Protestantism is dead because of all sorts of infiltration with the World Council of Churches and these so-called Protestant churches embrace ecumenism and other doctrines of Rome. These apostate churches are the daughters of the Whore of Babylon (Roman Catholic institution) from Revelation chapter 17 and in Revelation 18:4, God calls for His people to come out of her which includes these daughter apostate churches.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Queen Elizabeth is in a Protestant order, how is she in league with the Vatican</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the Order of St. John is considered the junior branch of the more superior Knights of Malta and is recognized as such under the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem. Britain has been subject to the Jesuits since George III (and in times before then they controlled the Stuarts) and so when we see that the Order of St. John emerged from a faction of the Order of Malta and was chartered some 100 years after the reign of George III, the obvious implication is that this is an Order controlled by Rome. Thus, for all intents and purposes, QEII is a Dame of Malta. Also, as I have explained, in addition to being a Dame of Malta, QEII is is a dame of the Golden Fleece which is much more powerful than the Knights of St. John and the Sovereign Grand Master of the Illustrious Royal Order of the Golden Fleece is the Jesuit-trained King of Spain who is of the House of Bourbon; the House of Bourbon being tied in with the Farnese and other Papal nobility families. The Bourbon Kings are potential claimants to the title &quot;King of Jerusalem,&quot; and modern Israel being nothing more than the Pope&#39;s revived Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem; the Vatican owning all of the holy sites therein.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>about JINSA being more powerful than all the other Jewish lobbies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JINSA is not a lobby, it&#39;s a think-tank and policy group and its members like ﻿Richard Perle are linked to 9/11 and the Project for a New American Century. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jason Vest, writing in The Nation, alleges that JINSA, along with Frank Gaffney&#39;s Center for Security Policy, are &quot;underwritten by far-right American Zionists&quot; and both believe strongly that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#39;regime change&#39; by any means necessary in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority is an urgent imperative.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>JINSA even claims to be &quot;the most influential group on the issue of U.S.-Israel military relations.&quot; So there is no question that it is the most powerful government-interlocked Jewish policy group in the United States. </p>

<p>If you want more information on the Rothschilds being Jesuit-Vatican agents, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EXZAVWw3vg">here&#39;s a good short video</a>. It shows they are Roman Catholic and Masonic Knights and highlights how David de Rothschild was on the Alex Jones show! Ever notice how Alex Jones never talks about any of this? Lenny Bloom and Sherman Skolnick went on Alex Jones&#39;s show years ago and they were disallowed to talk about the Jesuits, Knights of Malta, Vatican, etc. Jones, who has ties to the Jesuit Sheen family won&#39;t even mention Eric Jon Phelps by name. I have heard Phelps say that Jones&#39; father-in-law is also a Knight of Malta. Is it any wonder that Jew bashers are however allowed on his show like Texe Marrs and the Pope-serving, race-war inciting, Malcolm X co-assassin and pawn to Roman Catholic priest Michael Pfleger, Louis Farrakhan!? Jones also frequently has Knight of Malta Pat Buchanan on his show. Yes, the Jesuits control the mainstream and alternative media. Fox news owner and media mogul Rupert Murdoch is a Pontifical Knight of Saint Gregory! <a href="http://jesuits.webs.com/media-control">The Jews in the media all have ties with Rome</a>; they are a bunch of Papist Jews just like the Rothschilds and also ultimately subject to the Jesuits who <a href="http://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress2/the-jesuits-and-the-order-of-malta-created-the-hollywood-film-industry/">created Hollywood</a>. Another notable example of a court Jew in media is  David L. Cohen who is the VP of Comcast and was on the planning committee for the coming of Pope Francis to Philadelphia! Cohen was trained at University of Pennsylvania; it being funded by the Jewish Annenberg Foundation which was started by Papal Knight of Saint Gregory and mobster Walter Annenberg. All of this is why the ADL&#39;s bestows the Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award, named after a Jesuit Cardinal (who was deeply involved with the Nazis, the Vatican Ratlines and the Italian Masonic P2 Lodge) who led a pretended reconciliation with the Jews. The Papist Jews understand that the Vatican and Jesuits still hate them because they are the &quot;holy people,&quot; but have struck a deal where they will be loyal in return for important positions in government, that way it works in favor of both parties and the Jesuits can have their court Jews take the heat for apparently being in control. With that said, there are many, many more government officials in my estimation who are white Roman Catholic Gentiles, then there are Jewish ones; and the ones that are Jewish are mostly Papists like Chuck Shumer and Roberta Achtenberg (the latter is Jesuit-trained out of San-Fransisco and the former constantly praises the Pope and is a member of a Masonic/secret society called the Knights of Pythias). Same goes for the federal reserve board; the board doesn&#39;t control anything; they are figure heads and PR peeopl to make it look like the Jews run the banks when like mentioned, it is the Banks who invest in the FED that are the actual owners and those banks are controlled by the Knights of Malta and Jesuits.</p>

<p>The Protocols of Zion was a Jesuit forgery ripped off from their prior writing called the <em>Secrets of the Elders of Bourg-Fontaine</em>.</p>

<p>I trust that this addresses your questions and that you can tell  I&#39;ve done the right research; it&#39;s why I have a subreddit about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response. That addresses some questions but still doesn&#39;t make sense in a complete picture to me. And as for Alex Jones, when he that Rotschild on he argued with him, it wasn&#39;t to promote him. And all indications are that Jones is funded by &quot;Ashkenazi Jews&quot; not Jesuits, at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve read.</p>

<p>But here are the big picture questions I still have. If the people doing this conspiracy are the Jesuits and &quot;Angulo-Americans&quot; as Bill Cooper puts it, why are they trying to take down America and Britain with cultural marxism? And why is the royal family in Britain always in gossip rags in the UK and being joked about, with at least one newspaper calling for the end of the monarchy? Meanwhile criticizing Judaism is not allowed in either country.</p>

<p>You can find motivation for why a Jewish elite would want to overthrow western, Christian countries. Why would the Jesuits? Why would they let Christianity be ridiculed so much in the west? And to the extent the Jesuits are involved, what have you read about their founding and who they are? Because if they were infiltrated by Marrano Jews then they&#39;d just be another wing of a Jewish Zionist conspiracy. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s where I&#39;m still confused. Where&#39;s the motivation to mess with Christian values, and promote cultural marxism (feminism, gay marriage, all anti-Christian ideologies), and to create  Israel under a Jewish banner, and to give Jews control of Hollywood and Wall Street, regardless of who founded it originally, for the Jesuits?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering about this, too. A lot of the research on Sabbateans by people like Antelman and Chamish don&#39;t really have much to say about the Jesuits, and a lot of the stuff you read about the Jesuits doesn&#39;t really have much to say about the Sabbateans (I&#39;m using the word Sabbatean here rather than Zionist, because I think it&#39;s more accurate and precise, since not all Zionists are Sabbateans). </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that there was a meeting of the minds in Frankfurt towards the end of the 18th century and some kind of alliance was formed between Weishaupt (a Jesuit and founder of the Bavarian Illuminati), Frank (Sabbatean) and Amschel Meyer Rothschild (who was a knight of Malta and probably a Sabbatean).  </p>

<p>People who favor the Sabbatean storyline will tell you that the Sabbateans infiltrated the Catholic Church (Jesuits), etc. etc. In that case, the Sabbateans are the ones who are &quot;really&quot; in power. Others will tell you that the Jesuits manipulated Shabtai Zvi and Jacob Frank. But then others will tell you that it&#39;s really all about Khazarian mafia. Oh, and don&#39;t forget about the reptilians... (-;</p>

<p>Who the fuck knows? When you start getting this deep into things, I don&#39;t think there is anyway to really &quot;know&quot; what is going or who is in power. Nor does it really matter. It&#39;s enough to realize that they want to consolidate power and all the people involved appear to adhere roughly to very ancient, occult belief systems that cannot be described as Jewish or Christian as we know it. Some would call it Satanisms, Luciferianism, occult, ancient mysteries, Magick, whatever, whatever. It involves some unimaginable sick and twisted practices. </p>

<p>Most likely, there is nobody who is &#39;really&#39; in power. Different groups and factions likely think that they have the &#39;true&#39; power or jockey amongst themselves. That is really the only thing that gives me the slightest bit of hope: that the grand conspirators are not so well organized and monolithic as we&#39;d like to think, and that it will fall apart or at least fail due to the competition between factions. On the other hand, that competition might just lead to them blowing us all to hell each other up and take the rest of us with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why it matters who is at the top. There is that Albert Pike &quot;letter&quot; about 3 wars which of course doesn&#39;t exist that anyone can prove. But if Zionists are at the top, then the letter is a deception. If they&#39;re not at the top, it may not be. This is what the letter says about Zionism.</p>

<p>&quot;The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other.&quot;</p>

<p>This goes back to the basic question of whether it&#39;s &quot;Satanists&quot; behind this who want to mutually destroy Christianity, Islam, and Judaism to bring in &quot;Lucifer&quot; or whatever, which seems ridiculous, or if it these are Talmudic Jews who want to destroy Christianity and Islam, and bring in their Talmudic Jewish Messiah, which fits much better with the Sabbattean Frankists element of this, and seems slightly less crazy, although still crazy.</p>

<p>Everything going on currently points to Talmudic Zionists running the show for the benefit of Israel and Talmudic Jewish bankers, but with David Icke exposing Zionism, Alex Jones having David Duke on and not really refuting any points he made, I wonder about what&#39;s really going on. If you also read infowars articles, the number of comments exposing Zionism the last 4 months totally skyrocketed just around the time that Obama and Bibi started having their fake fight over Iran.</p>

<p>Is this just a result of real people exposing the truth, or are the puppet masters starting to manipulate people against Israel on purpose? Of course even if they are, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s to expose Zionism and Israel, it could just be to foster a minority opposition to it and then squash it. Just because they&#39;re creating a thesis (Zionism) and antithesis (Islam or Christianity or whatever) doesn&#39;t mean the synthesis will be them turning on Israel. It could be just to use an Islamic threat as an excuse to make Israel even more powerful. They could just be trying to create more &quot;anti semitism&quot; to scare Jews around the world into supporting a more fascist Israel.</p>

<p>But this is why this is the big question. Is someone at the top with no loyalty to Israel using Israel as a pawn, with the Rothschild&#39;s help, or do they have loyalty to Israel? I mean the fact the Rothschilds are building or have built this fancy temple in Israel, why would they built something in Israel if they actually planned to destroy Israel? So ultimately I think the story makes more sense if the Rothschilds control the Vatican through its money supply, and Sabbattean Frankist Zionists infiltrated the Vatican to the extent that the Vatican is involved in any of this. But I still want to know for sure. </p>

<p>Well there&#39;s the problem. You can&#39;t even come close to knowing for sure. Maybe all these conspiracy theories are all just a smokescreen for something different. Who the hell knows? </p>

<p>I agree these are big and important questions. You know, I live in Israel, so it&#39;s actually really important for me to know whether TPTB have it in for Israel or not. Would it be safer for me and my family to move back to the US or stay here? I have come to the conclusion that there is no way of knowing, really. </p>

<p>Just one thing to point out in what you said: don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking that the &quot;Zionists&quot; as you call them, care about Israel. The Zionists you&#39;re talking about are the Sabbateans, and they don&#39;t have any special loyalty to Israel or commitment to the existence of Israel whatsoever. So as far as I&#39;m concerned both theories could lead to more or less the same conclusion. Presumably the Jesuits want the Pope to be installed at the top of the NWO hierarchy. And I guess the Sabbateans are hoping to bring the Messiah by bringing the world to evil. But both plans take us all in the same direction...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true at all. I believe the Jesuits are involved but if they were also founded by Zionist Jews, which I read Loyola and Borgia were, then it&#39;s still not Catholics at the top of &quot;the Jesuits&quot; in abstract, it&#39;s Zionists who have invaded the Jesuits.</p>

<p>So the question is, is my information about Loyola and Borgia wrong? Were they not actually crypto Jews? Is Rothschild not actually Zionist (would seem ridiculous since Rothschilds control Israel but maybe it&#39;s part of a bigger move where they will actually sacrifice Israel? I doubt it but that&#39;s what Albert Pike&#39;s probably fake three wars letter says)?</p>

<p>The real question is we can tie Zionists to the NWO, to control of the US, and to being allied with the British royalty. So on our left hand, we can tie Zionism to almost every aspect of the conspiracy. Then on our right hand, there&#39;s this one outlier, the Jesuits, who don&#39;t fit into the puzzle as easily. So the real question I&#39;m asking is how do they fit? And then I&#39;m postulating that the simplest, easiest way they would fit in the puzzle, especially if the claim of Loyola and Borgia being crypto Jews is true, would be if the Jesuits are also part of the &quot;Zionist conspiracy,&quot; that they were taken over or founded in the first place by Talmudic Jews.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s absolute fact, just the only way I can make sense of the conspiracy where the Jesuits fit so far based on what I know, and then I&#39;m asking people who have also researched this if that&#39;s true or if I&#39;m missing something, while also being wary of people posting disinfo here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t have to except plenty of people keep claiming the Jesuits run the NWO conspiracy, not Zionists or the British royal family. I&#39;m trying to understand the whole story. I think it&#39;s true the Jesuits were very evil for a long time, at least if they were responsible for the Inquisition, but then something happened with the Renaissance (what was that about anyway? Why would the Jesuits give up control like that?), and since then, instead of projecting the power of Rome and Catholicism everywhere, it&#39;s the Jews who have been growing in power in every way from Israel to the taking over wall street, Hollywood, and the FED. Unless this is a 60 year chess move by the Jesuits since WWI ended, which it could be, then it would be a lot easier to just say if everything points to Zionists at the top, if everything benefits Zionists, then it&#39;s probably them.</p>

<p>People say, when trying to solve a mystery, do these things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the money</li>
<li>Ask who benefits</li>
<li>Ask who you can&#39;t criticize to see who &quot;owns&quot; you</li>
</ol>

<p>If you follow the money, Zionists run the banking industry in the US. If you see who benefits, Zionists were given Palestine as a Jewish state, it wasn&#39;t Catholics given Palestine as a Vatican state. If you go by who you can&#39;t criticize, it&#39;s Zionists.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why this is so confusing. On its face, this is a Zionist conspiracy. But many say there&#39;s another conspiracy behind it, like the first commenter talking about Cleopatra&#39;s bloodline... I just want the truth but it&#39;s hard to know who is disinfo and who isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure the Knights of Malta is a branch of freemasonry? The freemasons have a degree that is based on the Knights of Malta the way they take names of degrees from other things, but that&#39;s different than the Vatican&#39;s Knights of Malta. Apparently the Vatican&#39;s Knights of Malta is a continuation of the Knights Hospitaller&#39;s, where Freemason was maybe a continuation of the Knights Templars? They were kind of in competition at one point but maybe not anymore.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know. To put the question another way, is Israel under Zionist rule the end game, like it is now, or is Israel going to be crossed? There&#39;s the Albert Pike 3 wars letter, which of course doesn&#39;t exist that anyone can prove, so the question is whether the Pike letter&#39;s plan is the real plan, where Israel would get crossed, or if that&#39;s just a deception to make us think Zionism isn&#39;t the end game, the top of the pyramid, when really it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to go birdseye view and then specifics.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on is there are 3 players, cross, crown and people.  The cross and crown are frenemies who sometimes join forces to suppress any uprisings from the people.   The crown or royals in this case are monarchies including the ruling class, international &#39;masters of banking and industry&#39;.  Zionism is really not a part of this because all zionism means is jews who want to take and hold Israel.  </p>

<p>At any rate, post 9/11 this royalty class and cross have gone overboard, and it has become clear they are making a power play for total world control of all citizens with this international mass surveillance effort.</p>

<p>The wars we have are just a sham so that they can sell drugs long enough to fund more supercomputers.  That&#39;s all its about.  To keep those numbers high, they make the newest jets cost just under 1T  (no, they don&#39;t really cost that much, c&#39;mon) so they can justify asking for more than that of congress.  Since people over 50 who have most of the wealth in america now are the worst generation of demoralized paranoid sissy cowards (aging neocons) disconnected with reality in the worst possible ways, they justify the system by giving tacit approval to more defense funding, despite the deep cognitive dissonance that this post 9/11 militariztion of the police and greatly enhanced intelligence community has done fuck-all for protecting us, given the monthly mass shootings ,etc.  </p>

<p>So we are building the panopticon for them that will be used to control us to a microlevel, analyzing our facial pattern for emotions and our habits and then pushing behavior modificaiton algorithms on us through apps and possibly more intrusive forms of state control.  Good job guys, you&#39;ve ruined humanity.</p>

<p>Since you asked about Jesuits, Zionists, etc.  It comes down to secret sociteies being the &#39;anonymization&#39; organizations for the activities requested of the secret society members as agents by both the cross AND the crown.  In this way, outsourcing clandestine activities to the the secret societies gives cross and crown plausible deniability by burying any leads.  Mae Brussell had very much to say about this with hours of research at her disposal.  She focused however on john foster dulles and allen dulles which she portrayed as cryptonazis but also knights of malta, which is why their behavior at the end of the day is treasonous and was ultimately against the intestest of the US</p>

<p>The dual loyalties of for example the Freemason Knights of Malta are cross and crown, but mostly cross  They are controlled by Jesuits--and the jesuits answer only to themselves but &#39;officially&#39; the Pope.  They are mercenaries, spies for hire.  Knights of Malta agents are embedded within intelligence communities to carry out clandestine extrajudicial orders--they are double agents for the church basically.  But KOM are also assassins and use the world as a chessboard, carrying out actions clearly that benefitted the crown as well (putting relgious peoples at odds to each other, when they destroy each other, a king will swoop in and claim the area with the two parties thus weakened...this is what happens so many times, but a perfect example is in Fes, Morrocco, which yes, is the city for which the hat Fez is named, which is relevant because of the Shriners in Freemasonry, a reminder of the success of guile in winning for the crown and cross.</p>

<p>Knights of Malta have a signet ring in hoc signo vinces &#39;in this sign you will conquer&#39; and their symbol is a cross through a crown, indicating the two loyalties but the clergy at the core....</p>
