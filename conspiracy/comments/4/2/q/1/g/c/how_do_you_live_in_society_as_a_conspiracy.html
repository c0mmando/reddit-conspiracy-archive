<p>I basically have given up trying to red pill anyone anymore, yet I feel like that just resigns me to treating my friends like theyre idiots and lying to their faces. Which is it? Do I have a three hour discussion about the moon landings tonight and leave feeling like a dick, or do I smile and laugh along at how dumb people are to think it never happened. (Moon landing is just an example).</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat for nearly every aspect of society and life. I have ideas in my head that are so far beyond what the average person would think of as a &quot;really crazy idea&quot; that I truly struggle to relate to people sometimes, they really truly stopped learning about the world when high school or college ended.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this to make myself sound cool because it fucking sucks.</p>

<p>How do you deal? What&#39;s your vibe on red pilling people? Tell me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do the opposite and repel people.  I figure they suck anyway and can go away if they don&#39;t believe what I have to say after I copy them mountains of evidence to support my view.  I figure it&#39;s like this:  you say, &quot;the government is a big drug dealer moving the heroin&quot;.  They say, &quot;that&#39;s nonsense, they&#39;re fighting the drug war&quot;.  You reply with 3 pages of evidence, marines in poppy fields, occupying afghanistan for 15 yrs and a chart that shows the production levels dropping to effectively 0 on 2001 as motivation to &#39;have a reason to go over there&#39;.  They say, &quot;you got all those sources on the internet.  You cited wikipedia.  You cited a book.  The witnesses could be fake&quot;.  You say, &quot;those witnesses were CIA and FBI whistleblowers, one of which admitted to traffinking.  Try again.&quot;  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t talk to you for weeks, when they do that subject is never approached again.  But you have to wonder why you&#39;re sharing air with this person instead of with someone who actually believes most of what you say and doesn&#39;t treat you like you&#39;re lying to them or trying to pull one over on them or have an antigovernment agenda.  </p>

<p>These people then justify a corrupt government with pseudoskepticism and statusquotarianism.  The chains aren&#39;t real, but they tether these people nonetheless.  You can&#39;t help them. They are govcucks and bound to their own foolishness.</p>

<p>People are willfully ignorant and can&#39;t handle the truth.  Find people who can, but if you don&#39;t stand up and say something, you&#39;re kind of justifying the system too, aren&#39;t you, by giving the establishment and our culture generally a tacit complicity in the spectacle.  This then bolsters it and only ensures the same future corruption by enablement as successful.  In other words, the next 9/11 is on all the silent asses, because</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be more fact based and less theory based.    In other words,  be a historian,  with a measure of psychology and philosophy mixed in.</p>

<p>Or really,  its a study of mythology,   because what people are telling themselves are largely myths in many cases,   a world view that justifies the way they live and the choices they make.</p>

<p>What messes up a lot of people who reject the conventional myths is that they have to replace them with hypotheticals and theories.   Its ok to not know a lot of things.    Speculation is fine,   but don&#39;t go overboard on the tin foil.    Between the excessive tin foil and the alienation/isolation/or the being shunned,   rejecting convention can be bad for your physical and mental health.    So,  a focus on the discipline of history,   roots in a discipline,   can be healthy.</p>

<p>For current history,  you will be meeting some excellent critical thinkers when you step out of the mass media box.    R/conspiracy would do well to honor some of the top minds of our age,   who should be our mentors.    And there are others that have done a disservice,  who should be avoided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For most people, I wouldn&#39;t start out with something deep into the rabbit hole like the moon landing or 9/11. There&#39;s just so much propaganda and emotional investment surrounding both events that most people will stop listening rather quickly, and either go into defensive mode about the subject, try to change the topic, or just check completely out of the conversation. At that point, they likely won&#39;t be receptive to much else you have to say on the matter or any similar subject. (Some obviously will, but it&#39;s a risky bet if this is someone you know somewhat well or will have extended interactions with in the future.)</p>

<p>My main tactic is to feel out what they already find wrong with the system, and get them asking more questions about it. Most people, and especially younger people, are disillusioned to the political process, and for good reasons. It&#39;s usually as good a place to start as any, as even those apathetic to it often are so because of how messed up they know it to be. I&#39;d start to get them asking questions about the influence of money in politics, regulatory capture, election fraud, etc. But don&#39;t push them; just get them started with the questioning process by asking good questions of your own.</p>

<p>Offer facts and statistics where applicable, but don&#39;t lecture or let it turn into a debate. You want it to be a mutual exploration of a topic. One metaphor I use to think about it is that we all have darkened lenses over our eyes, causing us to have a distorted view of reality. But we also have cracks in these lenses. Many of us on this sub have managed to pry some of these cracks open into larger cracks and eventually large holes through which we can see more clearly. This is what you&#39;re trying to help others do for themselves, even as you yourself try to see more clearly. </p>

<p>You won&#39;t usually have much luck trying to punch a hole where the lens is fully formed, but you may have success in widening a crack that is already there. This method therefore must be customized to the person you&#39;re talking to, which means you must get the person to open up to you where their cracks are. This is a skill which you can become better at. </p>

<p>This approach also has the benefit of not having to talk down to or talk over the person. You approach it from the same perspective as them, as a person with an incomplete, distorted view of the world, yet as exploring and trying to discover the same thing. This position of humility, even though you have discarded more false beliefs, prevents the person from becoming angry at you or feeling the need to be defensive.</p>

<p>This is just my own personal tactic, which has worked on many people, but not for others. It&#39;s a long-game view. While it may have benefits in the short-term, what you are trying to do is cultivate a process of critical thinking rather than trying to convince or persuade them of any one view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try not to! I avoid it as much as possible. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard. I&#39;d rather sever ties with people who are hopelessly beholden to the status quo than fight to educate them when they often don&#39;t even want to know. It&#39;s like the matrix where pretty much anyone becomes an agent if you start to threaten their iSteak. I only keep friends who are more or less on the same page because I just don&#39;t have the patience for superficial relationships. I&#39;m lucky that most of my close family are aware enough in their own ways that I don&#39;t feel like they are hopeless. </p>

<p>That said, practically every normal person has some issue that they care about. Maybe they&#39;ve been fucked over by pharma or health insurance. Maybe they have a relative wrongly jailed for a little bit of weed or something. Maybe GMO food freaks them out, or they&#39;re worried about net neutrality. Find what that issue is, and every time you interact with that person just tap on it a little bit, help that crack in their wall grow. It can be a fun game. Once they see the corruption and insanity in that aspect, it&#39;s not hard to show them the rest. The hard part is for them wanting to see it. </p>

<p>I will leave you with a quote. It&#39;s from a book about cultivating spiritual whatever the fuck, but it has helped me in the past:</p>

<p>The first thing to do if you cultivate the Path is to hold firm to loneliness. The highest form of cultivation in human life is to be able to hold firm to loneliness, and be able to appreciate solitude. </p>
