The other two roommates, however, get mad or offended and the idea that America the Great would deceive them. The mention of 9/11 being an inside job INFURIATES them to even hear my side of it. Any of you guys try telling people about conspiracies too?</p>

<p>To this day I tend to keep conspiracies to myself, besides on this subreddit. I find that only people who are searching for truth will listen to me but others who are caught up in it all tend to deny the thought that anything could be going on behind the scenes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling something patently absurd doesn&#39;t make it so.  The valid questions pertaining to what we understand as &quot;the laws of physics&quot; in relation to 9/11 should be addressed if only for the purpose of providing the relevant proofs that separate theory from fact.   Attacking credibility instead of answering perfectly acceptable questioning serves no scientific purpose and appears, to me, highly suspect.<br/>
I personally don&#39;t have feelings about the incident.  I do have questions.<br/>
Also I&#39;d like to point out that, historically, consensus has not always been in our best interest.  Often times consensus is based on belief and it&#39;s not at all difficult to make a large group of people believe something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read Bazant&#39;s paper? His treatment of the collapse mechanics is much more robust than the &quot;Newton&#39;s Laws&quot; analysis coming from armchair engineers. It was published in a peer reviewed journal and has withstood publication without convincing rebuttal or retraction in a reputable journal. </p>

<p>That is the arena where nuanced discussions of engineering should take place, between the relevant experts. Lay persons making conclusions based on 10th grade science is unproductive, but not unfamiliar. Every field has its underqualified cranks that use pseudoscience to promote their ideas -- perpetual motion, flat earth, and 9/11. They all produce lengthy treatises with diagrams and equations that almost sound plausible if you don&#39;t have an expertise in the relevant field. </p>

<p>Examine the premise that a collapse could not proceed at near-free fall unless it was a controlled demolition. Bazant&#39;s analysis shows that the resistance from the lower floors under the collapse front is actually not substantial. And keep in mind that the free fall was not continuous and uninterrupted. The collapse front was proceeding slower than adjacent debris. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree that those people exist, but the people whose credibility you are besmirching are not just &quot;arm chair&quot; engineers.  They&#39;re professional engineers  or professionals in the field of engineering if not practicing.
3 steel building collapsed vertically.  No skeleton was left.  Molten steel was running beneath the rubble.  This has never happened before under hotter fires and even bomb blasts that have removed large portions of buildings similar in size to building 7.</p>

<p>I do know this much as an armchair whatever I am... skeptic I guess.  Under no circumstance would a mass push through an equal amount of mass and keep going unless there was no resistance from that larger mass or something was pushing it from behind.  It doesn&#39;t happen.  It&#39;s science that has been tested, repeat tested and never proven wrong.  Until 9/11.  The one time when a smaller mass was able to drive a larger mass to the ground and leave no steel standing... 3 times.  The sheer improbability of a this happening should be enough to raise questions.
I&#39;ll read what Bazant has to say to justify this because I&#39;m interested in answers that can sate my questions.  If he ignores building 7 in his argument I&#39;ll immediately feel there is something missing however.  I&#39;ll check and get back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, fuck me sideways... These guys are like super geniuses.  They submitted that paper two days after the collapse.  I imagine the first was lacking in detail if they published it that quickly which is why he revised it and has released 4 more since them.

    <div class="md"><p>So I read the initial paper but haven&#39;t had time to parooze the subsequent publishings that they did.  I did not find the &quot;findings&quot; to be robust at all.  They were highly speculative and even with the revisions lacked necessary insight into the structural integrity of the buildings to make the &quot;scientific&quot; assertions they made to justify the collapse.  Also they neglected building 7.  I was really hoping that this would be a good paper, but the amount of flak that they&#39;ve received for submitting this paper and having it published, from the scientific community that has gone un-addressed (as of right now... I still have to read the other publishings to see if they do address the other published works).  Certainly there must be something better than this?  Can you recommend some other sources?</p>

I explained what financial motives there are by the fed and how almost every country owes it, and those countries businesses owe it, and how people owe said businesses. It&#39;s a trickle down effect. He promptly asked me to stop being crazy. That was about a year ago. Since then I just stopped.

<p>I was watching CNBC yesterday as the markets were going nuts and my sheep roommate said &quot;You shouldn&#39;t read too into this stuff, it&#39;s all normal.&quot; And I replied &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we all be looking into this kind of stuff? It matters a lot to people everywhere.&quot; He replied &quot;It&#39;s whatever, I just want to live my life.&quot;...So I guess the takeaway from that encounter is that accepting the truth would have affected him living his life....his life of deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Whatever, I just want to live my life.&quot;  This is just a cowardly way to live.  It&#39;s called IGNOREance.  The truth is there but they choose to ignore it because it&#39;s easier that way.  It is hard to admit you were fooled and admit you were wrong.  Only people with a strong ego can handle it.</p>

<p>But I do think speaking the truth is still important.  It is said that the truth is immediately recognized even if the person does not accept it at that time.  The subconscious knows.  Seeds may eventually grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">Cognitive dissonance</a> actually causes people discomfort.  I remember the feeling, when I first started to question things.  One thing I&#39;ve learned is that people need to choose their own moment.  It might take years for someone to admit to themselves that the narrative is a fraud.  One of the best ways to disengage is to turn off the TV.  IMO, CNN is especially insidious. </p>

<p>You can only lead a horse to water...</p>

<p>PS, One of the best ways to perhaps make a friend think, would be to ask why we now have never-ending war(s)?  That alone should cause people to pause and wonder, but so few seem to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cognitive dissonance is difficult for most people to understand. Primarily due to the fact that they are unaware that they have been duped, or deceived into thinking or believing something utterly false. They literally have no idea that their opinion isn&#39;t their own, and is totally untrue. </p>

<p>I used to bring up conspiracy theories a lot to my friends. At first it was difficult. I knew how I must have sounded from a &quot;normal&quot; perspective. I didn&#39;t give up though. 
I&#39;m fortunate enough to have friends that are intelligent and capable of understanding things like this, so it didn&#39;t take long for them to see that I was actually right. </p>

<p>In all honesty, it doesn&#39;t take a genius to see these conspiracies in plain sight, so just start off small and work your way up. Just, don&#39;t push it. If you push it they&#39;ll resist and reject everything you say. Just be easy with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;And tell them to not trust what you say but to research for themselves.&quot; Man, that statement is clutch. Another thing they say to me is &quot;show me the proof.&quot; My response to that is always, &quot;It&#39;s not on me to show it to you, but you should definitely look into it deeper.&quot; </p>

<p>On a similar note, I think the quote &quot;You can lead a horse to water, but you can&#39;t make it drink&quot; applies very well to the sheep. We can try our very hardest to open people&#39;s eyes but at the end of the day the choice lays with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually disagree.  Anyone&#39;s eyes can be opened.  Just not by force.
Not by picking an old subject, or showing pictures of 9/11.  I hate the way the word conspiracy is heard in the west. But we know the reaction.  So must be avoided.</p>

<p>U must choose carefully the subject, something they care about. plant the possibility of lies in their head.  Act like you don&#39;t know anything about it.  But keep asking, how can they do that?   The smallest phase can be enough to plant the seed of doubt. 
Politicians don&#39;t lie do they?</p>

<p>I find drugs is the best topic to get people on the track.  People like drugs.
And if carefully pointed at a few sources, they may start to question why some are illegal some arnt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think it&#39;s not only america the great as you put it that would deceive its people so anyone who is open minded or have actually read history would know that there things that was kept secret for some time and for one reason or another and there are alot of conspiracies that actually was proven to be real </p>

<p>i told my younger brother about some of the conspiracies ( he is almost 8 years younger than me ) and we started seeing the same things and read most of the big events the same way so we agree on alot of things in that area </p>

<p>i think that is partly because of my father who also likes to suspect most of the things that do not look or seem natural , and his way of thinking influenced by René Descartes and modern history </p>

<p>so i&#39;m just saying that maybe your room mates backgrounds and environment was a little different than yours </p>

<p>but keep enlightening people around you or at least show them the way and leave it to them to take it or not </p>

<p>No1.  Try not to fire 100 conspiracies at the person.
Although you know, they don&#39;t.  Automatic human response is to shy away from something you don&#39;t understand. 
Pick a topic they will be interested / knowledgeable in.</p>

<p>No3.  Remember when / how you started to question the official narrative.  I bet it wasn&#39;t from someone trying to convince you. 
More likely something that effected you personally made you dig deeper.</p>

<p>Be sneaky in order to help the person.  Don&#39;t give the answers.  Ask the questions, perhaps ask them to help you figure out what&#39;s going on with something.  Then lead them down the rabbit hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first issue is not conspiracies,   or alternative ways of looking to the conventional.</p>

<p>The first issue is the conventional view,  the commitment to it,  and whether the issue has been used for political (that is to say power and control) issues.</p>

<p>If the issue is hot,   its a control point.    That means its not neutrally objectively reviewable by most people.    So what kind of person are you dealing with,   and where is their particular weak spot?    Do they claim to be knowledgable,  have technical expertise,   research background?    Or are they guzzling kool aide as fast as they can?</p>

<p>Depending on the above,   the second you open you mouth,  they have already got a strategy to listen to you or blow you off.     And just how much have you done for yourself,   to master the issues at hand?    How much are you claiming to know,   and be qualified to have an opinion on?     How well would you be able to handle your position on a call in radio show against someone of &quot;official authority&quot;.</p>

<p>And finally,   how much do you have at stake in the matter?    A future job that pays hundreds of thousands?    See how that goes,  if you decide to challenge more than little corners of the status quo.</p>

At that age,   you emulate your role models,   and you believe that this is a way to improve your own odds of making it.    You also are afraid of not &quot;making it&quot;,   and lord knows,   there are signs of the price that is paid of people who do not &quot;make it&quot; and those signs are not pretty.    So,  they are looking at your attitude of questioning as a liability,  even a threat to their well being.   Shut the fuck up and get with the program,  dude!  (Just kidding)</p>

<p>But seriously,  if your eyes are opened,   you do have to use some discretion and observation of what is going on around you.

    <div class="md"><p>I think one way to broach the topic that might not face outright rejection and hostility is to discuss <em>historical</em> facts of now admitted false flags that are public record. For example the Gulf of Tonkin incident that got the US into the Vietnam war. Or the sinking of the Maine and the Lusitania. And then of course there&#39;s the Operation Northwoods memo. Not to mention all the CIA assassinations around the world, though that is maybe getting a bit off topic. For sure there are other examples. The point is that these things are now a matter of historical record rather than a &#39;conspiracy theory.&#39; Maybe if you can open people&#39;s minds to accepting this history, it might make them more inclined to accept that things like that could (and are) still happening today...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of good advice here.  I approach it differently with each person based on my estimation of how open-minded and intelligent they are, so my rhetorical approach varies widely if I am trying to bring this stuff up.  I don&#39;t try to force the issue and I will even say things like &quot;I will admit up front that you will probably be happier if you remain ignorant of XYZ, but if you want to know more about what&#39;s really going on, I&#39;m always happy to talk about it.&quot;   I find that it makes people more willing to be curious if it&#39;s obvious to them that my attitude is, &quot;I think you will probably cling to blissful ignorance like most people, but I will be pleasantly surprised if you prove me wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Though I try not to be pushy in any way, I find myself bringing up conspiracies in casual conversation if I can ever tie it in naturally with the conversation.  Or I will just blatantly say &quot;Yeah, the mainstream media is pushing that narrative hard, but it&#39;s probably a smokescreen or perversion of the truth because of blah blah blah&quot; in the most matter of fact tone possible.  Evil sure can be mundane!</p>

<p>Anyway, to conclude:  Be patient, be careful, don&#39;t give up on spreading truth in general, but also don&#39;t be afraid to give up on an individual who won&#39;t hear what you&#39;re saying, if only temporarily.  As others have said, people need to come to these conclusions somewhat of their own accord; all you can do is gently nudge them closer to the tools to do so.</p>

This is WHOLLY uncomfortable.  Imagine how much more simple your life would be if you were able to un-see and un-question all of the things that have been presented for you.  Chances are you felt something was off kilter and questioned it yourself only to have it verified by valid suspicions and sometimes things that more closely related to &quot;proof&quot; than what you were being told.  Removing yourself from a pattern that has been established for society is not something that should naturally happen with immediacy.

<p>I&#39;d wager that the majority of people who express conspiracy theories just took it for truth after reading a few articles here and there from highly biased sources and from that point on accepted every &quot;fact&quot; from conspiracy sites without question. Just look at this whole sub, almost never is the validity of a conspiracy theory questioned, any criticism will be down voted and buried. Isn&#39;t that the very definition of cognitive dissonance?</p>

<p>People forget to keep in mind when expressing their conspiracy theories that they are in fact just potential explanations. Proven conspiracies are scandals, crimes or historical events. To speak about conspiracy theories as if they were undeniable fact, to be upset that someone doesn&#39;t accept your assertions at face value generally indicates that your own theories are lacking credibility.</p>

<p>Remember that to be a critical thinker and avoid intellectual dishonesty, you must apply the same level of critique to your own ideas that you do to others. This means while picking apart every little detail about the official narrative you don&#39;t just accept whatever conspiracy explanation someone comes up with. More importantly don&#39;t take that idea which you have applied no scrutiny to and try to assert it to someone else as absolute truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My roommates get their news from Buzzfeed or snippets of CNN. On top of that, they are majoring in Industrial Engineering, so their hubris is pretty strong in regards to events of the world. Also, they are very reliant on &quot;the system&quot; because they need corporate jobs after college. So I think when I suggest the state of the economy they fire off some stats about the unemployment rate...I guess what it always boils down to is them saying their sources are right and me saying you shouldn&#39;t outsource your news to the mainstream so easily. The agenda I push to them is simply to question what&#39;s going on, but even that seems extreme to them.  </p>
