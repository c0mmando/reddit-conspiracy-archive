        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bear with me on this one guys. I had never actually listened to the arguments for a flat earth until recently, and I figured out a way to prove or disprove it for good. </p>

<p>My idea is to simply fly a plane across antarctica, and keep going until I either reach the firmament or loop back around the globe. This simple test would either confirm or completely extinguish the theory as a whole. I&#39;m not sure why no one has proposed this idea before. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in the theory myself, but it&#39;s hard for me to let something go without knowing 100% for sure. And I&#39;m sure many of you would be interested in the results. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t seem weird at all.  Industrial civilization developed in the Northern Hemisphere.  Airports and ATC are denser in the Northern Hemisphere.  Trans-oceanic crossings are shorter in the Northern Hemisphere, due to geography.  Weather over the South Pole is much worse than weather over the North Pole.  The North Pole is surrounded by land masses that have air strips to which a flight can divert.  The South Pole comes close to narrow extensions of continents like Tierra del Fuega.</p>

<p>There are many practical reasons why flights do not usually cross the Antarctic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main differences are that the Arctic has water under it (it&#39;s a floating ice cap) and a lot of land area surrounding it.  The Antarctic is a land mass, with mountain ranges reaching quite high, and it is surrounded mostly by ocean area.  For whatever reason, those things make the Antarctic weather worse.  Considering that winter Antarctic conditions make flying difficult far from the actual continent, I would hazard a guess that it&#39;s the sheer amount of ocean area nearby that makes the most difference.</p>

<p>Also, I am not sure the Southern Hemisphere has an equivalent to the Gulf Stream -- an ocean current that brings tropical currents to the Antarctic.</p>
