       Bear with me on this one guys. I had never actually listened to the arguments for a flat earth until recently, and I figured out a way to prove or disprove it for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       My idea is to simply fly a plane across antarctica, and keep going until I either reach the firmament or loop back around the globe. This simple test would either confirm or completely extinguish the theory as a whole. I'm not sure why no one has proposed this idea before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in the theory myself, but it's hard for me to let something go without knowing 100% for sure. And I'm sure many of you would be interested in the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       I have a way to be able to do it, and will have the means within my lifetime. I cannot tell you the plan, as I'd likely be put on a watch list, or arrested for even saying it. But believe me, if someone else doesn't do it, I will and I will be successful.

       Ok, so you aren't relying on stealth or a technological advantage.  You are asking for permission and you think there is some amount of money that you can pay to ensure that you will be allowed passage unmolested?  My guess it would be the US military or possibly the military of another UN assigned nation that would intercept you.  Who are you paying this money to?  I'm curious for sure.

       This Antarctica angle is what tipped me off to flat earth stuff. I don't endorse the theory 100%, but there are a lot of curious problems they expose, lack of flights over Antarctica being a major one.

       There are definitely some odd things going on at the poles, but I don't think that directly implies flat earth.  I am interested in knowing what is there, but anything controlled by official channels like prince harry touching a pole on the shoreline isn't doing it for me.

       I just don't see how you get down there without it being a controlled production.

       This is what actually makes me start to side withFE peops. I started looking into Antarctica (mainly the nazi/ufo angle) and then started realizing how no flights cross, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WHOLE FUCKING CONTINENT is basically a no-fly zone, and AGREED TO by every government in the world? Wtf? Is that like the one thing every country unanimously agreed with? Laypersons should not visit/go near/even THINK about Antarctica.

       That's kind of the trick about FE.  It points out problems with the official model, but presents a flawed alternative model.  Disproving one model does not in any way prove any other specific model.

       There are easier ways to disprove flat earth theory.  Measure the angle of the horizon relative to your altitude.  On round earth reality, the angle is arccos( R+H / R ), where R is the radius of the Earth, and H is your altitude.

       There are many ways of demonstrating this to an F.E. but most will refuse to believe it. Even if you collaborated with them in sending a camera up into the atmosphere (helium balloon) and reviewed the footage, they would probably accuse you of trickery or blame the apparent curvature of the Horizon on the Camera's FOV.

       If I could see the curvature of the earth myself, I would instantly discredit flat earth entirely. But that's the thing, I'd like to see it for myself and not just believe what I've been told.

       Many have had this thought.  Doesn't it seem weird how hard it is to find information about planes flying over Antarctica?  Commercial airlines don't do it.  The continent is protected for science since the treaty in 1961. I would do it today if I had the means, but unfortunately I do not.

       I think a simpler way to disprove the FE model is to just look at the celestial south pole.  I am not sure how it could work in the FE model.

       My point is that doing this would provide definitive proof one way or the other. To have someone completely unbiased or unaffiliated with any organizations complete the flight while capturing video from many sources would put an end to it for good.

       No, it doesn't seem weird at all.  Industrial civilization developed in the Northern Hemisphere.  Airports and ATC are denser in the Northern Hemisphere.  Trans-oceanic crossings are shorter in the Northern Hemisphere, due to geography.  Weather over the South Pole is much worse than weather over the North Pole.  The North Pole is surrounded by land masses that have air strips to which a flight can divert.  The South Pole comes close to narrow extensions of continents like Tierra del Fuega.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many practical reasons why flights do not usually cross the Antarctic.

       All good points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea why the South pole would have worse weather than the North?  They are both presumably equidistant from the equator, why the difference?

       The main differences are that the Arctic has water under it (it's a floating ice cap) and a lot of land area surrounding it.  The Antarctic is a land mass, with mountain ranges reaching quite high, and it is surrounded mostly by ocean area.  For whatever reason, those things make the Antarctic weather worse.  Considering that winter Antarctic conditions make flying difficult far from the actual continent, I would hazard a guess that it's the sheer amount of ocean area nearby that makes the most difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I am not sure the Southern Hemisphere has an equivalent to the Gulf Stream -- an ocean current that brings tropical currents to the Antarctic.
