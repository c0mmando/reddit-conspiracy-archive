    <div class="md"><p>I know that a bribe or a neatly worded financial persuasion from Mr. Omidyar would be appealing to me and most reading this, but don&#39;t you think that the U.S. would be willing to handle it that way too (whether directly or through Omidyar)? </p>

<p>So why wouldn&#39;t Greenwald be apprehensive of a deal with Omidyar where Omidyar owned (and could therefore stop further release of) Snowden documents? Greenwald is a journalist...he was a former ACLU attorney. He has been articulately condemning the U.S. since I started reading his blog (early days at Salon).  I&#39;m sure he likes money, but <strong>his passion is the truth.</strong></p>

<p>As such, a threat made to him that his loved ones would be harmed/killed, (as the comment above regarding Michael Phillips shows) is far more likely the reason Greenwald stopped.</p>

<p>Although it was awhile ago, does anyone here remember 1992???  When Ross Perot, a very wealthy businessman (like Trump but without the ego or tantrums) grew to be a very popular independent presidential candidate, mysteriously dropped out of the race??  Have you ever read why? The reason he dropped out was because certain individuals came to his daughter&#39;s wedding (likely dressed for one, maybe looking like executives) and threatened Perot&#39;s family. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> When you have people who do what they do because they actually want to stem corruption and give the truth back to the people above everything else, threats (or actual commission of) violence are the only options for these sociopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That and the phone call he received from the US government prior to releasing an article detailing with names which Americans were being spied on. After he received that phone call, the article ended up being about just a handful of Muslim Americans -- what a shocker!</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I noticed the frequency of leaks, which we all suspected or knew were true, slowed to a crawl. I suspect he was threatened with that phone call. But who knows? I&#39;m still on the fence on the whole <em>limited hangout/actual leaks</em> issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been disappointed since Glenn withheld the names of Americans being targeted. There was a lot of buildup and suspense leading up to the release of names. For months Greenwald mentioned the release and built the suspense, only to pull out at the last moment. </p>

<p>I feel like I could see something different in his eyes and hear something different in his voice when he had to explain why the names weren&#39;t being released. He didn&#39;t give specific details (that I am aware of) as to what the USG said to him, but he did confirm he was contacted and decided to pull out.</p>

<p>I suspect the worst because Glenn has balls and an idle threat wouldn&#39;t work. I suspect they threatened to kill his dogs and his partner. He said he received a phone call but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he received a personal visit, a covert, black-op type visit. I believe Glenn has the bravery to withstand a USG death threat on his own life, but maybe he didn&#39;t want to be responsible for the death of people he loves. Maybe the bullies were totally convincing, he truly believed they would follow through.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe he would have withheld the release if he wasn&#39;t convinced the threat was real.</p>

<p>Glenn is a role model for me personally - smoking one with him and David at their home would be a dream come true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point <a href="/u/plato_thyself">/u/plato_thyself</a> is suggesting above is that Greenwald, more or less, has been effectively neutered. He may still write a caustic column attacking the U.S. now and again, but in my opinion, not like he did prior to 2013 at Salon or The Guardian.</p>

<p>I disagree... I don&#39;t think Greenwald would be persuaded by money (at least by money alone...I&#39;m sure there was a carrot <em>and</em> a stick).</p>
