        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>AbleChild describes their mission as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AbleChild, a 501c3 non profit organization, has been established to raise public awareness regarding the psychiatric labeling and drugging of children, and the risks of mandatory mental health screening.</p>

<p>AbleChild acts as an independent advocate on behalf of parents whose children have been subjected to mental health screening, psychiatric labeling, and prescribed psychotropic drugs without receiving informed consent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="http://ablechild.org/2014/07/28/grief-shared-questions-remain-in-sandy-hook-police-investigation/">the article on their site about Sandy Hook</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, in regard to investigative questions, one cannot help but wonder what the odds are that 148 bullets/bullet fragments were extracted from the crime scene and none – zero – can be matched to the barrel of the Bushmaster Rifle reportedly used in the shooting incident.</p>

<p>More bizarre is the stamped envelope that was retrieved from the Lanza home and addressed “For the young students of Sandy Hook Elementary School.”   This envelope was tested for fingerprints and DNA. Both Nancy and Adam Lanza were eliminated as contributors, but a DNA “hit” was made and it belongs to a known convicted felon in New York.</p>

<p>What was in the envelope and how did the DNA of a convicted felon find its way onto the envelope and into the Lanza home? It’s anyone’s guess because the State Police did not feel it was necessary to answer those questions in the report.</p>

<p>One also has to wonder how it is possible that the weapon used to kill Nancy Lanza- the Savage Mark II rifle – does not have any fingerprints or DNA for Adam Lanza, but the cartridges of the weapon tested does have a DNA “hit” for some unknown person.</p>

<p>It also is curious that the ballistic tests done on the only two weapons reportedly used in the shooting – the Bushmaster Rifle and the Glock 10mm – came up with interesting findings, including “No positive identification could be made to any of the bullet evidence submissions…”</p>

<p>There also is the issue of the Garmin Nuvi information provided to track Lanza’s whereabouts leading up to the shooting. Based on the investigation, there are two Garmin Nuvi models – a 550 and a 200. Which one was actually taken into custody? Reports are provided for both the 550 and the 200.</p>

<p>The questions surrounding this investigation are too numerous to go into in one piece, but the point, of course, is that there are too many questions. There is too much stonewalling, beginning with the redaction of so much of the report. And the investigative information that was provided is, frankly, shoddy.</p>

<p>Certainly one can sympathize with Mr. Pozner’s need to grieve, but the nation was drawn into this horrific event with the families and also is trying to make sense of such a senseless act. Moreover, enormous amounts of money have been appropriated in the aftermath of Sandy Hook to increase mental health services throughout the nation. These costly legislative measures were passed based on absolutely no information that Adam Lanza lacked mental health services and, in fact, based on the investigative report, it appears it is quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Mr. Pozner cannot ignore that Sandy Hook spawned a nation-wide attack on the 2nd Amendment rights of every American, and many of the families have been outspoken supporters of these efforts. While Ablechild holds no opinion on this issue, it seems unrealistic on the part of the victim’s families to so publicly support these restrictive efforts and not expect those who oppose the issue to question the facts that caused the action.</p>

<p>Based just on these two legislative measures, mental health and gun control, it seems unreasonable that the public would simply ignore the facts of this investigation. It is unclear whether or not Mr. Pozner read the entire investigation, but Ablechild believes the families of the victims deserve better. Questioning the investigation isn’t the problem. An inadequate investigation is the problem.</p>

<p>&#39;Lenny Pozner&#39; needs to come out and state his real name and nationality and occupation.</p>

<p>The envelope wasn&#39;t found in the Lanza house, it was sent December 16, 2012
(four days after the shooting), <a href="http://i.imgur.com/q2azA7U.png">postmarked in New York City</a>, and addressed to &quot;FOR THE YOUNG STUDENTS OF SANDY HOOK ELEM SCHOOL, NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT&quot;. Inside was a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Lm5Nm3t.png">Christmas card with a message purported to be from Peter Lanza</a>, Adam&#39;s father.

<p>But Adam Lanza&#39;s DNA <em>was</em> found on the rifle. The lab report identified the file <a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-AQeMpoWsTJ29fq74/Sec%2012%20-%20CT%20State%20Police%20Forensic%20Laboratory%20Reports#page/n0/mode/1up">here</a>: &quot;Item #4-1 consisted of a .22-caliber Savage Mark II rifle with serial number 1605038. Samples were collected from the left side of the stock (#4-1S4), handle area (#4-1S5) and the forend are (#4-1S6) of this rifle for DNA analysis.&quot; And on <a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-AQeMpoWsTJ29fq74/Sec%2012%20-%20CT%20State%20Police%20Forensic%20Laboratory%20Reports#page/n18/mode/1up">this page</a>, concluded: &quot;4. The results are consistent with item #4-1S4 (swabbing - left side of stock area) being a mixure. <strong>A. Lanza (submission #14) is included as a contributor to the DNA profile from item #4-1S4.</strong> The expected frequency of individuals who could be a contributor to the DNA profile from item #4-1S4 is less than 1 in 7 billion in the African American, Caucasion, and Hispanic populations.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</p>
