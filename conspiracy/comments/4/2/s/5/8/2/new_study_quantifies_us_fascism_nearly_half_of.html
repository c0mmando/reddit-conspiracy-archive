      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the 1990s, corporate America became particularly skilled at bending the will of the state away from actually representing the people and towards their own nuanced positions through the use of lobbyists — otherwise known as fascism or corporatism.

       Fascism definition:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.

       "Corporatism" does seem to match up though:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the control of a state or organization by large interest groups.
       </p>

      <p>
       Call it playing with semantics, but calling something fascist that clearly isnt so is a cheap way of adding weight to your claim by alarming people. Its crying wolf.

       All the definitions I've found for fascism are pretty shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one were to examine the success of the German economy in the 1930's, it stands out as an example among the unremarkable and corrupted "democracies".

      <p>
       Capture of the corporate executive positions and the regulatory agencies, treasury, and justice dept. by dual-citizens of a certain persuasion have everything to do with what's happening in this country, and it isn't fascism. It's outright subversion of the American political process.

       As a member of the U.S. Congress, one can expect to earn a substantial income of $174,000 per year – a very comfortable sum to live on. But it doesn’t stop there, now legislators are frequently using their political careers as a stepping-stone to a much larger payday upon retirement, often quintupling their income as an industry lobbyist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three political scientists have tracked data all the way back to 1976 to analyze the lobbying activity of former members of Congress in an eye-opening
       <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/iga/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/iga201516a.html">
        new study
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The results of the study, “Who walks through the revolving door? Examining the lobbying activity of former members of Congress,” appearing in the journal Interest Groups &amp; Advocacy, make clear that there has been a substantial increase in the number of members becoming lobbyists after retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The data indicates that in the 1970s and ’80s it was extremely rare for Congress members to go on to become lobbyists, as the pay-for-play lobbying system of today was virtually non-existent. In the 1990s, corporate America became particularly skilled at bending the will of the state away from actually representing the people and towards their own nuanced positions through the use of lobbyists — otherwise known as fascism or corporatism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, there is a reported $3.2 billion dollars-per-year spent on lobbying activity, with estimates that there is actually closer to double that amount spend, as only registered lobbyists activities are disclosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress passed the Lobbying Disclosure Act in 1995 to provide more accountability and transparency, because prior to the legislation being passed the rules for registration as a lobbyist were even more lax. Even after the Lobbying Disclosure Act, many former Congress members simply choose not to register, such as former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-SD), but continue to engage in work virtually identical to that of a registered lobbyist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some other interesting findings contained within the study:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Retiring members are more likely to become lobbyists if they were party or committee leaders, or they were on the powerful Ways and Means Committee in the House or the Senate Finance Committee (which have authority over tax and trade policy — always popular lobbying issues). This is especially true for House members. Backbenchers are less likely to become lobbyists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to go on to become lobbyists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very conservative Republicans were less likely to become lobbyists than moderate Republicans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most retiring members (78 percent in the House, and 87 percent in the Senate) who became lobbyists went to lobbying firms that represent multiple clients, rather than going in house at a company, association or other group. This makes sense, since former members generally specialize in access, which they can then sell to multiple clients.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The logic behind having former Congress members on staff at a lobbying firm is simply to allow for greater access to the internal workings of government, as these people are intimately connected within the corridors of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revolving door from Congress to K Street gives influence to large corporations that can afford the considerable sums of money required by the former Congress members, evidenced by the fact that for every $1 spent by public interest groups and unions, corporations spent $34.
How to Disappear Off the Grid Completely (Ad)
      </p>
      <p>
       These dynamics only serve to contribute to an even greater imbalance of representation in Washington, D.C. The select few with money and influence are allowed even greater access to U.S. lawmakers, while the majority of America is left virtually powerless to affect change.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea you have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and control the corporations that’ve long since bought and paid for, the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pocket, and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and the information you get to hear.
       </p>
       <p>
        They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you what they don’t want. They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. ―George Carlin

       Oligarchy? Fascism comes in the form of "Monsanto protection act" and things like that.  He, I wonder if lobbyists brought that to fruition. Give it a name, didn't make it smell any sweeter. Didn't come in only arm bands and sharp looking khaki uniforms.

       Literally no one said that, ever. We’re not talking about communism. We’re talking about a crony capitalist oligarchy being mistaken (purposefully) for fascism. Not even national socialism. They’re not related at all. They don’t beget each other. Nazism gained popularity because commies were planning to commit genocide on the German people and its ideologies, as they had done in Russia. Any of a number of other political ideologies could have arisen to combat communism. Nazism was not the only way to fight it, nor was it created because of it.

       Wrap yourself in semantics? What do you think is happening here? Article from bullshit conspiracy site incorrectly used alarming word to describe something, in an attempt to get clicks. People click on this post, are disappointed to see that op exaggerated. OP is justly called out. You bend over backwards and write in confusing unclear talk defending misuse of word. Dont wrap yourself in faux poetic sophistry, just say what you mean.

       Literally no one said that, ever. We’re not talking about communism. We’re talking about a crony capitalist oligarchy being mistaken (purposefully) for fascism. Not even national socialism. They’re not related at all. They don’t beget each other. Nazism gained popularity because commies were planning to commit genocide on the German people and its ideologies, as they had done in Russia. Any of a number of other political ideologies could have arisen to combat communism. Nazism was not the only way to fight it, nor was it created because of it.
