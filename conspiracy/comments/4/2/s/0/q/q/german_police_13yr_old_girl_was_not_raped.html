    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no age of consent there? So... theoretically, if Americans (or anyone else for that matter) wanted to have sex with thirteen year old girls, it would be legal to fly to Germany, <del>pay</del> romance a thirteen year old girl, and if she consents it&#39;s A-OK?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#Germany">Wait, that&#39;s not the case?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The age of consent in Germany is 14, as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14- to 15-year-old person&#39;s lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself. Otherwise the age of consent is 16, although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18 (under Section 182(1), it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 &quot;by taking advantage of an exploitative situation&quot;[30]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oooh, so 14 is <em>technically</em> legal, unless she feels bad afterwards, otherwise 16 is legal. So, what these men did, regardless of whether or not it was consensual or moral was <em>illegal</em>, by the letter of the law. Round them up and deport them.</p>

Instead, remove them entirely and send them back from whence they came.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that eventually, they&#39;ll attempt to return. You must not let them in. And if that does not work, then you must defend your borders with force.</p>

<p>comes in. The implication there being the force in question is <em>deadly</em>, and repeated as necessary until border incursions stop.</p>

<p>Countries in the EU are smaller than states in the US--hell, some of them are smaller than individual counties. Putting up a fence wouldn&#39;t be hard. Putting up guard posts with sniper/machine gun nests wouldn&#39;t be too difficult either. It&#39;s a lot less ground to cover than you think. Even a small fence to show a demarcation zone covered in warnings in multiple languages would work for legal purposes. Cross the fence, get shot.</p>

<p>The only difference between the two is whether travel is restricted for citizens or not. If I were running things, it would not be. Oh, there&#39;d be vehicle searches to make sure no one is trying to smuggle in <del>immigrants</del> refugees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh dear. None of you see it do you.</p>

<p>The controlled media lowers the moral standards of a nation targeting children, teens and young adults. </p>

<p>The controlled education system then teaches all manner of sexual acts to their children. </p>

<p>They then create a flow of immigrants with low morals to invade said nation.</p>

<p>The same controlled media then reports that the 13yr old child wanted sex with these men.</p>

<p>IF YOU TRIED THIS IN THE CONTROLLERS STATE/COUNTRY THEY WOULD SHOOT YOU AND IF YOU LIVED THEY WOULD THEN BEAT YOU TILL YOU NO LONGER RESPONDED TO PAIN, AND THEN BEAT YOU SOME MORE.  </p>
