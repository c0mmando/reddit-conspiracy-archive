    <div class="md"><p>I’ll leave you with an excerpt.</p>

<p>Once you get to the higher levels, you’re so deep into it with what you know that you can’t go back. Each new level you gain knowledge little by little, but very few know the full truth. The higher levels have initiation rituals that would destroy the person’s life should the information go public. Why do you think the info on David Cameron fucking a pig was released recently? It was part of an initiation, a punishment for disobeying the higher ups but not something so severe it’d ruin his life. One of the higher level initiation rituals is fucking a child so the film of the event could be used against you should you ever turn. Like Jeffery Epstein filming the underage orgies that went on in his house and on his plane. He flew dozens of important men–including president Bill Clinton–on his plane, where they would get underage prostitutes and have the men filmed having sex with them. The Finders. The Beast of Belgium. The British government. Larry King &amp; Boys Town. There are a lot of examples of the child fucking ritual and hidden pedophile rings.</p>

<p>It’s all designed to keep the people they want informed informed while still keeping control over their ranks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t related to government pedophilia directly, but government does protect the high level pedophiles in Hollywood.</p>

<p>The two Corey&#39;s (Haim and Feldman) were both molested many times as child actors.</p>

<p>Corey Feldman spoke out about it a few years ago. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was literally surrounded by a nest of pedophiles. I started using drugs to numb the pain. There&#39;s a picture that they didn&#39;t end up using in my book of Corey [Haim] surrounded by three guys, and they all molested him. These were devilish, sick-minded individuals. Now, contrast them with Michael Jackson, who I view as a greatly misunderstood, innocent person. He was always a perfect gentleman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feldman added that Haim had died &quot;very destitute&quot; and alone. In 2011, Feldman told ABC&#39;s Nightline that &quot;there&#39;s one person to blame in the death of Corey Haim, and that person happens to be a Hollywood mogul&quot;. He claimed that the sexual abuse of Haim had contributed to his early death.</p>

<p>David Cameron has never explicitly denied the incident, or taken any action against the publisher, and that tells you everything you need to know.</p>

<p>The incident was described in an biography of Cameron which was pubished last year. Because such a claim is potentially actionable, you can be CERTAIN that this story would not have been printed without the publisher knowing they had highly credible witness testimony and/or some photographic evidence of the incident. </p>

<p>Whether the Black Mirror episode about the British PM and a pig is an allusion to real events is uncertain, but I would suggest the two are connected more likely than not.</p>

<p>Doesn’t really matter, does it? It’s not like he can say, “Well, you know, I fucked all those children, sure, but I didn’t really MEAN it! I just wanted to have more political power!” There are plenty of people in the higher echelons (not highest) who don’t believe (or aren’t allowed to) and simply play their part in the cabal, as high as they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia and much, much worse. It&#39;s (ritualized) abuse, rape and murder of babies, young children and teens. <a href="http://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/01/12/david-mcgowan-programmed-to-kill/">Just check out McGowan&#39;s book <em>Programmed to Kill.</em></a> There is a whole section on the &#39;Pedophocracy.&#39; He makes it abundantly clear that this is a widespread phenomenon that reaches the highest levels of government and business and is protected by such. The recent Whitehall pedophilia scandal in the UK involving people at the highest reaches of the British gov&#39;t is only the latest in a long line of similar scandals that have erupted over the last 30+ years across Europe and North America. </p>

<p>It serves many purposes at once. It is part of the unimaginably twisted rites of occult/Luciferian groups to gain spiritual and other &#39;magickal&#39; powers (at least in their mind if not in reality). Traumatic abuse at a young age also makes it easier to create dissociated identities that can be easily &#39;programmed&#39; for various tasks. One of these tasks is to be used as bait to seduce and catch important people in the act of having sex with kids and/or teenagers, take pictures, and use it as blackmail. And on top of all that they can also make a lot of money selling pictures of the pornography, abuse and murder. </p>

<p>The rabbit hole is deep, and much, much darker and more evil than most people, even many conspiracy theorists, realize or are willing to admit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing can be done about it.  Only the low hanging fruit get arrested and even then strings are pulled to cushion the blow. </p>

<p>This particular moral panic, however, appeared in the press when the biggest fraud uncovered in the world at the time, the LIBOR banking fraud was in the headlines.  One minute we&#39;re all getting to the bottom of the fractional reserve banking problem and the next, Jimmy Saville is on the front page with nothing but allegations and hearsay about a dead man.  </p>

<p>Until the majority can be strong enough to not be distracted, we will have more and more paedophilia, because it works very effectively to keep low level elites in line. </p>

<p>Puppets, but yes, higher than most.</p>

<p>Absolutely, but they’re not alone. A lot of people want to heap <em>all</em> the blame on the Rothschild family, but of course they couldn’t do it by themselves.</p>
