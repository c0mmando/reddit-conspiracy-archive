<p>There are a multitude of origin legends about who these groups are, and what they call themselves. For the purposes of this question, I&#39;ll refer to them as &#39;Global Elites&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any theories on what the Global Elites intentions are? What are their long-term goals?</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m deliberately asking this as an open-ended question, to encourage diverse lines of thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major issue with this line of thinking is the fact that overpopulation isn&#39;t an issue at all.</p>

<p>Look at population maps, where are all the people located? Cities.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much room to spread out, the planet could easily hold 20 billion, 50 billion, 500 billion. </p>

<p>If they would dedicate farmland to feed the people, we&#39;d have zero issues with hunger. You could feed the entire world, plus more, with a farm the size of texas (in fact, the size of texas could feed at least double the earth&#39;s population).</p>

<p>People give the &quot;overpopulation&quot; theory too much weight, if you hear big names like Bill Gates talking about it, it&#39;s deception, plain and simple. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so easy to get rid of people if you tell them &quot;The world is too crowded, do you want to go, or them?&quot;, they will choose &quot;them&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about room to spread out its about resources. There needs to be more wildlife accounting for the earth&#39;s total biomass. Right now it accounts for 2%. Humans and our livestock account for 98% of the entire earth&#39;s biomass. We&#39;ve literally wiped out everything. 50% of US land is animal agriculture. Also I&#39;d like to see links on those claims bc I think they&#39;re wrong, mine are from Cowspiracy on Netflix.</p>

<p>There are too many humans on the planet and I agree that having children removes any questioning of the system bc all that matters is providing for your kids. Don&#39;t fall too far off the conspiracy ledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of human influenced carbon emissions, but carbon emissions wasn&#39;t the debate, total biomass ratios were. I&#39;m not being a dick or arguing the impact of humans on climate change, I&#39;m just reading and reciting scientific fact. </p>

<p>We could also discuss the amount of greenhouse gases released by volcanoes, hydrates, and pockets of naturally occurring gases being released from the ground by natural processes. Then we can talk about all the coal seam fires that having been burning for hundreds to thousands of years that were most likely ignited by natural processes. Science confirming that we&#39;re on the tail end of a mini ice age and that the warming trend is natural.</p>

<p>All of this, humanity included, contributes to a warming trend that accelerates as it approaches a saturation threshold. But none of this pertained to the original argument. I&#39;ve watched enough documentaries and done enough research to understand that, everything is always changing, and there is always something else to consider. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Natural emissions from volcanoes and the like is completely out of our control. We should only focus on what we can control. And I&#39;m torn as to how our scientific facts contradict each other, so plz check out cowspiracy.com and look at the facts themselves. What your previous research probably failed to tell you is that some of the biggest environmental organizations take large donations from the food industry and that&#39;s largely why they don&#39;t talk about the damage the industry causes to our ecosystems and environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I know about &quot;donations&quot;. I also knew about Monsanto before it was mainstream. I also knew about slash and burns, economic hit men that propagate the kind of behavior we are speaking of, pink slime, and a lot of other conspiracies many years before they were commonly known because I read way more than the average person. I&#39;ll check it out because there may be something I don&#39;t know that may open up yet another part of the rabbit hole I&#39;ve come to love and hate so much. I still disagree that we only focus on what&#39;s controllable to predict an outcome though. Every factor should always be considered for an accurate conclusion or one would lose credibility and thus be able to accomplish nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome man thanks for keeping an open mind about it, let me know what you think! &amp; I agree about the controllable thing to an extent.. Like I 100% think it&#39;s completely retarded of us to not invest in the defense system that&#39;d protect us from a comet impact on earth. Many ppl don&#39;t know we pass through a meteor belt twice a year. So things like that I&#39;m for, but I can&#39;t really see how we&#39;d prevent earthquakes. I mean they&#39;re miles below the ground, how would we go about stopping them? And would doing so lead to worse, unknown difficulties?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question for you, if they want to wipe us all out why did they let the population explode to 7billion in the first place (soon to go to 9billion so it still hasn&#39;t stopped)?</p>

<p>The fact is it technology that is giving humans the conditions to thrive. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eLu5FfG.png">This</a> chart shows you that it was infact the invention of the steam engine that first set the stage for human population explosion. It was the industrial revolution that put in place the conditions for a population rise and it is continued technology progression that is meaning we are continuing to boom. It has almost nothing to do with an elite, no one man or even group of men can control the way technology has changed human activity. It is a run away train and humanity is on for the ride, you can believe there are a bunch of old men pulling the strings behind the scenes but you would be looking in absolutely the wrong direction. The robotic revolution is what is pulling the strings in the world, not some old chaps with too much money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The global elite you are talking about are all Zionists. Their long term ( not so far now actually) is making sure that Israel will become the new ruling state in the world , they&#39;re trying to bring back the golden age and the biblical frontiers of the Holy Land, so that a man will emerge from Jerusalem and declare &quot; I am the Messiah &quot; but he will not be the messiah, he will be the antichrist and the Jews will be deceived.  </p>

<p>In the same way that the US and before Britain ruled the world following certain patterns ( banking system, hegemony of British pound and then USD , great wars) Israel will not be the ruling state until the USD and the American economy collpase and a great war occurs. That&#39;s why we have been witnessing the &quot; controlled demolition of the US economy&quot; and the constant provoking of the NATO/Zionists against Russia, Iran, China. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s add more meat... facebook will become the world wide interim agency of jobs with oculus rift like technology, tomorrow when people will be looking to work, they will go to facebook&#39;s virtual job market, and work inside there (whether completely virtually or as drone operator, have you seen google&#39;s lastest robots? Have you seen Chappie?). Eventually, real life will become a source of problems for the construct, so humans will be introduced to the simulation earlier and earlier such that they eventually don&#39;t know about real life. And once capital gets rid of the remaining chimpanzees of the future (the non-connected sub-humans!) for good with their armies of drones, there will be absolutely nothing left to threaten the world slavery model but a major catastrophic event. </p>

<p>Hopefully we&#39;ll fuck their shit up before, but that&#39;s the plan i read, literally the matrix as a slavery model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vulture capitalists have no problem liquidating corporations &amp; jobs for profit. Bankers wreak havoc on the economy they live in with derivatives securities. </p>

<p><em>Why wouldn&#39;t the richest 10 people have a common daydream of ... eliminating the competition?</em></p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t the richest 10 people on Earth have a common daydream of &quot;cleaning the slate&quot; and eliminating the Earth&#39;s population to start over, with ten surviving families at the helm?</p>

<p>A few thousand surviving &quot;subhumans&quot; will survive, starved for the clean water &amp; medicine in the possession of their new slavemasters.   They will become the permanent maintenance crew.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one family left alive in California, then there&#39;s no real &quot;drought&quot; problem anymore.</p>

<p>If slavery is illegal, then the extermination of the human race  (leaving intact the vast infrastructure that was built by those now-dead workers) amounts to retroactive slavery.</p>

<p>We were their slaves, and accomplished what never could have been accomplished in an enslaved world.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t the 10 richest men want to eliminate the next 100 richest men?</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t the 10 richest men want to eliminate the threat of mobs of poverty zombies?</p>

<p>The 10 richest men on the planet all have one thing in common: they are very, very competitive. Any competition is viewed as a threat. And we are their competition for their survival.</p>

<p>The 10 richest men on the planet, give or take a couple, own more than the bottom half of the planet. SO many people want their property, and they live in fear of people coming to steal their stuff.</p>

<p>And they can afford to own all the media, all the railroads, all the governments, all the food production &amp; distribution.</p>

<p>They can afford to make it look like an accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that every single member of the elite are conspiring together against everyone.  They&#39;re only human, so there would be infighting and competition amongst themselves.  </p>

<p>They live in their own world separate from everyone else, and some of them compete against each other to see who could amass the most wealth, power, or influence.  </p>

<p>&#39;Global government&#39; would just be a natural result of finding the most fair way to carve up the world for them and a better way to resolve interfactional issues.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that means everyone else gets screwed in the process.  I&#39;m pretty sure that the <em>game of thrones</em> books is their favorite series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major issue with this line of thinking is the fact that overpopulation isn&#39;t an issue at all.</p>

<p>Look at population maps, where are all the people located? Cities.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much room to spread out, the planet could easily hold 20 billion, 50 billion, 500 billion. </p>

<p>If they would dedicate farmland to feed the people, we&#39;d have zero issues with hunger. You could feed the entire world, plus more, with a farm the size of texas (in fact, the size of texas could feed at least double the earth&#39;s population).</p>

<p>People give the &quot;overpopulation&quot; theory too much weight, if you hear big names like Bill Gates talking about it, it&#39;s deception, plain and simple. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so easy to get rid of people if you tell them &quot;The world is too crowded, do you want to go, or them?&quot;, they will choose &quot;them&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question for you, if they want to wipe us all out why did they let the population explode to 7billion in the first place (soon to go to 9billion so it still hasn&#39;t stopped)?</p>

<p>The fact is it technology that is giving humans the conditions to thrive. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eLu5FfG.png">This</a> chart shows you that it was infact the invention of the steam engine that first set the stage for human population explosion. It was the industrial revolution that put in place the conditions for a population rise and it is continued technology progression that is meaning we are continuing to boom. It has almost nothing to do with an elite, no one man or even group of men can control the way technology has changed human activity. It is a run away train and humanity is on for the ride, you can believe there are a bunch of old men pulling the strings behind the scenes but you would be looking in absolutely the wrong direction. The robotic revolution is what is pulling the strings in the world, not some old chaps with too much money.</p>

<p>We could also discuss the amount of greenhouse gases released by volcanoes, hydrates, and pockets of naturally occurring gases being released from the ground by natural processes. Then we can talk about all the coal seam fires that having been burning for hundreds to thousands of years that were most likely ignited by natural processes. Science confirming that we&#39;re on the tail end of a mini ice age and that the warming trend is natural.</p>

<p>All of this, humanity included, contributes to a warming trend that accelerates as it approaches a saturation threshold. But none of this pertained to the original argument. I&#39;ve watched enough documentaries and done enough research to understand that, everything is always changing, and there is always something else to consider. </p>
