This would have cost more than the buildings were worth at the current time. </p>

<p>The planes would not have brought the towers down by themselves. The entire buildings needed to be re done. Controlled demolition and the &quot;Terrorist act&quot; insurance was the deal Larry Silverstein worked out with the other perpetrators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;stupidity&quot; lies within your complete and utter lack of knowledge on the subject of 9/11. You come on here asking questions and then act as if you have all the answers. Since you are so much smarter than the conspirators yourself, maybe you can think of one reason WHY they felt the entire buildings had to be destroyed, including WTC 7 which was not hit by a plane but still, Silverstein managed to make millions in insurance profit off of. </p>

<p>9/11 is more complicated than you obviously know. It was huge in geopolitical scope. Deals were obviously worked out. The department of Homeland Security, the USA patriot act and plans for invading the Middle East were all riding on it. You are looking at this in such a 2 dimensional way it&#39;s laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not just say terrorists used thermite to blow up the building? Why bother crashing planes? Al Qaeda had previously tried to bring down the WTC in 93 with explosives, but failed. It would be just as believable that al Qaeda terrorists used explosives to bring down the building. 
Or why not just crash the planes and bring the buildings down, why did the government do both?</p>

<p>Also, if al Qaeda and the taliban where controlled by the United States, why was former mujahideen commander Ahmed shah Massoud of the United Islamic front assassinated 2 days before 9/11?</p>

<p>When you apply basic logic to these conspiracies, it becomes easy to see right through them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make sense though. Larry Silverstien actually lost money from the towers falling, even after the insurance payoff was trippled in a court settlement. Not to mention, even if it were profitable, Lucky Larry might have had to split the money. Because of that I can&#39;t imagine him making a profit.</p>

<p>As far as destroyed evidence goes, what evidence? It&#39;s not like the WTC had paperwork describing the details of the conspiracy in it.</p>

<p>isrseli mossad, who ran security for the buildings, wired then for demolition with the help of rogue cia and silverstein, it is the only story that adds up at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not unlikely for radical Islamists not to follow the Quran or Hadith word for word, Isis fighters shoot up heroin, ground soldiers for African radical political Islamist organisations that banned music listen to tupac on their MP3 players.
Why would the goverment have the two people go to a strip club before they have them commit a false flag? They wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s far more likely these terrorists wanted a good day full of strippers and fun before they kill themselves. I&#39;m sure Allah would have made an exception for that one night considering the circumstances.</p>

<p>What do you mean they couldn&#39;t fly planes? They literally attended flight school beforehand. This shows how uneducated you are on the subject.</p>

<p>Your story doesn&#39;t add up, the only story that does is the one that happened. Ahmed shah Massoud was assassinated on September the 9th, 2001, explain that. Give it a go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a troll.</p>

<p>Dude your Wikipedia article research shows. Read a fucking book.
Ahmed shah Massoud was killed two days before 9/11 because he was the taliban governments biggest threat, after the soviet withdrawal, and the fall of the Democratic Party of Afghanistan, Massoud, hekmatyar, and other former mujahideen commanders fought for control of Kabul, and surrounding tribal areas. The taliban eventually rose and ahmed shah Massoud became their biggest enemy. Over time, with Pakistani support (condemned by western nations such as America), the taliban grew to control like 95% of Afghanistan, while ahmed shah massouds northen alliance had little power. Ahmed shah Massoud was killed by al Qaeda for two reasons, to show support to the taliban, and so that in the case of foreign invasion, the northen alliance wouldn&#39;t have the mythical, legendary leader Massoud leading the northen alliance.</p>

<p>the 2001 defeat of the taliban by American forces was won by sending teams of special forces into to guide and support the northen alliance as they retook Kabul, and dropping bombs on taliban targets. Eventually many northen alliance commanders became powerful in the afghan goverment.</p>

<p>When people heard Massoud was killed, they knew something gigantic was going to happen, the fact that you call him &quot;this guy&quot; shows how little you understand the significance of him.</p>

<p>You&#39;re arguing the most stupid point I have ever heard, we know who killed Massoud, it was three men with obvious links to al Qaeda, one of the wife&#39;s of the assassins is literally an outspoken AQ advocate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious when dumbasses like you think they understand a subject, but if they spent a couple hours reading a book, they&#39;d understand how little they know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it would have cost a fortune. However losing a huge source of income and then having to rebuild the entire thing again costs significantly more. While the asbestos would have been very expensive, it was only necessary to remove it everytime a new part of the towers were renovated.

<p>The planes are said to have been expertly flown (possibly by remote control).  If they wanted mass trauma, why did they hit the towers so high up?  If the planes were as precision controlled as they say, why not aim lower in the building and really trap more people in?</p>

And actually you make an excellent point, but perhaps the amount of life and the quickness and tragedy still resonates when excusing military action abroad; you pose such a good argument that all I can think is that they were testing a new weapon (like the small nuclear device theory), but you really have me semi-stumped, I still believe the amount of carnage and the organized attack across the board with the high cassualty was the main goal, in order to reach global support for ventures that have nothing to do with our freedom or security.

<p>Assumption: The goal was to bring the WTC buildings down to the ground as a symbolic attack, not simply kill some people.</p>

<p>One: Having failed to bring down the WTC with the truck bomb in 1993, this time they wanted &#39;insurance&#39; that it would come down after the plane attack.</p>

<p>Second: The bombs planted inside the building were to distract and cause as much chaos as possible. Perhaps to scare the first responders from entering the building to extinguish fires and rescue people. Simply a flank attack...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely believe that the government was somehow involved, but a lot of the &quot;controlled demolition&quot; theories don&#39;t hold a lot of water. Rigging a building like that with explosives would&#39;ve been extremely noticeable in the short term as blocks of explosives rigged with wire would&#39;ve been everywhere. Long term they could&#39;ve disguised the explosives as things like circuit breakers, intranet hubs, things that wires going in and out of wouldn&#39;t have been suspicious but this would&#39;ve taken years (which doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility). &quot;Maintenance&quot; crews could&#39;ve severely been weakening certain parts of the structure and rigging certain parts of the building with specific demolition devices. It&#39;s also in the realm of possibility that the steel used in construction wasn&#39;t up to code and we&#39;ve been running the math with the wrong materials sheet.</p>

<p>Another one that comes up is people saying they &quot;pulled&quot; building 7, but building 7 is far too large for a traditional pull in demolition. Building 7 was at the time home to local branches of the CIA, FBI, and NSA so it would&#39;ve been the easiest to just rig up with explosives and have nobody say a word. </p>

<p>Long term planning to get an excuse to invade somewhere and destabilize the region for access to resources and new capital.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my opinion, and a lot of it is clearly conjecture so you know, read it with a grain of salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the conspirators didn&#39;t rig the WTC to be demolished.  </p>

<p>The fact is that the building were ALWAYS rigged to be demolished since their inception.  By New York law, a building must be able to be demolished in it&#39;s own footprint.  The only way do accomplish this with buildings of WTC size is by nuclear shockwave.  Beneath each tower are tunnels specifically made to transport the nuclear explosive to do the job when the towers are ultimately decommissioned. The bombs are stored nearby underground and are moved autonomously to the area directly beneath each building.  The effect of the underground detonation is a high magnitude, short wavelength shockwave that pulverizes any structure immediately above the blast zone. This method of demolishing a building is not known to the public for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Those members of government <em>not</em> part of the conspiracy chose to pull the building for safety reasons.  If this was a legit terrorist attack with the aim of causing maximum damage, the planes could be carrying nuclear/dirty explosives.  When they are embedded high in the building, the potential blast radius is far more destructive and far-reaching.  Therefore, pulling the buildings and bringing the bombs to ground level could save thousands of lives.  And so, they were demolished using the method that had been put in place for exactly that purpose three decades earlier.</p>

<p>You&#39;re skeptical about underground nukes?  What of the molten <em>granite</em> existing for weeks?  Hundreds of varied cancers?  Dusted steel spires?  Thermite and other &#39;conventional explosive&#39; nonsense is disinfo and controlled opposition through and through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make sense though. Larry Silverstien actually lost money from the towers falling, even after the insurance payoff was trippled in a court settlement. Not to mention, even if it were profitable, Lucky Larry might have had to split the money. Because of that I can&#39;t imagine him making a profit.</p>

<p>As far as destroyed evidence goes, what evidence? It&#39;s not like the WTC had paperwork describing the details of the conspiracy in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not just say terrorists used thermite to blow up the building? Why bother crashing planes? Al Qaeda had previously tried to bring down the WTC in 93 with explosives, but failed. It would be just as believable that al Qaeda terrorists used explosives to bring down the building. 
Or why not just crash the planes and bring the buildings down, why did the government do both?</p>

<p>Also, if al Qaeda and the taliban where controlled by the United States, why was former mujahideen commander Ahmed shah Massoud of the United Islamic front assassinated 2 days before 9/11?</p>

<p>When you apply basic logic to these conspiracies, it becomes easy to see right through them.</p>

<p>Downvoted, yet no ones responded, come downvote me, but explain why</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I understand (it&#39;s not my go to and it seems very far fetched as well) but perhaps we&#39;re talking about another type of &quot;nuclear-like&quot; device, since reports of mass destruction in the basement happening just before the planes hit.</p>
