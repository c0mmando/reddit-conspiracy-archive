       but then they said that that chick and scully had alien DNA...and that's what the whistleblowers say.  the good ETs were shot down in Roswell when they came after the atomic bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       then the dark hats came along and offered power for a few abductions.  the leaders picked the dark hats because they didn't want to give up their nuclear weapons.  especially after they found out ETs could get here.

       I don't see alien DNA ending up in the database that she analyzes DNA on.   more like she noticed something 'alien' to the human genome.    she said she sequenced the entire thing.. lol.

       the alien image in the link is the alien from the show

       it doesn't make sense from a scientific point of view.  they'd have to actually compare it to something to say it's alien.   otherwise, it would just be an unknown/unidentified sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe if they found different base pairs, something besides AGCT...  but they were talking about sequencing.

       I'm a huge X-Files fan, I grew up watching it in the 90's. I'm a bit apprehensive to watch this new series, though. From what I've read, it seems almost like propaganda to discredit any 9/11 truthers.

       Can't say I'm surprised though.

       The old episodes were mostly about aliens and humans with supernatural abilities, entertaining science fiction stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new series is very different. 9/11 is not only the most obvious false flag in modern history, it changed the world as we know it and gave birth to the police state in the West, and the perpetual war in the Middle East.

       <p>
        Entertainment Industry Liaison
       </p>
       <p>
        As an organization that plays a key role in America’s defense, the CIA is a frequent subject of books, motion pictures, documentaries, and other creative ventures. For years, artists from across the entertainment industry — actors, authors, directors, producers, screenwriters, and others — have been in touch with the CIA to gain a better understanding of our intelligence mission. Our goal is an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA, and the skill, innovation, daring, and commitment to public service that defines them.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are part of the entertainment industry, and are working on a project that deals with the CIA, the Agency may be able to help you. We are in a position to give greater authenticity to scripts, stories, and other products in development. That can mean answering questions, debunking myths, or arranging visits to the CIA to meet the people who know intelligence — its past, present, and future. In some cases, we permit filming on our headquarters compound. (Please visit our Headquarters Virtual Tour.)  We can also provide stock footage of locations within and around our main building.
       </p>
       <p>
        Intelligence is challenging, exciting, and essential. To better convey that reality, the CIA is ready for a constructive dialogue with a broad range of creative talents.
       </p>

We had made a number of suggestions for outside experts and former diplomats to interview to "balance" the piece. 60 Minutes assures me that they raised a number of questions and concerns we planted with them during the course of the interview.

       As I posted in another thread on x-files(which seems to be over taking this sub) Plauseable deniability. More and more people are questioning the stories they are being fed by main stream media. So what better way to keep them from the truth than to fill them with nostalgia . By bringing back a show people have fond memories of. They throw the truth in there so if people question it the simple answer is
oh that's a episode of x-files it can't possibly be true

       Yeah, and if you read interviews about it you can tell they were crapping their pants about it at the time. They probably thought they'd be implicated by the government for one out of the hundreds of stories that they'd written.

       I haven't watched TV in 4 or 5 years, but I will stream shows off the internet. My gripe with TV is the advertising. I want to watch a show, I don't want to watch 100 advertisements for shit I don't want or need and cannot afford, which breaks up the flow of a good show.

       I think they were trying way too hard.  Instead of a buildup it was a pile of steaming theory all thrown together at once and served on a plate of take our word for it, we don't have time to explain.

       I thought Joel McHale's character was more Glenn Beck with Alex Jones talking points.  It didn't really feel genuine.  They just threw a bunch of conspiracy theories at the wall like they were testing spaghetti.
      </p>
      <p>
       The msm always tries to tear down jones by pointing out how rich he has gotten from fear mongering.  Well you have to sell a shit ton of seeds and canned food to make serious money.  He might be making a decent living, but for all the listeners he has, his advertisers are spending a fraction of the big corporations backing republican "libertarians" on Fox News and talk radio networks.  While Alex Jones might make $1-5 million a year, Beck is bringing in over 10x that.

       Mulder is clearly doubtful that the character is sincere- since he is pitching republican propaganda AND legitimate conspiracy theories.
Is it the conspiracy theories that sell, or the republican propaganda?  The audience likes conspiracy theories, but the advertisers like the propaganda- and who is paying your bills at the end of the day?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a good theme for the new show, though.  People are starting to "want to believe".  But are the aliens real or is this all just another layer in the onion?

       The conspiracy community should be tearing down Alex Jones, not the mainstream media. Whether or not he's a disinformation shill, he's become the biggest "conspiracy guy" that all the MSM outlets like to use and make fun of. When he goes on to a MSM show he makes anyone who seriously looks into and researches conspiracies look like a raving lunatic. While there may not be a united movement among conspiracy theorists (for lack of a better term), he discredits all of us.

       I completely disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       His character is built on the right wing talk show host format.  If he wasn't a fear monger, he wouldn't be as pervasive as he is.  And he's not insincere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take him literally every time he says "this is it, folks!  They're implementing martial law NOW!", but the reality is that he sees a slow and steady march in a certain direction and his rhetoric is geared towards mobilization.  Compare his rhetoric to pro-science rhetoric pushing climate change- it's really no different.  How often do you see a new scientific article proving that if we don't act NOW, climate change will be irreversible?

       He preaches to a choir.  He's not there to change the minds of people in the opposite camp- he's speaking to people who A: believe there IS a government conspiracy, or B: feel like there's something wrong and are looking for answers about what it is.

       Scully has always been the skeptic (unless it's about religion, then she believes for some reason), The show wouldn't be as good if everybody in it was just in an echo chamber of agreement all the time. That would ruin half the drama and end most discussion.

       I watched it twice. They were fairly spot on with their analysis of real world conspiracies. I also like that they are shifting from blaming it all on the Ayy Lmao aliens, to a more realistic conspiracy of secret governments experimenting on their own people, even going as far as referencing the Tuskeegie experiments. I thought it was a brilliant episode and a true return to form for one of my favorite shows. The only downside that concerns me is that people might just watch it and consider it an entertaining fiction when it is actually drawing heavily on factual conspiracies which have shaped the world we live in. The best lies are sandwiched in between a couple truths and that's how the 'fiction' of X-files works. They cite 100 real conspiracies and link them together with a more fantastic alien conspiracy.
