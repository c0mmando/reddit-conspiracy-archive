       Much has been made of the issue of whether Steven Avery is guilty or innocent. There is no hard evidence pointing either way. One thing there is evidence of, though, is police corruption and a potential conspiracy to have Steven Avery convicted regardless of his guilt or innocence. If you haven't seen Making a Murderer yet, please do so now. It depicts perhaps one of the most unjust and obvious examples of police corruption in recent history. Google search link to petition in comments. Please share! As it stands now it will not make the threshold.

       Forget about the murder case.  His initial wrongful rape conviction should be enough to warrant an investigation.  The only reason Avery had to settle the lawsuit early was because he needed the money for his defense in his knew case.

       I don't get that early settlement to get money for his defense. His new lawyer knew he had a massive judgement coming for the previous innocent years in jail. Should have just attached a fee to any proceeds from that litigation.

       SA was guaranteed nothing at the time he was on trial for murder so you can't reasonably expect the defense lawyers to accept that they

       I think they were worried that all the bad press might affect the jury in the civil trial.  Also, who knows how long it might take to actually complete that trial and receive any money.

       Whether he did it or not (I kind of think he's still the strongest suspect) there was enough fuckey with his case that he should have at least got a mistrial

       The fact Brendan Dassey is in jail is an absolute travesty, a 16 y/o kid with a functioning iq of 68 even being allowed to stand trial is fucked up, then you toss in the fact that his public defender was actually working for the prosecution and his case should have been dismissed faster than claims that Atlantis was found in Oklahoma.

       The lawyer for Dassey should be removed from the Bar for his actions in that case. Brutal. I'm surprised Dassey hasn't gotten a retrial because of his lawyers actions. I think the US justice system is pretty F'd up to be honest.

       Avery looks pretty guilty to me thou. Sure he should have had more fairness but I'm not crazy upset about his situation.

       Kachinsky was his name--he was the criminal pretending to be a defense attorney--and now a judge for his work fixing the defense for Steven.  Brendan should sue him for every dime he has--his duty was to help Brendan get through the legal system as the innocent man/boy he was--there was no evidence against Brendan at all until they told this kid that they had secret evidence Steven killed her, so Brendan went along with the false confession...They lied,  bullied him, defrauded him with that fake form, and when they told him they wanted nothing but the truth, he went straight back to "I was playing video games with my brother."  Boring, but what he really was doing!  He was so relieved to be able to tell the truth  until he saw that they meant that fictional "truth" about rape and murder.  Bunch of psychos trying to ruin the U.S. judicial system for their own gain.  I wish we had the French guillotine.  "Off with their heads!"

       There should have never been a trial.  All the evidence was brought forth by the Monto County police that had an order to stay out of the investigation. The judge that handled the case was either corrupt or an absolute fool.

       It wouldn’t do any good if I signed a petition because I’m Canadian.  However, I don’t see the harm in signing anything if you truly believe in a just cause.  So what if your name ends up on some sort of list. It’s not like you’ve committed a crime; it just means that you’re interested in justice and believe that everyone is entitled to a fair trial.  Whether you believe SA and BD are guilty or that the docu-series is biased, nobody can deny that either one of these men were treated unethically.  At the very least Manitowoc County ended up with serious egg on its face.  The arrogant bastards who interrogated an intellectually challenged boy, must be held up as an example of what goes on in a perverted justice system.

       Well, it was a somewhat tongue in cheeck comment, but I do think in a post-Snowden world it's clear that
       <a href="/u/OswaldWasAFag">
        /u/OswaldWasAFag
       </a>
       isn't talking complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did sign the petition.  But I wouldn't feel comfortable signing any truly controversial petitions from that that site, because I do believe they aren't going to forget who signed in support of
       <em>
        Evicting the Martians from the Whitehouse
       </em>
       (as an arbitrary fictitious example) or whatever controversial topic there might be a petition about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very clear at this point that info is being collected in enough granularity to build a profile of the online activities of just about everyone - and it's probably fully automated and sits on a hard drive someplace, and no one cares about it - until they have a reason to look at it, and then it's all there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I was kidding with that post for the most part, but I'm also not naive enough to think that names on that petition all just vanish once the petition expires, either.

       I get your meaning, but I'm not ready to care about who listens, watches or reads my comments online.  I doubt my many searches on eBay for cat toys or some such nonsense will interest anyone.  If someone ever needed to build a profile of me, I would have said before the Avery/Dassey case that it would most likely because I was a victim not a perpetrator.  But, you're right about staying clear of controversy.  If you're not sure about something, what's the point of signing your name anywhere and that includes a guilty verdict.

       Sorry if it's boring for you to have a one sided debate, but I was readying for a conversation about the presumption of innocence or reasonable doubt when you go and throw a wrench in my train of thought.  I actually had to look up “what is privacy”.  Why hadn’t I ever really thought of it before, even after the Snowdon affair, would probably take too long to explain.  But again, I have to acknowledge your point.  Privacy is important because it’s impossible to know or control who’s looking and for what reason.  My right to be left alone and my freedom from interference or intrusion are important to me.  Thanks for the reminder. :)

       :-)  There are less and less people who get that and who value their privacy these days - and honestly I don't think I could have said it as succinctly as you.

       If you hold that definition in your head and start to notice how many people are very ready to throw their privacy away, or are ready to look sideways at someone who admits to valuing their own privacy, it will likely start to bother you a little after awhile.

       I'm not really on the fringe about it either, I take only very minimal steps to give myself some semblance of privacy online.  But I'm not in a rush to put as much of myself "out there" as a lot of people are, and I think that's one of the biggest things.

       for a more set of legitimate circumstances, research Steven Mark Chaney and the other 20+ exonerees that have come to light from the same court room in Dallas, where the DA, Police and Judge were all in cahoots to force convictions, innocent or not. I live in the Dallas area and they even used the same "Odontologist" Consultant over and over and now has redacted his statements on record. In Steven Chaney's case, they had DNA evidence that was enough to exonerate in 2009 and said nothing, it took a newbie intern to find out in 2015 to bring it to light and started an absolute shit storm

       Also, the former governor Rick Perry signed a law giving a dollar amount, time lines, etc. for this type of situation because Texas was exonerating people then giving them a $50 gift card and a fuck off. So that particular county is going to pay an ungodly amount of money with 20 people already exonerated and possibly more to come

       The show does not exclude anything that can be considered damning whatsoever. In fact, there has not been a single piece of damning material presented against SA. Not to mention that the accusations (and they are literally nothing more) of missing evidence are coming from those implicated in wrongdoing surrounding the case, as well as the slimeball prosecutor who tried the case (aka people who hold their own extreme biases). There are several pieces of physical evidence, yes, but there is nothing for which the surrounding circumstances can be reasonably explained. I will concede that the show paints Avery in a sympathetic light. There's no denying that. Regardless  of this though, what the show does show beyond any reasonable doubt is that some form of police corruption occurred. That is the only piece of information that really matters with respect to this petition because even if SA is guilty it stills shows that there was a conspiracy among law enforcement to abuse power.

       It shouldn't be ignored but it also can't be considered damning if it wasn't proven that it was shot from that gun. You are aware that testing to see if a bullet was shot from a
       <em>
        particular
       </em>
       gun, not type, is not only possible but extremely easy, right? If it was the gun Avery kept in his room then why weren't they able to prove it? Not to mention the fact that the bullet was found in the complete absence of any other blood from the victim whatsoever. It would have taken a professional clean up job to pull that off and it would be simply impossible to get the victim's body from the garage to the pit where she was supposedly burned without some other DNA evidence being left. SA is extremely unintelligent, the furthest thing from competent when it comes to something like this. It simply does not make any sense and there has been no logical explanation put forth by
       <em>
        anyone

       Not if the bullet is severely mangled it isn't. Which a 22LR entering a body, contacting bone, and then exiting said body would be. We aren't talking a high powered rifle with a decent sized bullet encased in copper here. It's a (relatively) slow moving soft lead slug whose trajectory and exit are completely unpredictable once it contacts human bone. It could come out of the body nearly whole or come out so trashed that you can only recognize it as a 22.

       I think you are overestimating what kind of mess a 22 wound would leave. We aren't taking a 30-06, 270, or even a 9mm.

       That's interesting to note but it doesn't come close to explaining the majority of the rest of the stuff as well as not being conclusive itself. To be honest I don't care all that much whether he's guilty or innocent. Certain things don't add up for me and that's what I base my scrutiny of the police departments in these cases on. That's my primary issue.

       Well being that you mentioned that Avery was framed in the title of the post, I would say that it doesn't matter to you because you've already made up your mind that he is innocent.

       The title should probably be "possible" framing, although the first case was almost a definite framing and failure of the legal system.

       Not "the victim's DNA"--THE LAB TECH'S DNA!  Experts say that piece of planted evidence has to be tossed because once the lab tech's DNA came up, and she had run no other tests but HAD destroyed the evidence, it was all over.  It should never have been admissible.  She screwed up the test big time and the prosecutor tried to hide it.  It became a lying mess where FBI cridibility was misused to cover-up county messes and incomplete testing.  I included a link to a good article by a blood expert above.   Again:

       And there were questions if the rifle had been fired at all.  Why carry a srabbed slashed and raped woman--who mysteriously is not bleeding a single drop of blood--or bleach either--and the rifle all the way to the garage?  It's all a phony story the prosecutor made up to explain evidence planted by at least 2 groups of people.  Nothing makes any sense!  Brendan denied it all as did Steven.  Only after cops started lying to Brendan about secret evidence they had proving Steven did it and they were trying to blame him that the kid started repeating anything cops said.

       Halbach’s belongings were found on Avery’s property. Kratz said her phone and camera were found 20 feet from Avery’s door. “This isn’t contested,” he said. “It was all presented as evidence at the jury trial, and the documentary people don’t tell you that.”

       I read that article and most every one of those items was refuted in the early comments.  The items were ones we all already knew about, or they were part of something else that WAS included in detail, or it was inadmissible anyway.  On and on people all said they knew of every one of the items, as did I.  And as a producer said, when you are expremely limited for time, boiling 700 hours down into 10, you don't rehash stuff everyone already knows or can glean from any news article.  For each item they would add, they'd be forced to remove something you saw in the documentary.  So all those armchair film editors:  do you re-edit ALL documentaries you watch?  Or just those produced by women?  Just curious.......

       Well, the key kind of did it for itself.  The Calumet deputies (I call them the good guys because we don't have shady stuff from their time at the salvage lot) testified that they were told to escort and keep an eye on the Manitowoc County deputies (these are the bad guys from the 1st case where Steve spent 18 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit and would not provide a false confession for....Kusche, Lenk, Colborn, Peterson, and some others who had all been deposed in Steven's lawsuit that week or 2 predeeding Teresa's disappearance, and they were angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       While officers held the Avery salvage lot in their possession for 8 days, forcing the Avery family to live at a hunting or fishing cabin they have to the north, many people besides the Avery's were allowed to access the property.  For example, Pam Sturm, a relative of the victim was allowed to search for the car of Teresa's and many others were allowed back to search for Teresa herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time the police investigating a report Teresa was missing stopped at Steven Avery's trailer home, on Nov. 3d or 4th, 2006, he invited them in.  The did a complete walk thru and saw nothing suspicious--no smel of bleach, no smell of a human being cremated.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the car was discovered there on the 5th of Nov, the police took control of the entire property but for one brother's home who served as a caretaker.   Steven's trailer was thoroughly searched for evidence consistent with their theory of this big rape and murder (rape so the murder could be bumped to 1st degree (which allows a death penalty if they have it, or other harsher penalties), not because they had any evidence of rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photos were taken on the corner of Steven's bedroom clearly showing no key and no way for joggling the table to release a key...   The Calumet deputies testified to keeping an eye of Manitowoc deputies who came there daily although they were not really supposed to to be there.As days went by, and work appeared to be getting finished up, the Calumet deputies relaxed their watch on the cops like Lenk from the first lawsuit.  The case against them was still active, but nonetheless, they were allowed on site without an escort.  And, later, Lenk was allowed to roam Avery's home without anyone watching him...and that is when--5 days after the first thorough search--Lenk "discovers" a key to Teresa's RAV 4 in full view where it clearly wasn't just days earlier!  Calumet deputies testified to its earlier absence there as well!  And similarly, long after the garage was searched, Lenk and Colborn were allowed back on the property, not with guards, and the one bullet appears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both items atso were subjects of strange DNA results....The key had no DNA from the car's owner Teresa, even tho she'd driven it for years.  It had apparently been scrubbed.  It's also btw, not the key she is shown posing by her car with--it has no office or home keys, and appears to be only the single valet key?  Where are her full set?  With the murderer?  But then Kratz reports this key without DNA has DNA--from Steven's blood.  And the county claims the FBI invents a test just for them that tests for EDTA in the blood to see if it came from the purple vial!  And they say it did not, of course.   Here is someone who disagrees
       <a href="http://brobible.com/entertainment/article/scientist-explained-blood-evidence-making-murderer-garbage/">
        http://brobible.com/entertainment/article/scientist-explained-blood-evidence-making-murderer-garbage/
       </a>
       And who argues the bullet's test has no value.  EDTA in the purple vial is in minute quantities.  And to remove blood from a surface, it must be re-liquidified, further dilutingt it, as happes again when it's tested.  Eventually the amounts of EDTA would be too small.  And the Prosecutors never even mention this?

       Because the judge prohibited evidence of other killers, the trial was all prosecition evidence and their lies.  Since it was covered pretty well given time constraints, and the county refused to speak with t5he serirs' producers, I think they deserve an award for covering the side hiding behind the curtain!!  The producers were limited to media reports they could find and trial footage.  IMO, youall would not approve anything exposing cop corruption.

       bullshit, there is tons of evidence they "omitted" that shows a pattern. His ex-girlfriend even filed a report saying he beat her unconscious and when he thought she died dragged her to the car (possibly to dump the body). She awoke while being dragged by her hair and he then changed his mind. She also admits on record that she was told what to say in front of the cameras to put him in a positive light

       Compare her in the MaM series and on Nancy Grace.  Who looks like someone is coercing them?   It's very obviously when she is on Nancy Grace.  and who was singled out for a reprimand by name by their state supreme court for dishonest tactics?  Hint: it was not Avery or anyone on the defense team.  Yes, Nancy Grace recieved this dubious honor twice--nearly unheard of in the profession.  So the girl supports Steven all the way until media dries up.  Then she has a new story from prosecution whore Nancy Grace.  And she looks like hell.  She has gained a lot of weight (a sign of stress), her skin is awful.  I saw her saying she was drinking again...  All in all, NOT a reliable witness for anything..

       The "point" of your petition is distraction. He had a trial and was found guilty by a jury of his peers.....again. (Not sure if he had a trial last time)

      <p>
       More important things are going on that warrant greater attention then this. The show is just that. Entertainment industry hype. They omitted facts painted the DA so you would feel sympathy for the accused when it had no bearing on the case.

       If there is any wrong doing do you honestly think the FBI will do shit? Police protect their own. Steve Avery is FUCKED. He either did it or had something to do with it.

       And which part of his case, whether guilty or not guilty, excuses the abhorrent behavior of several officers during his arrest, processing, trial, and conviction in both instances?
      </p>
      <p>
       How does Avery's alleged involvement with the Halbach case excuse Andrew Colburn from bringing forward vital information for his 1985 conviction while he was up for appeal in '94? "We've got our guy" is not police protocol in a situation where you have a detainee pleading guilty to a crime committed 10 years back, for which you've holed up some other poor schmuck in his place. Regardless of his current status of innocent/guilty, there was a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department have to answer for, and very little they will answer for while people are caught up in the "But did Avery do it?" spiderweb.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of bringing up Avery is distraction, the petition is a call to the people to make them understand these conspiracies
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       carried out on, at least, the small scale either because they have a personal grievance with the victimized, or because they genuinely believe them to be guilty, and thus want to get them behind bars (a point Ken Kratz, the DA, claimed was justification enough to find him guilty if the police were willing to go to such lengths, essentially promoting a perversion of the judicial and legal system so long as it reaches a conclusion preferable to the state).

       Ok I get it you saw some corrupted shit happen and now you demand accountability. Well here is the thing. People don't give a fuck. They do right now cause its trendy. A month from now it won't be.

       Learn to pick and choose your battles because this is a loser. Personally I see it as some of the residents said "a family of fuck ups" lets say you get them to admit guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what? Reprisal is what. You have to sacrifice one for the good of all. The family isn't going to make it if he is released again. Plain and simple. The police departments families will do something because well they are all tied to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you tell me you want him to go free so the rest of his days his family will have to look over their shoulder? Or is it going to be better for all now?

       Pretty defeatist of you, makes me wonder why you're so adament people stop entirely, and why you don't stop entirely replying. If it's so futile, is it not more futile to keep coming back to make your point that it's futile? If you wish to do nothing, fine, but stop standing in the doorway saying it's pointless going outside today.

       Firstly, my point was that it's irregardless of his innocence or guilt, and that the actions of the officers implicate them independently of the actions of Steven Avery. His release has naught to do with their incarceration, and claiming he should remain in prison for the rest of his life because "the police might do it again" is such a ridiculous argument it's almost up there with "well, he might commit murder at some point, so may as well lock him up now before he maybe does in the future". It's false incarceration. In the first instance, the police could be charged with false imprisonment, but that can be overlooked, because he's in jail again now, and if he gets out, it might happen again, so let's ignore the acts of the officers.
      </p>

       Perhaps for you, though that attitude does answer the question of futility above. Fair enough, you see no light at the end of the tunnel, others do, others do when they squint, but when you sit on your arse instead of heading forward to investigate the light, you're never going to see it. You're just stuck in a dark murky tunnel complaining there's no hope because you can't see it. Allowing injustice to pass because it has passed won't fix anything, and claiming "we may as well move on, leave it, it's distraction, let's all focus on this thing over here instead" removes all right you have to complain about the issue.

       His history with law enforcement is that they falsely accused him of rape, actively obstructed investigations, ignored credible tips, hid evidence of his innocence, and attempted to have any new evidence of his innocence suppressed...all while he sat in prison for 18 years for a crime he did not commit.

       You simply fail to have even the most basic comprehension of law enforcement or the function of the criminal justice system.  You think that he's guilty because they said he's guilty rather than bothering to care if he actually did it or not...then, even if he DID do it..you don't care about the conduct of the police or how they broke every law in the book in order to get a conviction.

       What position is that, exactly? You don't have to break a law to rely on a jury to make a good call on a case. You could easily be the victim of it without 'putting yourself in that position.'

       I'm not even just talking about Steven Avery, but excellent dodge. Although, depending on what you believe, the only thing he did to warrant the attention he attracted was be wrongfully convicted and file a civil suit.

       Here is what I think. I think from jump he has been a pedofile. I have read thru number accounts before I came to this conclusion. So the information is out there. I don't give links cause if it means anything then you will find it yourself.

       What if you knew the county lied about the blood in the car?  And the blood on the bullet.  If those never existed and Kratz and the witness faked them both (what forensic blood experts say reading transcripts) they have no value.  Bones were burned by someone in the quarry, NOT at the Avery's..placed on 3 sites at the Avery's because they had no clue which pit was Steven's!  There was nothing in his house.  Blood in her car was planted.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And there never was any evidence against Brendan until police lied to him about what Steven supposedly did...and everything he ever mentioned was fed to him by police.  Now the blood is gone, key was gone as soon as Calumet said it was not here until the Manitowoc cops returned--and they offered photos to prove it was not there.  Bullet gone, never was any evidence in his house, none in garage.  Everything is a fake piece of evidence.  Nothing is real when an independent expert looks into it.  A shell game.

       There was expert testimony the bones had been moved.  They probably were burned at the quarry and then moved to the Avery lot, but the murderer did not know where to put them to implicate Steven Avery.  So they divided them up into 3 separate burn pits and boxes.  There was no evidence that Brendan Dassey did anything until they lied to him that they had secret evidence his Uncle Steven did it and was burning the body at the Halloween bonfire!  Such lies.  The poor kid was being held without a lawyer (who was honest and worked for him instead of the prosecutor) or his mother and he could not understand what they said to him.  His own attorney set him up!  It was a crime.  His IQ is 69.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to Teresa's comment about Avery, her friends posted that she just thought he was creepy, not that she feared him!  That has been misused by the sleazeball prosecutor for years now. She was not afraid of Avery.  She willingly went there again and again.

Bones were burned by someone in the quarry, NOT at the Avery's..placed on 3 sites at the Avery's because they had no clue which pit was Steven's!  There was nothing in his house.  Blood in her car was planted.

       And there never was any evidence against Brendan until police lied to him about what Steven supposedly did...and everything he ever mentioned was fed to him by police.  Now the blood is gone, key was gone as soon as Calumet said it was not here until the Manitowoc cops returned--and they offered photos to prove it was not there.  Bullet gone, never was any evidence in his house, none in garage.  Everything is a fake piece of evidence.  Nothing is real when an independent expert looks into it.  A shell game.
