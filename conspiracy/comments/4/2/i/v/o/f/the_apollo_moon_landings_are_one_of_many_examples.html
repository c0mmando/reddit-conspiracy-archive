<p>But there&#39;s other weird shit around the moon, just scientifically in general, like:</p>

<p>1- The moon&#39;s older than the earth. Earth is roughly 4.6 billion years, moon rocks have been dated to 5.3 billion years. </p>

<p>2- The moon&#39;s orbit is very nearly a perfect circle, unlike any other moon in our solar system.</p>

<p>3- The moon&#39;s orbit and its rotation are exactly the same, so we on earth ONLY see the same side and the &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; is always opposite us.</p>

<p>4- The moon may be hollow. </p>

<p>Weird. There is much more to the moon than we have been told. </p>

<p>Said a millions times before by just about everyone, <em>There&#39;s nothing to go back for</em>. It&#39;s a moon. There are alot of them, and there&#39;s fuck all on it for us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon&#39;s orbit is very nearly a perfect circle, unlike any other moon in our solar system</p>

<p>This was likely the result of the way it was created, If the theory about being what&#39;s left of a planetary impact is true. Weird, but not un-explainable. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s called tidal locking, and it happens to all moons eventually. Jupiter&#39;s inner moons are all tidal locked as well. IIRC It&#39;s due to the gravitational pull of the planet slowing the orbit till it eventually becomes tethered to only face one direction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-2" data-depth="2" data-id="czbmosx">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">2</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/grigby.html">grigby</a> 2016-01-25</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Actually, tidal locking occurs by a slightly different mechanism. As per the law of gravity, the force decreases with the square of distance. Let&#39;s only consider the gravity the earth exerts on the moon, before it became tidally locked. The near part of the moon will experience a larger pull than the far side. This will cause the moon as a whole to distort into an oblong shape, ever so slightly. Now the moon wishes to rotate, as it always has. Now there&#39;s this large lump of mass that was pulled there by the earth a moment earlier. The attraction to the earth that this lump experiences causes a torque on the moon in the opposite direction to rotation. This torque creates an angular acceleration which will eventually cause the rotation to go to 0 from our reference point. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a0/Tidal_torque.png">This</a> perfect image from wiki shows it perfectly. The moon is the green body and rotated counter-clockwise, the blue arrows are the torque created from the gravity effect lines.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can examine this explanation in terms of energy. As the moon rotates, the earth is always trying to make it oblong by pulling the near side stronger than the far side, so the shape of the moon is continually shifting to meet this force. Imagine how the tides on earth work, the moon pulls one one side and it rises. That&#39;s what the earth is doing to the moon, though its through the rock instead of water. The &quot;highest&quot; point on the moon will always be moving around as it rotates as there&#39;s always a new closest point to the earth. This causes the moon to always shift its shape, which requires enormous amounts of energy. As energy cannot be created, it has to come from somewhere. In this case it is the rotation of the moon as it&#39;s what causes the need for deformation. Eventually, all the excess rotational energy is spent and the moon is tidally locked as this is the lowest energy state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By far the biggest cost of the Apollo program involved life support. Humans are squishy and fragile - they require a constant supply of essential gasses, liquids and nutrients. They produce waste that has to be safely disposed of. They can only handle a limited g-force before their insides turn to goo. They can only survive in a limited temperature range. They have to take frequent periods of rest.</p>

<p>Robots, on the other hand, can be constructed to be far more impervious to damage. They can survive high g-forces, They don&#39;t need to breathe gasses or ingest liquids and proteins, So long as they have a constant supply of electricity, they can operate for much, much longer than a human, all without requiring any sleep.</p>

<p>We <em>have</em> been back to the moon. Many, many times. Even as we speak, there are a not insignificant number of reconnaissance orbiters and rovers on the moon. We are there 24/7. Just not in person.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t been <em>physically</em> back to the moon because there is no need. We can get all the information that we need from remote machines, which are several orders of magnitude cheaper than manned missions, and have the added benefit that if something goes catastrophically wrong, we don&#39;t end up with a bunch of dead humans.</p>

<p>This was all known even before the Apollo and Soviet N1 programs. There were several successful unmanned landings made by both nations before they even started design on the manned programs. Even then, there really wasn&#39;t a need to send humans to the moon. It was little more than a dick-wagging contest which the US happened to win. Once all the fanfare was over, the need to send humans back to the moon just never materialized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orbits tend to either be very elongated, or very nearly circular in general.  Any of the eight planets have orbits that are so close to circular that if you saw them drawn on your computer screen you&#39;d think they were perfect circles. In fact the plants have orbits so nearly perfectly circular that it took a crazy amount of work back in Kepler&#39;s day for him to figure out that they weren&#39;t, quite, perfect circles.  He desperately wanted them to be, it matched with his religious ideas, but the data just didn&#39;t back him.</p>

<p>As for going back, the problem is money, and the fact that the stupid &quot;space race&quot; way the USA went in the first place sucked massively and left no infrastructure in place to make going back easier or cheaper.  Ideally we would have gone by building a space plane, or even something like the old Shuttles, using that to heft up the equipment to make a space station (a real space station, not a little toy like Skylab, Mir, or the ISS), built a big moon ship there, and sent it out to make a single landing and be the core of a permanent colony.</p>

<p>But that won&#39;t let you land live people on the moon before the Soviets, so they went fast and expensive and sloppy, and not only did it wind up killing a few astronauts due to sloppy and fast engineering mistakes, it also resulted in a tiny handful of single use missiles that&#39;d get you there, and get you back in a tiny little lifeboat, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Once America &quot;won&quot; the space race, the money dried up and that was the end of that.  In fact after the first landing there was a lot of movement in Congress to cut funding rather than even go to the expense of launching the other Apollo missions even though they&#39;d already paid for building the missiles.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a space freak, I&#39;d love to say that there&#39;s a great economic reason to go back, but there isn&#39;t.  There aren&#39;t any resources on the moon that can&#39;t be gotten more easily here on Earth, it&#39;d be a massive expense with no real economic payoff to build a colony there, and if you aren&#39;t going to build a colony then why bother going at all?</p>

<p>Mind, I think we <em>SHOULD</em> build a colony there and use it as the hub of a growing human presence in space.  But unless someone can come up with few hundred billion dollars to fund the project it isn&#39;t going to happen anytime soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4- The moon may be hollow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you say that?  If you do the calculations on its orbit you can figure out the moon&#39;s mass, and if its hollow than it&#39;d need to be made out of lead or something equally very massive because otherwise it can&#39;t be in the orbit it&#39;s in.  You don&#39;t even need any really fancy math, just the stuff you&#39;d learn in Calc II and an intro to physics class.</p>

<p>But it damn sure isn&#39;t made out of rock and hollow, not with the orbit it has.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3- The moon&#39;s orbit and its rotation are exactly the same, so we on earth ONLY see the same side and the &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; is always opposite us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, its called tidal locking.  Anytime you&#39;ve got a smaller body very close to a bigger one it tends to happen.  Mars&#39;s moons are also tidally locked, as are the closer moons to Jupiter and Saturn.  Mercury is <em>almost</em> tidal locked with the sun, and probably will be in another billion years or so, right now it rotates so slowly you can walk about as fast as the terminator (the sunrise/sunset line) moves across Mercury.  Well, you can jog about that fast anyway.</p>

<p>Theory is that there was a planet (Theia, about size of mars) between Earth and Mars and around 4.5 billion years ago it collided with Earth and took big chunk of it, and that is how our moon (Luna some even call it Selene) was created.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon&#39;s orbit is very nearly a perfect circle, unlike any other moon in our solar system.</p>

<p>It needs to be like that, there is a reason for this... read below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon&#39;s orbit and its rotation are exactly the same, so we on earth ONLY see the same side and the &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; is always opposite us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they are not well not always at least, i also thought Luna was fixed but no, Luna is adopting over time because Luna is actually going away from Earth about less then 2 centimeters per year, therefor in order for the dark side always be the dark side from Earth&#39;s perspective Luna needs to adjust its orbit, rotation, speed etc. and at some point will brake off from Earth&#39;s gravity. If we assume that Luna is by definition a natural object in space, what i don&#39;t understand is how can nature do this with such precision ? I really have no idea lol there are much bigger things about our moon that its simply not allowed to public :[</p>

<p>Who knows maybe Luna over certain period of time become an artificial HQ for observations over Earth for what ever reason.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t use it because their politically-driven space program kept engineers from reporting bad news, such as slipping deadlines and glaringly obvious engineering mistakes. The result was that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N1_(rocket)">N1 rocket</a> (the Soviet&#39;s answer to the Saturn V) exploded rather spectacularly on the launch pad and took most of the Baikonur launch complex with it.</p>

<p>The fear of radiation had nothing to do with it. The real reason was that the Soviets were simply never able to get the N1 to work.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s tough to gauge why people react different ways, but in terms of the Apollo landings people keep repeating the same points of conjecture over and over without any <em>actual</em> evidence while there is an overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary, which people may get tired of hearing.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s definitely a compelling read, all he does is make numerous circumstantial claims, but provides no concrete evidence of what he is saying while deliberately misrepresenting certain things due to his lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>His claims about the moon rocks are dishonest at best and absolutely fabricated at worst.  His claims about shadows show a misunderstanding of how single vs. multiple light sources act.  He also intentionally obfuscates the point about the Laser Ranging Experiment as well as how the Soviets &quot;placed&quot; their laser ranging targets.  Again, these are claims that sound legitimate at first glance, but anybody willing to do some secondary research will see that they suspiciously lack any evidence.</p>

<p>What do you believe is the most compelling piece of concrete evidence for the fact that we didn&#39;t go to the moon?</p>
