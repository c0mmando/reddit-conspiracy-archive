<p>The fact that he would be committing <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/mcm/bl134-26.htm">a very serious felony</a> and risking several tens of thousands of dollars in fines as well as several years <em>in prison</em> if he were impersonating a military officer means that he is not likely trolling and impersonating an officer in the United States military (unless, of course, you think he&#39;s willing to risk such very real-life punishment via the UCMJ 134 just so places like 4chan can crown him &quot;troll of the week&quot;).  As such, it seems he in all likelihood <em>is</em> in fact an officer in the United States military.</p>

<p>If he hasn&#39;t been issued any &quot;cease and desist&quot; orders by any of his superior officers or command staff, then that seems to go a long way toward giving weight to what he is saying (and <em>why</em> he is saying it).</p>

<p>EDIT:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORK09cTxGWY#t=19m27s">This</a> is a timestamp of him explaining the legal and military impetus and motivation behind what he is doing.</p>

<p>What’s your “verifiable evidence”?  It’s all the school book writers and MSM pundits going on tv and telling you that “such and such” is the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but random people spouting crap with no evidence whatsoever and nothing to back up their claim on this earth are telling the truth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Random people” who’ve been in the military, who have degrees in law with active private practices, and who are siblings of powerful presidents.</p>

<p>You’re working really hard at protecting that world view you had indoctrinated into you since childhood.</p>

<p>Some security blankets are hard to let go of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>simply because they say so? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corroboration on a given subject by disparate, unrelated sources is scientifically validating, and when the corroborators are disparate, unrelated military and civilian personnel, then it is simply unintelligent (not to mention unscientific) to discard such information (as you are doing here).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously, explain to me how you justify this, I&#39;m genuinely interested in the hoop-jumping you have to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoop-jumping&quot;.  That you call what I’m doing such only shows A) how little you know about what I&#39;m doing or talking about, and B) just how stuck you are in the very superficial level of thinking you’ve had indoctrinated into you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s quite a bit of evidence that points directly <em>against</em> that MSM data, however.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  That is absolutely an option too.  However, the fact that his testimony is backed up and corroborated by various other disparate sources strongly indicates that he is not being sent in as a disinformation agent.  Laura Eisenhower (great grand daughter of president Dwight D. Eisenhower), Andrew Basiago, and Corey Goode have all gone on record talking about the very same topics that Cramer has talked about, and they all did this before they had any awareness of each other’s existence, so it’s not like they colluded with each other on this.</p>

<p>That, again, lends great weight to Cramer <em>not</em> being sent out by his military superiors to spin fanciful yarns.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you think the governments of the world <em>haven’t</em> been in contact with ETs, then you have a lot of research to do, sir - because there is an absolute ton of evidence showing pretty definitively that they have been.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s the sort of thing that makes the A-Bomb look like slingshot pellets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now ask yourself how multiple members of the military are able to leak a national security secret on the scale of alien contact?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is not only an easy one, but one that Captain Cramer has spelled out quite a bit himself.  This planet isn’t ruled by ONE HEAD HONCHO that runs everything and calls the shots to everyone.  It is composed of various very powerful factions all vying for more power - all of which tend to backstab each other to get the upper hand.  Some of those factions could care less for the 99%.  Other <em>do</em> very much care about the welfare of the species.  According to captain Cramer’s own words, he represents forces that wish to restore order to the constitution of the United States.  Those forces have enough power of their own to protect him and keep him from getting immediately shut down or killed by those other forces that, as you intimated above, would prevent “national security secrets on the scale of alien contact”.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Just answered that as far as Captain Cramer goes.  Corey Goode has mentioned having the backing of certain senior command staff as well - although his situation seems quite a bit more unstable than captain Cramer’s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What makes a military man so much more trustworthy a source than anyone else?</p>

<p>Because, as I already mentioned captain Cramer stating, he would be committing a prosecutable felony if he were lying.</p>

<p>Incorrect.  Eisenhower signed a law into effect toward the end of his presidency making it the highest priority for the proper forces to exercise their ability to restore constitutional order to the country if and when that constitution was becoming undermined by forces that illegally wrested power from the country.</p>

<p>Such is the country we live in today.</p>

<p>As such, the real forces committing treason here are actually those who are supporting and acting in accord with the illegal system that was put in power in the United States.  Those who are fighting <em>against</em> that illegal system are actually the ones serving the highest order of The Constitution itself.  <a href="http://boardofwisdom.com/cachetogo/images/quotes/151.png">Treason is the last thing Cramer is committing.</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What buoys his information is the fact that what he says is corroborated by various other civilian and military individuals completely unrelated to him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more difficult to say he&#39;s just making shit up when other individuals who don&#39;t know him also said similar things.</p>

This is a young age to begin such dangerous service and tends to strain the credibility of anybody offering such an account. Seventeen was, however, the average age of the five Mars jumpers that have been identified as being among the 10 American teenagers who were trained to go to Mars by Major Ed Dames at College of the Siskiyous in Summer 1980. They were: Barack H. Obama, born 8/4/61 (age 19), Andrew D. Basiago, born 9/18/61 (age 18), William C. McCool, born 9/23/61 (age 18), Regina E. Dugan, born 3/19/63 (age 17), and William B. Stillings, born 12/22/66 (age 13). Do the math. 19+18+18+17+13 = 85. 85/5 = 17. Clearly, the fact that Randy stated that his age at onset of training was 17 without knowing that this was the average age of our cadre of Mars visitors when we began training is probative of his claims.</p>

<p>Your mind is the one that doesn&#39;t work too well.  Either way it doesn&#39;t matter, and existence will go on regardless of whatever it is you think is the case.</p>
