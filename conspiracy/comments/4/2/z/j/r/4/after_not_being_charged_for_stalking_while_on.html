        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Kenosha County, WI – This week, former police officer Steven Zelich pleaded guilty to killing a woman, putting her body in a suitcase, and leaving it on the side of the highway. The victim, 19-year-old Jenny Gamez, was found stuffed in a suitcase along a highway in Wisconsin in August of 2012.</p>

<p>Gamez was not the only woman that Zelich was accused of killing either. He has also been implicated in the murder of a 37-year-old woman from Minnesota named Laura Simonson. Simpson’s body was also found in a suitcase along the same highway where Gamez was found.  </p>

<p>Zelich has a history of troubling incidents during his time as a police officer and many of the events surrounding his career would have landed a non-police officer in jail.</p>

<p>According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Zelich was forced to resign, but never charged after a series of troubling incidents, including one in May 2001 in which a woman ran, crying, from his apartment in her underwear.</p>

<p>For years, Zelich stalked workers at a salon, often hanging outside and threatening the workers. In one of the complaints, the victim stated that Zelich startled her.</p>

<p>“She stated that he scared the heck out of her and she told him so,” the report says. “His reply was that he was supposed to scare people.”</p>

<p>The list goes on. Multiple women, two dancers and a bartender, filed complaints against Zelich for entering a gentleman’s club, in uniform and demanding dates. Zelich refused to take no for an answer.</p>

<p>Other women in different areas describe similar incidents, including a victim who said Zelich called her at least 1,000 times.</p>

<p>“She stated that she has moved three times in the past eight years and changed her telephone number,” the records say.“Each time this would happen Officer Zelich would have her new unlisted telephone number and address. He would call her at home and would send her birthday cards, greeting cards and Christmas cards.”</p>

<p>After countless complaints against this stalking maniac, the department finally launched an investigation. They found that he was using the department computers to run multiple women’s license plates to get their addresses, names, and numbers.</p>
