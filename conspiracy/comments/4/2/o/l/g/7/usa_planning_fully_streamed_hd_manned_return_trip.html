       States have sent rovers to the moon (China in 2013), but it's been public projects. Space-X could do it, I suppose, but they've invested in other more potentially commercial ventures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the idea underestimates the decade of R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D a private company would have to invest to potentially pull in maybe a billion USD on one pay-per-view. Every pay-per-view afterwards would have diminishing returns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's absurd to think no company or investment entity has considered it and done the math. It's easy to speculate from the cheap seats.

       I'm not familiar with pay per view, but from my understanding, if you don't pay then you don't view isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You paid with your taxes, you're entitled to look at the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robbing you of that right to rack up some more money would be frowned upon, if not illegal i assume?

       <p>
        The Apollo program cost $25 billion to supposedly complete six return trips
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's thing thing called inflation. The Apollo program cost in today's money 110 billion dollars. So you're doing one trip, which is about 6 billion saved in the actual rockets and materials. You still have to do the R&amp;D, you still have to build the new design, you still have to test the shit out of it, and you still have to launch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't delude yourself that we could get away with using a Saturn V again. Space safety guidelines have been increased so much in the last half-century that you'd be laughed out of the boardroom for even suggesting it. The cost of the the program would still be 100 Billion easily, provided that number didn't increase exponentially due to the higher need for safety tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I'm on the topic of money, let's do some math.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are approximately 7.241 billion people on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every person on earth would need to pay 13 US dollars to equal 100 billion in US currency. (I'm doing ll of this in US money, to save time).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, not every person would be in a position to pay, either economically or socially, so lets subtract them:
      </p>
      <p>
       Take off roughly half of the Asian/Middle eastern region, due to simple lack of money, lack of ability, or lack of interest. That's around-a-bout 2.5 billion less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less 2/3rds of Africa (I'm being very conservative here) so that's another 800 million gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then take off half of south america, again due to lack of interest or ability, which is another 210-or-so million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bearing in mind that there are other areas where people would have to be subtracted, such as Oceania and Europe, that totals up to basically 3.4 billion people who wouldn't be paying. That is, of course, if the Chinese government and the Russian governments allow their citizens to pay, because if they don't, that fucks the whole system much much further.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves us with roughly 3.85 billion people. Ideally, they'd all pay, but let's knock off a third for people who just wont. (Again, this number would be far far higher in reality, probably closer to 2/3).
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves us with very roughly 2.7 billion people. This brings each persons total to about 40 US dollars, which would turn even more people off, increasing the total, which would turn more people off..... e.t.c.

       You see where I'm going with this? With a government paying half, it's still be too needlessly economically complicated to organize, and you'd basically be adding the equivalent of shareholders to the project, getting angry when delays occur, and god forbid there's an accident, or everyone leaves and you're fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason no one has organised this is the same as no one has gone back to the moon. It's too complicated for basically no gain but to prove a bunch of people who repeat the same debunked crap over and over again wrong. We'll go back eventually, we just need to be able to make it worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the wall, but It looked painfull as a block.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Too complicated to open source the money, cost of program would be basically the same.

       Nobody has conclusively demonstrated that merely changing the tape speed would have produced the behavior seen on the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       His claim about how high people might have jumped ignores the simple fact that the astronauts were wearing 200 lbs in extra gear - even with the lower gravity, I'd like to see anyone jump very high with that much extra gear on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and like many of the "apollo was a hoax" folks, this author completely ignores the 14,000 pictures that were taken on the various missions. Funny how that doesn't weigh in to any of his considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
       To sum up, a lot of handwaving, a lot of "What if" or "Why this", but no actual scientific analysis or real evidence to challenge what was done.

The rest of the parts are extremely informative, and covered many points that I had never heard before (including your question about the pictures taken).

       So part two has more handwaving, including "How can something that looks like this actually land on the moon and take off again?" - which, last I checked, it not a real scientific analysis. It also has the standard claim about "untested" technology - never mind the fact that all portions of the lander were tested in various ways - including apollo 10, which tested every phase of the process except landing on the moon itself. They orbited to within 60 miles of the surface, and tested the full process that would be needed to ascend from the moon back to the command module. And despite the author's claims that "Despite the completely foreign environment, they worked perfectly the very first time and every time thereafter!", there were various incidents on almost every mission to show that not everything worked perfectly. Again, on Apollo 10 they had a malfunction with the thrusters that nearly doomed the mission.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Upon separation of the descent stage and ascent engine ignition, the Lunar Module began to roll violently due to the crew accidentally duplicating commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver.[15] The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM. Cernan has said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over, indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under ascent engine power. While the incident was downplayed by NASA, the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable, which would have resulted in the LM crashing into the lunar surface.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So once again, this "scientific" analysis of the moon landings is anything but, missing incidents that it took me less than five minutes to research. I'll continue reading through at least the next part or two, but so far I can say that I am less than impressed with this "analysis".

       You're cherry picking. What about the Van Allen Belts? Or the extreme changes in temperature? Or the micro space dust? Or the pictures that have the exact same background as pictures taken from different Apollo missions? Or the absence of a crater underneath the landing module? Or the fact that they were able to bring a transforming rover without making any significant changes to the spaceship they used?

       I get that a lot of this is speculative, but at the same time, so is the "true" story as told by NASA. They claim to have evidence to back up the claims, but where is all of the flight data from all of the Apollo missions? Pictures can easily be photoshopped, I'd like to see some actual data.

       Okay, I've had a chance to look through part 3. First half of this section is on the timing of the launches. There was a lot going on during the late 60s and early 70s and it's almost inevitable that some of the launches would be timed "conveniently" for some part of the government, at least if you are of a particularly paranoid mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second half of this section covers the van allen belt and radiation, and is almost entirely devoid of any hard, specific details on how much radiation the astronauts could expect to encounter. The link in my previous post contains a very detailed debunking of this tired argument. As far as radiation that they could encounter on the surface, that's a different matter entirely and is something that will have to be planned around, as astronauts will (hopefully!) eventually be on the surface for much longer periods of time than just a day or two.

       There are a lot of things we are told about space that do not make sense.  But we are soaked in an environment where it is beyond questioning.  The largest shock to my world view was when I saw the space fraud for what it was.  It was like a spell was broken.  It really is so thinly veiled once you allow yourself to look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger, I knew that the space 'photos' taken by telescopes were not actual photos, but colorized representations.  The explanation was that they had to be in order to see anything, but still I wondered why all the images were like this.  I was blocked from thinking further in this line because every person around me and every media I could access never suggested the possibility of it being fraudulent.  How could a thought be considered if every influence around me dismissed it as nonsense?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have viewed very little of the material from NASA that is supposed to constitute proof of their achievements.  We get our ideas and images of space from tv and movies.  The amount of fraud in the area of 'space' is so large that I consider it an obfuscation of information pertinent to the meaning of our existence.  The generally accepted cosmology is full of holes plugged by circular reasoning.  Concepts are invented and presumed to exist because without them previous assumptions made no longer work.  An example is "dark matter", pure pseudo-science nonsense, doubling down on previous dogma.

       Well said, and to add to it, the Newtonian/Heliocentric sciences/math/physics/space/etc are all steeped in secret societies/the occult/ancient mystery schools. We claim to say they are evil and have alternative motives/agendas in one sense, yet at the very same time support them in other narratives. Either knowingly, or more likely, unknowingly. This is why I question (after, as you've said, woken from the trance).

       Because it's really expensive and risky. The upfront costs alone are enormous and what would happen if the rocket exploded on the launch pad and you end up live streaming the death of all the crew on board? But hey, maybe you're on to something. Why don't you try to get investors?

       I'm not saying it it was okay to do anything, but people are more likely to risk money and lives for the possible scientific benefit and the glory of being first.

       The fact is why go back? We already learned a lot about the moon. We already won the glory. Why go back when we could go forward to Mars instead.

       Sure I'd watch it, but I'd much rather the space agencies of the world focus on taking man to Mars or other places rather than go back to the moon and discover nothing new.

       Why go back? That's like people in Europe saying not to explore the new world when Columbus travelled. Except it's literally a new world. The amount of Tech and knowledge that we would develop in the process of actually colonizing the moon is worth it. To think they figured it out 40 years ago, did it 6 times with no problem, while we still have trouble getting to low earth orbit... Right

       Except there is nothing but dust on the moon. The new world had people and plants and animals that had never been seen. Not to mention gold and silver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sailing to the new world was hard, but ultimately just required building homes somewhere else that already humans were already adapted for. Colonizing the moon requires building a home in a place entirely alien to us. There is no food. No water. No air. The technology required to colonize it is far more advanced than what was required to simply visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are going to colonize anywhere, it's probably going to be a place like Mars. Where there is at least an atmosphere and a possible source of water. We may colonize the moon eventually, but until we have the technology there isn't much reason to visit.

       Not so obvious to me. Looks like they're on a hill.

        The effect is most pronounced and blatantly obvious from 1:15 until the end of the video. You can clearly see that the stone is flat and is simply a part of the 2D mountain backdrop image.

       It'd be a roughly 8 day long event, you're vastly overestimating the general publics attention span. people would be bored 30 minutes after launch. We'd get some cool photos of the earth, some more video of people walking on the moon and then the return trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       People wouldn't buy it, and we'd gain nothing scientifically from it. But hey, of you think there is interest why not shop the idea around to people like Elon Musk and whoever else is pioneering private space travel.

       Are you going to watch all 8 days? Probably not, I'd be willing to bet you and a majority of people would watch the launch, the lunar approach and landing, lunar launch and the atmospheric reentery.

       You don't understand how boring that would be to watch. 80% of the journey would be a black screen or stars if you're lucky and the camera doesn't get contrasted to fuck by the sunlight hitting something on the ship. The landing would get views, but you would have alot of time to fill.

       You know I point this out to people all the time.  The damn Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter cost us $583 million.  When I look up top end video camera's I am hard pressed to find one for over $1000...
      </p>
      <p>
       WE are paying for this shit, why can't we just get a camera dedicated to viewing the earth on every single satellite.  The battery on the Mars Opportunity Rover has lasted since 2003 and is still kicking so it is not like we don't have the ability to maintain a constant stream.

       When I saw your post I (naively) thought to myself "Alright! ask and you shall receive!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well done.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the technology is so obviously there and yet we don't have it should piss people off.

       We throw billions of dollars at it already.  I am not talking about a manned trip, I am talking about a camera that sees like you and I see.

      <p>
       The lunar orbiter sees and analyzes the moon in
       <a href="http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/instruments.html">
        six different ways
       </a>
       none of which actually give us an idea of what the human eye would see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not suggesting that we have some startup build their own space program, I am suggesting that we start putting actual video equipment on the orbiters and satellites that we already send.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cost of a camera and perhaps some sort of gyroscopic system that keeps it pointed in the right direction would interest enough people to pay for itself if properly marketed, and I am surely not the first guy to come up with this idea.

       The problem is that it's expensive. You can't just run down to best buy, grab and camera and duct tape it to a rocket. You need specialized equipment that can function in space. You need people to design that equipment. It has to go all the way to space. That's expensive. And for what purpose? To prove to conspiracy theorists that we really went to the moon? No offense, but it's just not that important.

       Even if its a hundred times more expensive, a $100,000 camera still fits into a $583 million budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it doesn't then surely it could garner enough interest to pay for itself.

       My best guess is that space has already been militarized and divided up between humans &amp; aliens, and, humans have gotten the worst of the deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we can't reveal aliens explicitly (total meltdown) we have to reveal them subtly, with "disclosure" conferences and Hollywood movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I do think that the flat earth/concave earth theories have already tapped into the idea that outer space is a "protected" space - no civvies allowed.

        The Apollo program cost $25 billion to supposedly complete six return trips
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's thing thing called inflation. The Apollo program cost in today's money 110 billion dollars. So you're doing one trip, which is about 6 billion saved in the actual rockets and materials. You still have to do the R&amp;D, you still have to build the new design, you still have to test the shit out of it, and you still have to launch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't delude yourself that we could get away with using a Saturn V again. Space safety guidelines have been increased so much in the last half-century that you'd be laughed out of the boardroom for even suggesting it. The cost of the the program would still be 100 Billion easily, provided that number didn't increase exponentially due to the higher need for safety tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I'm on the topic of money, let's do some math.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are approximately 7.241 billion people on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every person on earth would need to pay 13 US dollars to equal 100 billion in US currency. (I'm doing ll of this in US money, to save time).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, not every person would be in a position to pay, either economically or socially, so lets subtract them:
      </p>
      <p>
       Take off roughly half of the Asian/Middle eastern region, due to simple lack of money, lack of ability, or lack of interest. That's around-a-bout 2.5 billion less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less 2/3rds of Africa (I'm being very conservative here) so that's another 800 million gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then take off half of south america, again due to lack of interest or ability, which is another 210-or-so million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bearing in mind that there are other areas where people would have to be subtracted, such as Oceania and Europe, that totals up to basically 3.4 billion people who wouldn't be paying. That is, of course, if the Chinese government and the Russian governments allow their citizens to pay, because if they don't, that fucks the whole system much much further.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves us with roughly 3.85 billion people. Ideally, they'd all pay, but let's knock off a third for people who just wont. (Again, this number would be far far higher in reality, probably closer to 2/3).
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves us with very roughly 2.7 billion people. This brings each persons total to about 40 US dollars, which would turn even more people off, increasing the total, which would turn more people off..... e.t.c.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see where I'm going with this? With a government paying half, it's still be too needlessly economically complicated to organize, and you'd basically be adding the equivalent of shareholders to the project, getting angry when delays occur, and god forbid there's an accident, or everyone leaves and you're fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason no one has organised this is the same as no one has gone back to the moon. It's too complicated for basically no gain but to prove a bunch of people who repeat the same debunked crap over and over again wrong. We'll go back eventually, we just need to be able to make it worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the wall, but It looked painfull as a block.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Too complicated to open source the money, cost of program would be basically the same.
