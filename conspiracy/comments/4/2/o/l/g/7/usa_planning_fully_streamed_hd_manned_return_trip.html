    <div class="md"><p>States have sent rovers to the moon (China in 2013), but it&#39;s been public projects. Space-X could do it, I suppose, but they&#39;ve invested in other more potentially commercial ventures.</p>

<p>I think the idea underestimates the decade of R&amp;amp;amp;amp;D a private company would have to invest to potentially pull in maybe a billion USD on one pay-per-view. Every pay-per-view afterwards would have diminishing returns.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s absurd to think no company or investment entity has considered it and done the math. It&#39;s easy to speculate from the cheap seats.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Apollo program cost $25 billion to supposedly complete six return trips</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s thing thing called inflation. The Apollo program cost in today&#39;s money 110 billion dollars. So you&#39;re doing one trip, which is about 6 billion saved in the actual rockets and materials. You still have to do the R&amp;D, you still have to build the new design, you still have to test the shit out of it, and you still have to launch it. </p>

<p>And don&#39;t delude yourself that we could get away with using a Saturn V again. Space safety guidelines have been increased so much in the last half-century that you&#39;d be laughed out of the boardroom for even suggesting it. The cost of the the program would still be 100 Billion easily, provided that number didn&#39;t increase exponentially due to the higher need for safety tests.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;m on the topic of money, let&#39;s do some math. </p>

<p>There are approximately 7.241 billion people on earth. </p>

<p>Every person on earth would need to pay 13 US dollars to equal 100 billion in US currency. (I&#39;m doing ll of this in US money, to save time).</p>

<p>However, not every person would be in a position to pay, either economically or socially, so lets subtract them:</p>

<p>Take off roughly half of the Asian/Middle eastern region, due to simple lack of money, lack of ability, or lack of interest. That&#39;s around-a-bout 2.5 billion less. </p>

<p>Less 2/3rds of Africa (I&#39;m being very conservative here) so that&#39;s another 800 million gone.</p>

<p>Then take off half of south america, again due to lack of interest or ability, which is another 210-or-so million. </p>

<p>Bearing in mind that there are other areas where people would have to be subtracted, such as Oceania and Europe, that totals up to basically 3.4 billion people who wouldn&#39;t be paying. That is, of course, if the Chinese government and the Russian governments allow their citizens to pay, because if they don&#39;t, that fucks the whole system much much further.</p>

<p>That leaves us with roughly 3.85 billion people. Ideally, they&#39;d all pay, but let&#39;s knock off a third for people who just wont. (Again, this number would be far far higher in reality, probably closer to 2/3).</p>

<p>That leaves us with very roughly 2.7 billion people. This brings each persons total to about 40 US dollars, which would turn even more people off, increasing the total, which would turn more people off..... e.t.c.</p>

<p>You see where I&#39;m going with this? With a government paying half, it&#39;s still be too needlessly economically complicated to organize, and you&#39;d basically be adding the equivalent of shareholders to the project, getting angry when delays occur, and god forbid there&#39;s an accident, or everyone leaves and you&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>The reason no one has organised this is the same as no one has gone back to the moon. It&#39;s too complicated for basically no gain but to prove a bunch of people who repeat the same debunked crap over and over again wrong. We&#39;ll go back eventually, we just need to be able to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall, but It looked painfull as a block.</p>

<p>TL;DR Too complicated to open source the money, cost of program would be basically the same.</p>

<p>When Americans can involuntarily have $1.5 trillion of their tax dollars spent on a war they didn&#39;t want, the entire population of planet Earth could certainly afford a few billion for a trip to the moon.</p>

<p>This comparison doesn&#39;t even make sense. Because the government can spend tax money on war, everyone should donate to launch a rocket?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I highly doubt it would cost anywhere near that much anyway considering we&#39;re talking about 60s technology</p>

<p>Not in your wildest dreams would the Apollo program&#39;s vehicles be acceptable by modern standards. <em>That&#39;s the problem. You have to redesign everything, which pulls the costs way the fuck up</em>.</p>

<p>Did you see the video I posted in my edit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the video showing the lunar soil being flung in a way that is only possible in a vacuum, which would imply that it&#39;s either in a 100+ x 100+ vacuum chamber, or on the Moon? Yeah, saw it. Seen it before actually, it&#39;s quite breathtaking. </p>

<p>And for the record, the line you&#39;re talking about is a valley. </p>

<p>Nobody has conclusively demonstrated that merely changing the tape speed would have produced the behavior seen on the videos. </p>

<p>His claim about how high people might have jumped ignores the simple fact that the astronauts were wearing 200 lbs in extra gear - even with the lower gravity, I&#39;d like to see anyone jump very high with that much extra gear on them. </p>

<p>Oh, and like many of the &quot;apollo was a hoax&quot; folks, this author completely ignores the 14,000 pictures that were taken on the various missions. Funny how that doesn&#39;t weigh in to any of his considerations. </p>

<p>To sum up, a lot of handwaving, a lot of &quot;What if&quot; or &quot;Why this&quot;, but no actual scientific analysis or real evidence to challenge what was done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this and respond. For the record, that link was just part 1 of 13 (just click next at the bottom of the page). The rest of the parts are extremely informative, and covered many points that I had never heard before (including your question about the pictures taken). The author does a great job at explaining his theories, the debunker&#39;s arguments, and why they don&#39;t hold water.</p>

<p>Please keep reading, because there is a ton of scientific analysis to challenge what was done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So part two has more handwaving, including &quot;How can something that looks like this actually land on the moon and take off again?&quot; - which, last I checked, it not a real scientific analysis. It also has the standard claim about &quot;untested&quot; technology - never mind the fact that all portions of the lander were tested in various ways - including apollo 10, which tested every phase of the process except landing on the moon itself. They orbited to within 60 miles of the surface, and tested the full process that would be needed to ascend from the moon back to the command module. And despite the author&#39;s claims that &quot;Despite the completely foreign environment, they worked perfectly the very first time and every time thereafter!&quot;, there were various incidents on almost every mission to show that not everything worked perfectly. Again, on Apollo 10 they had a malfunction with the thrusters that nearly doomed the mission.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon separation of the descent stage and ascent engine ignition, the Lunar Module began to roll violently due to the crew accidentally duplicating commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver.[15] The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM. Cernan has said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over, indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under ascent engine power. While the incident was downplayed by NASA, the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable, which would have resulted in the LM crashing into the lunar surface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So once again, this &quot;scientific&quot; analysis of the moon landings is anything but, missing incidents that it took me less than five minutes to research. I&#39;ll continue reading through at least the next part or two, but so far I can say that I am less than impressed with this &quot;analysis&quot;. </p>

<p>I get that a lot of this is speculative, but at the same time, so is the &quot;true&quot; story as told by NASA. They claim to have evidence to back up the claims, but where is all of the flight data from all of the Apollo missions? Pictures can easily be photoshopped, I&#39;d like to see some actual data.</p>

<p>Some simple research shows that they used one of the existing storage compartments on the lander module. <a href="http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/lunar-rover-designing-and-unpacking-car-moon">Here</a> is an article about it including links to official NASA documentation. </p>

<p>I am at work now so I can&#39;t go through any of the additional portions of the author&#39;s article at the moment, but I will go through at least one or two more and comment on them as I have time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;ve had a chance to look through part 3. First half of this section is on the timing of the launches. There was a lot going on during the late 60s and early 70s and it&#39;s almost inevitable that some of the launches would be timed &quot;conveniently&quot; for some part of the government, at least if you are of a particularly paranoid mindset. </p>

<p>The second half of this section covers the van allen belt and radiation, and is almost entirely devoid of any hard, specific details on how much radiation the astronauts could expect to encounter. The link in my previous post contains a very detailed debunking of this tired argument. As far as radiation that they could encounter on the surface, that&#39;s a different matter entirely and is something that will have to be planned around, as astronauts will (hopefully!) eventually be on the surface for much longer periods of time than just a day or two. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of things we are told about space that do not make sense.  But we are soaked in an environment where it is beyond questioning.  The largest shock to my world view was when I saw the space fraud for what it was.  It was like a spell was broken.  It really is so thinly veiled once you allow yourself to look at it.  </p>

<p>When I was younger, I knew that the space &#39;photos&#39; taken by telescopes were not actual photos, but colorized representations.  The explanation was that they had to be in order to see anything, but still I wondered why all the images were like this.  I was blocked from thinking further in this line because every person around me and every media I could access never suggested the possibility of it being fraudulent.  How could a thought be considered if every influence around me dismissed it as nonsense?</p>

<p>Most people have viewed very little of the material from NASA that is supposed to constitute proof of their achievements.  We get our ideas and images of space from tv and movies.  The amount of fraud in the area of &#39;space&#39; is so large that I consider it an obfuscation of information pertinent to the meaning of our existence.  The generally accepted cosmology is full of holes plugged by circular reasoning.  Concepts are invented and presumed to exist because without them previous assumptions made no longer work.  An example is &quot;dark matter&quot;, pure pseudo-science nonsense, doubling down on previous dogma.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t delude yourself that we could get away with using a Saturn V again. Space safety guidelines have been increased so much in the last half-century that you&#39;d be laughed out of the boardroom for even suggesting it. The cost of the the program would still be 100 Billion easily, provided that number didn&#39;t increase exponentially due to the higher need for safety tests.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;m on the topic of money, let&#39;s do some math. </p>

<p>There are approximately 7.241 billion people on earth. </p>

<p>Every person on earth would need to pay 13 US dollars to equal 100 billion in US currency. (I&#39;m doing ll of this in US money, to save time).</p>

<p>However, not every person would be in a position to pay, either economically or socially, so lets subtract them:</p>

<p>Take off roughly half of the Asian/Middle eastern region, due to simple lack of money, lack of ability, or lack of interest. That&#39;s around-a-bout 2.5 billion less. </p>

<p>Less 2/3rds of Africa (I&#39;m being very conservative here) so that&#39;s another 800 million gone.</p>

<p>Then take off half of south america, again due to lack of interest or ability, which is another 210-or-so million. </p>

<p>Bearing in mind that there are other areas where people would have to be subtracted, such as Oceania and Europe, that totals up to basically 3.4 billion people who wouldn&#39;t be paying. That is, of course, if the Chinese government and the Russian governments allow their citizens to pay, because if they don&#39;t, that fucks the whole system much much further.</p>

<p>That leaves us with roughly 3.85 billion people. Ideally, they&#39;d all pay, but let&#39;s knock off a third for people who just wont. (Again, this number would be far far higher in reality, probably closer to 2/3).</p>

<p>That leaves us with very roughly 2.7 billion people. This brings each persons total to about 40 US dollars, which would turn even more people off, increasing the total, which would turn more people off..... e.t.c.</p>

<p>You see where I&#39;m going with this? With a government paying half, it&#39;s still be too needlessly economically complicated to organize, and you&#39;d basically be adding the equivalent of shareholders to the project, getting angry when delays occur, and god forbid there&#39;s an accident, or everyone leaves and you&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>The reason no one has organised this is the same as no one has gone back to the moon. It&#39;s too complicated for basically no gain but to prove a bunch of people who repeat the same debunked crap over and over again wrong. We&#39;ll go back eventually, we just need to be able to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall, but It looked painfull as a block.</p>

<p>TL;DR Too complicated to open source the money, cost of program would be basically the same.</p>
