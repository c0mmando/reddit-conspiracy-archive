      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly 
speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during 
his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, 
some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the 
whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would 
have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, 
ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. 
But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to 
possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. 
Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war 
with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The 
enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed 
that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles) -- the frightening thing was that it might all be true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened -- that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?
       </p>
       <p>
        The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, 
Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as 
short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only 
in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. 
And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -if all records 
told the same tale -- then the lie passed into history and became truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         'Who controls the past,'
        </strong>
        ran the Party slogan,
        <strong>
         'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'
        </strong>
        And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed 
was an unending series of victories over your own memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         'Reality control',
        </em>
        they called it: in Newspeak,
        <em>
         'doublethink'.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         'Stand easy!'
        </em>
        barked the instructress, a little more genially.
       </p>
       <p>
        Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. 
His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know 
and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling 
carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which 
cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of 
them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim 
to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the 
guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then 
to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and 
then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process 
to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce 
unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act 
of hypnosis you had just performed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even to understand the word
        <em>
         'doublethink'
        </em>
        involved the use of doublethink.

       The victors write the history books. Pretty crazy to see how easily manipulated our history is, and how extremely biased it is as well.  This is a war against our minds...and it always has been. We've been terribly deceived, and the powers at be, or "controllers," ultimately want to get 100% control of our mind. Here in the West we are deep into the mind-control programming that we see, hear, and observe everyday.   They have turned reality into an orchestrated script, and they make us believe it is naturally true; that's what gives them their power, because we believe and support and put our energy into this script.  We fight over it, debate over it, agree on it, and we keep it real.  Not to rant, but always remember, no matter where you are in the world, we are as free as we ever could be right now at this very moment, and nobody has true power over you, except YOU, unless you choose to give them your power.  We're in this together, and we always have been.  I know this sub highlights a lot of the dark that goes on in our reality, which I agree people need to become aware of, but it is time to accept it for what it is and choose to grow and move on from it.

       Inspirational and all, but it's only true metaphysically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physically, people in jail and prison are not reading this. In fact most of the world can't read this because they are so oppressed they've pretty much only heard about computers and the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you want to start up a ______ to try make this flowery talk true, you're completely full of it. I'm defiantly open to doing ______ with you though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone, literally everyone, needs to be aware before we can move on. Otherwise we're growing and moving in the wrong direction. We haven't even made it close to a half way point in one damn country. Talk about dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to take this attitude with you. I know you're trying to help. I've done a lot of activism and people always say this kind of broad flowery stuff when things are so obviously going badly. It does nothing but give people the excuse to not work as hard because we've already accomplished 'so much.' That's how movements die, if the cops don't get them first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep it real, always, no matter how dark real is. Truth is the guiding light, not flowery talk.

       This.  The pursuit of truth and knowledge sets us free, and our standard for society should be the same.  To give up and call it human nature is just internalization that the world cannot change and we should let the corrupt powers that be continue with their agenda.  And to internalize their agenda for your well being.

       Well I really didn't mean it to come across as flowery talk, what I'm talking about is gaining true liberation from our minds.  We've been engraved with a false reality that everyone thinks is truth, as you probably already know, there's real estate up for grabs in our minds that they would love to take if not have already taken.  But yeah I know, there are millions behind bars, people being tortured, constrained in war camps, etc. etc that are physically trapped and really can't do anything to get out of those situations, it's a really good point, but I think we have to realize this is a collective thing.  Millions of people are letting this happen when they know it's going on.  The very people that are torturing others in war camps and prisons are victims of the same mind-control program that the majority are trapped in.  And you're exactly right, it takes awareness to transcend this shit.  As it seems to get worse and worse and the news seems to get darker and darker, we can look at it as a good thing or a bad thing; the way I look at it is the bad shit is showing the mass collective a reality that we must choose not to prefer any longer if we wish to move on from it.  But obviously it starts at the individual level making the choice to show different, most truth aligned actions within themselves and they will see more of that in the reality in front of them.  We've gone through thousands of years of being limited through these devastating systems that people have put in place here on the Earth, but now we've reached a time where information is almost limitless, a quantum age is on the horizon and new systems are going to rise from the ashes of the crumbling old-ways of doing things.  Things are still going to get ugly, but the very fact that I can talk to you through this means we've somehow made our future a tad brighter.  We are bridging huge communication gaps that we've lacked in the reality for so long.  It's definitely hard to stay optimistic about the future of our species with all this shit going on, but these old games of division and separation the "controllers" play are dying out and being brought to the light and to the surface for everyone to finally make a choice to choose not to participate in it any longer

       Yes. It applies to mental liberation and awareness, precisely. AKA metaphysically: "the branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space."
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool. So we definitely agree there.

      <p>
       Indeed cops and military types are aware. They have done a very superficial 'cost benefit analysis.' They follow through with their crimes against humanity because their life, as they know it, would fall apart if they did not. Same mind control program, different branch. If they are aware they are doing something wrong, they have the brain washing to justify it. So they are not actually aware, but they need to be.

       Yes. The information going out to the people that are aware is an example of what not to do. But to those without the awareness it's just a warning to behave and 'keep calm, carry on.' Big brother will keep the flock safe as long as you stay tight in the herd.

       Not possible unless you're aware. Only meaningful if you're unafraid of death.

       You're very optimistic. Power is being consolidated, things aren't crumbling unless 'they' want them too. Controlled demolition. Power gets all these technologies first. They have years to make up for the befits we get. For every one benefit we get, 'they' get billions. It's not that I'm a pessimist it's just that what your saying is not in line with history. Yea there's some protest here and there and 'they' have to make concessions to keep us docile and so there's some progress sure.
      </p>

       Until we decide were better of without gov, were just going to keep making the same mistakes and going through the same cycles. We'll just have cooler toys.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...We'll talk more. I need to go now. Hopefully I can catch some of you optimism.

       Saddam and Bin Laden were both pals of the US. Then all of a sudden they were the most vile of enemies...like all of a sudden we weren't responsible for their rise to power.

       Naming a type of bomb "peacemakers" is a beautiful example of doublespeak. Or calling  something that strips us of our rights the "Patriot Act". Total bullshit.

       This is the thing. I have seen kids with me in school take Enron as a model of how to run a business.

       Luckily all of the documents regarding the investigation of Enron and a myriad of other shady dealings collapsed with that section of the pentagon that held all of the documents of said investigations. Crazy that these 19 terrorists would target the one section of the pentagon that had no high-level officials of the American Government, and instead bomb the one place that handles financial malfeasance.

       They already do this. It only took 4-5 years to blame the entire crash of '08 on Bush policies when it was the sub prime mortgages Bill Clinton put in place that started the whole housing bubble that collapsed. But you will never hear a democrat take hear for it in the future. It's a fact that is actively being removed from history.

       While the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act certainly played it's roll, the game was probably far afoot from Clinton's understanding (his mind was on interns after all). The Bush family however already had practice in the scenario with the Savings and Loan Crises, 40% of which played out in Texas and to which Niel Bush was directly involved in Colorado. I don't put it past either president -- in truth it is the people behind them pulling the strings, but it is clear the Bush was at least somewhat aware of the plan while Clinton a rather hapless accomplice. In a news conference Bush let slip that "it wasn't supposed to happen on his watch".
