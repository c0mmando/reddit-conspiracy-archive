        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">22</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-03-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Kuntergrau.html">Kuntergrau</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, Trump says a lot of refreshing and many good things, but <strong>Trump is one of the worst candidates that anyone could vote for and it makes absolutely no sense to vote for him</strong>. He is the embodiment of almost everything that people here in this sub should hate, because he and people like him are the reasons for all the problems we face today. Now, I totally get how you could decide not to vote, because you think the system is rigged and your candidate won&#39;t win or later change his opinion or there&#39;s no perfect candidate. But supporting Trump makes just no sense at all and you might as well support the candidate most of us hate: Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Trump <strong>supports the PATRIOT Act</strong>, he <strong>loves Israel</strong> and wanted to meet , suggests <strong>Snowden should be executed</strong>, <strong>supports NSA data collection</strong>, is an <strong>extreme fear monger</strong> <em>(No, Muslims/Terrorism isn&#39;t a big issue why you need to vote for him)</em>, supports torture, constantly lies, abused workers, made deals with the mob, wants to close parts of the internet and would probably start with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to stay in control. He is the corrupt billionaire and show man that buys politicians and is part of the establishment and elite that make keep America dumb and unaware of the things that go on. People say he is good, because he &quot;says what he thinks&quot; and is &quot;anti-establishment&quot; when he&#39;s exactly that: <strong>Trump = Money/Business in politics = The establishment that we need to break free from</strong>. What we need to do is get money out of politics the best we can, and you can&#39;t do that by supporting a greedy billionaire business man that loves nothing more than himself. He flip flops and changes his opinion all the time just to get as many single-issue voters on board as possible. </p>

<p>Now, this sub usually questions everything. Sees even a conspiracy on top of the conspiracy <em>(some even believe that there is a media conspiracy against Trump, <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/706580478665560064">when he&#39;s the one who get&#39;s more airtime than all other candidates combined</a>)</em>. How can it be that Trump supporters constantly get upvotes? Has the brainwashing spread so far that the majority of this subreddit is completely compromised? There&#39;s no free thinking involved if you don&#39;t see how Trump is manipulating the media to get as much airtime as possible to make every brainwashed TV addict his supporter. He even changes his opinions between debates, which is even worse than what Hillary does, because she at least has years between those thongs. Trump doesn&#39;t even believe the things he&#39;s saying to get elected. He says them to appeal to the Republican evangelical core voter base. According to the latest polls (Quinnipiac) <a href="https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/20160222_electabilitygraphs_v3-1.png">a vote for Trump even means that Hillary could become president</a>, because <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-really-unpopular-with-general-election-voters/">he is even more unpopular with General election voters</a> than her.</p>

</ul>

<p>Yes, he says some things people like, but he&#39;s just saying basically anything to become the President. And by doing that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/who-are-donald-trumps-supporters-really/471714/">he&#39;s attracting mainly uneducated voters</a>. And he knows that, even saying: <em>&quot;We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated!&quot;</em>, while intellectuals like <strong>Noam Chomsky</strong> <em>(who usually receives lots of love here)</em> supports the <a href="http://www.stophatedumptrump.com/">#StopeHateDumpTrump</a> campaign. No critical thinker should be fooled by him - so no single <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> subscriber should vote for Trump. Trump doesn&#39;t mean what he says. He&#39;s just using the far right morons to push his campaign.</p>

<p>Most Alternative-Media sites and groups are against Trump. Only crazies like <strong>Alex Jones</strong> support Trump. Trump is not someone who cares about you. He&#39;s an oligarch and we need to stop oligarchs like him from owning countries. I view it as a virtual certainty that he would go after critics and political rivals, and a strong possibility that he would Erdogan-style moves to keep himself in power for as long as possible. Would you want a man like Trump have control over the military and other areas of the US?</p>

<p>&quot;It may turn out that Trump is doing his country a major service with his candidacy because he is demonstrating very vividly what is rotten about this system. With all due respect, he&#39;s a useful idiot&quot;. (- Der Spiegel)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you make a lot of good points, I would caution you away from one. At a certain juncture, you echo those who would ridicule &quot;uneducated voters&quot; and you make it seem like it&#39;s bad that, in a democracy, mass numbers of average people [i.e., the uneducated] support a Donald Trump. Democracies are crafted around &quot;The greatest good for the greatest number&quot;. And, in our society, let&#39;s face it: The majority are not PhD&#39;s. Nor should they be.</p>

<p>I remember when Mitt Romney lost, and a large part of it was a tape someone produced of him dismissing &quot;the 47%&quot; of working-class [and &quot;uneducated&quot;] people. That out-of-touch condescendion probably cost Romney the election.</p>

<p>He was roundly excoriated in the media for his patrician snobbery.</p>

<p>Then (with no cognitive dissonance whatsoever) the media ridicules Trump for appealing precisely to that 47%. Scorn is poured over him for carrying the working-class and appealing to those who haven&#39;t been to the mass indoctrination centers we call colleges.</p>

<p>Trump is riding a populist wave. And populism is based on that 47% that Romney wrote off (and which Trump is so clearly dominant in).</p>

<p>I wish the media would just make up its mind: Is a candidate bad for rejecting the &quot;uneducated 47%&quot; or is he to be commended for dominating among the same demographic? The press can&#39;t seem to get its story straight.</p>

<p>Oh no, that&#39;s generally absolutely not what I meant or want to advocate. The problem is, though, that poor/uneducated voters are most likely to vote against their interests, because they are influenced by things that are outside of their control. Democracy  [or as you called it &quot;The greatest good for the greatest number&quot;] is failing, if people live in poverty and therefore have less access to education (due to time, money, no internet, etc.), because then they can be easily manipulated. We see that in the US just as well as in any other country on earth. If they knew what the influences of these policies are or what all candidates actually stand for they wouldn&#39;t vote for him. I see that a indisputable fact. </p>

<p>I know that it sounds condescending to say that and would definitely be a horrible thing to say as a politician (perfect example with Romney there), but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that Trump mainly lives on those voters and that this is a reason for concern. But personally I think that calling Trump voters &quot;average people&quot; seems already be condescending to me. I don&#39;t belief that it&#39;s already that bad. Trump is riding the populist wave like a champion and tries to reach every single person that he can by saying the most outrageous things to <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/706580478665560064">get constant media exposure</a> and it&#39;s working. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take every one of your points--and they&#39;re all valid. </p>

<p>But I&#39;d just like to posit an assertion: Since higher education has become a big business (and the student loan bubble has inflated to become more of a threat to the economy than the sub-prime mortgage debacle that crushed the global financial markets in 2008), maybe it&#39;s time to re-evaluate some time-worn assumptions. I mean, we&#39;re constantly told that &quot;access to education&quot; is the solution to all our nation&#39;s problems. And we&#39;re sold on this idea that we can have a &quot;Gender Studies-based Economy&quot; where every American is a professor.</p>

<p>The reality is: The number of slots available for these positions is incredibly small, with most post-grads having to take jobs at Starbucks as they live in their parents&#39; basement. </p>

<p>Clearly, getting a degree isn&#39;t the magical solution to our job woes (after the Powers That Be gutted our country&#39;s industrial base).</p>

<p>You&#39;ll hear politicians slip unctuously away from the issue all the time with the old standby: &quot;What? All the jobs have gone overseas? Well, education is the answer! All the millions who were working at the factory should be Art History PhD&#39;s and our economy will start to hum again.&quot;</p>

<p>The reality is: It&#39;s not &quot;access to education&quot; that lifts people out of poverty [because most people--let&#39;s be honest--are not college material]. And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. What lifts average people out of poverty is &quot;access to opportunity,&quot; entrepreneurship. </p>

<p>Big corporations have been strangling opportunity by using regulation to drive the little guys out. Like in New York, where the large cab companies got the city council to pass a law that says, &quot;To be able to drive a cab, you must first pay for a license that costs $1 million.&quot; That regulation isn&#39;t designed with the consumer in mind: It&#39;s designed to keep normal people out of the field (which would drive down prices for the consumer). To keep prices from being driven down [and seeing capitalism work as competition spurs better quality and pricing], the big companies used regulation to maintain a monopoly. Because THEY can afford the $1 million license, whereas an independent (who stands to earn $46,000/year) can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Walmart, likewise, used regulation to crush its competition and maintain a monopoly. Though the media is loath to report this, it was Walmart who was behind the $15 minimum wage push recently. According to internal documents, Walmart spearheaded this initiative because they knew they could pay it, but small Mom and Pop retailers couldn&#39;t. So it would see them collapse, and Walmart could maintain its stranglehold on the market.</p>

<p>Regulation isn&#39;t there to &quot;make things better,&quot; as the bureaucrats claim. It&#39;s there as a method to crush opportunity and disallow normal people from competing.</p>

<p>What the working class understands (and what the pundit class doesn&#39;t) is that <em>their</em> way out of poverty isn&#39;t a worthless Gender Studies degree (that plumps them into debt), but loosened regulations so that they can start plumbing businesses, hair salons, food carts, etc.</p>

<p>Before the oppressive legislation we have now [ushered in by crony-capitalism] America&#39;s entrepreneurship was legendary, and its economy became the strongest in the world. We need to get back to that.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky said that, in the 1970s, a decision was taken by the power brokers to change America&#39;s economy from an industrial economy [that made things] to a &quot;financial economy&quot; [where paper profits were inflated by cooking the books]. The 2008 financial crash effectively ended the dream of a &quot;paper profit economy&quot; where we didn&#39;t need to make things. The reality is: America&#39;s wealth [and its rise in the world] was spurred by manufacturing and small businesses. I.e., an economy where people actually make things and provide real services.</p>

<p>As our current economy hovers over an abyss, and as we see foodstamp usage at an all-time high and the workforce participation rate at historical lows, the American people are clamoring for the government to get out of its way. To stop impeding them [at the behest of the monopolies, who want to rig the economy].</p>

<p>They&#39;re saying (and I think this is absolutely correct) that the way out of poverty for them is &quot;economic opportunity,&quot; not a college degree from a university who&#39;s job is to make a profit by getting them into debt.</p>

<p>So what they&#39;re doing is voting for candidates who they see as leading the way forward on issues that matter to <em>them</em>. This can&#39;t be overstated enough: Trump&#39;s rise was based on his association in the public&#39;s mind with jobs. He&#39;s created tens of thousands of them. And his show, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; was all about getting a job. His famous &quot;You&#39;re fired!&quot; line underscores his association with jobs in the popular imagination. None of the other candidates have this immediate subliminal association with jobs. Even Trump&#39;s other positions (which at first seem tangential) are in fact related to jobs. For instance, when Trump speaks about building a wall and stemming the flood of cheap illegal labor that&#39;s artificially depressing wages, that resonates with working people who have seen their incomes decrease because of it. Like union laborers and construction workers who have seen the job-sites flood with foreign nationals in the country illegally--and watched as their hourly wages tanked. They see the direct connection. They&#39;ve <em>lived</em> it. So when a candidate says, &quot;I&#39;m ending the artificial depression of wages that illegal immigration represents,&quot; these people are voting their economic interests. It&#39;s not based on racism or xenophobia (as the globalists want to frame it); it&#39;s based on jobs and economics. The workers understand that it&#39;s a question of supply-and-demand. To have any leverage in negotiating living wages, you have to have scarcity--even in the labor market. By flooding the field with &quot;scabs&quot; (designed to crush the unions and take away their negotiating power), you&#39;re ensuring low wages. So I would argue that the working class <em>are</em> voting their economic interests. It&#39;s just that the pundits haven&#39;t noticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to say really great post. Very clear and well done. I felt like I was in Atlas Shrugged there for a moment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to perpetuate any stereotypes but I do want to note that I&#39;ve heard the argument (I don&#39;t know from where exactly) that illegal immigrants are taking jobs from people that don&#39;t want to do those very jobs they would get if they weren&#39;t taken by illegal immigrants. It may be that they aren&#39;t living wage jobs and it doesn&#39;t minimize anyone&#39;s decision to back a candidate that will attempt to stop the immigration madness. Just wanted to note that.</p>

<p>What I want to know and don&#39;t get at all is where is the line between race and economics? It would seem to me that Trump (and Sanders for that matter) should have a very broad appeal to all working class Americans regardless of race. (The reason I bring this up is that I&#39;ve heard Sanders is the candidate for minorities and Trump is for the racist and/or uneducated white Americans.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blacks are actually voting for Trump in shockingly high numbers. In my own South Carolina, Jesse Jackson actually chided the blacks who switched parties to vote for Trump. (Jackson wouldn&#39;t have had to do that if it was a miniscule fringe phenomenon.) Mitt Romney got 6% of African-Americans. Trump, in polling, gets something like 25%. In one shock poll, 40% of blacks said that they were flirting with the idea of voting for him.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Blacks want those borders closed. They&#39;re in direct competition with foreign nationals in the country illegally. And they&#39;ve been economically hurt the worst. Have you ever seen black stats since Obama&#39;s been in office (and the Border Patrol has been issued a stand-down order)?</p>

<p>Blacks are getting screwed--and they&#39;re angry.</p>

<p>So the facts actually challenge the narrative that &quot;Trump is for racists&quot;. That&#39;s the narrative the Establishment is trying to spin to kneecap Trump&#39;s shocking support across all sorts of demographics that most Republicans don&#39;t get.</p>

<p>The reality is: Trump is a nationalist.</p>

<p>And blacks identify with America. They don&#39;t identify with foreign nationals--no matter how hard Leftists want to foster the fake relationship. Progressives are like, &quot;See, black man? You and the Mexican are &#39;people of color&#39;. You should league against Evil Whitey, and ban together to take him down.&quot;</p>

<p>But blacks and Mexicans have a long-standing antagonism. All across the country, Mexican gangs are ethnically cleansing black neighborhoods and taking them over.</p>

<p>The two groups are not &quot;buddies,&quot; no matter how hard the Left tries to craft that narrative.</p>

<p>Blacks identify with America. Not Mexico.</p>

<p>And because of that, they&#39;re gravitating toward Trump.</p>

<p>Solution? Flood the media with propaganda stories about &quot;Evil Generic Republican Racist&quot;.</p>

<p>They do this every election cycle.</p>

<p>Every Republican is an evil racist, sexist, homophobic bigot.</p>

<p>They haven&#39;t strayed one iota from the script with Trump.</p>

<p>You could run Jesus Christ as a Republican, and the narrative would be exactly the same.</p>

<p>The fact is: The Left is sweating bullets because blacks are waking up to how much they&#39;re being exploited, taken for granted--and economically screwed. They&#39;ve done nothing to help the black community. In fact, all their policies exacerbate the joblessness and poverty. They&#39;re pipelining in their replacements--and asking them to like it.</p>

<p>Blacks aren&#39;t stupid. They&#39;re waking up.</p>

<p>And the Left is in a panic. The last thing they want is for blacks not to be segregated. They have to be &quot;<em>African</em>-Americans,&quot; and not Americans. The second blacks wake up to the fact that they&#39;re Americans, and Americans alone [with no qualifying adjective] the divide-and-conquer game of Progressiveness is over.</p>

<p>So they&#39;re doing the only thing they know how to do: Flood the media with KKK stories and half-baked propaganda that a three year-old could see through. They&#39;re desperate--and it shows.</p>

<p>I myself am voting for Trump--and I&#39;m Hispanic. </p>

<p>His appeal is not a racial one. It&#39;s a nationalistic one.</p>

<p>If you believe in America, and if you identify as American, your choices are limited this election cycle to the two populist candidates. All the others are Maintainers of the Status Quo. A &quot;status quo&quot; that&#39;s been killing the Middle Class. People like Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton are identical (when you scratch off the surface labels): Globalists. George Soros puppets. And in fact, Soros is funding <em>both</em> Clinton and Kasich. (And probably Cruz, too, if you dug deeper.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I wouldn&#39;t have guessed he would&#39;ve been polling that high. That is crazy. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I live in blue country so my vote doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s been good though. I&#39;ve been able to separate from party politics and look at things a little more objectively, plus it&#39;s been way more entertaining to watch when liberals lose the White House (2000 was a fun year!) than when I lived in the red. </p>

<p>This election cycle I&#39;ve been really honing in on the media and trying to look at the bigger picture. After analyzing it for some time, it now seems very predictable and rather boring, but I still keep listening in hopes the media will be crushed. I used to just want the liberal media to be crushed: now I want both sides to blow up. </p>

<p>I find it fascinating how the AM dial is just beating on Trump like an old, washed up pony at a kid&#39;s birthday party. I&#39;m like &quot;You&#39;re doing it again?! You just did it last segment.&quot; And it happens on multiple shows all the day long. It&#39;s laughable and so ridiculous that it actually makes me WANT to vote for him. </p>

<p>Which makes me think that they are just an extension of the establishment. It also makes me think if everyone is against Trump, then something is up here and It needs a second look. It&#39;s an all out assault that makes even NPR look pretty reserved. </p>

<p>But (and you&#39;re right about Nationalist vs Globalist) what really solidified this and made me really start thinking it through was when I asked my father, a die hard establishment conservative about all of this and when he said, yeah, I think Clinton will probably be o.k. and it&#39;s fine, I lost it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just as much about status quo vs. change as it is Nationalist vs. Globalist. And it&#39;s crazy but true, people actually fear change more than they want to win. And that to me is scary. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see people who don&#39;t normally come together just once come together and just blow the whole thing up.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;d never consider voting for Trump--before I saw the quality of the people aligned against him. Both Democrats and neocons. The look-a-like establishment from both parties. And all their propaganda outlets, combined.</p>

<p>Fox News, for instance, secretly donated money to the Hillary campaign. This was well before Trump came into the ascendant. The truth is: Fox news is <em>not</em> conservative. It&#39;s neocon. I.e., globalist.</p>

<p>True conservatives want to conserve American values--freedom of speech, privacy, due process, etc.</p>

<p>Fox News champions the surveillance state, oppressive trade deals, Israeli-style foreign policy, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a globalist outlet--which aligns itself more with Hillary Clinton than with anything Ronald Reagan stood for.</p>

<p>So when both MSNBC <em>and</em> Fox started attacking Trump, I realized: Crap! This guy&#39;s really a threat. He&#39;s the real deal.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not a stealth candidate. If he were, they&#39;d be giving him the Barack Obama/Jesus media coverage.</p>

<p>The media so far as spent 2 billion dollars--almost all of it in time attacking Trump.</p>

<p>This is unprecedented in any election cycle.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen the media <em>and</em> the candidate&#39;s own party working together to undermine their own frontrunner. It&#39;s fascinating to watch.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s how I know Trump is an even bigger threat than Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>If Bernie gets in, they can still rely on bloated government getting bigger, and the gravy train continuing on. Corruption will proceed, untouched. And, if anything, the federal largesse will expand.</p>

<p>With Trump, though, something about him scares the hell out of them.</p>

<p>And my suspicion is that they fear that he&#39;ll turn the tap off.</p>

<p>And <em>that&#39;s</em> when he got my vote.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also convinced right now that some of the Republican elite also want Hillary as president (Gingrich is a fantastic example of this phenomenon) - because they&#39;re no longer Repubs or Dems, they&#39;re statists or anti-statists, corporatists vs. anti-corporatists, and unfortunately, the anti-s are outnumbered like 99 to 1 in government. The only hope is the people here. And they gotta wake up and stop letting themselves be jerked around by the media and the Trump vs. Clinton false dichotomy.</p>

<p>I knew this would come as the first comment and it&#39;s of course good that you checked. But I could have posted this on a different account very easily. If you believe that anything in this post is because someone has an special &quot;agenda&quot; because of my post-history then you&#39;re really delusional. Trump is objectively a bad choice.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say someone should vote for any other candidate or the candidate that I like most. No serious candidate is perfect. I&#39;m just hugely concerned about the fact that Trump comments get upvotes in almost every politics based thread around here and you should be to.</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny even if you believe Sanders is a fake. I think he&#39;s just most in line what people here think. Reddit is not populated by the &quot;average American&quot;. People here are on average way better educated and know more about the world. He&#39;s way better than Hillary by far and educated people know that, which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrats_Abroad_primary,_2016#Provisional_Results">he&#39;s completely destroying her with Democrats that live abroad.</a>. Americans are sadly too brainwashed by mainstream media to see that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you pay attention, a lot of the people &quot;going along with it here&quot; are trolls with ulterior motives. I suspect a few are actually paid Hillary supporters, pushing Trump here for the obvious reason.</p>

<p>But that isn&#39;t everyone, because I know real Trump supporters in real life, who completely go blank when you talk with them about it. They know they&#39;re doing something wrong, something self-destructive, but it&#39;s like their brain shuts off if you try to get them to look at what they&#39;re doing. Hillary supporters are kind of the same way, except there are a few of them I know that get really nasty about it, and rude. Whereas the Trump supporters get hang-dog and change the subject. Either way, people are <em>completely</em> falling for the mainstream media bullshit of Trump vs. Clinton. </p>

<p>It kills me that not a damned person in media seems to care about their country enough to tell the truth, that neither of these people can be trusted in office and there <em>are</em> alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it looks like he has a very serious chance to be a serious contender against Hillary. He&#39;s even leading at the moment. If these two will become nominees I predict that we&#39;d be seeing the greatest voter turnout in recent history, because both Trump and Hillary are hated by so many people. They have both the lowest favorability rating among general election voters. Everything can happen, especially in a country that re-elected George W. Bush. </p>

<p>Voters not turning out is good for Clinton and her team knows it. Hence, her team getting Trump where he is and pushing him so hard via dark marketing. A turnip would beat Clinton in a general election. But Trump is less liked than a turnip. <strong>Trump is the path to a Clinton presidency</strong>, I wish people would wake the fuck up and stop being such sheep.</p>

<p>The party destroyed itself by going to extreme this time. It isn&#39;t Trump. Cruz and Rubio are no alternatives. See how the republicans shifted to the right from <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/images/uscandidates2008.png">2008</a>, to <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/images/us2012.png">2012</a> to <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/images/us2016.png">2016</a>. This is helping Hillary more than anything. All of them are. If they want to stop Trump then they should have put up a different candidate. 2008 or 2012 Republican candidates would have realistic chances to beat Hillary, but this time they went overboard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you vote in the primaries? By not doing that you get candidates elected that you don&#39;t want. Voting in the primaries makes your vote more powerful, because a protest vote at the end when everything is already decided doesn&#39;t do as much.</p>

<p>Of course I strongly belief that America needs to get away from that two party system (as does Sanders), so I don&#39;t think that voting for Gary Johnson is a bad idea. But if you are for &quot;anyone who&#39;s not Trump or Clinton&quot; I think voting in the primaries in that horrible two party system (that really seems like one party anyway) is a necessary evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely voting in the primaries. I registered for the first time as not an independent so I can do so. But if it&#39;s Trump vs. Clinton at the general, definitely voting Johnson or anyone else worthwhile. I couldn&#39;t live with myself voting either and I don&#39;t know if I really want to stay here in the US in that case. The first Clinton presidency was bad enough.</p>

<p>I am curious about this election, though - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the entire thing is upended by November, and T &amp; C are both out of the game. Politics has gotten <em>weird</em> and I think there are shadow battles going on while we watch the circus.</p>

<p>Trump... Well simply put the Republican establishment is considering running a 3rd party spoiler candidate to hand the WH to Clinton.</p>

<p>Gringrich said that if they try to cheat him then it could start a civil war within the republican party.</p>

<p>Honestly if they try to cheat him then Trump should make Sanders his running mate and dismantle the two party system.</p>

<p>Trump should implement term limits so that the trash who&#39;ve been in power since Bill Clinton was in the WH would be ejected from the senate and congress..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this thread is no longer united in beliefs and politics is only a part of the discussion of conspiracies or theories of conspiracies. For that reason, I don&#39;t think we should be surprised to see any candidate supported here as people will have varying agendas.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t think any one person should be voting or not voting for a candidate because other people that share beliefs with them tell them to or not to (fallacy). I instead encourage people to do their own individual or selective (trusted) group research on not only the candidate but the system itself and the players of it. Along the way, make sure to verify your sources because the biggest weapon out there today is misinformation. Without correct information, we cannot make correct conclusions and without correct conclusions, we can and will support causes that are in actually against our beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but all of the other candidates are the exact same.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not American, but imagine I am. There&#39;s not a single republican candidate that doesn&#39;t make me want to drown myself except for Trump. He&#39;s a stubborn old man that barely bases his ideas on reality which is usually what I hate about republicans.</p>

<p>However, this year we have choices between who? Trump and Cruz, and Hillary and Bernie on the democrat side? I&#39;m not even going to touch on Hillary, but Bernie is first of all a feminist, something I cannot look past. These people have woven one of the biggest webs of lies the west has ever seen. If you want to look for fear mongering, look no further. Women and minorities aren&#39;t oppressed AT ALL, but feminist propaganda makes it sound like whites are on the streets cutting their throats for simply existing. Meanwhile the western &quot;white&quot; (like there&#39;s a single white culture, you know, cause nations aren&#39;t a thing) society is for the most part the most equal society in the history of the world. Women are usually better protected by the law as well, like in Spain where men have to prove their innocence against rape accusations, or in the US where women get custody over their children against all odds.</p>

<p>Not to mention the state of free speech in universities. Students are at an all time low in support for free speech, and it&#39;s all due to feminism, &quot;diversity&quot;, and &quot;inclusiveness&quot;. The attempt to implement common core, or more accurately nation wide feminist brainwashing, an idea good in theory but absolutely destructive an practice when schooling is decided by democrat-feminist run boards of education where nepotism runs rampant.</p>

<p>No, I think I&#39;ll vote against the fascist thought-policing progressives despite Trump being far from perfect.</p>

<p>Or at least I would if I was American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, Trump isn&#39;t against feminism, though. Not saying that any of the things you say are wrong, but I wonder why that whole thing even is a reason to vote for a candidate? If some are a bit misjudging the situation and think that they have to aggressively fight for women&#39;s right in the developed world (instead where it&#39;s really needed), then that&#39;s all that just that: They support a popular movement, because they are misinformed.</p>

<p>But I fail to see the harm that would come out of that feminist brainwashing? We&#39;re all just people and women aren&#39;t the enemy that will take over the world? I&#39;m more concerned about the bigger issues that could really harm people and make the situation for everyone worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or how about when the Obama administration removed due process from college campuses in sexual assault cases? If someone says that you raped them you get expelled and publicly vilified and you&#39;re not given the means to defend yourself. This is all because of feminist dogma. &quot;Women wouldn&#39;t lie about getting raped, that&#39;s too awful! We have to believe them and not impartially judging the situation by the facts!&quot;</p>

<p>Or how about how feminists get funding shut down for male domestic abuse shelters because they are &quot;misogynistic&quot;. These people are close to the biggest problem in the west, just after corruption in politics, war, and poverty.</p>

<p>And Trump is most definitely against these things, as he is not a third wave feminist, and he believes in merit over quotas and diversity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because modern feminism isn&#39;t just &quot;we are equal lol&quot;, it&#39;s LISTEN AND BELIEVE WOMEN WHEN THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN RAPED mentality, SAFE SPACES IN CAMPUSES mentality, FACTS ARE A PATRIARCHAL CONSTRUCT mentality, or &quot;You aren&#39;t a minority so you have no idea if I&#39;m oppressed or not so shut your mouth&quot; mentality. These things are about as destructive, racist, sexist and bigoted as it gets. These are the kind of people who physically attack &quot;nazis&quot; at their protests just because they think they are evil, and then the media tells us that nazis were attacking these poor belligerent safe space nazis. In their world, other opinions are evil and bad and should be no-platformed and silenced.

<p>Non-American here as well, but I really hope Bernie wins because to me he doesn&#39;t feel like the others. He&#39;s not just saying shit to get votes, he&#39;s been consistently pushing for the same goals for decades.</p>
