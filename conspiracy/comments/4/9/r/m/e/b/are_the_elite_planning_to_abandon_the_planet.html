       Yesterday I had a rather horrid notion. I decided not to share it b/c it surely had to be too far fetched. But then I read
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aei-world-forum-donald-trump_us_56ddbd38e4b0ffe6f8ea125d?ir=Politics&amp;section=us_politics">
        this
       </a>
       . Not it doesn't seem so far fetched after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the notion? It is simply this: Why are a handful of billionaires suddenly all rushing to get man into space? Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson and others are all spending fortunes of their own money to see it happen. Is it just enthusiasm for space travel as they would have us beleive or is their are bigger plot afoot?
      </p>
      <p>
       I did a search. I am not the first to consider it:

       it's called: breakaway civilization
      </p>
      <p>
       "The term “Breakaway Civilization” was coined by Richard Dolan after his exhaustive and extensive research into his books UFOs and the National Security State Volumes 1 and 2. He came to the realization that
       <em>
        the deep secretive black budget world had actually become a civilization on its own with its own exotic technology
       </em>
       , a different view of the cosmos, our place in it, and a different version of Human history. This is a new avenue of research that will delve into the Occult, secret societies, Central Banking, UFO secrecy, the Military Industrial Complex, and the Secret Space Program comprising this Breakaway Civilization.

       are the elite planning on leaving without us?
      </p>
      <p>
       some people think so. i always thought that was the reason why there's never any mention about Niribu (Planet X). rumors about the elite hiding in D.U.M.B.O.'s (deep underground military bases) assume they will go there, but i don't think they'd survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       if it's true that there is a colony on Mars, i can't imagine all the elite jetting off into space although i'm sure they have a plan.

       I think the Nibiru stuff is a collective unconscious software program that fires off when conditions allow it; perhaps it's stored holographically in our genes; genetic memetic program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say that because when I was 6-8 I had a recurring dream I would describe as characteristically a Nibiru-like experience.  I would be an old man meditating on an outcropping in a very remote forest wilderness area, my consciousness would fly out (oobe) into deep space, accelerating beyond lightspeed to an unfathomable distance away to the edge of the known universe where I met an infinitely massive black star or black sun.  I was a bodiless point of being at that point and it communicated telepathically that "it was coming (to Earth) and that I was to tell everyone it was coming", then it tossed me back in the direction of earth and I suppose like a rubber band I snapped back into the body and woke up.  This dream repeated 3x in 2 yrs and was very memorable, very 'detailed', very real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward 15 yrs and Luc Besson makes the 5th Element with nearly the same theme, a black object from deep space (a comet or moon) coming to collide with the earth.  (except in his version, it must be stopped by the 5th metaphysical element or transcendent love)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen art that depicts the same; turns out many have had this dream if you read internet boards.  It's possible that Nibiru is simply a
       <em>
        Jungian archetype
       </em>
       or a collective memory of a bygone event; or possibly even a collective premonition of a future event.  Or it's a deep-seated, apocalyptarian / eschatological fear in mankind of natural disaster from space, the fear or phobia of a cataclysm over which one has zero control.

       It's also interested to note Jung was a gnostic and was obsessed with mythology and alchemy; he basically figured out that alchemy was some spiritual self-psychology of psychedelic self-transformation; and that the symbolisms of mythology were tropes, allegories, archetypes, and mental formations in the human experience as universal (stored within the collective unconscious); a similar theme espoused by his contemporary, the late, world-reknowned mythologist Joseph Cambell.  This perspective guided a lot of the work he did.  Namely in trying to decipher the Voynich Manuscript.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which led him--iirc--to creating his own strange book, the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Book_%28Jung%29">
        Red Book
       </a>
       , where he illustrates the archetypes he's collected as 'common' from his dealings with hundreds of patients.

       according to the messages channeled from higher dimensional beings, we are preparing for another axis shift (which coincide with the arrival of nibiru, so it must really gravitationally pull on our planet), and when that happens, most of mankind will be wiped out and the ETs will save those with light hearts (anubis) who will then repopulate the earth and take us into the golden age of atlantis again.  matriarchy will rule again.  the "ascension" or "rapture" is us being beamed up onto crafts.

       Can you clue me in on these messages? Literally anything showing that you (or whomever you're referring to) received messages from higher dimensional beings telling us about the future of humanity? I'd imagine a couple million scientists would be interested in such a claim.

       I'm aware that the poles switch every so often naturally, as well as the big concern about it back in Dec. 2012 because everyone thought the world was going to end again because the date was a palindrome and the Mayan calendar ending supposedly predicted an apocalypse to coincide with that date. I wasn't arguing against any of that, I was talking about the messages from higher dimensional beings that supposedly told us all this -- I'll have to get back to you on the video later since that's all you did to inform me as to that aspect and it's an hour long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: currently watching the video and maybe you could point me to a particular part where this guy who supposedly received messages actually talks about it? Not just some animated film that spews all of this theories of ancient aliens that requires me to take their word as fact when they don't give me any references as to how they know what they're talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd Edit: I'm losing the little faith I had in this video when they said that NASA essentially denies that polar shifts are a real thing at 16:15 in the video WHILE USING A PICTURE FROM A NASA ARTICLE DESCRIBING POLE SHIFTS

       I'd imagine you're familiar with it, but do you know how many BS hits I would have to wade through when searching "messages from higher dimensional beings about the world's end"? I asked for info regarding how you believe in these messages and where they came from and you provided me with info about polar shifts and a youtube video that presupposes that I already believe all of this stuff without explaining where the supposed information came from in the first place. "Go do some research" is a lazy answer that implies, "you're dumber than me because you don't know what I think I know, and I'm not going to help you nor prove my own point." Thanks.

       You made an extraordinary claim that we have received messages from higher dimensional beings. That requires some sort of evidence that it happened. I asked for said evidence. You provided a cartoon video that summarizes the tenets of your belief but does not address how we know this to be true or even plausible. Further, your video was interesting the watch for thought-provoking value at least, but it lost its credibility when it started making false claims about NASA denying something as basic as pole shifts, while using an image in their video taken from a NASA article about pole shifts. Hence my frustration and you choosing to bow out instead of persuading me from my skepticism.

       NASA claims the shifts only happen every 800,000 years, not 13,000-26,000.  there's too much information to catch you up on, like i said, i have followed the spiritual community for over a decade.  i am sorry if i am not telling you what you want to hear.  i am not trying to persuade you about anything, just telling you what the messages are that people are receiving.  it's up to you to believe it or not.  it's up to you if you want to know more or blow it off.  it doesn't really affect me one way or another.    if you do want to know, drunvalo is one place to start

       Not to sound like an agent of the united fruitcake outlet, but Science can never explain magic, it's not equipped.  Science is deductive and reductive whereas magic is inclusive and holistic.  Objective versus subjective in experience.  Subjective observation is generally rejected in science or considered at best anecdotal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, channelling happens in the mind, and mind is something science has yet to even try to explain. It's still busy looking at the mechanical parts (neurons) whose link to mind are tenuous at best.

       I thought ascension was an internal act of alchemical completion of the philosopher's stone, the magnum opus, by the grand unification of opposites in the act of apotheosis (becoming

       The Chinese government doesn't care about living conditions, or pollution, or anything else. They have one goal in mind: restoring their "rightful" place as the dominant power in Asia, and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       For thousands of years China ruled Asia and all their neighbours literally had to crack their heads on the floor loud enough to be heard by the emperor, during a full kowtow, to show their obedience. Everything China does reeks of power grabbing and racial supremacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even have a military doctrine called Unrestricted Warfare, which is full spectrum covert attacks against America and allies. The cyber war is not an isolated strategy, it's part of unrestricted warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just read books by former panda-huggers like Dr Michael Pillsbury: “Chinese strategy is, at its core, a product of lessons derived from the Warring States period”.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the folks who wrote The Art Of War. The Chinese people are nice enough, but the government is hellbent on restoring their historical role as hegemon.

       But China may have overplayed its hand. Now that it is stealing islands in the South China Sea, and putting missiles on them, everyone is starting to wake up. Hopefully we stop trading with them, until they learn how to cooperate peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with Obama dithering on the world stage, China (and Russia) are taking advantage, and stealing territory. And neither will stop expanding unless they are stopped by America. Power fills a vacuum.

       Since you seem concerned, I'll share my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, consider the concept of the breakaway civilization. If you're not familiar, check out Richard Dolan's presentations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then consider that along with this, various groups of alien species have been pretty much controlling our existence for a variety of agendas for a very, very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess they do this through a few designated "parents" who each have groups that control the bloodlines, Illuminati, blah blah. The stuff we're familiar with.  These groups all have different programs and whatnot and generally work together to orchestrate our civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, something else has happened recently, coupled with our now space traveling human race (although secret), that has forced a change. Its too much to get into, doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is this.  We, the human race, now need to make the transition to a type 1 civilization.  As a whole, not just the secret space program folks.  So the "elites" are now pushing to go into space, publicly.  They already have the tech, but in order to not let the whole cat out of the bag (that we're actually already space travellers) and coordinated effort of small disclosure is the plan. Did you see the Boeing Superbowl ad?  That's them prepping the average Joe.

       We're going to see a bunch of incredible "discoveries" over the next few years. The gravity waves was one of them. Notice how they presented it. It wasn't maybe or possibly, it was bam here it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: They're not leaving, they've decided we're going to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: it all sounds good but there is also a real danger for us depending if we as a race can learn to get along and take care of our world ourselves or if we'll need another savior to come along and do things for us.

       I'm not too big on the breakaway society(I've heard of it and get the gist of the concept); could you bring me up to speed? Also, what do you mean by space traveler?

       By space travellers I meant the breakaway civilization folks :)
      </p>
      <p>
       The super short version is if somebody did get their hands on some alien techs way back when and kept it secret, then by now they're already colonized in space and interacting with other species.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've become a breakaway civilization.

       I'm no expert on the subject, but was their something more specific you want to know?

       Wow I think you've nailed it. There will be some upheaval. I imagine certain populations will have to be eliminated as the transition will just not be possible for them (third world and below?). Perhaps also any society unwilling to surrender arms? I'm not sure whether aliens carry personal weapons or not.

       Actually from what I've been tracking, there is now a split. Some want it to go down more like your description, others want a peaceful transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides have what it takes to make it go either way and it all playing out now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which ever way it goes, the challenge for us is to break free from needing controllers and learn to be responsible enough to live free and peaceful.

       You made an extraordinary claim that we have received messages from higher dimensional beings. That requires some sort of evidence that it happened. I asked for said evidence. You provided a cartoon video that summarizes the tenets of your belief but does not address how we know this to be true or even plausible. Further, your video was interesting the watch for thought-provoking value at least, but it lost its credibility when it started making false claims about NASA denying something as basic as pole shifts, while using an image in their video taken from a NASA article about pole shifts. Hence my frustration and you choosing to bow out instead of persuading me from my skepticism.
