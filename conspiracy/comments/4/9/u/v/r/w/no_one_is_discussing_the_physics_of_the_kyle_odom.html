        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have a lot of thoughts on this incident but for now, I&#39;ll stick to the basics. Kyle Odom was a trained marine, who fired a .45 POINT BLANK at Tim Remington, and hit him 6 times, once in the skull, once in the lungs. A .45 at point blank range would not &quot;fail to penetrate the skull&quot; as has been reported....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I was hoping this would gain more traction here. A US marine who earned his pistol sharpshooter badge fired POINT BLANK hitting his target SIX times once in the skull with a .45 and not only did he live, but the next day the &quot;victim&quot; was described as &quot;joking laughing and basically back to normal&quot;</p>

<p>His head perhaps would not have exploded like we see in the movies, but certainly a human skull cap cant stop a .45 calibre bullet at close range.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in East Cleveland and had a russian friend who was shot (from maybe ~40ft distance) in the head by a 9mm.  It went through the front of his skull, bounced off the back of his skull and came back out the front of his face.  He was never very bright to begin with, but after a few months recovery he wasn&#39;t much worse for wear.  I always though it was really amazing that he was still the loud-mouth idiot afterwards as he was before.  I think it took him like a few weeks to walk properly again as his motor skills were lightly affected, but nothing he didn&#39;t recover from.  That all being said, a .45 is like twice the diameter of a 9mm and travels much slower and is much more prone to tumbling in the air (a bullet tumbling is usually much more dangerous because the longer profile of the entry/exit wound, and many times it wont exit at all.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at some data of the only caliber breakdown study I know (selection method may be flawed)</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/node/7866">http://www.buckeyefirearms.org/node/7866</a></p>

<p>For the average 45 shooting, slightly more than 2 rounds hit a victim with an average fatality rate of 29% (survival rate of 71%). The best way I can think to calculate the probability of surviving 6 rounds in this case is to calculate what are odds of surviving 3 shootings of 2 rounds each. This is a very generous assumption because obviously it is better to be shot in 3 incidents due to cumulative blood loss, shock, etc than suffer an equal number of rounds in a single instance a single incident. With this model, there is a 36% chance of the pastor&#39;s survival (.71 cubed), but again this is a very flawed analysis because of above assumptions.  I would guess the real P is well below 10%</p>

<p>45 ACP                   </p>

<h1>of people shot - 209</h1>

<h1>of hits - 436</h1>

<p>% of hits that were fatal - 29%
Average number of rounds until incapacitation - 2.08
% of people who were not incapacitated - 14%
One-shot-stop % - 39%
Accuracy (head and torso hits) - 85%
% actually incapacitated by one shot (torso or head hit) - 51%</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, <strong>90%</strong> of head wounds are fatal. That means 10% are not. </p>

<p>While you&#39;re busy looking things up, I distinctly remember a US cop shot in the head at point blank range during the 90s. The bullet entered above his brow ridge and traveled under the skin, without penetrating the skull, exiting behind his ear. I remember the X-rays and that he was a really big black guy. Not sure if he was fat or muscular, just big. Don&#39;t remember anything else other than that it being a large calibre.</p>

<p>Things like that don&#39;t happen often, but they do happen and the classic example is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>. What are the odds of him surviving an injury like that? </p>
