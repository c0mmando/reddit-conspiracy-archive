       Man, I'm at 45 minutes into this... and it's already quite obvious they murdered him along with the rest of his family tree. I remember watching

       and thinking the same things...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so bloody obvious all of the Kennedy 'assassinations' were false if you take the time to look at the actions of all involved. TPTB have never liked the Kennedy family.

       Long story short.... the Kennedy family was systematically murdered because they were seen as being soft on communism and avoided military intervention with Russia and Cuba.  Their continued lack of support of the CIA and military interventionism was declared a threat to "national security" (as well as threatening the livelihood of many within the CIA and MIC), so they were killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why, since that time, we have seen the rise of a double government that transcends presidencies and whose policies can not be influenced by the citizenry.

       Not so much evidence that Clinton was involved, however the reporting, the search,  the military and civilians all collectively and continuously dropping the ball and failing at pretty much everything they tried does point towards some tom foolery

       You talk like that about yourself and others but don't you realize how hard it would be to get everyone to 'wake up'. I agree with you and what is said but don't call me a cowardly piece of shit. How about you stop being a lazy piece of shit writing messages on Reddit and go do something...

       Bush was one of the main planners involved in the JFK assassination and a lifetime CIA  devotee (see "Family of Secrets" by Russ Baker), so they definitely had the resources to do it.

       Tesla thought his DEW discoveries would be a weapon to end all wars. I'm sure, if his spirit is eternal, it hasn't been happy for a while. His inventions possibly could have given us free energy, instead we've got weapons that Putin say are as powerful as the atom bomb but more socially acceptable.

        Did George Bush Jr Murder John Kennedy Jr?

      <p>
       John Hankey has produced a fascinating and superbly crafted documentary outlining a court ready case showing how George Bush, Jr murdered John Kennedy, Jr. on July 16, 1999. While it does not produce a smoking gun, the evidence is a prima facie indictment of the man who brought us 9/11.
