<p>It&#39;s so bloody obvious all of the Kennedy &#39;assassinations&#39; were false if you take the time to look at the actions of all involved. TPTB have never liked the Kennedy family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story short.... the Kennedy family was systematically murdered because they were seen as being soft on communism and avoided military intervention with Russia and Cuba.  Their continued lack of support of the CIA and military interventionism was declared a threat to &quot;national security&quot; (as well as threatening the livelihood of many within the CIA and MIC), so they were killed.</p>

<p>This is why, since that time, we have seen the rise of a double government that transcends presidencies and whose policies can not be influenced by the citizenry.</p>

<p><strong>Did George Bush Jr Murder John Kennedy Jr?</strong> </p>

<p>John Hankey has produced a fascinating and superbly crafted documentary outlining a court ready case showing how George Bush, Jr murdered John Kennedy, Jr. on July 16, 1999. While it does not produce a smoking gun, the evidence is a prima facie indictment of the man who brought us 9/11.</p>

Monroe and JFk Jr. both were trying to go public which led to both of their deaths.
