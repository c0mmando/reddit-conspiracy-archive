       I tried to tell folk this aeons ago...but got laughed away, as per usual. This is how these corporate sociopaths do their shit...nose thumbing the masses and concurrently controlling/raping their privacy...and all at the same time.

Instead people will then line up to buy equipment from Germany or Russia or China or some other 'enemy' country that produces a decent product that expressly does not have backdoors. It will then be very clear to everyone in the US that the FBI destroyed the tech industry and caused 3rd quarter earnings to drop to zero across the board. Investors will panic.

        Unless of course, these handsets get frozen out of access to the cell towers by some mechanism, which will then only cause people to develop very smart wifi-voip solutions and software that uses the p2p meshnetworking voip preferentially. They will demand metrowifi and reward businesses with easy, open wifi by visiting them more than stupid places that have no wifi or malfunctioning wifi or passoword protected ("ask us") wifi rather than hotspot wifi.

       This just makes me sad but it would actually explain a lot.  Like how they are managing to easily get into places that are supposed to be cryptographically secure, without using a building-sized supercomputer with john the ripper.

        Apple computer corporation could move it's administrative home office to Seychelles and turn all apple stores into subsidiaries. If FBI then shuts them down for continued refusal to comply, they'll destroy 1/2 of the handset market overnight, screwing tens of millions of customers, greviously injuring the tech industry by chilling effects, because other businesses will be terrified to have the same done to them. So like the spineless cowards they are, they'll line up to help the NSA / FBI with backdoors, which will then cause people to ditch them forever. Instead people will then line up to buy equipment from Germany or Russia or China or some other 'enemy' country that produces a decent product that expressly does not have backdoors. It will then be very clear to everyone in the US that the FBI destroyed the tech industry and caused 3rd quarter earnings to drop to zero across the board. Investors will panic.

An overnight sucess spawning a revolution in open source hardware, changing the face of security forever since the handset market will start to grow features expressly disallowed by the 3GPP like peering and smart, nonproprietary adhoc mesh networking.

        Unless of course, these handsets get frozen out of access to the cell towers by some mechanism, which will then only cause people to develop very smart wifi-voip solutions and software that uses the p2p meshnetworking voip preferentially. They will demand metrowifi and reward businesses with easy, open wifi by visiting them more than stupid places that have no wifi or malfunctioning wifi or passoword protected ("ask us") wifi rather than hotspot wifi.
