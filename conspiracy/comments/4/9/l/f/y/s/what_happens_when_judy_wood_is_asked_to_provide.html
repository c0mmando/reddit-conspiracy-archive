       She has no evidence; proof below:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the structural steel was “dustified,” one would expect to see at least some evidence for partially “dustified” steel members in the debris. Yet nothing of the sort is shown in Wood’s book or website. One would also expect a much higher fraction of the dust to be found to consist of iron than the 5.87% maximum detected by RJLee Group (see below).
       <strong>
        the massive structural steel was roughly equal to the mass of concrete in the towers, and there was not enough gypsum wallboard to dilute the iron below a 6% proportion, if any significant fraction of it had been “dustified.”
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people defend her unproven theories? There is literally no science in her above claim. She can't prove it with the samples, so where's her evidence?

       I did not know that the building led to additional firefighters dying at Ground Zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting that the building was way more damaged by the collapse of WTC 's 1&amp;2 than WTC7 and it still didn't collapse during the 2007 fire. Which lasted TEN hours!

       If you recall from the myriad of cars that seemingly
       <em>
        rusted

       over night...Deutsche Bank also experienced
       <em>

       From the 9/11 blogger article....
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The John Galt Corporation of the Bronx, hired last year for the dangerous and complex job of demolishing the former Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty Street, where two firefighters died last Saturday, has apparently never done any work like it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, Galt does not seem to have done much of anything since it was incorporated in 1983. Public and private records give no indication of how many employees it has, what its volume of business is or who its clients are.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are almost no accounts of any projects it has undertaken on any scale, apart from 130 Liberty Street. Court records are largely silent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some leading construction executives in the city say they have never even heard of it."

       It doesn't bother me. But spamming a sub reddit is not how you achieve a valuable discussion (not like you actually want one). You shit post this over and over. It's loaded and expect people to take you seriously? You're just making a fool of yourself... But continue on, if you wish.

         If the structural steel was “dustified,” one would expect to see at least some evidence for partially “dustified” steel members in the debris.

        <p>
         Yet nothing of the sort is shown in Wood’s book or website. One would also expect a much higher fraction of the dust to be found to consist of iron than the 5.87% maximum detected by RJLee Group (see below). the massive structural steel was roughly equal to the mass of concrete in the towers, and there was not enough gypsum wallboard to dilute the iron below a 6% proportion, if any significant fraction of it had been “dustified.”

       Judith Wood doesn't have any evidence, she's never tested any of the physical debris, and anyone with an above room temperature IQ knows that she is nothing but hilariously obvious disinformation meant to discredit the truth movement.

       I figure the best way to shine light on the disinformation campaigns is to shine light on the actual evidence for 'dustifucation,' a completely made up word by Judy herself. There's no evidence for her theory either. ;)

       Sounds like stalking to me. Why are you interested in stalking users who post about disinformation agents like Judy Wood?

       Why don't you use your "trending" ability to call bullshit on Judy? Seems odd you want to follow around the guy who points out Judy is disinformation.

       The USGS values for the samples collected under the big dust cloud weren’t reported.  Why?
See Fgure 339 (a) (b) and Figure 340 (a) (b), page 324 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you must understand that what the USGS DID report in collected dust were biased samples. A lot of the material went up into the atmosphere, down the eastern seaboard, and wafted away. That dust wasn’t presented as a data sample in the USGS study. So, their study is bias. See Figure 337, page 323 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.

      <p>
       The USGS didn’t collect the dust samples until about a week later – AFTER it had rained about 2 inches (the back side of Hurricane Erin) and AFTER they had hosed down the streets. (Rain values are shown in the Glossary table in the back of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.)
