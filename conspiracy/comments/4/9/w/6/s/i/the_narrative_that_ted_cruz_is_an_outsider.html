       Almost everything about Ted Cruz is a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is, as you say, supposedly anti-establishment and yet is firmly in bed with the establishment and will dance to their tune if elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is, according to many of his supporters, a libertarian and yet has the most inflexible, authoritarian attitudes of any candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to be running on a Christian platform, and yet his policies and views are diametrically opposed to practically everything that Christ taught. Furthermore, the issues that he majors on as being Christian are issues that Christ never raised.
      </p>
      <p>
       He criticizes Trump for lying and yet he tells the most blatant lies, all of which can be easily fact checked by watching video footage of him speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says he cares about government spending and not wasting taxpayer money, and yet he wasted huge amounts of government time and money through his obstructionist actions in the Senate. These actions not only failed to deliver any political advantage to his party, but disrupted the lives of thousands of government workers and, wasted significant amounts of public money.

       As Rubio is caught again and again feeding his drug habit.  Debating while appearing high as fuck on amphetamines.  Discretely popping pills.  One does not pop breath mints like he's doing.  Scale that does back a little, dipshit.  Your debate dose

        Again this is because Rubio is dead and he's not Trump.

        Meh, even it was a higher up in the CIA, you can easily chalk it up to ideological brothers.  If you had a huge group of former CIA agents in his campaign, then you can start asking these sorts of questions.

        The tea party didn't exist then and he was just starting off really.  Gotta start somewhere.  Also don't know that he was a TOP advisor.
Must've been shit since he didn't get any post worth mentioning after Bush won.
