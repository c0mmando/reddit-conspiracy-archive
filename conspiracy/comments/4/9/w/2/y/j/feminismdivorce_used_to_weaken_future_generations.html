       I had an idea today Let me know what you guys think I'm connecting dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering how the Divorce rate is up to some 54%. A Shit load of kids are growing up with terrible/confusing/split parenting. Divorces are obviously in favor of women. Dessert pussy mom, doesn't want to be around daddy anymore. Cuts ties and Gets half+ Kids. Both Mother and Child Latch to Nanny States titty. Lack of Father figure, feminizes the boy he grows up weak and sickly, due to lack of nutrition(Mom won't/Doesn't know how too cook a decent meal=Throws pizza in oven).No father since mother is always at corporate wage slave job and purely self interested. Kid goes through school no questions asked, kid goes through college Liberally indoctrinated+ with massive student loan debt. Kid gets out and is begging for scrapes and working a corporate wage slave job 35-45k.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dissolution of the family is the primary goal. Weak, Low T men pose no threat to the established order.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Female child side, they are indoctrinated with fuax superiority characteristic of almost all girls these days. Masculinizing women, makes them far more likely to divorce weak fathers. Cycle continues
      </p>
      <p>
       This stuff is likely known, just hoping to reiterate.

       Fascinating that men are entirely the victims and bear no blame or responsibility in your scenario.  "Violent abusive men?  No problem, there must be some reason for their innocence to have turned bad, and it's liberals' fault.  Conservatism does no wrong."

       Well when you consider the fact that

        the divorce rate is actually going down

       this seems to not be the case. Also, where did you get the 54% figure?

       Both parents working outside the home doesn't earn the buying power that only one parent working outside the home used to.  Deeper debt slavery.  Both parents must work, so who's going to take over the job of raising the child?  The State.

       Yep it a sad state of affairs. Kids are getting snatched up for "Education" at like the age of 2-4 since parents cannot suspend financial resources. States raising and indoctrinating every year of citizens getting pumped out on a conveyor belt with massive loan debt to continue the cycle.

       their mechanism is like... letting things be that serve their purpose. they go like: "ohh so you girls want divorces? ok, we make money in courts. You want to kill your babies? okk go ahead we wont stop you, we got ways to deal with this." they let anything pass. Making the regular person well educated, in a stable family environment?? nope!

       True, but the rise of feminism is definitely a key factor. There are plenty of NWO books dating all the way back to the 1800's that elaborate on feminism ushering in their breakdown of society.

       I think you put that very well OP...much to agree with. The destruction of the family unit has certainly been an elite goal. Weaken the immediate group (family) and it all kind of rolls from there...poor family ties, likely breed poor socioeconomic ties. Out into the corporate economic world, we're basically just individuals with no collective feel and with no collective bargaining power either. When the shit hits the fan with a job, generally we're just 'an individual' at the mercy of a corporate system, no one's at our backs.

       We've also all been divided as people along 'economic lines' it's what defines us, shouldn't be, but that is what the overall social group message is. This has bred an "I'm alright Jack" mentality with no mind given to the wider group, therefore, over time the group ultimately deteriorates. Collectively, we all need to do what is best for ourselves and what is best for the group as a whole and combined etc.

       Now with things stretched and with both parents likely working jobs, less time is being directly spent co-existing as an interacting family unit. I would say that increasingly, children are actually more likely to spend their time being 'raised' by media (degenerate, subversive media), than their parents. You can guarantee that many children are now interacting with media, far more than they are with people, including their parents.

       <strong>
        Here’s the process:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Force women into degrees they don’t want using affirmative action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force companies to hire the additional women, who have poor scores due to the mismatch effect and their comparative lack of motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force healthcare companies to pay for the psychiatric diseases of these women as they go through life constantly being patronized and coddled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force companies not to offshore to India to escape the ridiculous cycle of defeated idealism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nudge women away from childbirth and into the workforce to pay for the declining economy as a result of the previous steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encourage immigration and push for illegal immigrants to be given citizenship in order to make up the deficit of births.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force different cultural groups not to fight in order to keep illegal immigrants in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force population to give up guns in order to cut down intercultural violence due to close proximity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Declare that, as women have greater mental illness levels, lower pay, lower graduation rates, lower levels of trust in the workforce, and declining happiness, more government control is needed to equalize the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Declare that institutionalized racism is driving apart cultural groups and that more government funding and greater diversity are needed to stop racial violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally, word for word, what is happening.

       It's crazy this got downvoted. It's a shame there are some many feminized individuals and liberally indoctrinated people on this conspiracy page. You would think they would be at the craft brewery after 60 hour week at a corporate wage slave job

       It was cross-posted to “TopMinds”, which I think is a sub dedicated to breaking the rules and brigading someone into agreeing with marxist dialectic. I’ve lost a shit ton of “karma” since it was posted there and the site owners refuse to take it down.
