       Odom is the guy who shot a pastor the day after the pastor invoked prayer at a Ted Cruz rally. After shooting the pastor, he got in his car, drove away - and, despite law enforcement knowing exactly who he was, he boarded a plane, flew to DC, and the only reason he was apprehended was because he was caught throwing documents and a thumb drive over the White House fence.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is described in the news as suffering from "unspecified mental illness;" no mention is made of the medications he may have been taking or not taking. He does refer to deep meditation in the manifesto.

       The story is interesting but also terrifying.  I had a strikingly similar experience in my life sans the Martian conspiracy part. I saw a blue light after a lot of prayer and also woke up with tears. I didn't go crazy then but a few years later I went completely off. I also was super stressed in school and completely stopped sleeping. Every few hours I had a different theory as to what my reality was.  This went on for months.  I took no drugs or other substances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story he tells is different than mine but a lot of similar things. I also thought people were digiusing themselves as other people. He thought it was Martians I had my own story (it's pretty in depth and kind of comical now but i don't want to dox myself.) Luckily my outbursts were harmless and not stopping a Martian dominated world. I'm so happy I never killed anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read his story today and was taken aback. That could have been me. Thankfully I had a great support system of family and friends and doctors that helped me. I'm a normal functioning adult now and have been for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope he gets the help he needs. In my experience its not just meds and loving support that fixed me(although they were essental).  Because I got to where I was from (what at the time) I thought was a logical conclusion, my world did not completely right itself until I logically saw the flaws in my thinking. This dude is no dummy. He has to be brought to reality under his own understanding or he won't be convinced it is the case. He needs a space where he can't harm others or himself and can talk about what is going on. Someone listening helps a ton and maybe he could see for himself the holes in his story. Right now the story he is telling IS his reality.
       <br/>
       It's sad to see this happen but hopefully this story turns around like mine did.

       On that closing statement: this guy actually killed someone, so I doubt his story will turn around just fine (specially considering the fucked up us legal system). About the rest: so you sold out, you martian-loving scum

       Can confirm.  Pastor Tim is talking and in good spirits. He and his family sent prayers for Kyle - they understand he's ill. But on a really weird side note: the guy was shot 6 times, including a bullet to the head. His skull literally stopped the bullet. Call it a miracle if you subscribe to that kind of thinking- or- Aliens. Either way, odom didn't kill anyone and the victim is recovering.

       Not even shitting you, this was all over local talk show radio!
      </p>
      <p>
       and here was my personal convo about the event:
      </p>
      <p>
       Roommate: He got shot six times? 
Me: So reported...
Roommate: In the head and the bullet didn't penetrate?
Me: Not according to the Church People.
Roommate: Was it a twenty-two?
Me: HellifIknow!
      </p>
      <p>
       Twenty two, at distance and angle might not penetrate skull!
      </p>
      <p>
       My roommate looked at the Newtown shit show and Hebdo/Paris with much insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really bizarre shit!

       Sheesh.  Really does sound like it.  I just read the whole manifesto last night.  It really sucks too because off world intelligent, technologically advanced beings are
       <em>
        100% real
       </em>
       .  Zero doubt about it.  They exist
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">
        all throughout the cosmos
       </a>
       , and live in this very galaxy, solar system, and
       <em>
        on this very planet
       </em>
       .  They
       <em>
        exist.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said...the more I read through Odom's manifesto, the more it seems like what happened with him was that he was a "normal" kid that perhaps had some deep but ultimately latent/dormant psychopathic/psychotic tendencies which would have likely
       <em>
        remained
       </em>
       dormant...but that were somehow activated by what he experienced during his meditative practices.  The things he saw and experienced during his meditation may have in fact actually occurred and been real.  However, it seems like it somehow activated something in his brain that just made him start thinking that
       <em>
        everybody around him
       </em>
       was part of "them"...and it seems it may have made him go a little wonky in the mind as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like maybe 10-15% of what he experienced and saw (in and out of meditation)
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       indeed real (which is a big deal because he talks about some
       <em>
        far out shit
       </em>
       in his manifesto)…but a good 50-80% might not have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that I don't doubt for a moment that at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of what he said he saw and experienced was, again, very much real and true.  We do indeed live in a very fucked up, very controlled, very strange, and manipulated world.  However...I'm not sure I can say that
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       he experienced and everyone he saw that he thought was one of "them" actually
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       one of "them" and it wasn't, instead, his mind just going wonky and playing serious tricks on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's fucked up about all this is that what this story does/is going to do is that it will take all those other individuals who do also have very real experiences…and it will put them in a bad light, and it will cause unthinking, uncritical type of people (which unfortunately seems to be many people in society) to immediately take
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       ET claims - and even the overall practice of
       <em>
        meditation itself
       </em>
       - and associate it all with
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       kid.  They'll immediately categorize people making ET claims or who even just talk about entering and achieving deep meditative states as being “Just another wonky weirdo like that other kid.  Hey!  Make sure you don't go on any shooting sprees, you tin foil hat weirdo!  Durrr!!"

       He was shot from behind (in the back) with a .45 caliber. The gun hasn't been found. Odom said he shot him 12 times, but officials here locally reported 6. Also- the bullet penetrated his skull but stopped just before entering soft tissue.

       I'm about 20 miles from the church where this happened. There are some small details I've picked up from being a local- the media here is all over this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially the message he got inviting him to the church was a wrong number. The church is known for having a very solid addict recovery program. Meth is HUGE here. There is a serious epidemic especially on NIC campus in Idaho. There is a theory floating that he was a solid good guy- so something happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tweakers around here seem
       <em>
        obsessed
       </em>
       with this lizard people theory. The few I know carry binoculars and are constantly taking apart trac phones and pulling chips out. Seriously. This is a thing.

       Yeah. I'm down in the Valley myself. Was aware of this program from former clients wishing to relocate.

       From the sounds of it he put himself into the VA for Mental Health care and this is something that would be very rare, in my experience for
       <em>
        an addict

       I didn't catch Bolyn when he was here. I keep an open mind but he's a little too "fringe" for me.
      </p>

       You're right about the rarity of addicts going in for mental health, but my dad was a vet (and an addict) who did check into the VA for help. So- I probably have a little confirmation bias. To me Odom sounds like a really stressed out guy who went days with out any sleep. That can make a sane person crack imo. I'm theorizing though- that he got pulled into drugs to ease his pain. Mental health issues, plus insomnia is a recipe for disaster.

       The only thing I can point to is the suicidal comments in the manifesto. Suicidal ideation can be a precursor for drug use.

       I can't find anything on layovers during his flight, but there are a lot of reporters talking about
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       he got past TSA. News snip: "...the vetting system does not query criminal databases like the FBI’s National Crime Information Center. That means people with active arrest warrants can fly relatively freely in the country because they are not routinely flagged by the terrorist-watch list."

       From past experience flying out of Boise to the East Coast, there are no direct flights that I can find. Would stand to reason that he would have been in at least
       <em>
        three airports
       </em>
       from Boise to DC.

       One would think a BOLO would have been issued to TSA?

       he boarded the plane in Boise.

       Yes they tracked him until they had a report that he may have entered Oregon. That's where it seems they lost him.

       It's the State Prosecutor's call, not the victim's (the victim could sue civilly; in this case, probably some suits will happen on the victim's behalf as his health insurance company might try to get the shooter's insurance to pay - wonder if that would that be Tricare/VA?). Would assume attempted murder would be the charge, may be Federal charges, too, for the throwing-over-the-fence stuff.

       The craziest part about this is that it might be true. I practice deep meditation and have had similar experiences. I also have knowledge of the underground civilization and life originally coming from Mars. This needs some further investigation before people write him off as crazy or paranoid.

       Did you ever watch that old kids' TV show, Land of the Lost? Wonder if there's some archetype deep in our psyches that comes out under meditation or hallucinogens - because it seems repeated across people and experiences.

       posted the interview video three days ago. I listened to it as I was headed to bed, as I often do with
       <em>
        new to me
       </em>
       persons/ideas of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something about it struck me while I was looking at the post on Washington State being used by the Navy for illegal
       <em>
        testing
       </em>
       and this story breaking last night. So, yes. I went back and listened again today because the Goldsmith name stuck with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Odom was
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       the parameters for a schizophrenic
       <em>

       I would imagine a true chemical imbalance is also at play like overproduction of nor-epinephrine causing an overactive mind then psychosis. It bugs me when people say it's just their imagination because were talking about an adult studying medicine here not some child that doesn't have enough to do.

       He is partially correct. im new to conspiracy but most of you guys seem like good folk. If you're interested read up on wespenre google his research papers. Genetics are a big deal.

       this guy was targeted, very profoundly. Meditation is a good thing, but it also opens us up to negative channels and influences. Electromagnetic thought impulse wave attacks (whatever u want to call them, fuck semantics, seek the truth) are a thing. When we start "hearing voices" automatic red flag, especially if we have NOT explicitly asked or given permission to outside entities to enter.
      </p>

       read up on the universal law of free will. anyways. happy camping hope this guy's life is fullfilled if not on this life, than on another life. I wish I could have talked to him.

       They say when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail, so take it with a grain of salt that this screams mind control to me. They do get in two-way telepathic contact with you, and do initially play the alien card. All that's been described in excruciating details by hundreds of victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of similarities between this account and those of mind control victims, including the idea that everyone is stalking them because of something innocuous- in this case a sniffing.

       Just finished reading.  Giving the benefit of the doubt to its authenticity based on what has happened to others that I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       is true.  The answer to his problems became apparent about three pages in, but given the known outcome of his fate, I knew it wouldn't appear within the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that, if you choose to dabble in deep meditation and consciousness expansion, know that you are venturing into the
       <strong>
        spiritual
       </strong>
       realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I say this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if you dip your toes into this realm, to the extent of making yourself known to those which exist primarily outside of our dimension, [this takes substantial effort and patience, combined with a superabundance of fortitude (do you notice what isn't required out of that which is mentioned here?)] don't kid yourself with thinking there isn't a consequence if you reach certain states [such as mentioned in the story].
      </p>
      <p>
       The repercussions of doing this without having a central point and belief in
       <em>
        something positive
       </em>
       such as God, Christ Consciousness, Jesus, etc.  By central point I mean something that which you are willing to die for willingly and openly out of love and
       <em>
        altruistic belief
       </em>
       , you open yourself to
       <strong>
        all entities
       </strong>
       positive or negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that since God was not mentioned a single time within the story, he opened himself to the extreme negative entities of Orion.

       Did you read the entire manifesto?  He did mention God and heaven, but to say they don't exist.  I agree that he was under serious spiritual attack.  I've read many stories of those negative entities ("demons" or "jinn") duping people into believing they're aliens from another planet who control the world.

       I've also experienced this blue light
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny, because that's literally what I called it. "The blue light"
      </p>
      <p>
       It was preceded by me forgoing drug use and seeking other states of consciousness through meditation as well. While I was experiencing this I felt this positive glow around me and my empathy was through the roof. I could dissect and see the flaws in everything, without being aggressive or defensive. See through every lie. The world and all of the concepts contained therein seemed like they were made of plastic, and still do somewhat but to a much lesser degree. Also had tons of lucid dreams and OBEs for awhile where I saw what I consider to be "real reality", so many other worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was convinced I was a hair's breadth away from leaving this world. It would come and go in waves that would get stronger each time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was interrupted by a lot of things... I went back to baseline quickly. I've also been in "telepathic" (sounds ridiculous, I know) contact with seemingly capricious "beings", whose motives I can't ascertain, but they seem to be distracting me or trying to steer me in a different direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I didn't read the whole thing, not sure why he went the violence route. One thing I learned in that state was to, despite the increased awareness of everything that is wrong and the incredible precariousness of existence (if you can even call it that) here, hate the game, not the players who are coerced by reality into being who they are (and therefore entirely faultless, no matter what they do). And don't even hate the game, just walk away from it because if you hate it then you're just engaging in it further.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not gonna dismiss his experiences, how much of it was real and how much of it was delusion is up in the air imo. It's probably a mix of the two. People are going to dismiss him off the bat because of "trigger words" like "mental illness", "aliens", etc. that provoke an automated response of sorts no matter what in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this world resolves itself soon.

       It's interesting how his madness was a result of his meditation. It reminds me of Kundalini syndrome a little. Meditation when done properly clearly affects the mind similarly to some drugs and therefore it has the same dangers.

       I got here from Google btw. I would like to know if there's an unedited version of the manifesto. Those crossed out words are annoying.

       That's one thing I don't get. Look at someone the wrong way at a check point, and you get the double-screening the next few times. This guy, they knew exactly who he was, what he looked like, had his plates, knew his name, and he's free to move about the country "armed and dangerous." I can understand it's hard to find someone, but he didn't even use fake ID...
      </p>
      <p>
       One part of me says, well, that's security theater for you. But the other is like, they knew this guy was batshit and had a second target planned - how'd he get on a
       <em>
        plane
       </em>
       ? I mean, if he hadn't've thrown stuff over the WH fence, he'd probably still be out there...it just doesn't make sense.

       Yeah, I'm still trying to figure out how he made a long ass road trip from CD, Id. into Boise without every State Patrol BOLO!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he boards a flight out of Boise. This is a smaller airport but it still employs TSA screening! There are NO direct flights out of Boise so, he had to land in Denver/Atlanta/Chicago to continue to DC! Did he rent a car when he got to DC?

       I find it interesting that his motivation had absolutely nothing to do with politics or religion (except when he was explaining that God was invented). The only problem I had with it was that he didn't explain what "millions of years" of scientific evolution was like. So, they made paper bags appear out of nowhere? Is that it? I want to know more of what these aliens can do that we can't. lol

       I know how stressful college courses can be, but I never meditated. And I'm aware that stress can bring on spouts of psychosis. I never heard my conscience talking to me and making me believe it was the person rubbing my leg on an airplane, though... stimulating my [asshole] and [dick]. Just never happened.

       First off, I hope to God this doesn't become an organized conspiracy/religion. Anyways, I share the same story, but not on details. After almost a full year of depression without help (my dad didn't care to listen, nor could I afford a psychiatrist), I didn't channel my sadness into meditation, but rather deep thought. After time, these thoughts grew and grew. My psychological skills became more and more advanced. Without struggle, I naturally would increase my skills at an alarming rate. I read body language so easy I could read someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, I learned to control my eyes (to water, or dry). Then, by body temperature, and then my heartrate. One day however, I had an insane experience during these deep thoughts that only expanded my mind, perhaps too far. See, the 10% we use of our brain controls our thoughts, but once you reach 11%, you can control your heartrate. I didn't realize at the time if I went past, I could potentially acquire control of my heart or other organs and perhaps stop them, obviously killing me in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       After this horrible existential-crisis-like deep thought I had, in best words: I felt like my mind was trying to break out of reality, everything I saw going back and forth rapidly in a fish-eye formation. For 2 seconds, I reached a state of carelessness for my reality. I realized I was only a microdecimal compared to the entire existence of the world and its existence forth-worth. I could kill, without caring. After these two seconds, I came back into reality. I couldn't believe what I had thought, what I could do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since (it's been about 2 years now) I have been dumbing myself down. I'm a lot more social, I get out more, I play online instead of only single-player. I got rid of my existential books, I resorted myself from existential thought. I started listening to Christian metal and realized I'm more to reality. We all are. We were all put here individually for a purpose by God, and I think that's the best right any of us could have.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only problem now however, is when I talk to people my eyes water. It's a psychological fear that I could control if I focused on it (I coined the term through my whole existential bullshit: meditation of thought condensation, or MTC) I won't use MTC on it however, I don't want to go back into the whole mental state I was in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the first time I've ever shared my extremely long, extremely thought-provoking story. Before I go, I might add that there are bonuses. With my immense knowledge I received of body-language, I'm not an A+ actor in my Drama class, extremely charismatic, and have heavy knowledge of how the human mind operates and when I hear about a psychological syndrome, no need to research why some would have it. I can already tell. Of course, I DO NOT recommend deep thought meditation or MTC to ANYONE. It simply will spiral you out of control into insanity, and many studies have shown that meditation/deep thought is a leading cause in insanity. Well anyways, God bless you all and may you all find divine peace :)

       it seems he had a couple of sleep paralysis experiences. he also probably fell asleep while meditating and experienced sleep paralysis. when people have sleep paralysis, they somewhat feel aware and out of body, also they can get aroused and some experience sexual encounters with jinn-like creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       he also seems schizophrenic which would explain a lot of his paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       if he was going to church i'm sure he would have felt like everyone there was crazy, definitely understand that, could have exacerbated his paranoia.

       Check out kyle odoms report that he wrote. It's worth a read. It shows how real experiences can be continously seen through the tint of confusion. Unable to see all that presents as it is by the habit of projecting our concepts over the reality. A classic case of meditation being mistaken for a means to become magical. If only they could see through the unlimited power of mind. It's sad how this is based around meditation. Unfortunately meditation is taught by many that don't understand proper technique and this confusion translates to the student. Far too often the professor tries to teach "profound" teachings that are really far from being profound. Meditation is not about becoming something else or achieving high states of whatever you wish to call it. It is simply a practise to get to know the mind and it's potential. This is done through a very simple yet not soo simple formal period where one brings their awareness to the present moment without judgement of thoughts feelings or sensations. That's it!! Since we do the opposite all day we can't learn about our habits and tendencies so this is a formal get to know you period without participating in the distraction. I apologize to anyone that I have offended if so, that would be the unthinkable act and does not reflect my intention which is, to simply clarify a little so that this unfortunate confusion is ceased. Let me note that anyone's experience here of meditation is 100% okay. The issue lies more in the judgement and fixation to our experience when  we bring the awareness. Anyone have questions feel free to ask me. I have been meditating for a while. Let us pray for all those people suffering from such pain.

       posted the interview video three days ago. I listened to it as I was headed to bed, as I often do with

       <em>
        testing

       and this story breaking last night. So, yes. I went back and listened again today because the Goldsmith name stuck with me.

      <p>
       Odom was
