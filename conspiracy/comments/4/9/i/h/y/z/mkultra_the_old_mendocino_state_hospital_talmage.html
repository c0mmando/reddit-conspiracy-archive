        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I lived in Mendocino Co. California for many years during the time it changed from being an agricultural backwater to a hippie/cult enclave, 1960&#39;s/1970&#39;s.</p>

<p>I was none of the above. Just a young person looking to survive in this world.</p>

<p>In the last few days I have weirdly discovered that I lived in a vortex of conspiracy of that time. I had no idea -</p>

<p>The old Mendocino State Hospital which became infested with the People&#39;s Temple was and was used for mind control drug experimentation. The Jonestown Massacre, Guyana, where people known to me died. Moonies, a $billion+ empire connected to to US government and the Bush family. Moonie property is where the winter Olympics will be held in S.Korea 2018.</p>

<p>The Manson family, a lot of weird serial killers back in the day active in Mendocino county -  Bowie Bergdahl was  picked up in a Redwood Valley pot farm bust just last fall and whisked away by a military escort. No press.</p>

<p>What the actual fuck? I&#39;m old now. How did I fail to see all the connections before?</p>

<p>And no, I haven&#39;t posted any links to all of this. Been through too many in the last few days; didn&#39;t save them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just feeling gobsmacked by life. My life. I left there a long time ago but I still have ties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember riding my bike around the MSH property after it had been closed, it was a beautiful abandoned property. The old state hospital buildings were open and unlocked -</p>

<p>It was later sold to the Buddhists who operated a refugee resettlement center after the war in Vietnam. I worked with those refugees. The Buddhists (largely southern California nobility trust kids) stole their resettlement money. We bombed their country into oblivion, and then when we rescued some of them, a bunch of entitled SoCal kids in orange robes siphoned off their funds into god-know-where.</p>

<p>40 years later and looking back on my life, I feel lucky to have survived. I didn&#39;t even know I was in the Eye Of The Storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;ve also recently bumped into some weird cold case files about the Mendo Wicthes, Manson family people who are suspect in several Mendocino county unsolved murders.</p>

<p>The People&#39;s Temple saga is bizarre beyond belief. Apparently the government records are inaccessible even after 30 years. The US government refuses to release anything.</p>

<p>The old Mendocino State Hospital records are secret for 75 years after the closing of the hospital. I&#39;ve tried to get into them and failed.</p>

<p>And every time I start tracking into one of these items I run into MKUltra somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did indeed.</p>

<p>I will post it here again as I wish this name to be findable on the internet - Ken Kempton</p>

<p>Ken Kempton was a passenger of of mine in Ukiah CA after he was released from the Mendocino State Hospital approximately 1976. Working for MTA in in the late 1970&#39;s I picked him up every morning for <em>years</em> from his motel room and took him to the Model Bakery for his breakfast of doughnuts and coffee. Ken Kempton was my dear friend and associate -</p>

<p>Ken Kempton, formerly of the Mendocino State Hospital in Talmage CA, was released after some 20+ years of incarceration in the MSH. Upon many conversations with him,  he had no idea why he had been committed to a state mental health institution, and he could not remember how long exactly he had been there.</p>

<p>Ken Kempton remembered being committed sometime in the 1950&#39;s. He remembered family from southern California. He served in the US military in WWII, and played the trumpet. His eyeglasses were filled with moss (which he didn&#39;t notice) he was nearly blind. </p>

<p>Ken Kempton died @1981 from a brain tumor. I ferried him to the doughnut shop and then all his doctor appointments for years until he finally gave way. </p>

<p>Since the Mendocino State Hospital records have been sealed from 75 years after closure, I wish to record this rememberance of Ken Kempton on the internet for any relative who does a search.</p>

<p>He was a friend of mine, and a fine human being who did in fact exist.</p>

<p>Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was caught in the middle of a pot raid on Tuesday while he was on leave in California.</p>

<p>Bergdahl, who spent five years as a captive under the Taliban and was released last year in a controversial prisoner swap, was on leave at the time, Army Times confirmed Friday morning.</p>

<p>“U.S. Army North was contacted by the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office on July 21 regarding an incident within their jurisdiction in which Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was present,” said Lt. Col. Jason Shropshire, a spokesman for U.S. Army North, where Bergdahl is assigned.</p>

<p>Bergdahl was on “authorized leave in California at that time,” Shropshire said. “He was not arrested and has returned to his duty station at Fort Sam Houston. He has not been charged with any crime involving his time on leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.. I am starting to think there must be something to the rumors I have heard about that area.  I am from Mississippi but lived and farmed on Mcnab mountain outside of Ukiah near Hopland for a couple of summers.  I met several older folks there that told me there were secret DUMB&#39;s (deep underground military bases) there interconnected with other DUMB&#39;s.  They would also talk of missing persons and UFOs and such as well..  One night a girl and I were laying on the mountainside looking at the stars and there must have been a meteor shower going on because we saw lots of them.. It was pretty awesome.  During this time we both saw what appeared to be a slower moving star that would move in one direction and then suddenly shoot off at an angle into another direction at light speed and disappear.. I googled what I described a long time ago and never really came up with an idea of what those things were.. I can not confirm 100% that I saw any UFOs, but there was tons of air traffic... I assumed this traffic to be due to marijuana grows in the area and never really suspected anything different.  I have to say while visiting in Ukiah I met lots of very mentally unstable people, like very bipolar.  I mean I have been lots of places around this nation and there are mentally unstable people everywhere but not like what I saw while in Ukiah.  One minute they would be fine and enjoyable, and then it was like a switch flipped and they were outta control.. Ukiah pretty much survived on the medical marijuana industry from what I could tell while there.  I never really took all of the rumors about secret military bases, UFOs, missing persons, witchcraft, etc seriously but now I am starting to think there must be something going on there.  Interesting place, interesting people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never really read about People&#39;s Temple before. Super interesting so far.</p>

<p>Reminds me a lot of Snow Crash.. I can see more where Stephenson got his inspiration.</p>

<p>&quot;Jones saw Jonestown as both a &quot;socialist paradise&quot; and a &quot;sanctuary&quot; from media scrutiny that had started with the Kinsolving articles.[82] Former Temple member Tim Carter describes the reason for the move to Jonestown as &quot;in seventy four (1974), what we saw in the United States was creeping fascism.&quot;[83] Carter explained, &quot;It was apparent that corporations, or the multinationals, were getting much larger, their influence was growing within the government, and the United States is a racist place.&quot;[83] Carter said the Temple concluded that Guyana was &quot;a place in a black country where our black members could live in peace&quot;, &quot;it was a socialist government&quot; and it was &quot;the only English speaking country in South America.&quot;[83]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I just slipped under the wire on this thread... I found it because I have been going crazy trying to remember the name of that young woman that a cult- can&#39;t remember if it was Peoples Temple or The Family (not Manson&#39;s The Family- there was another little weird group in Mendo county called that). Anyway, she left the group, took a job at the state hospital, worked her way up, got a serious boyfriend etc and tgen it turned out it was all a set up to make her think she was going crazy. Her bosses were cult members, her boyfriend was, I think even the sheriff was or something. At any raten everywhere she turned all she got was people telling her she was crazy and needed to be institutionalized (at the hospital taken over by her tormentors.) She killed herself with all the non players thinking she&#39;d just gone paranoid delusional but eventually it came out that she was telling the truth. It was straight out of a VC Andrews gothic novel ir something. She had her own wikipedia page for a bit but I can&#39;t remember enough to look it up. Do you remember that story? Ended maybe &#39;77?</p>

<p>I was a kid them. My parents met in that state hospital. They were part of a super weird synanon-style drug program. </p>

<p>Anyway- shot in the dark but I&#39;ve been googling for an hour and the webpage that used to exist that talked about Talmage craziness pre-Jonestown has disappeared and now it&#39;s all Jonestown. </p>

<p>I mean, Jonestown <em>was</em> the flashiest but the weirdness of that era goes way deeper. I thought every place was like that til I moved out after high school.</p>
