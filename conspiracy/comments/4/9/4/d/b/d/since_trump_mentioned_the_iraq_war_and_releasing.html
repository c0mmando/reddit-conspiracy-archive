       On February 18th, Donald Trump said:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We went after Iraq, they did not knock down the World Trade Center. It wasn’t the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center, we went after Iraq, we decimated the country, Iran’s taking over, okay.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         But it wasn’t the Iraqis, you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center. Because they have papers in there that are very secret, you may find it’s the Saudis, okay? But you will find out.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       Donald Trump has the Cabal squirming!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Since he brought up the Iraq War and the 28 pages former high ranking officials have been lining up to take their shots at Trump in the media:

          112 GOP national security leaders
         </a>
         : including Philip Zelikow, Dov Zakheim, Michael Mukasey, Michael Chertoff
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       WHY???
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the American public knows the Iraq War was sold to us on a pile of LIES...and there is no defense of NOT releasing the 28 Pages...
      </p>
      <p>
       Former Senator Bob Graham had this to say last year at a press conference when he called for the release of the 28 Pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Saudis know what they did. They are not persons who are unaware of the consequences of their government’s actions. Second, the Saudis know that we know what they did! Somebody in the Federal government has read these 28 pages, someone in the Federal government has read all the other documents that have been covered up so far. And the Saudis know that...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         ...They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for one of the most extreme forms of Islam, Wahhabism, throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East. And second, they have supported their religious fervor, with financial and other forms of support, of the institutions which were going to carry out those extreme forms of Islam. Those institutions have included mosques, madrassas, and military. Al-Qaeda was a creature of Saudi Arabia; the regional groups such as al-Shabaab have been largely creatures of Saudi Arabia; and now, ISIS is the latest creature!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <a href="http://28pages.org/2015/01/10/jan-7-h-res-14-press-conference-full-video-and-transcript/">
        http://28pages.org/2015/01/10/jan-7-h-res-14-press-conference-full-video-and-transcript/
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       In addition, 9/11 victims' family members have called for the release of the 28 Pages...Even the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commission (Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton) have called for the release of the 28 pages in the summer of 2014:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.vidinfo.org/video/5054082/thomas-kean-lee-hamilton-call-for-the-release">
        http://www.vidinfo.org/video/5054082/thomas-kean-lee-hamilton-call-for-the-release
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So, expect more turbulence for Trump if he keeps on mentioning the Iraq War (which brings attention to their War Crimes) and the 28 Pages.

       Well, yeah, but also because after South Carolina it became increasingly clear that Trump was bulldozing his way to actually winning the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 28 pages may well be a part of that, but it's not the only reason the pushback is reaching freakout level.

       Thanks OP for doing all the leg work gathering up this material. I can't imagine they won't try to kill Donald Trump. They can't afford Trump once he's successfully elected. He's got to select a VP who's absolutely abhorrent to the NWO to succeed him. Assassination proofing could involve bringing in Rand Paul, or perhaps War Machine if he's out of jail in November?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't pick a Boosh to make peace with the RINOs. They almost killed Ronald Reagan only 8 months into his first term of office. Imagine Attorney General Roger Stone investigating JFK, RFK, MLK, RR and the NWO gang!!!!

Having a VP pick would make your ticket sound bad ass. The GOP Ticket of Trump War Machine will be visiting the State Fair followed by a cage match with Harry Ried a once promising boxer. Proceeds from the match will all go to the Clinton Foundation where I doubt they'll spend a dime on smelly poor people/sarc

       I think the other thing at play is how increasingly clear that TPTB intend(ed) to put Hillary in the White House, and that has been more of a problem than anticipated. Too many people know her history now (largely thanks to many on this sub and our ilk), and there's substantial evidence that the FBI and isolated members of the intelligence community and military are also aware of her history and agenda – and they don't like it. Bernie and Trump have become too popular on top of it, so they need to do a lot of vote rigging in Bernie's case and bring out the smear campaigns for Trump. I mean really, Mitt Romney suddenly gets airtime to bash this guy? And there are people who still give a shit about his opinion? What a fucking circus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there's an effort to smear/defame a guy like Donald Trump because he's actually a threat to become the POTUS is just incredible. Can't laugh or cry, just amazed. I think the numbers of people still suckered by this theater are shrinking, but there are still plenty to keep the sham on course.

       Jeb Bush posted a picture of gun on Facebook with the single word America  the day after Donald Trump did this, and blamed George Bush for 9/11. It was pretty obvious that it was a veiled threat.  There's no doubt that the intensity of the opposition has ramped up significantly after he said this.

       Not sure Wikipedia says Michael Bernard Mukasey is for torture, wiretapping and was the source for the unverifiable claim "the government might have been able to prevent the attacks of September 11, 2001, if it had been able to wiretap a specific call to the U.S. from Afghanistan."

       They're in full damage-control mode. I read the news for 15 hours a day (thank you add and unemployment) and it's getting scary how they're all just completely engaging in sedition against the people.

       It's so bad, I can't believe I haven't noticed it before. CNN, fox news, all the same talking points. I turn on npr on the way to work same. It's just a constant barrage of the same message over and over again. My friends are even repeating the messages and if I dare to say something a little different my friends post how wrong I am and basically that they are disappointed in me. Getting labeled a racist because I want the establishment to actually listen to us. :/ I guess this is where we are headed, agree with the message or lose your friends, and respect from your peers.

       I get you man, the problem is most people don't even read the news, they don't know what's going on, so to them it's all just scary, strange information. They're not really worth it, thought, I find I'm happier alone lately anyway.

       I'm sure those 28 pages detail extensive Saudi involvement, and it'a quite telling that even the current administration will go out of it's way to ensure that part of the conspiracy is suppressed.

       I love how Dick Chainy opens with ad hominem when asked about Trump. Reminds me of the discussions on reddit. Open with ad hominem and then stay off target. That creepy devil voice.

       It's reaching a fever pitch. Talking points are everywhere, on Facebook, twitter, the people are re-posting every last one of their points. *Failed businesses *con-artist *racist All the news is covering is the republican side they aren't even touching the turmoil in the democratic party. Sanders is being ignored. If they keep pushing off the populist movement I'm scared of what it's going to turn into. Wall street movement and tea party was started because of the anger wall street was shut down and the tea party co-opted but the anger still exists. The longer they push it off the worse it's going to get. :/ I don't understand the end game.

       I actually think it's about
       <em>
        avoiding
       </em>
       civil war. They know that the American people could overthrow them if they all worked together, so to prevent that they're making the Americans all hate each other. Black vs white, "Republican" vs "Democrat", Sanders is there to make sure young leftists hate the older generation, Trump is there to make sure people interested in conspiracies hate the sheep even more, and so on and so on.

       I still don't understand, why not just let the people have a voice? There has been research after research from the top universities that there is wisdom in the crowd. Why not listen to them? I understand the old philosophers didn't think that populace should rule themselves, that there should be "philosopher kings" but the science is no longer backing that up.

       We have bias because the information we are being shared isn't the truth and the structure of our media is programming people what to think. We have come so far in science and understanding ourselves yet our political power system is still who has the most wealth, born into power, and people who are only in it for themselves, how does that make any sense?

       You have to realize that Donald Trump has altars. It may be his front altar that is a "conspiracy theorist" but he has many other altar personalities that play in to what the Cabal are trying to do. For that reason, once he gets into D.C. he won't have a chance because you are only one dissociated out taxi driver away from black magick central.
