       Dr. Judy Wood is a disinformation specialist. What's her motivation to lie? Let's take a look at her "evidence";
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wood asserts that the steel “turned to dust.” One of the key observations that she uses to support this conclusion is the dust that appeared when a portion of the North Tower's core finally came down about 12 seconds into the destruction of the North Tower, several seconds after the floors that used to surround that core structure had been pulverized or had fallen to the ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, upon studying the video of the “spire,” we find that the steel did not “turn to dust” (see for example the next to last segment in
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W0-W582fNQ">
         http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W0-W582fNQ
        </a>
        ). The spire clearly simply fell after being attacked by explosive charges, leaving behind, in mid-air, the pulverized concrete that had been resting on, or statically stuck to, the steel. As is well known, air resistance causes dust to fall slower than macroscopic pieces of structural steel (note the final remaining column falling faster than the dust in the third photograph of the sequence).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the structural steel was “dustified,” one would expect to see at least some evidence for partially “dustified” steel members in the debris. Yet nothing of the sort is shown in Wood’s book or website. One would also expect a much higher fraction of the dust to be found to consist of iron than the 5.87% maximum detected by RJLee Group (see below). the massive structural steel was roughly equal to the mass of concrete in the towers, and there was not enough gypsum wallboard to dilute the iron below a 6% proportion, if any significant fraction of it had been “dustified.”

       Well it's pretty obvious that she's right about it turning to dust.  Didn't you see the collapse of the towers?  Did you see the cleanup efforts?  Did you hear the testimonies of everyone in the nearby areas?  There were piles of concrete dust everywhere all over the city for weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the smoke cleared, the rubble accounted for a fraction of the actual mass of the towers.  Where's the other amount?  Did it melt?  Evaporate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying she's right, but I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       saying her observations vis a vis the dust,
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       , aren't wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current most popular theory in the truth movement is controlled demolition, not micronuke or energy weapon but honestly people need to get straight on their observations first; and that means a reinvestigation completely so they can start getting a consensus on what facts they believe are factual.

       I don't know what "dustified" means but I do know what "turned to dust" means.  I'm taking that as the definition.  I saw a building turn to dust, so did millions of other people.  If you want to continue to deny reality by splitting hairs in some kind of excuseological, system-justifying way, that's fine.  You can join the 51% of other people who are going to continue to live with an abject lack of integrity in every moment of the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If however you really do care and you're just getting cogtive capture in some kind of contrarian aspergian way and want to get at the truth, then calm your mind and make a cogent arguement in simpler terms that everyone can understand so that you have impact.  Otherwise I'll just continue to assume you're part of this system-justifying majority that continues to be on the wrong side of history and of truth, forever.  Which your'e certainly entitled to be, because this is america where you're allowed to be wrong, evil, immoral, laughing at goat herders with half their limbs blown off and nothing bad ever happens to ya

       Liars like 911ciablowjob often project their behavior onto others. When did 911ciablowjob read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? I read it five years ago and know when someone is posting disinformation. I also notice posters referring to Dr. Wood as "Judy" like they are old school chums or have a family relationship. 
There is a psychological reason for addressing her in this way and it's not to promote the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Wood does not present a theory. Dr. Wood presents EVIDENCE and only EVIDENCE that leads to the only conclusion that a type of energy was directed in a highly specific way to break the bonds of matter turning it to dust right before your eyes in less than 10 seconds for each tower. (Try clapping your hands 110 times in 10 seconds.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11 over a half mile of vertical building height, containing nearly 150 football fields of floor space, was reduced to a near-level field of dust and debris, where rescue workers walked horizontally or rappelled into empty caverns to look for survivors. How was this possible given the standard laws of engineering and physics? The 9/11 Commission Report bypassed this central issue, as did the report of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Contrary to its stated objective of determining 'why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed,' the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) made the stunning admission that it did not investigate how the towers fell. Neither the standard view that the Twin Towers collapsed from fire nor the standard opposition view that they were intentionally detonated by thermite explosives explains the evidence, nor do they follow the laws of engineering and physics. Dr. Wood left Clemson to research the 9/11 conundrum full time, and she has focused her research strictly on physical evidence and scientific principles. WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? provides an understandable, credible, and photo-enhanced summary of Dr. Wood's disturbing findings, which resulted in her lawsuit against the contractors of the NIST report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Judy Wood earned a Ph.D. Degree from Virginia Tech and is a former professor of mechanical engineering. She has research expertise in experimental stress analysis, structural mechanics, deformation analysis, materials characterization and materials engineering science. Her research has involved testing materials, including complex-material systems, in the area of photomechanics, or the use of optical and image-analysis methods to determine physical properties of materials and measure how materials respond to forces placed on them. Her area of expertise involves interferometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       She taught graduate and undergraduate engineering classes and has authored or co-authored over 60 peer-reviewed papers in her areas of expertise. In the time since 9/11/01, she has applied her expertise in materials science, image analysis and interferometry, to a forensic study of over 40,000 images, hundreds of video clips and a large volume of witness testimony pertaining to the destruction of the WTC complex. Dr. Wood has conducted a comprehensive forensic investigation of what physically happened to the World Trade Center site on 9/11. And, based on her analysis of the evidence she gathered, in 2007, she filed a federal qui tam case for science fraud against the contractors who contributed to the official NIST report about the destruction of the WTC. This case was filed in the US Supreme Court in Dec 2009. To this day, Dr. Wood's investigation is the only comprehensive forensic investigation in the public domain.

       I don't think she is, I also don't think she is 100% correct in her analysis. I also don't go around shitting on people and calling names. Face it. Many technologies were used on that day. And rather than throwing names and fighting maybe we can learn from each other. But you know, that would be rational/logical.

       That's also Judy's claim. Maybe you can explain the missing "dustification" of the steel in the dust, because Judy can't/won't.

        If the structural steel was “dustified,” one would expect to see at least some evidence for partially “dustified” steel members in the debris.

       If 911ciablowjob claims to be an active member of the 9-11 Truth Community, then that means this individual is active in covering up the use of a highly classified use of directed energy and is not interested in the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Wood does not make any claims. Dr. Wood is not an Internet blogger tasked with the job of swaying public opinion. Dr. Wood is a forensic engineer and scientist. Dr. Wood conducts research and writes reports. That is what Dr. Wood does. Dr. Wood does not have a dog in this fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       911ciablowjob - What is the iron content of these samples? This is a rhetorical question so if you igrore it that would be a proper reaction because the dust samples are a bogus argument for those who wish to cover-up the use of directed energy.

       Why is this evidence being covered up?

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The USGS values for the samples collected under the big dust cloud weren’t reported. Why? See Fgure 339 (a) (b) and Figure 340 (a) (b), page 324 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you must understand that what the USGS DID report in collected dust were biased samples. A lot of the material went up into the atmosphere, down the eastern seaboard, and wafted away. That dust wasn’t presented as a data sample in the USGS study. So, their study is bias. See Figure 337, page 323 of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.

      </p>
      <p>
       The USGS didn’t collect the dust samples until about a week later – AFTER it had rained about 2 inches (the back side of Hurricane Erin) and AFTER they had hosed down the streets. (Rain values are shown in the Glossary table in the back of WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?.)

       I read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? five years ago. If someone has not read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO?, they have no standing to dispute it. ;-) ♥

        If the structural steel was “dustified,” one would expect to see at least some evidence for partially “dustified” steel members in the debris. Yet nothing of the sort is shown in Wood’s book or website. One would also expect a much higher fraction of the dust to be found to consist of iron than the 5.87% maximum detected by RJLee Group (see below). the massive structural steel was roughly equal to the mass of concrete in the towers, and there was not enough gypsum wallboard to dilute the iron below a 6% proportion, if any significant fraction of it had been “dustified.”

       That's not my job nor is it my aim.  I think there is merit in validating her
       <em>
        very obvious observations
       </em>
       as
       <em>
        truthful
       </em>
       , which they are.  I however am not to jump to conclusions, but neither is the ae911truth movement, and they are very careful not to say, the towers were a controlled demolition.  Instead all the wording I've seen is "the towers accelerated freefall is an
       <em>
        indication
       </em>
       (or 'shows characteristics of) a controlled demolition".
      </p>
      <p>
       They clearly had lawyers work with them to coach their languaging so they wouldn't be making accusations.  It is however fair to say "it looks like this", "the physics would suggest", "the numbers don't lie", "judging by the total mass found measuring only 15' high"...etc

       While I do grasp your argument, the site was
       <em>
        swiftly
       </em>
       being
       <em>
        sanitized

       . There was a forensic crime specialist on scene marking
       <em>
        exhibits

       that were then lost. How can you study lost evidence? There was plenty of aluminum cladding but not much steel.
