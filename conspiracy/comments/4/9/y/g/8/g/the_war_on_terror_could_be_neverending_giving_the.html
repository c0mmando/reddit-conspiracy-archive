       Exactly. War is supposed to be declared on a country, group of people, etc. When we have a war on "terror" the meaning is arbitrary. It is then up to the government to decide what "terror" is and who are the perpetrators. It opens the door for perpetual war, as the meaning of terror can be ever changing in order to fit an agenda.

       Many were saying this very soon after 9/11...the authorities have created a (faux) 'invisible enemy' and one that can be fought against indefinitely. It's mainly Israel's grip on US foreign policy that is driving this, allowing Israel increased hegemony in that region and the subsequent fallout is effectively destroying everyone else (see Europe).

       Yes...that's correct.  I watched that Russo video a good few years ago, he was the producer for Trading 'WTC' Places (film). The WTC was literally the Rockefeller Towers...it was Nicholas Rockefeller that Russo referred to. Russo alleged that Rockefeller told him about 9/11, around a year or so before the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only issue I have with Russo is his work on Trading Places, the film has 911-WTC subliminals/ciphers/predictive programming elements, within its body. Of course, this doesn't mean he's responsible for those aspects...I only mention this to give a wider picture etc.

       Thanks for clarifying. Yep, I saw that too in Trading Places. My understanding of Russo though was that he kind of "woke up" at one point. He had been friends with Nicholas Rockefeller for a long time before finally seeing what his family was doing and had a life changing moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't confirm this though, and he's dead now, so who knows.

       Yes...he's a tricky one to evaluate (Russo). He was apparently a bit of a bully in his earlier years...he was heavily linked to Bette Midler, who had a restraining order against him for abuse and for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to agree though, he might well have had an epiphany of sorts and then started to talk...that's the most likely, imo.

       I've always felt this was the "first-step" to the path TPTB want us all to walk down. I wish there was a way to push a different narrative. America's Reign of Terror = America's War on Terror. But alas I'm probably on a list for equating the two. But don't worry, they can just called me a terrorist after they "black-bag" me or anyone. I just assume they're saving that for when someone really starts MLKing their way into the spot light.

       Calling it the "War on terror" was the first sign that this was going to be a never-ending war because you can always change the players and the war itself remains the same because you're fighting a vague, frightening term like "terror." Might as well call it the war on horror or the war on bad stuff. There's never going to be a world without "terror" in it, and they knew this when they created the term and they knew that they could fear mongre the public into supporting it. Because you don't support terrorism, do you, comrade?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the last generation who will remember what it was like to live in a world where we are not in a constant and consistent war with some far off country that we vaguely know about. Our children will just come accept a world with a war on terror just as they will accept a world where all things and all people are connected via social media and anything you have ever said or done or even thought of possibly saying or doing can be held against you for years to come. The concept of personal freedom and individuality is going to become less and less important to the point where future generations won't care about it at all, because it has been ingrained in them to fear the invisible monster under the bed and the only way to fend it off is to be 100 percent open and public with everything you say and do.

       We definitely need a new word for it. Something like "non-state military" or something. It shouldn't be something that any individual can claim just by feeling a certain way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al Qaeda isn't a special threat requiring exceptional responses because they can blow up a train. They are exceptional because they can blow up twelve trains at once. On the other hand, the San Bernardino killers or the Boston Marathon bombers committed ordinary crimes. There was no reason why ordinary criminal penalties and investigators weren't enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Al Qaeda and some guy share the same hate in their hearts should not affect federal policy. "War" should, at the very least, be reserved for organizations that pose a true existential threat.
