       maybe they are all pedophiles.  that sort of thing is rampant in hollywood.  anyone else remember the rumors about hunter thompson?  anyone else remember rob lowe, and r. kelly, and the dad from seventh heaven?...I am probably forgetting a few pedophiles here and there, this list is just off the top of my head.

       They want to reserve the special rights of their class, the artistic mass-media creators. They entertain and brainwash the masses. This is an important service that they provide to government/control-structure. They want to reserve their right to drug and rape 13 year olds. What is the mystery here?

       &amp; have signed "a contract" to keep quiet or else their money, reputations &amp; careers are shut down.

       Basically compatible with much of McGowan's findings and analysis, except that it reaches different conclusions regarding the actual murders. If correct, it means either that the charges against Polanski were faked, or that since he is working for TPTB, they helped him escape to Europe to continue leading a charmed life (perhaps up until he started his fictional whistle-blowing...?).

       No. He claims to be a victim of a conspiracy, and given that the US, and states like California in particular, is ruled by an interlocking machine composed entirely of conspiracies against its own citizens, I'm inclined to believe him. That being said, I'd really like to hear what Johnny Depp thinks about it, because Johnny is one of us. And it is notable that the Swiss judiciary ruled the conspiracy's extradition request was without merit.

         The night RFK was assassinated, RFK had his Last Supper (final dinner) with Roman Polanski &amp; director John Frankenheimer, who directed the film adaptation Seven Days in May (about a U.S. military coup by the Joint Chiefs of Staff) of the book -- at the urging of JFK himself, who was a fan of the book.

         According to Dave McGowan's
         <em>
          Laurel Canyon
         </em>
         book:  Sharon Tate, the daughter of a military intelligence colonel, and knew Charles Manson (as did many residents of Laurel Canyon).  Polanski first suspected the involvement of John Phillips (of the band The Mamas &amp; The Papas) in the murder of Tate.  Phillips' family, wife &amp; in-laws were employees of military intelligence, DOD and the Pentagon.  Phillips was later accused of incest by his daughter Michelle Phillips.

         Polanski directed
         <em>
          The Pianist
         </em>
         in 2002 and was given an Oscar, and there was no Interpol warrant for his arrest.  But then he directed
         <em>
          The Ghost Writer
         </em>
         (U.S. title; international title
         <em>
          The Ghost
         </em>
         ) and the film implicates that a Tony Blair-type Prime Minister was MI5 and linked to the CIA.  Suddenly there was a warrant for Polanski's arrest.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In real life, Tony Blair was alleged to be MI5 by David Shayler, an MI5 whistleblower.  After making this allegation and others, Shayler became a transvestite and declared himself God, which rendered Shayler a joke &amp; engineered a backlash against any claims that Blair was MI5.  This reeks of an intelligence psy-op tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good theory would be that Blair actually is MI5 or CIA-linked (as Jesse Ventura's claims of CIA placement in elected offices), and that the interdiction against Polanski (which happened between during post-production of
       <em>
        The Ghost Writer
       </em>
       , when principal filming was completed but the film was on the verge of release) was, in fact, politically motivated and designed to "smear" Polanski as a means of limiting audience interest in seeing a film that implies Blair (or any head of state) as CIA.

        One very interesting detail in the film
        <em>
         The Ghost Writer
        </em>
        (among many) is the Google search that Ewan MacGregor does.  During his Google search, one of the fictional CIA Neocon culprits is described on-screen as being a member of the Aspen Institute, a very real Neocon cabal.  Google Aspen Institute, Judith Miller, Scooter Libby,
        <em>
         Dark Winter
        </em>
        , 9/11, Anthrax and they're all linked.  Guess what the Aspen Institute is currently working on?  A "surprise nuclear attack by Iran".

       Yeah character assassination or just assassination isn't unheard of (Michael Jackson, Tupac, maybe Bill Cosby, etc). It could go either way from what little I know.

       I've read stuff about Cosby being naval intelligence and even perhaps being the handler who programmed Hugh hef's bunnies with CIA mind control.

       He came from the military to star in a pro CIA tv show, I spy.

       Probably a mistake to take allegations as facts; people allege things for all kinds of reasons, not the least of which is money. Not that I mean to imply justice is served by the imperial tribunal system, but the court of public opinion is even less likely.
