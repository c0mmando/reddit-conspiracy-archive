<p>How could those other subs reflect the ethos of free flowing information undergirding this subreddit when this sub&#39;s moderation philosophy is itself subordinate to Reddit&#39;s general ethos of &quot;controlling content&quot;?  After all, every other day we get at least one post in this sub detailing a heavily upvoted post in the front page getting deleted by Reddit mods or of insane vote brigading on some other post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a little factoid that is semi-relevant: that tends to be the case with everything. Things that were underground knowledge or of underground interest in the past eventually work their way up to the mainstream. That&#39;s how it is with music too. I remember being one of the few people here in the US that was into electronic music back in the 90s and never thinking that it would be so ubiquitous and all over the radio. And lo and behold, it is now. It&#39;s just the way the world works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some &quot;fringe&quot; things take a LOOOOT longer to make their way into the mainstream than others, however.  Take the electric car, for example.  We have Tesla Motors today, but did you know that there were fully functional, <em>in production</em> electric cars as far back as the 19<strong><em>20</em></strong>s?</p>

<p>Yes.  You&#39;re right.  Sometimes things <em>do</em> just work that way and what is &quot;fringe&quot; today inevitably becomes &quot;mainstream&quot; tomorrow.  However, this simply does not work with everything - at all - and sometimes there&#39;s information that&#39;s kept so secret and so hidden from the public that it takes a MUCH longer time for it to get out...if it ever gets out at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but I could be a bit of both. A lot of what we talk about around here isn&#39;t typical conspiracy stuff anymore (ufo&#39;s, Giants etc.). A lot of the trending topics are much more realistic and often pretty factual. A lot of what we do here is simply the investigative journalism the msm has moved away from. The reason some of the story&#39;s may seem like conspiracies is bc the world is really getting that fucked up. Just a thought..  </p>

<p>[Part of me wants to say &quot;she&quot; because of Manning&#39;s gender reassigning, but another part of me doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s really Manning&#39;s choice or a whole psyop used to vilify and marginalize him/her even more than before, so I don&#39;t know...]</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with seeing what’s underneath it all.  Matter of fact, it’s very good to find out what the foundation of a thing is.</p>

<p>Understanding the Earth’s true shape gets you closer to understanding the truth of where you live.  That’s important.</p>

<p>Understanding the truth of Khazar control gets you closer to understanding the truth of where you live as well.  That’s extremely important as well.</p>
