        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently watched some Alex Jones videos and was surprised to find out he seems to be a person I agree with for the most part despite all the criticism against him. He brings up a whole lot of topics that are straight up taboo in the mainstream news including the mainstream news itself. Yes he gets loud and comes off like a rambling madman sometimes but you can tell he&#39;s just trying to grab new attention for threats he feels are imminent; things that are actively degrading society as a whole and he&#39;s being doing so for like 25 fuckin&#39; years so really I don&#39;t understand the hate. The main arguments I see boil down to:  </p>

<ul>
<li>He knowingly spreads false/misleading information for ratings. This seems most plausible to me but to a much milder degree than people say, I think.</li>
<li>He is an actual real life disinformation agent shill. Personally I just don&#39;t see it. There are plenty of half-truths that would get a rise out of enough people without disturbing the elite. Based on my personal evaluation of his more recent content (2008-present) I would say he spits a lot more truth than lie. Yes there are discrepancies and yes he tends to connect too many dots at once but overall I get an honest vibe from him.</li>
<li>He straight up works for the illuminati. Extremely unlikely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes I&#39;ve heard about him accidentally scaring people with false information but listen, if you truly want to be part of the well informed opposition to the 1% you better not be a person who immediately panics based on something you heard on a conspiracy radio show, legitimate or not. </p>

<p>So yeah I say give the guy a chance and don&#39;t just write him off because of things you&#39;ve read. Listen for yourself. I&#39;m learning a lot more than I thought I would from this person I&#39;ve read so many negative things about. Go figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, are you thick.  People <em>did</em> make their judgement, and you asked for input.  They simply disagreed with you is all.  Generally, people don&#39;t like Alex Jones because he just sucks and his shtick is really old.  Alex Jones gives every conspiracy theorist, or anyone who questions anything beyond the norm a bad name.  That makes him a piece of shit.  Some people like him, but they are really, really scraping the bottom of the proverbial barrel.  I had good, rational reasons for disliking his show:  he&#39;s loud, obnoxious, sounds like he&#39;s eating a dick, goes way off the deep end into lunacy, and yet you still sit here and say no one has given you reasons.  At this point you&#39;re either Jones himself or his biggest fan, because no one cares so much about him. No one.  If you want similar opinions, head on back to the prison-planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bias is sort of fair. I mean, Jones is correct about much of what he says, but he is selling fear. That&#39;s his business model. And much of what he says is bat-shit crazy, which means that none of what he says is ever to be trusted. Also, he is hypocritical and cynical. He despises his own fans for listening to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really contribute to this discussion in any large way. What I <em>can</em> say is that from what I&#39;ve seen, Jones seems like he has some balls. That whole Bohemian Grove debacle and the associated fallout from it was / is really interesting to see. But that was a while ago, so maybe it doesn&#39;t really hold up anymore.</p>

<p>More on the specific topic, luckinator said something I can definitely see. Alex Jones sells fear. On one hand I can see how that&#39;s exploitative, but on the other, are conspiracy theorists in general not prone to similar fear-toting? You see it every day, even on this sub. I guess it&#39;s different when you use it to fuel a career?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a gatekeeper for the alternative media usually for younger libertarians. Usually his crowd are younger and more vigilant. Glenn Beck is the gatekeeper for the alternative older conservatives/faux-libertarians. Both give out 9 truths and the 10th is a lie (the biggest). Neither go into the full depths of truth, they create a ceiling, that never allows listeners to ascend. This is classic gatekeeping/controlled opposition. I call AJ&#39;s show a circus, and GB&#39;s show hospice.</p>

<p>Why are they traitors? Because they both sell out their country and countrymen/women by being apart of what I stated above.</p>

<p>I appreciate your wishes to find someone to believe in and trust. I feel the same. But Alex Jones is not that person.</p>

<p>You want some links to prove it? Here goes, from the Austin Free Speech event in 2010 that Jones crashed and tried to hijack:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.dailypaul.com/122932">http://archive.dailypaul.com/122932</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWM17wiHhww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWM17wiHhww</a></p>

<p>There was also this video link, which showed Jones at his worst, which the article notes has been repeatedly been removed from YouTube. I&#39;ve seen it, he&#39;s a total asshole, blasting through his megaphone to drown out their event. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_X-CVR5L14">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_X-CVR5L14</a></p>

<p>Alex Jones is conspiracy training wheels. He&#39;ll get you started, but at some point you&#39;ve got to get rid of him and start riding into the future on your own. Good luck. </p>
