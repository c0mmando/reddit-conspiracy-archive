       According to

        the eff

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The U.S. Congress is not likely to vote on the TPP implementing legislation (aka ratification) until after the International Trade Commission (ITC) comes out with its report about the agreement's economic impacts in mid-May.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And remember, since the "fast track" bill has already been passed, the TPP only needs a simple majority to pass and cannot be filibustered to require a supermajority. It is written in the TPP agreement that if the US delays passage of this bill for 2 years, then the TPP falls apart for all 12 countries involved. Delaying this for 2 years needs to be our goal, and we do it by creating public awareness of how awful the TPP is so that congress will not pass it for fear of a strongly negative reaction by the public, one that could cost them their jobs. We have to bring this situation about, it's the only way. Unless someone knows how to influence the EFF so they give a very negative report to congress.

       Although I  don't think Trump is actually against it since he moved all his manufacturing from the US to Mexico. I'd say he's fine with corporate globalism as long as it benefits him. And the makers of the TPP would certainly pay him off so it benefits him. Sanders cannot be sold in this same manner, so he's a better choice, imo.

       I'm not a trump supporter, but on this specific issue I think he's being truthful. Supporting the TPP would go directly against a his interests (mainly his property). So it's very unlikely he supports it. It would make him lose money, and power. I doubt he would support

       My screwdriver can open paint cans. Does that make it a paint opener and not a screwdriver? No one is denying the TPP reduces some tariffs for some goods. That is the bait in the bait and switch. My concern is all the other provisions, particularly re: IP and the ISDS, which are not about lowering tariffs. This is a common move in Congress, bundle stuff that couldn't pass on its own with important bills like the budget

       That may be true. But there isn't even the slimmest chance she will be arrested, or even go to trial. She's be more likely to drop out of the election for no reason what so ever, than to be arrested. We can't rely on that happening.

       The illusion of choice, thinking that the election will make a difference, it should quell the masses for a bit while the new puppet gets settled in and makes a new mess of the current situations.  Let's have a war, that'll stimulate the economy!  Who can the new president pick a one sided fight with that will hedge mutual funds and interests alike?

       Yeah, he's friends with Hillary, they go golfing, Clintons went to Trumps wedding. He's a lifelong democrat, he's tearing apart the GOP and splitting the GOP vote.. I don't see why it's that hard to believe this theory.

       Gotta love the implicit racism in this statement too. We're America, we should have better internet than those dirty Romanians!

       I also love how so many people who lived under former communist/socialist  governments are coming out of the woodwork to call his ass out. They know what it's really like living with socialism, not this fable that is sold to you Americans.

       Well.. a couple things here to clarify for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) That is not implicit racism, you are vastly reaching here for something where there is nothing. I'm not even sure how you implied that. In fact, to me, it sounds like
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       the racist one for even mentioning "...dirty Romanians!"
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There are also people in those same countries calling our current methodology out. Who is right? Certainly you nor I know better, as much as we like to think we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Do you know what socialism is? America as it currently stands is 80% socialist under the guise of a "free, capitalist society." If you believe this, you have fallen for the media's lies. Peep this list and tell me what socialist programs you do not agree with:

       I know that Hillary can't be trusted with the bill, but Drumpf's position on it is something that I haven't considered. If he were to flip-flop on his position, I'd laugh, and I'd also be somewhat scared... as in, more scared than I already am about him.

       The worse ones are the people who say they are against it but are actually for it, like Cruz and Clinton.  Fucking traitors (In Clinton's case, Cruz isn't American so I guess he can't technically be a traitor).

       Other than contacting congress, or talking to other people who might be able to talk to more people and create a social movement... I think that trying to talk with the EFF may be fruitful since they're the ones who are going to tell congress if the TPP is good or not. If people made a stink to the EFF it may cause them to present it to congress differently, which may change the way congress votes. It would be great if it were made clear to the EFF in the next few weeks that the TPP is bad for America, and bad for congress.

       No, TPP is not evil. TPP contains one thing - a so called ISDS - that might be harmful. 
The problem with all the conspiracy theories about ISDSs are that they are very, very, rarely used. For example: Denmark has 40 free trade agreements containing an ISDS. But the state of Denmark has never actually been sued because of the ISDS. 
I'm not saying that the TPP can't be harmful. But it will not be the end of the world, and we don't need Arnold Schwarzenegger to save us from the evil corporations as a result of the free trade agreement.

       This reminds me of so many scifi movies where the future is bleak and dismal all because the corporations became the government.  10 yrs from now the world will wish they could come back to right now and stop the TPP from happening.

       The US as "Empire Under Demolition" is a dangerous place, like an injured bear, she doesn't know she is bleeding, the many small cuts were self imposed, hollowing out her own economy, destroying jobs and destroying her core strength: her forgotten citizen. Weakened she does what the monied elite tell her to do, like passing the TTIPiece of Shit and wreaking war the globe over AND sending goon squads to every country in the world, including yours.

       Face it: nothing you can do will have any lasting effect on any of this. We all fucked. The more you dwell on it the more bitter and upset you'll become. Let it go; embrace your impotence.

       That's an inflated percentage and you know it. Throwing up your hands in defeat is the same as letting the powerful continue to win. There's recognizing the truth, then there's cynical defeatism. You're straying in to the latter.

       Spreading an idea at the beginning will be like that, it takes time to get out there. If you want this to actually be talked about and people to give a shit, it needs to trend, it needs to be shared. You are by default going to run into a lot of people that don't know about it, that give you those blank stares. That's fine, you encounter that fairly often in waking life and it's not a big deal then, so why make it one now? If you let a normal reaction turn you off talking about an incredibly important idea, that the TPP is a horrendous thing, you accept your fate and lie down before the corporate steamroller that's about to hit us.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've heard of the bystander effect right? Where many people see an emergency situation and nobody calls for help because people assume somebody else would do it? I think some version of that happens at the societal social awareness level; how well informed people are, how badly misinformed, willingness to listen to new ideas, openness to discussion, stubbornness and deep set beliefs, popular pressure, ... all of these are different forms of distraction that contribute to the current societal bystander effect going on many issues, and currently the TPP. Someone's got to pick up the phone and dial for help, otherwise they consign themselves to their non-intervening fate. Same issue with this authoritarian socioeconomic emergency that's looming in the next couple months, though at this scale it's going to take multiple phone calls, multiple voices to gather the help needed to address it.
       <em>
        We can't afford to NOT have another voice
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Your business is your own and only you can choose whether or not you will talk to people about it, (even if many times they have no clue what it is) however I hope that you might reconsider.

       People have been conditioned to respond this way to anything "political" because the whole theatrical, dialectical system we have is designed to present two and only two sides, force everyone to choose one of them, and then argue incessantly with the other side and never look for common ground.

       Yes, please keep talking to random people! We're not informed, people like you help people like me learn about shit like this! I literally googled reddit conspiracy tonight because I am so tired of seeing "the election" on yahoo. I just see headlines when I go to check my mail, and I thought to myself tonight, fuck it, I might as well just see what's on reddit conspiracy (I've never been to this page before) and I clicked on this thread immediately. People who know (like you) do make a difference. Please keep talking about this

       Just proves how much the left wing will subvert the truth for agenda. When Bush was in office, all they ever talked about was jet fuel and steel beams, wars for oil, and other conspiracy theories. Once Obama was elected, they stopped caring about searching for "the truth" in fear of hurting their guy. When the emails first came out against Hillary, they said it was all a "right wing conspiracy theory" against Hillary, in fear of it hurting her presidential chances. Now that Bernie is here, it's suddenly "truth" again, mostly to spite Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       MMW, if Bernie wins the presidency, everything against him will suddenly be "right wing conspiracy" again and this sub will shrink a bit. If Trump wins, it will suddenly be considered "truth" and this sub will grow.

       Yes, and then I remember when bush got elected, how it was suddenly a left-wing conspiracy, then when Obama got elected it was a right-wing conspiracy again. Now people are starting to wake up that it doesn't matter which side, both are selling us down the river.

       What can you do? and I ask seriously. It seems like there's at least 100 online petitions to stop this thing, which is bittersweet. It shows massive interest but it's not consolidated. When I was younger I used to think calling your representative was stupid, but with how far we've drifted from actual communication, it's stating to feel like it might help.

       As far as I'm concerned I think it's a done deal.  Even if you call every day, all day, hundreds of times.  Even if you vote really hard.  We get a vote, but voting is about making you buy into the system, not giving you power.  Your speaks are drowned out by the millions in cash that they get for voting "right".

       Yes, but there have been issues in the past where literally millions of people have been super pissed about an issue, which forces the media to focus on it somewhat, and that causes congress to act differently because they know their jobs and reputation may be on the line.

       the TPP will accelerate 'the plan', i expect noise to be made but i don't know if that will be enough to delay or stop it. i've signed several petitions already &amp; have mentioned it to others, a lot of people aren't aware of it.

       Same with me here. I'm glad my senators and reps are not on board with the TTP. They seem to also be against all the crap that would totally wreak the internet and civil freedoms.

       People really want to hate on Trump, but he's the only candidate who wants to stop the TPP.  His stance on this is why all those CEO'S and corporation owners just had a meeting in Georgia to discuss how to stop him.  Its why the media is attacking him so much.

       If they're not receptive in that moment, move on. Just keep trying to reach out to people who may be receptive because they're the only ones who will try to do anything about it.

       And the TPP
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       affect them, because it will outsource and insource more jobs at an even faster pace then NAFTA did, leaving less jobs for American citizens. All while driving down wages so corporations can make more profit.

       I came here to realize none of us is doing something about this and this is a real issue to not do anything about it. All I see posts about how bad this would be, bla and bla.

      <p>
       We should start using social media/contact popular web pages that might share this and so on, we really should start spreeding this to let people realize the problem with all of this, I bet nobdy would accept this if they know about it.

       We need to come together as some sort of organization, all of the groups I have found always focus too much on other issues when the real issue should be less (or no) government, more free will and better and more humane earth with no hidden agendas, but it's hard to find.

       Thats my point, there are a lot of people out there trying to spread the issues with this, but the fact is I barely read anything about this.

       Remember when we found out what SOPA was few years ago and people tried to stop it? That was a huge campaing by everyone, but with this one as you said: all of the groups I have found always focus too much on other issues when the real issue should be less (or no) government, you are right, they are bussy with other things right now and forget that this stuff its pretty big.

       This is pretty much the worst thing ever. For me it is the most important issue in this election and serves as my primary litmus test.
      </p>
      <p>
       This simply cannot be allowed to happen. Even if it is in place I would want the next president to completely renege on the deal and throw it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would override the constitution and trample all over what freedoms we have left, effectively ending whatever small semblance of sovereignty we still have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary thing is that will pass without much or a debate or even being read by the Senators. Rubio and Cruz are for it. Hilary is for it. Rubio said he wouldn't even try to read it.

       The middle class disappeared because we chose cheap overseas goods over doing the work ourselves.  America literally got fat and lazy, and now they don't believe in themselves to create the change they want to see.

       Regular Americans--by that I mean 'citizens'--prior to 9/11 have done a lot of good for the world.  And tried, and failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the perspective of foreign countries and those who disagree with aggressive foreign policies--like TPP--lots of shitty things also, in the name of cold war paranoia, world chessboardism, crytofascist assassinations--that's the expression of the 'shadow' pathos of american imperialism.  We the 'citizens' have nothing to do with these things, except we have to incur the karma, the guilt and ultimately the accountability.  Which is unfair, because we have about the same amount of control over this situation as the blameless Muslim goat herder in Afghanistan has over a drone strike against his family in the case of mistaken identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is we--the lumpen american working class, the middle class, educated people frozen out of the ruling class--are some of the most generous people in the world, jumping at the chance to try to help the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well now, 2016, we're under attack.  By our own government, it seems.  We have the most corrupt, malificent government in our history.  My question is this:
       <em>
        Where the hell is the rest of the world coming to help us--now--in our darkest hour?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't get some help from other countries quick, they lose all rights to call americans pussies because they've done nothing either and so whatever happens to us in the US will happen to them almost immediately thereafter.  Here's to being the canary in the TPP coalmine.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try as you will, but there's not going to be stopping in from within, by holding up posters on sticks, or blocking traffic or sleeping in a park downtown, or spending your money giving to pacs or websties or even complaining about it on reddit.  None of these things work. Sorry. Buy land and farm, or move to an ecovillage in peru.  Time to opt out from the shit global trip

       Reminder: 55 days until congress can try to pass the TPP.

      <p>
       Some information for you.  I am personally against the TPP, and I would not like to see it go through.  That being said I tried to find non biased information.  It's important for everyone to make up their own opinions with the information presented.  So, each link comes from a different stand point.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order from top to bottom: Against, Middle Ground/Divided, For, and then a link on how it could effect Canada.  I invite you to do your own research as well.  Share the information you have.  I've said it before, and I will say it again; know what is going on in your Country, understand how it will (and it will) effect you.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The TPP is NAFTA on steroids.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It will continue the speed up the exportation of US jobs by international corporations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It will create international courts designed by corporations, for corporations. They will have power that will overpower every nation's courts.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Number 3 is an international coup of sorts and is extremely serious business.

       So all you can tell me in that go is hearsay and a half-ass remark about the court system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, gonna have to dig a little deeper than that if you want to convince anyone of your claim. Focus your argument just on your third point and give it another go... Like I said, if your passionate about it, than be Informed about it! Tell me more in detail about the court system overruling with legitimate possible examples and outcomes that would show proof to its wrongness.

       my thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that the way that this part of the trade deal is presented in this article is very concerning. For example: being able to sue a government if they are passing a law that violates an agreement made in a deal that is connected to a system with ISDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       A court having that kind of ability is intimidating but I would like to bring up a few points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        This is assuming the worst of man-kind and a very pessimistic outlook on corporations and how they will react while conducting court. 
A. Just because a company sues does not mean they will  win. Have some faith in a system that is made on the belief of improving the living standards and betterment of society....
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That last sentence is a half-ass remark because I have to start work, but I wanted to complete a point &gt;.&lt;' I'll get back to this afterword work.

       Yup. It's language that already exists in NAFTA. Organizations have the right to dispute. It's nit the greatest method ever, but it isn't some clandestine shadow government that overrules our entire legal system. There are laws the TPP explicitly states it cannot impact, such as welfare laws or environmental laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm against the TPP because it results in a net loss for everyone who isn't a billionaire. That's worth talking about. But pretending like the TPP creates a new government, when it doesn't, undercuts your legitimate concerns.

       To be fair, I never said it would create an international government, just that it would create international
       <em>
        courts
       </em>
       that would have the ability to override national supreme courts. This is a true fact. But you're right, there's no reason to overstate the reality, since the reality is already quite bad.

       Trump has been against free trade since literally when NAFTA was signed into law. He has been as constantly correct on this as Sanders for like 20 years. Trust me, he really is against it.

       Trumps fortune is tied to real estate; he has a vested interest in this countrys success. Also, I think you're confusing globalism and complete loss of sovereignty with cheap labor.

       I know that Hillary can't be trusted with the bill, but Drumpf's position on it is something that I haven't considered. If he were to flip-flop on his position, I'd laugh, and I'd also be somewhat scared... as in, more scared than I already am about him.
