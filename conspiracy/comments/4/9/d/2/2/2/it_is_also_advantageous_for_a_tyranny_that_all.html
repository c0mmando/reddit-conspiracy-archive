       There's a guy (who won Teacher of the Year in New York twice) named John Taylor Gatto. He started to study why the system fails so many students, and put together several books showing documents that initially blew his mind (about how the system that we have now was intentional). Charlotte Iserbyt's "Deliberate Dumbing Down of America" is also a great resource. She worked at the Department of Education and leaked a lot of their internal memos. One I remember was educational pioneer John Dewey saying, "The literacy rate in America is too high."
      </p>
      <p>
       You heard that right. He wanted the literacy rate to be
       <em>
        lower
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And he was heading up what would become the Department of Education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they wanted to design the US school system after the Prussian school system--which was set up not to turn out critical thinkers but factory workers. Ever wonder why there are bells between classes? That came from 19th Century German factories. Children were being conditioned to operate according to sonic cues (like the men in the sweatshops). They were to be taught just enough math and reading to be able to carry out simple tasks, but not complicated enough for them to be able to understand how the larger economic system around them worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Taylor Gatto in particular documents how people like John D. Rockefeller [who funded and started the Department of Education] conferred with men like John Dewey; and how the two discussed purposely confusing the narrative of math and history textbooks. They were told to take older textbooks and put them out of order. I always wondered as a kid why my history book seemed incoherent. Chapter 1 would be on Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, and Chapter 2 would travel backward to George Washington, while Chapter 3 would cover the Beatles in 1964. There was no coherent order. No cause-and-effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       That wasn't accidental (according to Gatto). The powerful of the time-period were watching governments fall left and right in Europe. Most of the kings were being deposed and being replaced by Presidents and Prime Ministers. Anarchists like Emma Goldman were going around, calling for the assassination of all leaders [which led to the shootings of both William McKinley and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which touched off World War One.]  A certain man named Karl Marx's teachings were stirring the unwashed rabble elsewhere (which led directly to the collapse of the Russian Empire). In this atmosphere of instability, people like Carnegie and Rockefeller felt that working people were reading too much [and coming into contact with dangerous ideas that were radicalizing them]. Solution? Give the educational system an overhaul. Where once school was taught at the local level, now it would be bottlenecked through the rich and powerful. Centralized, with a new curriculum. Toward that end, they re-packaged the textbooks, with an emphasis on hiding cause-and-effect [lest angry workers discover just how much they were being screwed by the system]. Gone were courses on logic or philosophy; gone were classes on economics that showed how the larger economy worked (fractional reserve banking, bonds, stocks, etc.). Gone were classes on the political system (and how it was truly functioning). Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the new system, the population was to be trained to be factory workers--like in Prussia. Dissent was to be stigmatized. Statism encouraged. A passive obedience to authority instilled in the youth.
      </p>

       Fascinating, indeed -- and they wonder why a large portion of students have some developmental, learning-related deficiency? It's not exactly what they're learning, it's how they're learning it. Students are taught their curricula now in a way that does not make sense. They are taught what happened, but not why. They teach about communism, but don't ever get to the heart of it. The problem with this is that little of their education ends up feeling tangible -- it has no emotional context. When you cannot relate to something emotionally, it simply has no bearing on your life. So -- students are extremely bored with their classes, they simply cannot control themselves in a deliberately obfuscated and white-washed education system. This is all connected; I really believe that they attempt to remove any of the natural flow from the history books because if they didn't it would be interesting, and children would enjoy reading their literature. Thanks for the great post, btw.

       capitalism. Command economics results in the same plutocratic trend toward tyranny when applied to socialism. It makes no difference if wealth is held by individuals or in common when the authority to dictate it's mobilization is concentrated in the hands of an oligarchy.

        Government as we now know it in the USA and other economically advanced countries is so manifestly horrifying, so corrupt, counterproductive, and outright vicious, that one might well wonder how it continues to enjoy so much popular legitimacy and to be perceived so widely as not only tolerable but indispensable. The answer, in overwhelming part, may be reduced to a two-part formula: bribes and bamboozlement (classically "

        "). Under the former rubric falls the vast array of government "benefits" and goodies of all sorts, from corporate subsidies and privileges to professional grants and contracts to welfare payments and health care for low-income people and other members of the lumpenproletariat. Under the latter rubric fall such measures as the government schools, the government's lapdog news media, and the government's collaboration with the producers of professional sporting events and Hollywood films. Seen as a semi-integrated whole, these measures give current governments a strong hold on the public's allegiance and instill in the masses and the elites alike a deep fear of anything that seriously threatens the status quo.

       Was also my answer to a news snippet (some stalker and a marriott hotel article that reached Australian MSM) about a question along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing from memory) 'did the banks create bank robbers?'
      </p>
      <p>
       The context of my answer is yes they did, because they are the robbers themselves.

       And talk is cheap. You led with the cheap shot about the polysci degree, while the guy referenced a philosopher. So either you don't know what you claim to know, or you grasped at a straw in order to insult somebody else. Either way, your comment is specious and worthless and your insult is earned and deserved.

       I didn't insult anyone. I have a fucking Political Science degree! It's adorable that OP took his first poli sci class though. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY reads Aristotle's
       <em>
        Politics
       </em>
       for fun. It is shoved down the throat of entry level political scientists however. Quoting Aristotle is the sign of a fledgling political philosopher. When OP starts quoting Hobbes and Locke we will know he's progressing nicely.
      </p>

       Some people in this sub get butthurt far too easily. It is pathetic how defensive some "free-thinkers" can get. If you think words hurt, just wait until physical force is used to keep control. You pansies have no chance. Talk is cheap, I'm ready to fight. All you have are big words and little balls (earned and deserved).

       Hobbs and Locke owe everything to Aristotle. To your point, you've studied this more than most, quit being a condescending douche bag and let the point stand without your belittling it.

       I was OP once, amazed by a simple quote translated from Greek that speaks to a modern audience. But OP has a long way to go... as you pointed out, Aristotle is only the beginning of the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is a crayon drawing. Let's put it on the fridge and tell little Jonny he did a good job. He'll get no accolades from me for quoting Aristotle. Had he expanded on the point being made, in his own words, I could agree or disagree. But posting a quote? He barely tried making a point, he was repeating someone else's point. Please understand, I am not belittling the point being made, but I am teasing OP about the weak attempt of making a point by simply posting a quote.

       OK, OK. Fair enough. But I'm not sure when the physical force against us comes, there won't be many of us who then choose to fight rather than fall. Don't sell me short, but I'm not taking up arms as yet if you don't mind.
