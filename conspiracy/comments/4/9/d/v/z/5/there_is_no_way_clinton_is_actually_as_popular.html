       I think they are getting more and more desperate. But I also think as we become more and more awake, it becomes more obvious. One could say it's always been this way, but we now have the internet and are awake from their spells.

       Then you need to get out more. I know many, many reasonably minded people who are increasingly hearing me out when they used to laugh me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definitely an awakening. It's just the media needs to make it seem like anyone who questions their version of reality must be a Trump supporter, racist, hyper-evangelical, anti-Semitic Zionist, conspiracy theorist, and/or Flat Earther.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a lot more than that. They are nervous, which is why their actions are more and more outrageous and easy to see through for more and more people.

       Did you understand all of it at once? Or was it a gradual awakening?

       When I made my ultimate "breakthrough," it literally made me sick for a week or so. It's a hard step to take to realize almost everything is stage managed by psychopaths who use humanity's good nature and hunger to trust and love against it.

       We're peeling an onion here. We need to pluck the low-hanging fruit to get people to look higher up in the rotting tree of life that the psychos have planted and cultivated.

       I dunno man thats pretty cynical. Even if were not all on the same exact page in this sub its still amazing if even a percent of that 300,000 are tuning into and understanding the intelligent discussions a few of us are have here daily. Theres another 3,000 or so over in
       <a href="/r/c_s_t">
        /r/c_s_t

       and while there is overlap it is a whole other demographic that also have a pretty good grasp of the fuckery going on. And that sub has grown by 1,000 people in the last 3-4 months. People are waking up it is just a matter of if it is happening fast enough or not.

       point taken. I understand your frustration, but the Pr People and shills disinfo artists ramp up their tactics directly correlating with the amount of people waking up. So of course were going to be feeling that backlash. Little do they know that they actually highlight specific things of importance by how much an idea is attacked.

       And it doesn't much matter what they try to cover up and have success with, consciousness is a whack-a-mole for them.

      <p>
       We should focus on the low-hanging fruit from the poisoned tree to pluck. NASA and false flag shootings can come later, once we've started to peel the onion.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of us woke up bit by bit, not all at once. It's been a tapestry of lies, once you start to pull the thread, it can all come undone. 9/11 is the sloppiest big production of all, and people are just about ready to hear it. When that blows open, the whole construct could fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't lament NASA shit not making it to the front page. Blow out the stuff that does that we know to be true, and share with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern is the big chemtrail denial will last long enough for them to poison us via the atmosphere as they all head underground.

       White people have also been on the bottom of society though. Which is why their comment was confusing. My poor Polish Catholic ancestors faced the same prejudices as blacks have. People seem to forget how Catholic immigrants were treated in the early immigration days....

      <p>
       that's so true annd his "war on crime" bill 20 years ago has come back to haunt his wife's run for POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Twenty years ago this week, in 1994, then-President Bill Clinton signed a crime bill. It was, in effect, a long-term experiment in various ways to fight crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The measure paid to put more cops on the beat, trained police and lawyers to investigate domestic violence, imposed tougher prison sentences and provided money for extra prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton described his motivation to pass the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act in stark terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Gangs and drugs have taken over our streets and undermined our schools," he said. "Every day, we read about somebody else who has literally gotten away with murder."
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . Nick Turner of Vera ( Vera Institute, a nonprofit that researches crime policy) put the human costs even more starkly.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you're a black baby born today, you have a 1 in 3 chance of spending some time in prison or jail," Turner said. "If you're Latino, it's a 1 in 6 chance. And if you're white, it's 1 in 17. And so coming to terms with these disparities and reversing them, I would argue, is not only a matter of fairness and justice but it's, I would argue, a matter of national security."
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk to combatants in the long and sometimes nasty debate over the crime bill 20 years ago, and another item on the table back then looks different with hindsight too. It's a concept known as midnight basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rep. Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, voted against the bill years ago, in part because it didn't do enough to support prevention programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In between votes in the Capitol this week, Scott reflected on the debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Midnight basketball was described as paying money so that crackheads could play basketball in the middle of the night," Scott said. "What they left out was the fact that every time they put midnight basketball in a neighborhood, the crime rate plummeted. You saved more money than you spent on the midnight basketball. They left that part out."

       1/17 isn't that low either, and with all the crap they tell us about how great whites have it (so stop complaining goy), who knows if its even true?

      <p>
       Even if these numbers are true - they'll bring what the they did to the blacks and latinos to the poor in middle class whites, in facts its already happening.

       They introduced crack into the ghetto in the last wave, now its heroin in suburbia.

       where those trolls are going nuts over Sanders statment yesterday.  They want a race war so bad!  It ain't gonna happen!!! Look how much Soros spent trying to get it going in Ferguson and now it nothing.  Yes our county has problems but we all  want to work it out, not fight.  The media are nasty scoundrels and as much as i hate some of the things Donald Trump says its very telling to see how the established media is going to full on war with him.

       If they were really warring on him, we wouldn't see him on TV a la the Pauls, Perot, Kasich, even Sanders.

       They love this shit, and they want him in the General so that Clinton wins.

       I agree, any foothold of divisiveness on the basis of race is immediately shouted from the rooftops of every media station. People can't look away from the train wreck on the media, they get entranced by the siren call of racism, meanwhile the evil people organizing this all keep on profiting and controlling everyone

       Also, there is no way the seniors are affecting the result as much as the media claims, other than maybe in open primary states. This is a
       <strong>
        democratic
       </strong>
       primary we're talking about.  Seniors as a block are registered Republicans.

       Because Democrats don't live to old age? Old Democrats don't vote, but old Republicans do? People suddenly see the error of their ways and switch parties on their 50th birthdays?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton and Sanders are both senior citizens past retirement age. What makes you think seniors have no impact on results?
