       yea i wouldnt want to give my own money to evil corporations. Especially Jordan, who invests in prisons, contributing to the oppression of his own people. And he sells sneakers that cost like $50 to make for $200-300 knowing damn well that many of us ignorant black folk who are living in the ghettos would rather buy those than save money for their kids or even buy their basic needs, and then the kids head out in life with little or no money start with, on top of the discrimination and unequal chance, how are they going to make it? While Joe Flenderson here wears ugly pairs of $30 running shoes and gets off brand shirts, but he has a real good job with a good income and he saves his money and has a nice house and can afford to put his kids through college and give them 100k to start with. Bottom line is most of these corporations and even some black business men are contributing to the oppression of my own people and I would never give them my money.

       I agree with you.  Unfortunately, the corporate empire is so very ubiquitous throughout the planet that - whether it’s putting gas in a car, putting clothes on our back, or even just
       <em>
        eating
       </em>
       - it’s often very difficult to not give them money and support them in some way or the other.

       More power to you for being as conscious and aware as you can be.  The more everyone - black, white, asian, native (or a mutt mixture of all those genotypes like me) - raise their level of collective intelligence, the less we’ll be as exploited as we currently are on this planet.

       Your problem isn't the allegedly impending economic collapse, your problem is your fear. Remember that line from Dune, 'Fear is the mindkiller'?  It's true. Fear is how TPTB manipulate us. They divide us into groups (easy to do), make us fear each other, then use that fear to make us easy to rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because your fear comes from a "trusted" conspiracy source (or sources) doesn't make it right. In fact, it could just be disinfo. In fact,
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">
        it almost certainly is.
       </a>
       . Or they could just be using the fear-mongering to drive viewership and clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to make it a habit to be skeptical of anyone selling fear or pushing information that will tend to send me into a panic. People have been pushing the 'impending collapse' narrative, in various guises, for centuries. Including economic ones. Have you seen it happen yet? I haven't. The great depression was about as close as we've come, but people got through it. That doesn't mean it isn't going to happen. It might. It might happen in a few months or a few years or never for all I know. Or all you know. Or all anybody knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you really need to do is use your meditation to take a deep breath and try to rise above the fear and panic. If you believe that there will be a collapse, then you can gear your life to planning for it, and you have gotten advice here about that. Yes there is some awful, scary shit out there. No doubt about it. But at the end of the day, you don't know what's going to happen and there really isn't a whole lot you can do about it. So you have to try to find a way to come to terms with that and live with it. Build your life with calm and with care and with reason, not with fear and panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live in a place with regular disasters like earthquakes or tornadoes, maybe you can convince your parents to give you money to create an emergency preparedness kit. It's always good to have one of those anyway.

       The fact that you think being a vegan will benefit you in a survival situation shows that you haven't really thought this through. Eating lots of vegetables you've grown yourself is an
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       different matter to being a vegan. If the apocalypse comes (beep me), vegans will go extict with the first failed crop.

       I went vegan for a year, and did enough damage to my body in that one ear to last a lifetime, and I have met other people who experienced the same thing I did. Remember not everyone's body works the same way, make sure you do lots of research and eat the things that your body will need to live without meat protein, maybe take some vitamins, I'm no expert, but it was doctors that told me I fucked myself over with my diet, and I saw many doctored to find the cause. 
Now I eat less meat, but the meat I do eat comes form grass fed cows, I have chickens in my backyard that give me eggs, I buy from local farmers markets. 
If shit hits the fan I am prepared to go hunting, as most likely that's what would feed me and give me enough protein and fats to continue living. 
Save money, buy land away from cities, don't buy materialistic shit that won't do anything that perpetuate this consumerism.
Most important is to keep a positive attitude and not let things get you down, there is a lot of shit to be down about, but you can't carry that on your shoulders. 
Good luck!

       With all due respect, no thank you, you seem to have missed the point where my body didn't do well with it. I am blood type 0, not many of this blood type can eat a completely vegan diet, I know I can't and that's okay because I don't want to. 
I am okay with just eating less meat, and making sure the meat that I do eat is healthy local meat free of antibiotics and hormones.
I have energy. I don't get sick, this is working for me, and even morally I know that if everyone were to eat like me, the suffering of animals would drastically be reduced, at least if we could shut down factory farming it would be amazing.
Like I said what's right for one person isn't right for everyone, that's why I left r/vegan, everyone there thinks it's their God given quest to tell you how their way is the right way, fuck that, if I can respect your choices, respect mine, you're not in my shoes and you don't know that what works for you will work for me.

       Blood type should have literally no effect on what diets you can tolerate. They are only surface antigens on your red blood cells, that's it. They aren't even closely involved in metabolism or nutrition. This whole thread is full of terrible sources and information.

       This is exactly what I'm talking about, every vegan I've spoken with talks to me like I'm stupid and my clear observations of how my body behaved are irrelevant. The world is not black and white, you have to be able to accept that what's right for you may not be right for all, there is a common interest for us to protect our planet and the life on it, but this whole all knowing righteous attitude only takes away from the good message that should be associated to.

       You should focus on school so that you can get an education that will prove useful for said economic collapse...look into medicine or engineering, or go to school to learn agriculture; farmers aren't just dumb hicks anymore, farming has a lot of science involved these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think that the collapse will come before you finish your degree but you don't know that for certain.  If it does take some more years for society to really collapse in a bad way, you may have learned a lot of valuable knowledge in that time that will help you, not to mention that its always good to better yourself.  And there's nothing stopping you from learning minor survival skills and preparing some camping equipment in the meanwhile in case things happen sooner rather than later.

       Don't worry, before the economic collapse comes, China will probably send us all back to the stone age with an EMP attack to fry all our electronics. And they'll probably also blow holes in our dam walls too. It will be hurricane Katrina style chaos on mass. Fun for all. Not quite sure how your veganism will cope, but each to his own. Buckle up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, if you want to do something helpful, prepping is of limited use. It's organisation that matters. Strength in numbers. So, you want to get involved in building organisations that are either (a) trying to prevent collapse or (b) prepping on a community-wide scale (or larger) rather than as an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a story of group fitness. As individuals our power is limited. You need to seek out like-minded individuals, and put your talents to work within such an organisation. Alone, we are isolated, vulnerable, and easy pickings for whatever or whomever fills the power vacuum after the collapse.
      </p>

       Oh, and don't try to convert your mother. Politics and family usually don't mix. Just do your own thing, but don't upset your mother, it's not worth it. Just be a family and leave politics alone, it's too divisive. Family is family, politics is politics. Don't try to mix the two.

       you should also practice these outdoor skills  It's one thing to read about how to make fire. It's another to to be able to actually do it (like for the backyard BBQ) from scratch without matches, etc.

       I disagree.  A) Shit sucks
       <em>
        now

       .  B) It's not a bad idea to plan now for possibilities rather than do nothing and be up shit creek if/when SHTF.

       OP, don't go
       <em>

       w/the prepping, but definitely do your due diligence in terms of remaining vigilant.  The focus and meditation you're doing is ABSOLUTELY the right thing to do.  Keep it up.  Seriously.

       10 years ago a friend told me the economy was going to collapse and he took all of his money and bought gold and silver. He also went vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years later he sold all his precious coins as gold prices had almost tripled. Now he's a wealthy capitalist with 2 houses and eats meat (except chicken which he considers a "poor person food.")
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: the collapse is always just around the corner, and vegans are confused.

       It was sarcasm because the previous user said that "vegans are confused".  As if those who eat meat (i.e. killing yourself and destroying your body eating murdered animals) aren't the ones who are in reality the confused ones.

       Indeed you are, sir.  We are very similar, you and I.  We are part of the same tripartite.  I am a Scorpio.  Being such, my proclivities can at times be a bit more…jarring, abrasive, and stabbing, but I can definitely relate to and understand your saying that you're especially sensitive to emotions.  I can definitely relate.

       Very interesting. Yes, Guitar.

       I think there is something to being
       <em>
        awake
       </em>
       and creating music and art. True artists, rather than those who imitate, see the world differently than most people. Artists are the only people who allow themselves to see the world through their own eyes.

       Now I will give a few of your tunes a listen.

       I don’t disagree with that.

       Well, on one level, I can understand that.  However, I try to make sure and not allow myself to think that
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much if at all.  I would’nt want to let that type of thinking lead to any sort of elitist view on my part.  I know we’re all different.  We’re all at different stages of development and evolution.  Some are below us, some are above us.  I feel that it’s not impossible for some who imitate to somehow still arrive at no less a level of understanding than anyone who doesn’t.  They just arrive at it via a bit different route, I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goes back to my feeling on the holographic universe.  I don’t want to say or think that there’s “no way” one personality type can get to a certain level of development over another.  It may take longer or a different path, etc…but I often try to leave things as open ended and benefit-of-the-doubt-giving as possible.

       Interesting that you say that because I’ve always felt that
       <strong>
        <em>
         I
        </em>
       </strong>
       /me personally?  I am nothing.  I have nothing.  I am just a pen - a brush through which Divinity occasionally doodles every now and then.  I feel like
       <em>
        I’m
       </em>
       pretty useless/worthless…but I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know that every now and then I do some stuff - a painting or a writing or a composition, etc - and I step back and go “Wo!” and it is in that moment that I know that there is something very much bigger than me at work…because I know
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       didn’t do/couldn’t have done what appeared.

       Makes me think of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6k6IxRd.png">
        a poem I came across a long time ago.
       </a>
       It captures my feelings on the matter pretty accurately.

       I'm a little bit all over the map.  The last composition has moments that are a bit heavy, but yeah.
