    <div class="md"><p>I think the best way is to get rid of your debts, buy land, and learn to live a sustainable life as much off the grid as you want/possible. Start locally with neighbors and establish trading and bartering. Stop using their money.</p>

<p>Doing all of this while helping to educate people, is the best way I see. I&#39;ve done most of those things, but still have plenty of work to do. There are also options of living in tiny houses/van dwelling. Live simply and explore/travel. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, I&#39;ve come to the realization, that we cannot beat them. However, we can live more self-fulfilling lives out of their matrix as possible.</p>

<p>get rid of your debts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Avoid debt. Then avoid debt some more. Finally, avoid debt.</p>

<p>Avoid the &quot;stuff&quot; mentality. You don&#39;t need a 75&quot; plasma TV. You don&#39;t need a convertible Mustang. You don&#39;t need a new iPhone every time they release one. You don&#39;t need to eat steak every night. You&#39;re allowed to drive an old car (as long as you keep it safe!).</p>

<p>Going to bartering feels a bit extreme. If you can do it, great. If not, it&#39;s OK to use their money, as long as you keep avoiding debt. And you use it wisely. Buy only what you need, minimize &quot;toys&quot;. Save up so to the point that you have absolutely no fear of losing your job.</p>

<p>Then, when you get to that point, use the money buy <em>experiences</em>, not stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Especially if people do not want to take the plunge into homesteading. I&#39;d encourage what you said if you were going the tiny house/van dwelling route, or if you still want to live in civilization. We&#39;re all different, so different strokes for different blokes. That being said, I think the homesteading/trading/bartering route is the direction we should go, but that is my opinion.</p>

<p>That seems like a really difficult option for the vast majority of people in the USA.  I would like to get there myself at some point, but for the moment, I play their game and save my cash so I <em>can</em> get there...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no doubt they have been ruling for quite some time, but i still think they rule because they confuse the masses into letting them rule. they&#39;re just people, like us. if enough people were aware of the bullshit and werent caught up living for materialistic gain, we could drive them out of our lives. of course we wont get rid of them completely, they&#39;ll always be looking for their next opportunity to swoop in and seize control again. but, if we stay vigilant and never let our guard down, we can keep them out of our lives. they&#39;re not invincible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the same thing, unfortunately I&#39;ve come the the conclusion that a good majority of people are so brainwashed that if truth hit them in the face they&#39;d fight back against the truth. Fundamentally they are so far into the life and beliefs that they have, that if they acknowledge the real truth that would have to admit that the life they have lived so far is a sham. TPTB are just too good at fighting a split up society, everyone has different beliefs, from religion, to sport teams to political parties etc. they are slowly making it illegal to support yourself off-grid, to protest, free speech. The only way to beat them is to tear the system apart, and that&#39;s just not going to happen, it would require everyone to team up, see the common enemy and put materialistic shit aside and rebuild the system. I&#39;d like to say that this is possible, but every year that goes by, and they build a better surveillance grid, a robotic automated army, etc the harder it will be for people to fight back. Even now, if you want to protest something, you can&#39;t, you have to set a time and place and register the protest, then they will infiltrate some shit disturbers into the group, then they will do something that will give the &quot;police&quot; the grounds to arrest and brake up the protest. Not only that but most people are so in debt and living paycheck to paycheck, or on food stamps that if they take a day off work to protest they will end up starving in the street.
Waking people up to this truth has proven very difficult, I have lost many friends because I made it my mission to try and wake up the world to these crimes against humanity, I was stressed and depressed and it was just a shitty time of my life, no one should put that into their shoulders, the weight is too much to carry, all you can do is show people the door, some will open it right away, some will look at the door and never know what to do with it, but you can&#39;t open it for them.
Educate others, but only the ones who wish for it, getting rid of loans is in your best interest, the banking system is rigged against you, and being in debt is like being in prison, you can&#39;t be free of it, looms over you.
Buy land, move away from cities, grow your own food, don&#39;t let materialistic things suck the life out of you, experiences are worth the money, things are not, they need to be replaced too often and it&#39;s a cycle that is meant to trap you.
Don&#39;t eat fast food, don&#39;t eat frozen dinners, try to eat organic and local. 
TURN OFF THE TV, it is called programming for a reason, you&#39;ll have more time to focus on your life without having your thoughts manipulated. </p>
