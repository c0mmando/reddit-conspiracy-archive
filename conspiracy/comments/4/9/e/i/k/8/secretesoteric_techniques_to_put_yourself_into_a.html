       This might not be the right place to post it, but hear me out for a second. Perhaps you guys would know of something of the sorts and maybe give me some useful links?

       You know how sometimes you become more motivated or focused when you have a certain idea or frame of mind. Well, what if, there are ways to put yourself in those frames of mind and basically gain immense focus and determination. Now, how does this tie in with conspiracies? Naturally, such a thing should be wide-spread if it existed, but what if it does, and we're not taught about it on purpose, so we could stay miserable and keep buying stuff to fill the void in our lives?

       You could try the wim hof breathing technique.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically take in a deep breath, then exhale about 75 percent of that breath. Repeat this for as long as you need to, maybe a minute and a half if it's your first time doing breath exercises. After that hold it in for as long as you can and exhale completely.

       If my explanation confused you check out the vice documentary about him, he's also known as the iceman. Joe rogan has a show where he explains it to Joe in more depth. It's super simple to do. 
Check out mindful meditation or specific systems of yoga, particularly kundalini yoga.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were you though, I'd check out the occult board, or the kundalini board. Conspiracy is not the place for this kind of topic, but you mean well so it's cool.

       Take boswellia serrata (frankincense) supplements, any brand will do, just make sure it actually says boswellia serrata on the bottle. It's used in spritual practices since ancient times for a reason.
To mangle the words of a certain someone: Once you realize you can't do anything as just one person in your current state, you must do what you love while keeping your body toned and healthy, as well as your mind. Others may see it as a procrastination, especially if your love is video games or something, but-- only you know what you like and why, right? Keep a good balance.
Best of luck.

       I like that you mention frankincense (olibanum). There are many ways to use it; as an antiinflammatory like you mentioned, internally or topically in solution.  But it's also very mind-sharpening if you use it in the traditional sense which is as an incense.  Its extremely clean-burning, lemony and uplifting and mind-sharpening.  They say its a sacred scent for a reason, it seems to clear the room of bad spirits and negativity and really lightens the mood.
      </p>

       If I have a cold or I'm in a bad mood, i'll burn a few tears over hot charcoal self-ignite tabs and fill the bathroom with it while i run a hot shower.  I call it a smoke bath and the combo does wonders for the spririt.  Counterintuitively, this particular incense is
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       for a cough, as the incense smoke is also an antiinflammatory/antimicrobial, it soothes the lungs and is astringent (dries mucus); it's a salve for mucus membranes.  If you had a sore throat, you could gargle with a solution of it and it woudl help also as it's antiinflammatory and antimicrobial (google 'site:nih.gov boswellia antimicrobial'). I've used in the neti pot for this reason

       I use the oil too! Mixed with jojoba, works wonders. Apparently sacra is best, I need to get some.
Just, all around, a must have in this life.

        Some heavy reading here

       Personally speaking, I've been taking Frankincense for about a year now, and have found that it makes me feel very euphoric and relaxed, but also focused. There are many kinds of frankincense, but you can easily get serrata in pill form.

       "In ancient times, Hindus, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Chinese and Greeks as well as the people of old American civilizations used natural resins primarily for embalming and for its incense in cultural functions. They firmly believed that when these materials get in contact with fire, the smoke and the fragrance they produce, not only soothe their souls but also please their gods. Burning of these natural resins had become an important component of their cultural life. They burned these resins during sacrificial ceremonies and in their daily rituals to prevent the influence of evil spirits on their souls or to honour the dead or living ones"

       I came up with a good meditation. So meditation can be hard, and often you'll lose your train of thought, right? Well mindfulness teaches you to focus on the breath, and mantra teaches you to say a word in your mind over and over again. Either one can lead to distraction. But, if you put them both together, it's really easy. Just pick a word, and say it on every exhale (or however you want to do it). Way easier.

       The big secret is everything at it's most basic root is energy. CERN is close to figuring that out. We perceive such a narrow spectrum with our senses. Research pranic healing and YouTube meditation on twin hearts. Our bodies are vessels that act as conductors. Don't believe me though, do your own research and practice technique.

       One in the same. Its like chicken and egg argument. String theory says vibration causes energy but what causes the vibration? Energy?

       Don't do drugs, don't drink, get 8-10 hours of sleep, drink 10 glasses of water a day, don't eat GMO, don't drink milk, don't eat bread 4 meals a day, stand up at your desk, do cardio, eat vitamins everyday (and not just 'sex health' vitamins because those are not the best balance).

       I agree with all of that except the drugs thing.  You have to do the right drugs (cannabis and mushrooms) and not the wrong ones (everything else, incl. alcohol / tobacco)

       Ugh what about LSD? Literally can't overdose on it non-toxic, how about ayahuasca or peyote?? DMT is also up there, enough of the pot and shrooms circlejerk drugs can be good in moderation.

       In my opinion, I don't think lsd is a good psychedelic, but I've only had a lvl 3 experience with it and each experience sucked.  It deranged my thought process in a very negative way that annoyed me, amplified bad and there was no good.  It wasn't a set / setting thing.  Contrast with ketamine or mushrooms, these were very good to me.  Ketamine restored my hearing and sensation in a severed finger nerve as a 'bonus' effect of the afterglow.  From what I've read, mushrooms are overwhelmingly a positive expereicne because it doubles as anxiolytic and stimulant at low to med doses; medical merits with shrooms are real, as with ketamine.  LSD not so much, although in the 70s it was used to treat alcohol addiction with success so that should not be ignored.  These are all on nih, if you are interested in these claims.  Also maps.org.
      </p>

       From research I've done, shrooms and ketamine are very useful; ibogaine useful if they do a little more reesarch on how to tone down the cardio effects that can be deadly to some.

       I can't speak for aya but I have heard only really good things if you go to a valid ayahuascero abd not a sorceror (tropanes). DMT seems impossible to find and can't speak for the cactus stuff; they are amphetamines so I'd probably skip

       Drugs are basically degenerate, and you can get a lot of the same benefits from doing other activities. I highly recommend not doing them. Drugs are bad mmmkay

       Meditation and prayer are the best tools to achieve focus and bliss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brain wave frequency studies on Buddhist monks prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, eat and sleep properly, exercise, stay healthy.
