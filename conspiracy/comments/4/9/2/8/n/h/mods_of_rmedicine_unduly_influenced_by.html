       The mod directly above you in your sub cross posted this submission from

       EMF controlling our brains is a scientific fact. PBS has a documentary explaining the science behind it. Distance is the only factor that is lacking and this is only unclassified publicly available information. Thync devices are now available commercially. You can literally mind control yourself. Your post is obvious hyperbole.

       <a href="/r/electromagnetics">

       . There are hundreds of papers compiled in approximately 40 wikis. Bullies have rejected some of the papers solely due to being behind a pay wall and they do not want to pay for the paper.

       This is going to piss probably
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       off, but I am going to post it in the event that it helps someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a targeted or microwaved individual, can you look back into your past and check to see if you have at some point taken medications that you have stopped, or taken new medications and been on them for a week or two. Even if you stopped taking them months ago?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at what they are, and then do a quick search on the Internet for the name of what you were on or are on and then "adverse side effects." Pay attention to things like "akathisia" and "auditory hallucinations." If you are on a medication, DO NOT stop cold turkey because the effects can be very bad, but call your doctor as soon as you can. And don't drink on these medications. Talk to your family and your doctor; because of liability fears, it may be difficult getting help from the doctor who prescribed them (and
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       them for that), but get to a doctor as soon as you can to talk about what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel angry or violent or self-destructive or like you can't handle it anymore or being asked by these "voices" to do something, tell them to cut it out, and don't do what they say. Understand that you are being manipulated, yes, but that you can control it and get some help; tell your friends and loved ones what you are going through and see if they have access to resources to help. There's no need to do anything these "outside influences" are saying and there are ways of being free of them, with help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sending peace, love, and light -- and justice to those who've done this to you.

       Good comment. This is like the opposite of what you'll hear from TMOR.

      <p>
       I have personally got P51Mike1980 to delete 4 of his alts, but he never stops with his insane behavior. His long time alt Anti_Vaccination, which he used to harass lucycohen in the past, is finally gone after I called him out a few times on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       During his anger, he once posted to
       <a href="/r/GMOMyths">
        /r/GMOMyths
       </a>
       and went of the hinge calling them a hate sub. I had a huge grin that day, shills vs shills while I eat popcorn on the sidelines :D
      </p>
      <p>
       P51Mike1980 and DanglyW have been stalking/harassing him for a while now. It's like they are confirming/worsening his condition. Occasionally I will go around and tell these two to fuck off, and I'll explain to the sub/mods what they are doing. They're mentally inept people who want to hurt others on reddit and I don't understand why. P51 claims to be a nurse, do you want this person doing things to you in an ER?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, these guys go a bit further than mental ineptness. They will stage fake posts with fake accounts in various subs to drum up opinions about EMF or whatever in an attempt to prove this guy wrong. It's really odd and obsessive.

       worked over time waiting to pounce on me immediately after I reply to his comments. I never seen such immediate responses by a shill before. If I do not respond, he will criticize me for lack of a response. If I respond, he will say I did not fully respond and demand that I respond. Very time intensive. The more comments I write in subs, the more comments

       You made a good point that side effects of some drugs could include auditory hallucinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auditory "voices" are referred to as V2K (voice to skull) and referred to a lesser extent as VOG (voice of god).  The voices are heard out loud. The voices can be measured with a spectrum analyzer:
      </p>

        https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/3rs6tv/wiki_microwave_auditory_effect_voice_to_skull_v2k/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       V2K is induced by microwave auditory effect. There is evidence of United States researching, performing medical experiments on prisoners and using V2K in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       I included questions on V2K in a survey I drafted. No one volunteered to create a surveymonkey. There is no statistical analysis on TIs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe V2K is currently used on targeted individuals (TI). The TIs I have met and the blogs and articles I have considered credible did not report V2K.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read a warning by a TI about perps pretending to be crazy TIs to make TIs appear crazy. I have seen fake TIs pretending to be crazy. They promote big pharma and psychotic drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read comments by mentally ill people misbelieving the voices they consciously hear is V2K. They do not describe the voices as being auditory or silent inner voices. Hearing silent inner voices is not microwave auditory effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am wary when TIs write their testimony on having V2K. I look to see if they promote big pharma and if they have other symptoms that TIs do have.
      </p>
      <p>
       One such symptom is hearing 'The Hum.' This is not tinnitis. It is a strong vibrational humming.
      </p>
      <p>
       This symptom is also in the survey draft.  Though it is statistically unknown what percentage of TIs hear 'The Hum' all the ones I have met do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newer technologies is to modulate "voices" as subliminal messages in microwaves and ultrasound. Subliminal messages would be more difficult to resist than auditory conscious voices. Subliminal messages can be modulated in microwaves and in ultrasound. How to tell the difference is whether a faraday cage or sound proofing reduce 'The Hum.' In one experiment, the portion of a faraday cage that had sound proofing reduced 'The Hum.'
