        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Discussing the system&#39;s flaws without taking action is no longer a realistic course of action for me. I need to either begin exiting &#39;the matrix&#39; NOW, or accept there is little I can do and try to live as normal a life as possible. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to sound defeatist, but I&#39;ve realized that talk truly is cheap. Even though I can speak for hours about Operation GLADIO and cite Harvard studies about the toxicity of flouride, I am still going right along with the system. I work my 9 to 5, pay my taxes, and date girls on Tinder. The fact that I spend a certain amount of my life researching how the world operates is cool, but so far it hasn&#39;t produced any <em>real</em> changes for me. </p>

<p>So I am curious to hear from all of you: what would your life outside of the Matrix look like? It can be as simple as: &quot;I&#39;d get a job in a more meaningful field&quot; or you can go more in depth. <strong>We just need ideas.</strong> Otherwise all we&#39;re doing is blowing out hot air here. </p>

<p>Here is how I&#39;m starting to envision my &quot;red pilled&quot; life (it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not this is &#39;realistic&#39;...as I said we just need ideas): </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Financial Abundance.</strong> I&#39;ll develop a passive income stream from blogging. Then I&#39;ll be able to experience financial abundance while retaining control over my schedule. A blog will satisfy my need for meaningful and creative work; indeed, I never feel like a worker-drone while writing. It will allow me to connect with like minded individuals who share an interest in living more consciously. Finally, a blog about conscious living will fit into my larger goal to polarize in the service-to-others direction. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Real Education.</strong> After working 5-6 years to fix &quot;the money problem,&quot; I will have the time and resources to fully dedicate myself to lifelong learning. I will gather a massive library, and especially be interested in books about spirituality, occultism, history, and conspiracy theory. Through independent study (I can also take online courses or enroll at a local university), I will continually raise my awareness about the nature of the reality we live in. With a &quot;real&quot; education, I will be able to determine where I can most be of service and start to make strategic plays to help co-create a better shared experience on this planet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service.</strong> I have realized that living merely to satisfy base needs is extremely boring. I think &#39;serving others&#39; sometimes gets a bad rap because it conjures up memories of forced community service day in high school or fake priests who talk about serving the poor while they participate in an extremely corrupt organization themselves. The real reason to be of service to humanity is so that you deeply feel connected to all-that-is. It&#39;s to answer the warrior&#39;s call and get involved in the epic challenges of our time. It&#39;s to get out of your narrowly defined box and learn from the amazingly diverse people on this planet. In a couple words: by helping others, you help yourself. I am involved in some service activities right now, but I hope to greatly expand them after my exit from the matrix. I will use the time, resources, and connections I have to help raise awareness about issues the media isn&#39;t reporting on, and I will continue to volunteer in low-income neighborhoods around my city. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Travel.</strong> The elite are right about one thing: the world is going global, and national borders are indeed just imaginary lines. Whenever I read a biography about a great person - Malcolm X, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Tupac just off the top of my head - I am always struck at how much these people moved around. It seems like one adventure after another. Hell, if broke college graduates can figure out how to see the world for years at a time, I should be able to incorporate travel as a permanent part of my lifestyle once I am financially abundant. Furthermore, travel will broaden my perspective and give me something to compare my home country against. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaningful Relationships.</strong> We don&#39;t talk enough about the impact the Matrix has on personal relationships. I look back on my younger self and I see someone who was basically brainwashed when it came to socializing. I wanted to hang out with the cool kids (regardless of how empty many of them were) and hook up with the hot girls (ditto on the emptiness.) I based my friendships and romantic interests on what I saw in Sitcoms and the movies. Obviously I take responsibility for doing so, but in my red-pilled life I will have a completely different group of relationships. I will have friends who share a similar vision as me and who strive to empower one another. Life will cease to be a popularity contest. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustainability</strong> I will start to walk-the-walk when it comes to making the earth a cleaner place. I will have solar panels on my roof and potentially even grow organic food. I will certainly have a greenhouse and turn my house into a stronghold of eco-friendliness. I will study how past cultures have lived <em>with</em> nature instead of trying to dominate it. I will constantly get outdoors and enjoy how alive and vast the natural world is. I will make peace with my home, the Earth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose.</strong> Perhaps the most important part of my lifestyle will be a sense of deep meaning and purpose. I will get off the sidelines of life and actually participate in the animating contest that heretofore I&#39;ve only read about. The significant responsibility and risk inherent in dedicating myself to a cause greater than myself will firmly ground me in the present moment. There will be nowhere to run, as I seek to combat darkness and slavery everywhere it lurks. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I could keep going, but hopefully you see my point. Even if some of what I said sounds idealistic, at least it gets us thinking about what an alternative lifestyle would actually <em>be like.</em> Once we have a clear vision, we can then go to work creating a new earth, and it won&#39;t matter whether it takes 5 years or 500, because the journey will be so damn fulfilling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seven years ago, I quit my trucking job and learned appliance repair from online videos and blogs. Including the biz license, tools and preliminary parts, it only cost $800 to be up and running. Advertising on Craigslist, we had work in two days. Later we built a website and now, we have over 100 positive reviews, which draws a lot of traffic. Wife runs the office. Today, my entire family is in the company and making money. Come September, I will hand over the company to the kids and move up into the Blue Ridge Mountains of N. Georgia. Electricity? Solar. Free hot water? Solar (I can build that for a hundred bucks), chickens for eggs and meat, and a 1/4 acre for all our veggie and fruit needs. Simplify and win!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1977-1980, I lived in London. On long trips though, I saw how much open land there truly is in the UK. But compared to the US, everything is twice as expensive there (or at least, it was back then). Even still, people there do all sorts of fun social experiments. Just Google &quot;Living a natural life in the UK&quot; and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find some amazing things. Best wishes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was at museum recently and saw an exhibit about racism in the 60s. There was a chalkboard people were writing messages on about being equal. Most of the comments went along the lines of &quot;black/whites should get along&quot; and &quot;we can all live in peace&quot;. It was a nice sentiment but it kind of irked me. Not a single person wrote &quot;we&#39;re the human race&quot;. All of the comments were about race, but none of them pointed out that we&#39;re just the human race. Like, that&#39;s all you have to understand. None of this &quot;We should get along&quot; crap. No, it&#39;s &quot;we&#39;re the fucking human race and we&#39;re all in this together&quot;. There&#39;s no SHOULD about it. The chalkboard felt like a hollow gesture to me.</p>

<p>Does no technology automatically = out of the matrix, though? There are definitely downsides to technology, and we are too obsessed with it as a culture, but is going back to the stone age really going to help anything? I don&#39;t mean to be accusatory, would just be curious to hear you expand on what kind of lifestyle you&#39;d live without electricity, a car, etc. </p>

<p>We probably shouldn&#39;t focus on making sustainability profitable,  but instead focus on the discovery and development of new technologies that I suspect have been hidden from us based on the examination of so called neo classical buildings and megalithic structures that we would have a lot of difficulty erecting with &quot;modern&quot; tech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A growing number of people are building &#39;tiny houses&#39; which are sorta semi off-grid ...  (on trailers)  They&#39;re pretty cheap to build, compared to a real house, and you can move it around.</p>

<p>I am actually living in a campervan and building a home on the back of a truck, I am still going to have to pay registration and all that, but it provides me a degree of freedom - no rent.  I get to control a lot of my life&#39;s aspects.  Solar power, water filtration system and that.</p>

<p>I guess, I&#39;m a fan of having options (wheels to move somewhere else) rather than a fixed location.  When people see my campervan setup (solar panel and all) they are inspired - and I&#39;m sure my big truck will be even more so.</p>

<p>I like your list very much.  I have been devoting time to service as well, I volunteered at a bunch of different places - am at food not bombs at the moment and we all dumpster our vegetables!  It is just totally up to a person what kind of life they want to lead, they just gotta get up and go do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wife and I once bought a tiny Toyota Dolphin motorhome and lived in it for 1.5 years just to see how things would go. Best period of our long marriage. One can find them as cheap as $3000 today, used but in good condition. Willing to consider it? Get it and keep your day job. Sleep in it at night for a month. You&#39;ll quit your expensive home. We both chose day jobs as servers at Denny&#39;s, but with no rent or bills (except food, fuel  and insurance), we got it down to a 3 day workweek. Having four day weekends and a motorhome. Ah, the simplicity and the memories!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some really cool points, ESPECIALLY the meaningful relationships part. With a more interconnected world you&#39;d think we&#39;d be social on an astronomical level, yet new generations are struggling to maintain social lives. Don&#39;t forget about the family unit, another aspect of life that is quickly disintegrating.</p>

<p>P.S. About your sustainability point : It&#39;s not really complete without leading at least a partially vegan lifestyle. Greenhouse gas emissions from animal raising totals 50% of all emissions. Check out &quot;Cowspiracy&quot; it&#39;s on netflix.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve decided to do is keep informed about everything I can, but try to put as much energy into imagining a solution and the steps to getting there. The latter is the most difficult, because we can picture Utopia, but we have to understand the socio-psychological resistance, the power resistance, the money resistance, and all the variables that artificially divide humanity. We have to address those as they stand currently – with Utopia in mind. This is where what we&#39;ve learned meets our creativity, if we&#39;re going to survive and evolve.</p>
