They were talking about how it was completely unethical that apple encrypted their phones in such a way so that it&#39;s hard to find out personal info and that the government has the absolute right to search through all of things and that only  terrorists need that kind of privacy. Watching that honestly made me sick and scared. It was so surreal.</p>

The government already has been snooping on every single persons digital communications for more than 10 years.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much this. With fake cell towers they can intercept data from your phone real-time, they don&#39;t need access to your physical phone. It&#39;s been proven that the government has repeatedly used these, often without a warrant, and then used &quot;parallel construction&quot; to match their illegal evidence with plausible means that they could&#39;ve legally obtained it.</p>

<p>This is a false flag for our government to get most people content with the latest meme, that strong encryption is all you need to keep your info safe. Apple is just a convenient scapegoat because there are plenty of people who will believe just about anything Apple has to say.</p>

<p>“If they win, great for the FBI.

<p>Also great PR for Apple.

    <div class="md"><p>if they really just wanted to spy on you without your knowing this story would not be publicized. the law would be quietly passed - while you were reading about something else. this is a PERFORMANCE to make you FEEL like you are being spied on. are you coming away wit this unshakeable creepy feeling that whatever you do the government knows??? that&#39;s exactly how they want you to feel. you will curtail your own behavior this way. </p>

<p>don&#39;t be scared. this sht has been going on for so long. </p>

<p>here&#39;s a tip -- try sending an email to the white house - just ask a question about whatever -- but something they aught to answer. ask them about water resources - whatever, and just see how long it takes them to get back to you. (6months to a year is my estimation)  then start to consider what it really takes to read all the data on all America&#39;s phones, try to conceptualize the quantity of emails/ text / etc. when they did not even have time to read the email that is sent directly to the white house.  it&#39;s not possible. where are these legions of data readers??? they are not there. it&#39;s an act. not saying nobody can access your phone, but saying there is VERY little chance they are going to -- unless perhaps after the fact of you committing a major crime. think about how many people do commit major crimes every day --- are they stopped through spying??/? no. I don&#39;t know of one case where this has happened. so if even those people aren&#39;t being spied on -- fear not. they want you to be afraid. but this is not the thing to fear. </p>

<p>Here is a reality check: There are more agencies than the NSA. We know many other agencies spy on Americans. There are also many local governmental entities, such as your local police, who also spy on Americans. There are probably hundreds of thousands of government agents and contractors who could have a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to spy on you for one reason or another. </p>

<p>There are also algorithms which make this much more efficient. If you are indeed just a random dude and love the government, of course nobody will give a shit about your texts to your girlfriend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for one, Im questioning you. Does that make you so uncomfortable that you become incapable of answering questions?</p>

<p>Sure, profiteers steer nations to war, but that isn&#39;t the end-all-be-all. There&#39;s more than just profit to life. Most countries and people feel that way. It seems to be an especially Western, and exceptionally American trait. I see ideology as being the prime mover in history. Weaker ideologies submit to more aggressive ideologies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know who&#39;s doing it. likely whoever is really doing it crafts a lot of false leads to people to fall for if they scratch the surface to look further. the best I can see it&#39;s going back to some european, primarily British very old money families. but i also know whoever it really is assuredly scrubs the internet of the information to identify them. so I do not have the answer to your question. short answer -- sure Rothschilds are a good guess. but even that too is probably a front. but Im fairly sure it&#39;s ENGLAND or Rome maybe too, or something over there that is the homeland of the power here -- because it&#39;s all very colonialist at heart and style. they may be camouflaging themselves over and over but the ideology of exploiting through deception - thats them, thats colonialism. of course -- unless the history books entirely wrote out who to look for -- and that&#39;s possible too because whoever is doing this edits our history books. I can not answer who is behind the last curtain because I do not know. but the world banks are real, so far as I can tell, and they are the system that keeps the cohesive power going. so whoever is the secret owners of the world banks -- there you go. </p>

<p>but this concept -- that these bankers orchestrated ww2 and cold war -- this is like 101 of conspiracy theory, so I&#39;m not sure what you are doing in conspiracy if you are not familiar with this. it&#39;s really not me you are disagreeing with -- it&#39;s prob about 99% of anybody who goes into conspiracy theory, which is fine. I do not care, you don&#39;t need to be like everybody else. but there&#39;s SO much you can read on this topic -- you don&#39;t need anything from me. go forth on your own . if you are genuinely curious. </p>

<p>&amp; if you want to argue against it - more power to you, who knows maybe you can find a deeper truth if you do - but you should first get yourself familiar with the extensive evidence for it in order to have a meaningful conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, since you&#39;re even asking the question I&#39;ll take that as a sign that you have an open mind, and I&#39;ll give it a shot:</p>

<p>Psyop is short for &#39;psychological operation.&#39; The definition of psyops from Wikipedia is: &quot;planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_(United_States)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_(United_States)</a></p>

<p>So the term &#39;Snowden psyop&#39; suggests that the story we have been sold about Snowden is not authentic, but is part of an attempt to influence us in one or more ways. In that case, Snowden is not the hero we have been led to believe but actually an intelligence agent who is part of a psyop.</p>

<p>Here are are some links that offer some support to the claim that Snowden is just that:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/NSA_Leaker_Edward_Snowden_Seems_To_Be_Another_False_Hero_Created_By_Intelligence_And_Media_Circles/29228/0/34/34/Y/M.html">http://www.blacklistednews.com/NSA_Leaker_Edward_Snowden_Seems_To_Be_Another_False_Hero_Created_By_Intelligence_And_Media_Circles/29228/0/34/34/Y/M.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/211n4p/edward_snowden_is_controlled_opposition_glenn/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/211n4p/edward_snowden_is_controlled_opposition_glenn/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/glenn.pdf">And here is an interesting discussion of what Snowden&#39;s revelations can tell us about how psyops and disinfo work.</a> Note the author takes Snowden&#39;s revelations at face value, but he doesn&#39;t weigh in here on whether Snowden is controlled opposition or not. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s true that even if Snowden is part of the psyop, it doesn&#39;t mean that what he has revealed about the NSA&#39;s activities is false. It may very well be accurate. Actually if you look into it you will see that we&#39;ve known about many of these activities from other whistleblowers in the past. But it also means that Snowden is &#39;controlled opposition&#39; or a &#39;disinfo agent.&#39; If so, this means that the truths he is revealing are partial and/or misleading in some way. </p>

<p>For example, the NSA would have you believe they are doing all of this in the interest of national security and protecting us against terrorism, instead of, say, being used by the plutocrats who control the country/world to extend their reach and power and (largely successful) attempt to establish fascist control over nation states. Snowden doesn&#39;t challenge this. The narrative surrounding him leads you down a path where you believe he is a heroic whistleblower and then nicely diverts your attention away from the real power and the real aims.  </p>

<p>Some in this thread are calling this a limited hangout. I think the aims and emphasis of a limited hangout are somewhat different, but it doesn&#39;t really matter what you want to call it. </p>

<p>The argument being advanced in this thread is that in addition to all of these other aspects of this psyop, they actually want us to know that we are being monitored and that we have no privacy. Consciously or subconsciously this can work on our psyche to keep us in line. I used the word panopticon to describe this. The panopticon was a prison designed by Jeremy Bentham way back then as a very efficient way to keep an eye on prisoners, who were arrayed in cell circular cell blocks surrounding a tower. They could be seen at all times by the person(s) in the tower, but could not see whether the person in the tower was actually looking at them at any particular moment. But the control would come because the prisoners knew they could be monitored at any moment. Foucault used the panopticon as a metaphor for the exercise of power in contemporary societies.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon#Criticism_and_the_Panopticon_as_metaphor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon#Criticism_and_the_Panopticon_as_metaphor</a></p>

<p>But we should not assume the psy op ends there. It was likely used to both gauge the public&#39;s acceptance of this type of surveillance (most people don&#39;t seem to object) and also to sort of slowly get us used to this type of surveillance -- in a kind of boiling frogs type way. They&#39;ve been doing this in many different ways over the years, using various types of threats as a reason. Think of the CCTV cameras that are all over England and parts of the US that are put there to &#39;stop crime.&#39; Another aspect of this is to promote the narrative (in the form of a public &#39;debate&#39; over Snowden&#39;s revelations) that &#39;why should I worry about this if I have nothing to hide?&#39; (Which implies that if you are against it, you do have something to hide.) They couldn&#39;t really implant and nurture that narrative in the public&#39;s mind without first having a pseudo-controversy and debate over the issue in the first place. Enter Snowden. </p>

<p>So, as usual, this psyop works at many, many levels (of which I&#39;ve probably identified only a few) just like San Bernardino. First they used SB to instill fear, especially of Muslim terrorists and ISIS. They use it to promote a gun control agenda. But that in itself is kind of a ruse, since all that does is instill fear in people that the gov&#39;t is going to take away their guns, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">thus driving up the sale of guns from which the plutocrats profit enormously.</a> </p>

<p>Moreover, fear over armed terrorists and a heavily armed citizenry (e.g., see the Oregon psyop) just gives them an excuse to militarize and arm the police and the FBI to maintain an even more lopsided advantage (which happens to provide more profit to the plutocrats). If and when they really get serious disarming the populace and establishing a totalitarian regime that dispenses with the veneer of democracy, they will have the weapons on hand to do so. You don&#39;t need to get rid of Posse Comitatus (the act that restricts ability to use military as a police force) when you turn the police into a military. In the meantime they will continue to profit handsomely from the fear they generate. That&#39;s what they always do. </p>

<p>And now we see they&#39;re using SB to promote the anti-encryption agenda (because encryption really is an impediment, maybe the last impediment, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office">Total Information Awareness</a>, even if they&#39;re very good at getting in through the cracks.)</p>

<p>And yes, my opinion is that SB -- like Sandy Hook and Boston -- was a hoax. Nobody was killed, except maybe the poor couple. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to get one&#39;s mind around how <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">deeply and pervasively we are being lied to and manipulated.</a> The first step is to stop reading or watching corporate (i.e. mainstream) media and to not believe anything they say. Same is true of the government. Don&#39;t believe a word of what they say. Nothing. Even if some of it is accurate, it&#39;s simply impossible to separate the lies from the truth, and you will waste a lot of time and energy doing so. It already takes enough time and energy trying to discern the truth through the fog of disinfo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You had me up until San Bernardino, Oregon, Sandy Hook, and Boston all being Psyops. You seriously believe that those things were all gov&#39;t psyops? You dont think, that, just maybe sometimes bad shit happens? I just cant wrap my head around that narrative. I dont know, I guess Im just incredibly skeptical and that the preponderance of evidence point to... well, bad shit just happening.</p>

<p>Sure, there are things we dont know, or wont know, or arent intended to know, but, yeah, like I just said, I&#39;ve just accepted as all falling under the category of &quot;shit happens&quot; and that the only thread connecting them are mental illness and deadly weapons.</p>

<p>How could SB be a psyop? There&#39;s a lot we dont know and encryption is important preserve, but I chock it up to just twisted ideology and some level of social disengagement being to blame.</p>

<p>How could the Oregon &quot;militia&quot; occupation be a psyop? Are they supposed to be on the gov&#39;t payroll or something?</p>

<p>How is Boston a psyop? Seems like another social isolated radical who convinced his kid brother to help him maim a bunch of innocent people. Also, this one doesn&#39;t play into your gun control narrative.</p>

<p>And lastly, Sandy Hook. I dont know where to begin. My brother in law is a Sandy Hook truther and I just... I can&#39;t even wrap my (tiny) brain around how anyone can believe this. Ive heard all about the &quot;crisis&quot; actors and all that and none of it makes any fucking sense. Im sorry. Im not trying to be insulting here, really, Im not. Im just trying to gain some perspective.  How the fuck are these all nefarious plots tied together and gov&#39;t psyops?  It seems to me that they&#39;re all just cases of, like I said, bad shit happening.</p>

<p>People act very differently in response to stress, crisis, etc. Humans are complex and so are their behaviors. Humans aren&#39;t 100% predictable and you can&#39;t pin down where someone&#39;s going to land on an emotional spectrum in response to grief.

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re a person who is kind of curious about this stuff but not yet ready to swallow the red pill, or if you&#39;re a disinfo agent. Given your posts on the r/opiates subreddit, I&#39;m going to go ahead and give you the benefit of the doubt. I was in the same mindset as you are just a couple of months ago. Here is what I wrote in the comments of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/44na2v/some_thoughts_and_links_related_to_my_recent/">a post I made about my journey into conspiracy theories</a> that apply here (slightly modified to the present discussion):</p>

<p>There are two parts to a conspiracy theory. One is the evidence that things are not as we are told or as they appear. Then there is the explanation for why someone would conspire, or what is the rationale. If people were just spouting off &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; or &quot;coming up with rationales&quot; without any evidence at all, then there&#39;s a problem. But in most cases there are a lot of good reasons/evidence.</p>

<p>The problem is that you are putting the cart before the horse. You&#39;re saying, &quot;well how could that be true?&quot; or &quot;what reason could they possibly have for doing X?&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s absurd!&quot; So then you dismiss the possibility for the conspiracy, without even <em>examining</em> the evidence. Just because you can&#39;t wrap your head around something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong. You say &quot;the preponderance of the evidence points to bad shit just happening.&quot; What evidence are you referring to? Conventional wisdom? I would argue just the opposite: the evidence actually points in the opposite direction: many bad thing that happen were done on purpose to achieve a goal. I don&#39;t just believe the things I&#39;m saying. I have evidence for my beliefs. </p>

<p>Your worldview is one in which you don&#39;t live in a world filled with manipulation, deceit and conspiracies. But once you begin to realize how many world-changing events were the product of manipulation and deceit, you kind of have to start to wonder if maybe that is the world you&#39;re living in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/02/58-admitted-false-flag-attacks.html">Here are a list of 58 admitted false flag events.</a> Just look at how major some of these are. These are not &#39;theories,&#39; these are accepted facts. A matter of mainstream historical record. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.alienscientist.com/conspiracy2.html">Here is a list of conspiracies that turned out to be true.</a> Again, a matter of historical record. </p>

<p>There is some overlap between the lists, but hopefully you get the point. And then see the thread I linked to for links to a background on Pearl Harbor (not exactly false flag, but still something the US president appears to have willfully precipitated and knowingly ignored advance warnings of) and to Wall Street support/financing/etc. of the Bolshevik Revolution (aka Communism) and the Nazis.</p>

<p>So my worldview now is one where tragedies that are used to serve political goals are more likely than not to be the result of some kind of deceit/manipulation/false flag. Maybe not all of them, but that is now my starting point, though it should still be supported by evidence.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that every tragedy is a false flag or hoax. But the ones that matter to national and international affairs probably are, or at least have resulted from some kind of manipulation and deceit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know all about false flags and all that. Im aware of almost all of the ones on that list already. I think 9/11 even may even have been a USS Maine type incident. I just dont see how Sandy Hook could possibly be one. If it was intended to take our guns away, it sure failed. There was public outrage but only a small minority of people are/were for gun confiscation. I guess you could say I just dont understand how someone could think that the government or whoever could plan to use some patsy to execute a bunch of toddlers. The mental gymnastics involved is astounding. There&#39;s a reason 99.9% of people dont believe SH was a false flag, because none of the evidence suggests otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the point about Sandy Hook is that it was a hoax. Meaning <em>nobody died</em> at Sandy Hook. Which, by the way, is the name of <a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/NobodyDiedAtSandyHook_final.pdf">the book revealing that Sandy Hook was a hoax.</a> The book was banned by Amazon. Banned. You gotta ask yourself why they would ban the sale of book that simply claims that Sandy Hook was a hoax. I mean, they sell Mein Kampf for crying out loud. You&#39;d think they&#39;d be happy to learn that nobody died at Sandy Hook. I know it sounds crazy. In a sense it almost sounds crazier than the kids being killed. I&#39;m not asking you to believe it. I&#39;m just saying you should look at the evidence. </p>

<p>You can think about two basic types of false flags. One is a real false flag where people die but the public is lied to about about who killed them and why. That&#39;s like 9/11. And then there are hoaxed false flags, like <a href="http://fair.org/media-beat-column/30-year-anniversary-tonkin-gulf-lie-launched-vietnam-war/">The Gulf of Tonkin incident.</a>  We&#39;re saying that Sandy Hook, Boston, and San Bernardino were hoaxes where nobody died. </p>

<p>I linked to the Sandy Hook book above, but if you don&#39;t feel like reading it (though you should), you could try this documentary. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0z275nQnM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0z275nQnM</a></p>

<p>Oh, and since you&#39;re skeptical about (as you should be) but interested in (as you should be) the idea of &quot;crisis actors,&quot; check out this video:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpFopWtcu8E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpFopWtcu8E</a></p>

<p>EDIT: And as I said twice, the main goal of Sandy Hook was not to take away our guns. Re-read what I wrote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then, I presume you believe it was banned do it not being afraid to tell the truth, and not because it&#39;s patently offensive to the families who lost their children, or maybe due to some kind of copyright claim?<br/>
If no one lost children that day then what happened to all those children then how does one explain all the people in their families and communities that knew those children, had taught or interacted with those children? Or how about people in the surrounding area who knew those children? Or the people in the areas surrounding those areas who knew those people who knew those people who knew those children? And the people that knew those people, and so on and so fourth.</p>

<p>Now, more than ever we are all interconnected. The whole six degrees of separation aspect completely destroys your theory. Even if they government wanted to just somehow fabricate all those kids, people would realize it was bullshit right away. That&#39;s too many people to create out of thin air. It&#39;s absolutely impossible. So your theory goes to shit. So youve either got to start over and either admit the children really are dead and that for some reason the gov&#39;t had them killed to increase weapon sales, or youve got to move on to the next batshit line of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An addendum to my previous response. You wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You had me up until San Bernardino, Oregon, Sandy Hook, and Boston all being Psyops. You seriously believe that those things were all gov&#39;t psyops?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I do believe. But not on blind faith. But because I&#39;ve looked into them. I never ever would have believed it before that. Just a couple of months ago I thought the idea they could be hoaxed psyops was totally absurd. And so I never took a minute to look into them. But once I did, I realized the deception is paper thin. Poke at it and it falls away. There are some links to Sandy Hook and San Bernardino in the thread I linked to in my longer reply to you, if you&#39;re interested. </p>

<p>And yes, I know it&#39;s A LOT to get your head around. And you know what? Maybe you shouldn&#39;t even try to get your head around it. In some ways it&#39;s better to live without having an inkling of the world we really live in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is Boston a psyop? Seems like another social isolated radical who convinced his kid brother to help him maim a bunch of innocent people. Also, this one doesn&#39;t play into your gun control narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that <em>all</em> psyops are about gun control. And if you read again what I wrote about Sandy Hook, I said that it was only partly about gun control. If anything, it was a way to get people to go out and buy more guns. And I explained the reasoning behind that. I don&#39;t buy the narrative that it&#39;s all about Obama wanting to take away our guns (in fact that narrative was the reason I never took the whole claim seriously). Obama is just a puppet, and I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s (mainly) about taking away our guns. </p>

<p>I will say that one commonality of all of the psyops you mentioned is to make us afraid. Instill fear in us. Then they can come in and offer us protection, and we will gladly whatever they&#39;re offering because we feel it will make us safer. We&#39;ll let them wiretap all of our communication, take away any privacy we have, put us on lockdown (which is just a disguised form of martial law), arm the police to the hilt, etc. etc. Instilling fear is their number 1 method of control. And one of the main ways they do it is by making us afraid of each other: muslims, militia, communists, etc. etc. Divide and conquer is the oldest trick in the book. And despite the fact that everyone knows about it, we fall for it again and again and again.  </p>

<p>Finally, again, your entire line of argument is &#39;how could that be true&#39; or &#39;why would they do that&#39; or &#39;how does that make any sense.&#39; So here&#39;s what I suggest: stop putting the cart before the horse. Look with an open mind to see for yourself what the evidence says. If you decide the evidence is bad, so be it. If you decide there is evidence, <em>then</em> start asking yourself those questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey bud, thanks for making my day! I was feeling kind of down, but had good chuckle when I logged into Reddit and saw you taunting me about getting &#39;way more downvotes&#39; than you. And here I had already forgotten about the whole thing!</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#39;t know which is more hilarious/pathetic: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>That you&#39;re still stinging from having your ass handed to you so you had to crawl back two days later to respond to me in a low-ranking thread on a days-old post that <em>nobody</em> is going to read anymore. </p></li>
<li><p>That you think your insipid, idiotic and illogical copy-paste attempts to discredit and misdirect are anything other than completely and totally transparent and pointless. </p></li>
<li><p>That you are teasing me about how many downvotes I&#39;ve gotten (let&#39;s see, as of now the lowest I&#39;ve got is 0, the most you&#39;ve got is 2, yep you&#39;re right, I&#39;ve got <em>way</em> more downvotes)</p></li>
<li><p>That you care so much about up/downvotes</p></li>
<li><p>That you think <em>I</em> care about them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#39;t you realize that you&#39;re less annoying than a gnat buzzing in my ear? As a disinfo shill, you&#39;re certainly about as effective. Can I file a complaint with your supervisor? We need better opposition down here, it&#39;s getting boring. Like swatting flies.  </p>

<p>I admit you had me at first. I thought your initial question about psyops was genuine because I saw from your comment history that you frequent the r/opiates subreddit to boast about your prodigious drug habit. At first I thought it was a sign that you might be open to non-mainstream thinking. Now I&#39;m wondering if maybe you post there simply trying to encourage and reinforce other people&#39;s addictions. Wouldn&#39;t put it past you. </p>

<p>But judging from our exchange, the most likely scenario is that your addiction to opiates stems from a desperate and futile attempt to numb the pain of living a soulless, worthless existence. Hope that works out for you, bud. </p>

<p>And please feel free to respond--I&#39;m always up for a good laugh!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the concept of the Panopticon and agree with you that we are being informed that we are being spied upon in order to get us to self-censor and modify our behavior.  However this does not mean that the mass surveillance, storage and processing does not take place.</p>

<p>To me it is concerning how often we hear whistleblower stories that describe mass surveillance as being ineffective (such as <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-whistleblower-overwhelmed-with-data-ineffective/#!">http://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-whistleblower-overwhelmed-with-data-ineffective/#!</a>).  This reads like propaganda to downplay to me. </p>

<p>I approach this problem as a software developer myself.  If I can conceive of a system that I could build with unlimited man hours and hardware budget then there is no reason that it is not in operation right now.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>when they did not even have time to read the email that is sent directly to the white house</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a system like this no human reading is required at all, zero.  The capturing, processing and decision making could all be automated.  For example: The system determines through some keywords that you have made anti-government facebook posts, your SSN is now flagged for a secondary IRS review of your next tax return.  These are the sorts of problems that software developers design solutions to every day.  They are not technically difficult and do not require a lot of resources.  </p>

<p>At the very least all of this data is being vacuumed up and stored for possible later processing.  But I really have no idea how common it is for actions to be taken based on this data.  It could be almost none, like your example of only caring &quot;after the fact of committing a major crime&quot;, or it could be much more involved than that.</p>

<p>An example I can conceive of: A person is determined to be a threat to whatever group operates the network based on some automatically collected information.  An algorithm selects a response program for this person.  A signal is sent to his cell phone triggering a change in the EM output of the phone in such a way that is harmful to human health, significantly increasing the risk of cancer or some other disease.  I am not saying this is happening, I am just thinking in a way someone tasked with implementing this type of program might.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the imagination is an incredible thing. and i&#39;m not making for of you -- I&#39;m sincere. heres the thing -- psychological manipulation is easier than real action. it also happens to be the skill set of the powers that be, play acting is their game. now you may conceive of a plan where all could be monitored with unlimited man power --- and they are very glad you can concieve of that. but problem is they do not have unlimited man power. at all. they have to deal with real world factors. as your imagination does not. </p>

<p>there is also the issue of the quantity of people they are trying to control -- all of us. so tracking individuals doesn&#39;t do them a great deal of good when the only REAL threat to them is popular opinion. once popular opinion turns against them - well then they have a storming the castle/ refusal to pay taxes etc  sort of situation. thats what they really fear. and probably the only thing they really fear. individual trouble makers -- eh -- not really a big picture problem. if the news doesn&#39;t cover it - it did;t happen -- wink wink. </p>

<p>Put yourself in the shoes of the manipulators.  There are incredibly smart people whose job it is to think up these programs.  </p>

<p>Sure, but vacuuming up and processing data can be a rather low effort task.  As a single software developer, on a low budget I can rent some server space, set up a database and do quite a bit.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just about individuals.  Data can be analyzed to tell you things about groups of people as well.  I have a friend who does statistical modelling professionally.  She worked for the Democratic party during the first Obama election, now she does this work for large charities.  People pay big money for her work because she is able to take a dataset and suggest effective, concrete actions based on that data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realize that there is no technical barrier to further steps.  Again, I approach this as a software developer, this is stuff I could do personally.    Speech-to-text programs have existed for a long time.  Text can be parsed and processed for meaning.  This is done currently in High Frequency Trading: news stories are analyzed for meaning and automatic stock trades are made on the interpretations of the stories with no human interaction.  The processing power and storage required to do processing of all electronic communications is not an issue.  Hardware is just not that expensive.  Military budgets are massive and psychological warfare is likely more important to military success than tanks and bombs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is blocking you from considering this?  Is it a world view that thinks people in charge could not be that invasive or sinister?  There is no reason not to do this. Since:</p>

<p>a) It provides additional information.  Yes, we are measured in how we react to propaganda.  The contents of private phone conversations would seem to be an important data point.<br/>
b) It is technically simple.<br/>
c) It is cheap.</p>

<p>Done, next project.  Where I fall short is in not being able to imagine all of the possible data collection and analysis techniques.  We can look at the documents leaked by Snowden, but I think that is a limited hangout and so we only get what they want us to know.  I imagine there must be some kind of algorithm to match individual pieces of data to a specific person with some % certainty.  For example could analyze internet traffic from a common ip to attempt to associate various online accounts with the same person.  Again, there is no technical barrier to this, these are the types of problems software developers tackle every day.</p>

It&#39;s that I gave it a lot of consideration and realized it&#39;s not happening. --- consider all the missing child cases. if we were being spied on in this way would;t it give cops incredible leverage in these cases? and yet not a single kid has ever been retrieved because the NSA said -- hey we found this convo on this phone -- go look for this individual. this NEVER happens. there are so many crimes occurring where this kind of data retrieval would be a total game changer in preventing and solving the crimes -- but it never plays a role. that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s not really happening. not that it&#39;s necessarily truly impossible to do -- but just that if they were doing it we would see indications that we are not seeing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Im just saying it&#39;s an ugly truth that no one wants to talk about. Like how most rapists are known to the victim. Or going further, how most rapists not only know the victim but a majority of the time the perpetrator is either family or someone dating the victim or a close friend. </p>

<p>It&#39;s disturbing, but I find it more disturbing no one wants to talk about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the main point, according to the stats, most are runaways. Could be they&#39;re running away from shitty, abusive parents. Could be that they&#39;re just little shits who dont want to listen to mom or dad anymore and hightail it to seek whatever they think independence holds for them. </p>

<p>Spare me the melodramatics, please. &quot;Beyond reproach&quot;.... grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would conjecture that virtually all of the missing child cases that are not perpetrated by family or friends are actually perpetrated by the same people who have power over the NSA. Time and again information and investigations about the involvement of high-ranking people and intelligence agencies in child trafficking operations gets quashed and covered up. In other words, the reason &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t help the police on this is because &quot;they&quot; are the ones behind it in the first place. And if you don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible, you should read the first half of Dave McGowan&#39;s <em>Programmed to Kill.</em> Also this presentation by Ted Gunderson: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_jWWIS_hE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_jWWIS_hE</a></p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean we are actually being monitored, but I don&#39;t agree with your reasoning. I actually think it&#39;s quite plausible that we are all being monitored by computers (using speech recognition programs) that are searching for certain key phrases and will bring those to the attention of human analysts. They basically have unlimited resources, so sky is the limit. If not now, then it&#39;s only a matter of time. At the end of the day, though, it doesn&#39;t really matter.  </p>

<p>-- theres plenty of real strander-danger child predators, deeply unfortunately. I know too well from previous work. there may very well be kidnappings done by gov entities too, if fact I think that abuse at military child care is a certainly.  </p>

<p>but the standard opportunistic creep that offers kid a ride home from school is all too real and rampant as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this may be very very true. but I&#39;ll tell you they are not looking for real terrorists, all their terrorists are actors playing the part to help you get a real good show about what happens to accused terrorists. so - are our rights out the window? sure. but are they really looking for us if we discuss threats about the government? no. you have to actually do something  real that they want to get you for, whatever it may be. and really theres not much you can do. if you wanted to blow up a government office -- there are security measures to prevent you from achieving that, it&#39;s not nearly as easy as just &quot;planning it&quot; . plan all you like - it&#39;s not really an issue, the reality is even if you did it you would not achieve much. an explosion doesn&#39;t change the system.  and if you can&#39;t change the system -- you are not worth their time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah -- I agree with you on this too. lets hope nobody is being dragged off in middle of night. creepy thing is we wouldn&#39;t even really know. investigative journalism is kinda gone so who would report it if it were happening? I dunno what&#39;s beyond what I can see or hear or what my friends see of hear and tell me about -- really and truly. </p>

<p>and yeah -- that law is enough we should be having a revolution just for that. </p>

<p>but I do thin kits about fear factor, more than anything. I think they want us to fear. i think they are using age old tactics of controlling populous. give em a show of what will happen if they act out, make em believe they are always being watched. let em believe somebody is fighting for their best interest still - so not all hope  is lost and they don&#39;t need to revolt. give em spectacle and drama to keep their attention so they don&#39;t start spending their free time putting 2 and 2 together. give em a lottery kind of fantasy so there is always a reason to hope - tomorrow they will rise above the stress of their existence. </p>

<p>give em lots of little perils and tell them the government is working on them. so as much as things suck -- they would suck more without the system in place. </p>

<p>the list goes on --- but it&#39;s not original. it&#39;s just revamped to feel new and convincing. but it&#39;s really same old stuff. </p>

<p>of course we are free to get creative about a new response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t decided either way. but I see reasons to be uncertain. namely that the story of the torture there came to us and was sold hard by msm, same peeps who brought us snowden media blitz and official story of 9/11. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s not real at all - but I really wish there could be an independent investigation into exactly what goes on there and has gone on.  </p>

<p>do you think there would be any point to torturing 9/11 suspects when tptb knows exactly what happened? why waist the energy? I&#39;m not at  all certain but this is also one of the reasons i question it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t completely disagree with you. At least, it&#39;s not at that point yet.</p>

<p>The problem that I see lies in the very operations currently existing in the Middle East. As several former drone pilots have stated, there is literally <strong>no person</strong> who makes decisions on who to attack. A computer algorithm is set up to look for GPS locations and particular key words in messages in order to identify potential terrorists. This doesn&#39;t even go through an approval - what the computer spits out determines who gets killed.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this operation has no accountability and there&#39;s no way to know how many innocents have died as a result of this garbage, but estimates range anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000. There are some cases when the civilian unknowingly triggered the algorithm&#39;s alarm with no nefarious intent, and other attacks that find a legitimate threat are prone to easily killing multiple people in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>So, am I terribly worried about someone snooping through my messages? Well, I find it completely unethical that they can, however, the chance of it happening right now is extremely low. What does worry me, however, is the government employing some sort of similar algorithm to find people who are candidates to be rallied up and thrown in a camp. This isn&#39;t really a fear I live with, but if they&#39;re willing to use software to make kill decisions, then there&#39;s really nothing they&#39;re not willing to use it for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know about that system in middle east. it sounds very HAL like. can they even prevent it from targeting areas where their own soldiers are present? it sounds terrifying. it&#39;s also totally ourt of my realm of knowledge so I can&#39;t say if I know it&#39;s real or know it&#39;s not etc. if I were to guess I&#39;d say there is absolutely a person behind it manipulating what the computer says to target -- but everybody who is not in the know thinks it&#39;s only computer generated decisions. but that&#39;s just my guess. ugh war. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what our future holds. but I know they like to keep us afraid. and as old fears lose their sting they construct new fears for us to be paralyzed by. remember how we were all about to die from atom bomb for so long? now -- eh. but death camps might be coming. -- i dunno. maybe. but also many not. I&#39;m not saying our future will be sunshine and roses and all prosperity -- at all -- but I think what it comes down to is money more than anything. they WANT us to keep generating income tax -- to buy their oil and to pay interest on our increasing debts. not even specifically because it means they get more money - but just to maintain the disparity of them having much more money than us. because they didn&#39;t get enough love as children. or something .actually the ultimate motive baffles me, but for whatever reason - we are being bamboozled in a big way -- so they are always going to create these big scares for us -- and then get in disguise to be the ones we turn to for protection and security. it&#39;s not that there&#39;s nothing to fear - but the more theatrical the fear (and the more it would position us to not be able to pay taxes) the less likely that&#39;s the one thats really coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lucky for me my computer is not playing the video rt now, that stuff is really hard for me to take. i have not much fortitude for war violence/ but I do believe I remember hearing about this issue of the drone strikes being so random/ I&#39;d have to bolster myself -  - to give it a deep investigation. I&#39;m not at all convinced the reporting we get on the war is any more accurate than the reporting we get about our homeland, but I&#39;m sure some truth gets through too.  </p>

<p>have you read THE OPERATORS by Michael Hastings? he&#39;s journalist who was mysteriously killed. he wrote about a general in afghanistan a while back, it was a really good story about, a bunch of things - but one thing about how nobody is really trying to win the war. a cohesive strategy was actually undesirable, because it might lead to a conclusion. ... I&#39;m sure it;s only gotten worse -- but it&#39;s a great book I saw - and it was written at time just before (a lot of people myself included - and him -- who had voted for Obama were starting to realize -- what did we fall for,) </p>

<p>so if they are going super random with their attacks -- it is possible it is a strategy of being ineffectual and only terrifying without a path to resolution. we really are being run by monsters,  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sheds an interesting light. Makes sense. It&#39;s amazing we can be in a &quot;war&quot; against cave-dwelling guerillas who don&#39;t have satellite imagery, thermal goggles, stealth fighters, and UAV strikes, and still be nowhere closer to victory than we were when we started. It&#39;s either sheer incompetence, or it&#39;s intentional. Given that the war machine has no benefit in letting itself downsize, it&#39;s not incomprehensible that the goal is simply regional terrorism in hopes of breeding more enemies our great Big Brother can protect us from.</p>

<p>Think about it for a moment.  This is the <em>very</em> point and purpose of Edward Snowden and his supposed &quot;leaks&quot;.  He really didn&#39;t actually reveal anything that would hurt or undermine TPTB.  What he <em>did</em> do, however, is scare the shit out of the majority of the public who are now like &quot;O_o Oh nos!  Now Big Brother can watch everything I&#39;m doing!  Shit!&quot;, and this is <em>exactly</em> how TPTB want you to feel:  <em>Scared</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Be afraid, citizen.  Be very afraid!&quot;</p>

<p>So the msm parade out performance after performance (whether it be Snowboy and his &quot;leaks&quot; or this whole supposed &quot;conflict&quot; about whether TPTB can spy on you using iPhone technology or not) and all it&#39;s designed to do is get the citizenry more and more and more scared of &quot;just how powerful and all-encompassing the state is over us!!&quot;</p>

<p>Be afraid, citizen!  Be very afraid!  The state knows your every move!</p>

<p>Fear is what they use to control you/us.  Don&#39;t give in to it.</p>

<p>Sounds like Reddit in general. lol</p>

<p>I think that this sub is a lot closer to a <em>lot</em> of truths than many try to let on.  I think there’s a lot of cointelpro in this sub.  Big time.  There’s a lot of craziness and quackery here for sure - lots of stuff that <em>should</em> most definitely get downvoted to hell, yes.  However, there’s also stuff on here regularly enough that pops up that is A) pretty darn spot on with regard to what’s actually going on, and B) not really found or talked about in too many other places around…so I wouldn’t doubt that there’s a bit of an effort to not only keep tabs on some of what happens here, but also to shut some shit down or ridicule things as much as possible so as to keep people from getting <em>too</em> close to what some of the truth just might be that TPTB don’t want the plebs to know about.</p>

<p>I try to just dig and keep digging.  Often I come up with just clumps of mud and dirt, but sometimes I come across a pretty impressive nugget of truth.</p>

I like to see what people are posting about. sometimes I turn here just to find out whats going on in the world today, etc. but it&#39;s possible I&#39;m one of the people you think should get down voted to hell too. not sure what you view as those topics. but whatever.  wheve all got a different rainbow of what speaks to us -- or whatever. </p>

<p>but yeah -- overall it&#39;s a good place,  great really. but I could go for an even more open minded crowd too. not one that just believes any idea that comes along  - but just one that doesn&#39;t seek to shut down ideas they don&#39;t yet see the reasoning for,  I&#39;d like that very much too. but on other hand wouldn&#39;t want it to be too easy -- could get boring. :)  </p>

<p>I&#39;d say this goes for everyone.  All depends on what day and circumstances things find themselves in.  I try to deal with situations as they come in the moment.  If someone&#39;s decent to me, I&#39;m decent to them.  If they&#39;re not, then I&#39;m not.  I&#39;ve probably been upvoted <em>and</em> downvoted by almost everyone I&#39;ve come in contact with in this subreddit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I feel the same way.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I understand this sentiment, and think it&#39;s not a bad one at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the best part is that the people who go from poor to rich the hard way are almost always extremely positive people.  They&#39;re almost always coming from a viewpoint of the world having plenty of resources and that there&#39;s plenty for all of us.  They are positive and outgoing and <em>lack</em> fear of losing (you need that to move your life forward like that because there isn&#39;t some easy path).  But where it gets bad with human behavior is when people <em>have</em> success but don&#39;t have what they want (happiness, love, power, whatever it is).  Nothing causes laziness of the very things that create success like achieving some form of success and falling into a laziness or &quot;I&#39;m losing things&quot; mindset.  We&#39;ve all seen it, people get rich and then they stop doing the very things that got them there, they lose that mindset.  </p>

Imagine the church, or the old money families, or even war heroes like McCarthy when he ran out of enemies from one war and tried to keep claiming wars afterwards, or we&#39;ve seen it with rappers where they have a hit from having a huge ego, spend all their money, and then react so much when they&#39;re challenged that they rant on twitter.  Power and Money corrupts when we identify and think we deserve them.  Life is messy, creating things is messy, having an awesome life is hard, finding love is hard, being happy is hard (endorphins don&#39;t scale, they&#39;re exponential because there&#39;s receptors <em>and</em> the transmitters themselves, blasting one reduces the other).  </p>

<p>Power <em>can</em> corrupt.  Money <em>can</em> corrupt.  It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re evil, but they are incredibly powerful and every evil person is going to want to get them because of it (and hoard them when they get it, and do everything they can to claim them for themselves like a cornered animal).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is a silver lining to all of this, it&#39;s that I&#39;m not alone in understanding subterfuge in all forms of media. I remember giving up in high school, not giving a damn, and failing my classes knowing I was going to be another denizen to be watched and used. But I found communities here and elsewhere where there were other redpilled folks just like me; people who too want truth and justice pervade mankind. </p>

<p>I guess what I want to say is just hang in there. We live in a special time where we can gather and disseminate facts and theories in an instant. Things often get worse before life gets better, and nature refuses to be anything other than what it was intended to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lucky for me my computer is not playing the video rt now, that stuff is really hard for me to take. i have not much fortitude for war violence/ but I do believe I remember hearing about this issue of the drone strikes being so random/ I&#39;d have to bolster myself -  - to give it a deep investigation. I&#39;m not at all convinced the reporting we get on the war is any more accurate than the reporting we get about our homeland, but I&#39;m sure some truth gets through too.  </p>

<p>have you read THE OPERATORS by Michael Hastings? he&#39;s journalist who was mysteriously killed. he wrote about a general in afghanistan a while back, it was a really good story about, a bunch of things - but one thing about how nobody is really trying to win the war. a cohesive strategy was actually undesirable, because it might lead to a conclusion. ... I&#39;m sure it;s only gotten worse -- but it&#39;s a great book I saw - and it was written at time just before (a lot of people myself included - and him -- who had voted for Obama were starting to realize -- what did we fall for,) </p>

<p>so if they are going super random with their attacks -- it is possible it is a strategy of being ineffectual and only terrifying without a path to resolution. we really are being run by monsters,  </p>
