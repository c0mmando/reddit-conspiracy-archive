    <div class="md"><p>Got a lot of questions. Answer one or however many you like:</p>

<p>Are we going to see the 28 pages released before the election? </p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s about more than the Saudis in the 28 pages?</p>

<p>How many of the presidential candidates know the 9/11 Truth? Some of it? All of it? </p>

<p>Are you going to vote? Who is your choice?</p>

<p>What do you think is the tipping point between somebody like you or Sibel Edmunds, and Michael Hastings or Gary Webb or Dave McGowan? </p>

<p>Thank you. Keep up the good work. Liked the Bush Dynasty book a lot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No 28 pages on 9/11, Nope
I do think its about more-- all of that leads to questions about the US&#39;s relationship with the Saudis and their fear of what bringing them down could lead to.
I find most politicians pretty ignorant. they dont go very far beyond talking points, and some have admitted to me they dont have time to read books. so i doubt they know very much about 9/11 or anything else</p>

<p>Any thoughts about the Corrupt News Networks which are about to rake in $4.4 billion on political advertising for the 2016 federal election cycle? (up from $3.8 billion in 2012 federal elections)</p>

<p>Many Americans now are turning away from the Hacks &amp; Liars at the <em>New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Post</em>, CBS, NBC, CNN, PBS, etc.--but why should anyone watch or read them Ever Again?  Obama is proof that Hope and Change are marketing gimmicks--so now we know electing a new POTUS only determines the intensity of our wars (the level of corporate corruption will be the same for both democrats and republicans).</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it time Americans organized to expose the pseudo-journalism which fills our minds with Threat Inflation from the Pentagon and garbage from Hollywood? </p>

<p>The presidential campaigns are huge profit centers for the system. Thus, they want as much controversy and wackiness as possible, and of course this year is Pro Wrestling for Politicians. They love it. Yet, they also feel that their job is to &quot;preserve the system&quot; -- so while they enjoy the mud wrestling, they must also find a way in the end to direct the public to candidates who will &quot;stay the course.&quot;  It would be nice if more people did indeed seek out new voices in journalism, but outfits like WhoWhatWhy have trouble getting our name even out there, on account of limited funds. </p>

Targets of the anthrax letters originally blamed on radical extreme Muslims were Democratic party leaders <a href="http://www.salon.com/2001/11/22/anthrax_17/">Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy</a> as well as members of the media including Tom Brokaw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Daschle mentions in this video the Bush administration asked him not to investigate 9/11 several times:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0</a></p>

<p>Cheney and staff took CIPRO a week before the letters were mailed.:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2YrHpB64ac">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2YrHpB64ac</a></p>

<p>Daschle received anthrax in the mail. Anthrax was designed to shut down the government, at a time when Bush and Cheney did not want the government investigating 9/11...</p>

<p>A very important fact about all this is that the FBI destroyed evidence. They destroyed the entire supply of Ames strain anthrax. Now scientists cannot do a genetic reconstruction of where Daschle&#39;s anthrax originated.</p>

<p>This looks like an interesting read:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2002/04/25/biowarfare-terror-weapons-and-the-us/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2002/04/25/biowarfare-terror-weapons-and-the-us/</a></p>

<p>Who creates biological agents and weapons for the Whitehouse and US Military? Who would have the labs, technology and expertise to synthesize the various types of anthrax (including a pure and potentially weaponized version) when Ivan&#39;s original test tube containing the Ames strain didn&#39;t have enough material for all of the anthrax attacks that took place? Who could have stolen anthrax from the test tube that was held in a secure US military base? Name one company. I&#39;ll name one - Monsanto.</p>

<p>I consider myself a very thorough researcher.  But Graeme taught me a few things I&#39;d missed in this book.</p>

<p>I now consider the Anthrax Attacks (especially <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a101401strangecoincidence#a101401strangecoincidence">Gloria Irish</a> ...) to be a 9/11 smoking gun, moreso than WTC7, and at least as big as the Put Options.</p>

<p>Graeme connects Anthrax to 9/11, shows that it was designed as a single operation, and shows that it was intended to provide the WMD excuse to invade Iraq ... but like WTC7, something went wrong.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/Bioter/messageanthrax.html">This article</a> is the single best article about the Anthrax Attacks.  It will take about 20 minutes to read, but you&#39;ll agree that it&#39;ll change anyone&#39;s mind.  Written by a professor who subcontracted for the FBI, and damning of the FBI.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t have time to read Graeme MacQueen (Kevin Ryan&#39;s co-chair on Journal of 9/11 Studies), check out an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=graeme+macqueen+anthrax">audio interview on YouTube</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question from u/northamerimassgrave:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Greetings, I won&#39;t be able to participate in today&#39;s Russ Baker AMA due to time constraints. I know you&#39;ll be busy, but I was wondering if you could possibly cut/paste my questions (below) during the AMA. If not able, I&#39;ll understand. Thanks for any consideration you can give my request.</p>

<p>Questions for Russ Baker:</p>

<p>(1) The unreported facts around the &quot;Missing 28 Pages&quot; suggest much staging: Graham/Goss had conflicts of interest in leading the Joint Committee as they were from Florida where the alleged hijackers trained; Cheney made it clear that he would participate only if Graham/Goss were in charge of the committee; Graham/Goss obstructed witnesses, withheld information, and manipulated events surrounding the Inquiry &amp; its relations with the FBI.</p>

<p>How much of the 28 pages is a designated failsafe; not merely a limited hangout (since it reportedly points fingers at Saudi Arabia, but not Pakistan or UAE or many other states), but a trap? Could the 28 pages be used as a honeypot to jump-start &amp; control an HSCA-style &quot;re-investigation&quot; into 9/11 not only as a &quot;centerpiece misdirect&quot; but as a momentum-killer for other spectacular leads? Why wouldn&#39;t we anticipate that HSCA would be on the minds of &quot;inside job&quot; participants as an example to be learned from, as well as possibly an opportunity, in controlling a seemingly-inevitable &quot;opposition party&quot; re-investigation?</p>

<p>(2) A Question about the &quot;Iran Deal&quot;:</p>

<p>We know that CIA Director Richard Helms &quot;retired&quot; to become Ambassador to Iran during the Shah&#39;s reign of terror, establishing covert networks within Iran during the 1970s.</p>

<p>We know that CIA Director and VP candidate George H.W. Bush had a role in the October Surprise, and that the October Surprise shows that right-wingers organized a cooperation with Iran&#39;s new Muslim revolutionaries in 1980.</p>

<p>We know that the CIA has taken the unusual step of denying that Ahmadinejad was one of the hostage-takers in the Iran Hostage Crisis, despite being identified as a hostage taker by several of the hostages when Ahmadinejad became president.</p>

<p>We know that Oliver North established a secret network within Iran for the Iran-Contra weapons shipments. (Was this secret network within Iran a major goal of the Iran-Contra operations, or possibly the main goal? Have we all overlooked the real operational objective of Iran-Contra?)</p>

<p>With decades of CIA Directors and Neocons linked to affairs with Iran, including with the Islamist regime, why are we overlooking the mutual incentive held by the Neocons &amp; the Iranian hardliners to subvert the Iran Deal, to supply Iran with future terror staging, or nuclear material?</p>

<p>In other words, is the Iran Deal a Cheney trap?</p>

<p>Book Discussion on The Presidential Recordings: The editors talked about <em>The Presidential Recordings: John F. Kennedy, Volumes 1-3, The Great Crises</em>, published by W.W. Norton. More than a dozen scholars, led by the editorial team, transcribed and edited thousands of hours of White House meetings secretly taped by Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. The general editors and director of the project discussed the history of these tapes, their significance, the process of deciphering and transcribing them and the recent publication of the first three volumes of the Kennedy tapes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>please read my stuff. i was standing right in front of building 7 (well as close as cops would allow) looking at it when it collapsed. called it into the LA Times for whom i was working, and editor and i agreed it had the earmarks of a controlled demolition. certainly looked that way to everyone watching. just sayin.... but then it did disappear from coverage. that kind of stuff scares news organizations, and most others as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were on that Scalia story the second we say that bit about the &quot;pillow above his head.&quot; (I think I&#39;ll write about what we learned.) let me just say that the rumors came from really bizarre syntax and incompetent journalism. You&#39;d be surprised by how many things are indeed just screwups. that&#39;s the problem with people who assume that the &quot;bad guys&quot; are flawless in their execution and that everything involves something hidden. in Scalia&#39;s case, the real story is his friends and who were hanging out with him and influencing the court. </p>

<p>Do you think Israel will ever be exposed as the true executor of the 911 attacks, just like the SS Liberty? </p>

<p>If so, do you think we Americans will continue to let them screw us over into paying for and fighting THEIR wars or will we finally address the issue like grown-ups? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha my apologies! </p>

<p>It just seems so obvious that Israel had the most to gain from 911.  And they did.  </p>

<p>I guess you disagree? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats just such a libel on any country without more evidence. I abhor it. With the Saudis, we have much more conclusive links. besides, israel may have gained from 9/11, but how did they gain more than the Saudis, or the military-industrial complex, or the US security apparatus, or anything else? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i was told when i first got into journalism -- and i still believe it is valid -- that journalists should not endorse candidates. of course i will vote but it is my intention to fairly investigate any and every candidate, including the person i may finally settle on. </p>

<p>re &quot;interest in conspiracies&quot; please go to youtube and listen to some of the interviews with me. I think it is defeatist to accept terminology like that when all we&#39;re talking about is doing a better job of digging for the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well as you may know, i got interested in the JFK hit while researching the bush fmaily and discovering the fact that HW drew a blank on his whereabouts. thats&#39; why Family of Secrets has 5 chapters on Dallas. as far as &quot;the latest,&quot; i am not aware that there is much new publicly, though nothing i wrote seems to have been incorrect. i&#39;m doing some new research though, and connecting more dots. </p>
