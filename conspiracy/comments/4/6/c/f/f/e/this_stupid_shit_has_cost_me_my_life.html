<p>I didn&#39;t even really believe in the shit I was saying.</p>

<p>So then why the fuck were you saying it, man?  Be fucking responsible.  I hate to be that guy, but that&#39;s kind of what you get for going out and saying shit you don&#39;t mean.  Be serious in life.  Don&#39;t be a troll.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just slipped I never expected my brother to set me up nor did I think I was important enough to KILL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now you know.  Let that be a lesson to you - an important and valuable lesson perhaps, but a lesson nonetheless.  Sharpen the fuck up.  This world can be very dangerous.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go out and blame the information though.  Don&#39;t blame people going out and uncovering nefarious truths in this world and country.  Don&#39;t start up a post like you did here castigating people who are looking for and trying to uncover the evil that&#39;s being done on this planet.  Don&#39;t turn around and &quot;pledge allegiance&quot; now all the sudden to a flag you know was created by forces who don&#39;t give a fuck about you or any of us.</p>

<p>You can kick yourself in the head all you want for being a dumb ass and saying stupid shit when you shouldn&#39;t have, but don&#39;t go so far as to say you shouldn&#39;t have uncovered what you did.  Those are two different dynamics altogether.</p>

<p>Fuuck thaaaat.  Now that you know what you know, you’ll do nothing but be a walking lie unto yourself if you try to deny and reject all the truths you know.  This isn’t to say you should constantly stand up and yell out for all the world to see that you know certain things.  No.  Don’t do that if you don’t have to.  However, don’t bitch out and start going back to paying attention to the lies and propaganda that the machine peddles.  Fuck that.  <em>Keep educating yourself</em>.  Just don’t be a dumb ass about what you say and who you talk to.  Duh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re not going to change anything, the people that are in power are there for a reason and no amount of knowledge will change that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is nothing but complete and utter bullshit.  The people in power cannot change your own mind and heart if you don’t let them.  They might be able to change the <em>outside</em> world - they might even be able to imprison you or even kill you - but YOU can maintain your focus on the <em>inside</em> world if you’re strong enough.  Don’t punk out.  Don’t think you have no choice in the matter.  You <em>do</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead you could lose your life like I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then <em>lose your fucking life</em> then!  Don’t be afraid to lose this little puny temporary physical vehicle we call “our bodies” just because some people are threatening it now that you said some stupid shit online!  There is a LOT more in existence and to <em>you</em> than this little stupid body you see when you look in the mirror!  You’ll be surprised at how powerful you are and how much you can and will accomplish when you stop worrying about what “might” happen to this temporary physical vehicle.</p>

<p>And this is why you&#39;ve become so absolutely dumbfounded in your fear - because you actually believe this lie that&#39;s been peddled to you.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s exactly <em>nothing</em> &quot;macho&quot; about anything I&#39;ve been saying.  This isn&#39;t &quot;macho&quot;.  It&#39;s simply truth.  You were a dumb ass in what you were saying about your ex girlfriend/her father and about your own brother cop.  You played stupid games.  You won stupid prizes.</p>

<p>When you wake up again after you&#39;re done with this life, you&#39;ll hopefully have learned what <em>not</em> to do for the next time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But don&#39;t go to the other extreme and think &quot;I should have just said &#39;the gubment&#39;s <em>goood!</em>&#39; instead!&quot;  No.  Don&#39;t go and blame the information itself.  Not all, but a <em>lot</em> of the information found in this sub is very much valid and real.  Don&#39;t go throwing it away and saying &quot;I looove this country!  <a href="http://orig10.deviantart.net/7390/f/2012/145/5/5/happy_crying_face_png_by_nfc_by_ninetailsfoxchan-d510n4g.png">It&#39;s the best in the world!</a>&quot; because it&#39;s fucking <em>not</em>.  Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go and turn your back on all the information that <em>is</em> in fact true and valid and <em>does</em> point to all the nefarious bullshit that&#39;s going on in this country and world just because you did some stupid shit and got some trouble for it.</p>

<p>Just realize that you can&#39;t go around saying stupid shit in stupid places is all.  You know...play stupid games, win stupid prizes kind of thing?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do stupid shit.</p>

<p>Be smart.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right but I really wish I could go back and avoid all of this</p>

<p>Well you can’t.  So now you gotta buckle the fuck down and act responsibly NOW.  You have to deal with the circumstances in front of you <em>now</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>seriously you have no idea how bad I want to go back and save my life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t give me that shit.  You can save your life <em>NOW.</em>  The fact that your’e typing this means that all is not over yet.  Just don’t curl up in a ball and call uncle.  <em>Figure it out.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has done no good in my life. I never got a paycheck for figuring out who is running the world. I never got a medal for finding out who was behind 9/11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So fucking what?  Do you think you’re the only one who’s been persecuted or made fun of or even threatened for uncovering dangerous truths?  Join the fucking club, my brother!  Don’t turn your fucking back and turn tail and run now.  Too late for that.  Stand tall.  You’re <em>in it.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead I lost my life at 25 years old</p>

<p>You didn’t lose shit.  If I had you in front of me right now I’d slap some sense into you and tell you to wake the fuck up.  Don’t give up, God dammit.</p>

<p>Be strong.  Don’t be a weak bitch.  You won&#39;t help yourself that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There is no second chance, there is no getting better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit.  This little life isn’t the end all and be all.  You have a SHIT LOAD of second chances and getting better.  It might take a shit ton of work - yes - but it an’t over.  Not by a long shot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was an extremely athletic 25 year old and now I can&#39;t even stand up without getting dizzy, my head feels like its in a vice grip, my face is completely numb.. if you slapped me I wouldn&#39;t even feel it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay so then start going down the road you need to go on in order to find out what happened to you, and <em>why</em>, and what you can do about it to address the situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only am I going to be dead soon my parents are in serious danger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then you need to communicate with everyone you think is important and needs to hear the information you have - whether it be your parents, family, etc, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The group that was after me is the last people in the world you want on you.. I still cant believe this happened I feel like im in a nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then if you think you’re going to end up dead <em>anyway</em>, then you might as well go out in as powerful a manner as you can and do the very thing you think you need to do that would result in the best <em>GOOD</em> independent of whether it costs you your life or not (I mean, you’re talking like you think you’re going to die anyway, right?).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s too late to be strong, my life is OVER.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit.  We aren’t human beings having spiritual experiences in this life.  We are spiritual, <em>eternal</em> beings having temporary HUMAN experiences.  As such, work not from the perspective of this little, tiny, temporary, physical life.  Work from the perspective of the higher self - of the greater self.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter what I do I am going to be dead soon and it&#39;s going to look like I died of natural causes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay then.  So then think about what you need to do to effect the most good in the process.  Perhaps make a video letting it be known what you’ve uncovered and then putting it out so that everyone can see it and learn from it.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like you are so far gone in your paranoia that you are going to either need family and friends to hold your hand for a bit,   or you are going to end up institutionalized for a while.    </p>

<p>Like I said,  if you believe what you say,   then go out and volunteer some place,   mix with normal people,   get mentally and physically healthy.     If you die you die,  if you live,  you live well.    Hey,  isn&#39;t that true for all of us?</p>
