       So the latest bout with our privacy going by by is the FBI trying to get Apple to put a backdoor in their iPhone encryption so they can access data the latest US Terrorist squad /couple may have on their phone. I think their just going through the motions so they can say Apple helped us. In reality i know they have the best minds working for them and they have been able to get encrypted data off any phone they want to in about 29  minutes, na mean? Joke is on the public

       I think it's just a ploy to play with us, help with misdirection. I mean hell dude, they have bots that control upvotes and downvotes, and can control the direction of posts and conversations. Thats a real thing. They can capture data at any point on the internet, but somehow they need to get passed a passcode for some special file that wasn't sent to him or ever sent through the internet ever? Yeah, bullshit. They just want to be able to brute force drug dealer's phones and sic the dea on em.

       From a tech perspective, it's completely different than upvote bots on reddit, or even capturing internet traffic. If I intercept an internet communication, I can run a computer cluster for months at a time to break the encryption, and the data's still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iphone supposedly has a feature where after a certain number of failed passcode attempts, the data on the phone is deleted. They may be lying, but it's a different problem with a different set of solutions than the examples you raised.

       This. If there isn't a backdoor on iPhones already, and if Apple really doesn't want to cooperate, we're talking about breaking strong encryption... the safety of which relies on the fact that it just can't be cracked with the current computational power available to anyone on the planet in a reasonable amount of time. It's a mathematical fact, it's not one of those "oh the government can do it and they don't want you to know" thing. The fact that they may or may not have sophisticated AI that monitors and influences topics on social medias is completely irrelevant. It would be like saying "humanity can build roads and cars, surely we know also have a universal cure to cancer figured out"...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way they can get encrypted data on an iPhone is if Apple helps them or if Apple didn't implement their shit correctly (extremely unlikely).

       From my understanding, it's not even an issue of strong encryption, it's a matter of Apple having a failsafe such that the device will destroy all private data if the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times. There's only 10,000 possible combinations, but that doesn't matter you can only try 10.

       This is one of my biggest issues with this sub. It doesn't matter what you have to say; it's hard to take anything that looks like it was written by a 5th grader seriously. And it's not just the occasional post either... It's a majority of them. It undermines the credibility of anything said on here so bad...

       I always think that if someone can't be bothered to look up the grammar for simple words, then how can I trust them to research anything properly? 
Hence their opinion somewhat loses it's impact.
It also helps with understanding what is being said.
I don't mind foreigners getting it wrong or spelling mistakes because of using a phone but deliberate ignorance as a native English speaker to common words is doesn't look too good.

       Yep, if you enabled any app to use the microphone and/or camera, and it's an app made by 'Johnny' in Banglapur then pretty much they are in your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are though, you have 40 apps that they can get into.

       This. If there isn't a backdoor on iPhones already, and if Apple really doesn't want to cooperate, we're talking about breaking strong encryption... the safety of which relies on the fact that it just can't be cracked with the current computational power available to anyone on the planet in a reasonable amount of time. It's a mathematical fact, it's not one of those "oh the government can do it and they don't want you to know" thing. The fact that they may or may not have sophisticated AI that monitors and influences topics on social medias is completely irrelevant. It would be like saying "humanity can build roads and cars, surely we know also have a universal cure to cancer figured out"...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way they can get encrypted data on an iPhone is if Apple helps them or if Apple didn't implement their shit correctly (extremely unlikely).
