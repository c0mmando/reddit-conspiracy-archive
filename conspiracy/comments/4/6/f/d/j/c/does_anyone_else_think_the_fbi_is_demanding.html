       I was surprised and initially quite impressed by Apple when I learned that the FBI could not get past the ordinary 4 digit code everyone has on their iPhone. I'm sure this isn't the first time they've wanted to get information on a locked iPhone. I would have thought their security experts could (on their own) accomplish what they want Apple to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH maybe I am underestimating the technical difficulty doing so without having access to the original code. I have some experience with programming but I don't know much about writing operating systems, let alone iPhone software.

       Yeah it seems that everyone is forgetting that Apple is already a member of the NSA's PRISM program. We learned this from the Snowden leaks.

       Apple "fighting back" against the FBI is simply a publicity stunt. A backdoor already exists for the NSA.

       Actually, the little production we are witnessing is critical for them in keeping the one phone they need locked, kept locked. If it's indeed the patsy's phone, then there's no way they want that thing unlocked - something might contradict the sweet narrative. Catch my drift?

       It is said that in 2014 the Apple programmers developed new security tech that would prevent their own programmers from unlocking a device. Previously they could do so under government demand, but don't think other companies were not susceptible to these demands. It seems like Apple realized they were losing trust and decided to enhance the security. They have that right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically their new security tech was designed in a way that prevents brute force passcode cracking by giving the owner of the device an option to automatically wipe the data after 10 failed tries, and a few other preventions like that. It gives the FBI a very bad time. Now the FBI wants a way to have unlimited passcode attempts and bypass the automatic data wipe. If Apple provides that, it can be used for any number of iPhones. And it looks like they are being forced to provide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think demonizing Apple or making it out to be a PR stunt is the right move here. The statement from Cook seems like a genuine cry for help and his explanation doesn't appear to be loaded with BS. What seems to be happening is that yes, Apple is now being forced to build the software the FBI has asked them to, but they are opposed to it and standing up against it whether or not they have the final say. Apple is letting us know -
       <em>
        hey look guys, we tried to prevent this but it's going to happen anyway and the only way to stop it at this point is public outreach
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong though. There's always that.

       1) yes, the FBI can already break encryption. the problem is it takes time. What they want is the ability to quickly get in to any phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Do I think this is all for show? Most definitely. The letter is very unclear, was the FBI "asking" or "demanding" (but still a request) or "forcing" (no longer a request but an order). It's impossible to tell from the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) If Apple is not actually being forced to do this yet (which it sounds like they are not, merely being aggressively asked to do it) why go public with an issue that is not yet an issue? They can simply say no and let it be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to guess why this is happening though, I think it probably comes down to something very mundane. The FBI probably acted all high and mighty and treated Apple execs like shit and tried to intimidate them. The billionaire/millionaire execs, with their egos bruised being talked down to by a bunch of gov employees, figured, "You want to push us around, alright, we'll show you." and then they released this announcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now someone at the FBI is probably getting their asshole torn apart for letting the situation get this far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President will call Cook an apologize if he was mistreated and then Apple will secretly put the backdoor in and it will be business as usual.

       The FBI cannot break Apple's AES-256 encryption in iOS. This is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason the FBI are struggling to intrude on the device is simply because of a 10-attempt limit. We don't know that it is a pin-code (though likely is) or a passphrase of arbitrary length. 
The latter is more difficult to bruteforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all mitigated by the data being erased after 10 attempts.

       Thanks for this. I was wrong about that. I just assumed the NSA has the computing/brain power to figure out how to crack anything. But I did some reading due to your comments and Apple seems to have encoded the security directly onto the processor / firmware. So ya, that would be damn near impossible to crack, much less in 10 attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I still strongly suspect this is nothing but execs giving the finger to the FBI for petty reasons. It doesn't seem as though the FBI can force them to do anything, so why make a big public stink over it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will say it's to make the public aware of the government encroaching further, but I seriously doubt it. The only thing a tech company cares about are their profits.

       It would require a completely different type of computer (a quantum computer, or some unknown) to break strong encryption (this does not mean it couldn't be circumvented with backdoors or such). If that computer exists it's classified.

       If we are talking about breaking AES 256, then no. A quantum computer won't fix that 'hard problem.'
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are talking about public key encryption based on discrete logarithms, prime factorization (Elliptic Curve, RSA, DSA, CDH, etc.) then yes, we are approaching the time when a large enough quantum computer can be built and used with Shor's or Grover's algorithms to break that encryption.

       Yup, seems you found the iOS white paper. The key is infused into the silicon, so unless the NSA/FBI have the ability to also clone the hardware, they haven't made any progress (even if they decided to try and clone all the data an attempt it on another chip).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the execs, perhaps. But plenty of people rely on Apple's security for their businesses, and it definitely is an issue for Apple to not address and confirm the security of their services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously they don't want to lose business/customers due to them thinking Apple has a system that has a potential vulnerability.

       Which is why I'm always surprised the NSA and what not don't just co-opt the foundries; infiltrate the actual chip making process and insert their own backdoors without the vendors even knowing.

       Yes. Apple is telling everyone they are fighting against "The Man" trying to break in. Everyone will swarm towards Apple for this reason. Great marketing...now that everyone has come to the dark side, let's let the FBI in.

       Probably. Most likely it's simply to see or how to perfect the method from Apple them self. And it might be a legality thing. But if they cracked that phone without any issues given the public spotlight people would ask questions. And let's be honest a simple dive into some forums or boards will help anyone crack a phone. And pretty sure they have the computational might to brute force it.

       You are forgetting about backups to icloud the physical device Is really not necessary unless he disabled that or never connected to the net after first setting up the phone. There is no true actual secure digital anything. There is always a way in because it's the way or technology works. You would have to code something from the ground up that is completely independent of every other software that has existed so far. And even if you do most likely binary is the language used. And it would only take a matter of time to decode the binary because even then you would need a second device to for the first device to communicate with to transmit and receive the information. Even future technology will adhere to this. Think quantum computers. It's just a set of parameters that form a language of sorts.

       Apple doesn't know the iCloud password either, just the hash. And imagine if the iCloud uses 2-factor auth to log in anyway, and they now need the phone to do it (which is locked an you have 10 attempts to unlock). Pretty damn secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't anything that is 100% secure (there are unknown vulnerabilities, always) but the iCloud backup uses a combination of AES 128-256 encryption, which is as good as unbreakable. It is relatively "hard" to do because the only method is via bruteforce.

       I have to agree, the iPhone has some frustratingly solid security. Find My Phone and Remote Wipe are rad concepts, though I've never used them. I've been locked out of my own device on accident and found absolutely NO WAY to bypass the temporary lock. I've gone through the trouble of trying to rescue a locked iPhone that an employee returned and would not give the passcode for. From these personal experiences/blunders I quickly got the impression an iPhone is more secure than a PC, a Mac, or any other smartphone on the market. Annoyingly so. I've moved to Android though, the hardware is awesome and the customizable UI very slick. I also did Windows Phone for a while (Lumia), not bad, horrible app support.

       How does the phone "erase itself." If we can control power to the phone, can we not eliminate its ability to erase its own data?

       Does it have separate power for just implementing the erasing procedure?

       The data sits in the flash memory (and I think on an iPhone, it's all on a layer over the CPU, and this might complicate the matter)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the data in the flash is encrypted, but all you need is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get the key, you probably need the passcode. The key probably is encrypted with the passcode. This way you can change the passcode without having to re-encrypt your data.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how truecrypt works. This is kind of like how the MS Bitlocker works (Bitlocker is a little bit more flexible about data management)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are probably very clever techniques used by the hardware to make it impossible to read even the encrypted key back without a valid passcode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the flash is on top of the CPU on the same die (and therefore, the interface is buried inside the chip between the two) it becomes very difficult to read the flash directly (by say, desoldering it and dumping the content on another CPU)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the system is well designed, it's also possible that Apple engineers with all the knowledge of the system would not be able to break their own schemes.

       I think whatever it is is a bunch of lies. but your theory is pretty good. if they can get into iPhones i'm sure they already are doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I also think the whole thing is a psyop to make us aware we can be spied on and believe we are being spied on. but there's a problem --- try reading all of your own email from the past year/ try reading ten people's email in the past year - try reading the american public's email from last year, . you know I emailed the white house a few years ago - to say don't go to war with Syria. I got a reply about 6 months later. if they don't have the man power and time to keep up with data directly sent to them asking for their attention -- where is the man power and time to read ALL of our email that are not sending to them??? really. it's the quantity issue. that keeps us safe. but -- of course there is the issue of if they are specifically trying to spy on you personally - then - sure -- there's a problem. BUT -- I suspect the real purpose of this psyop is to make us ALL FEEL LIKE WE  ARE BEING SPIED ON&gt; . like they are painting a big eye in the sky. sure it's just a painting - but doesn't it make you curb your behavior anyway?

        If the FBI succeeds in ordering Apple to comply in California, it would have to build a new software version of iOS that allowed electronic brute-force password cracking. This is an important distinction to make when talking about such an important precedent-setting case.
