       Project MKOFTEN was a covert Department of Defense program developed in conjunction with the CIA. A partner program to MKSEARCH, the goal of MKOFTEN was to "test the behavioral and toxicological effects of certain drugs on animals and humans".[1]
      </p>
      <p>
       According to author Gordon Thomas' 2007 book, Secrets and Lies, the CIA's Operation Often was also initiated by the chief of the CIA's Technical Services Branch, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, to "explore the world of black magic" and "harness the forces of darkness and challenge the concept that the inner reaches of the mind are beyond reach".

       Stay clear of any thorough research into this subject matter. It'll drive you stark "raving" mad. Not only the premise in itself is just beyond terrifying, the data out there is laced with disinfo and, who would've thought, real MK.

       That's exactly what I'm saying, forget about it, for your own mental well-being. The thing is after a while of delving into this, you won't be able to discern what's real or not anymore, everything 'll be plausible. This mechanism is the MK, the disinfo throwing you in all general directions until your mind starts to wander in circles of belief followed by disbelief and you'll be highly susceptible to any form of suggestion, like a child being hypnotised.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your mind gets trapped in this paranoid feedback loop, you're effectively under MK. That's how manchurian candidates are made. Many of those mass shooters brain-washed themselves, being in a vulnerable state already by default, delving into crap they couldn't handle, which ultimately threw them overboard into a deep state of psychosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lot more complicated than that. It's so insidious, so diabolically inescapable, it's almost indescribable. And it'll make you lose whatever little faith you have left in humanity. It'll sap your will to live unlike anything else.

       I think people confuse mind control and programming. Is programming someone to react emotionally to stimulus of an event or experience actual control of the mind? or careful programming that brainwashes an individual to perceive reality differently by way of deceptive forces being applied on the individual's senses which would require drugs or suggestive methods to induce the illusion on the senses for the programming to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this way programming is a form social control and is achieved by convincing the person, deceiving them into accepting a way of seeing the world that is the point of view of the programmer.The individual can always overcome this form of control because it is being applied by emotional and physical stimuli coming from outside of the mind of the individual, ie physical or emotional torture applied by the handler. If a Manchurian candidate is controlled by confusing him with deceptive methods he cant overcome because of the social control than it cannot be said he is mind controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think True mind control cannot be done. The Mind is a barrier that cannot be overcome in the true sense of mind control by law of nature. But the mind can be tricked into accepting a false paradigm.

       If you knew of the new technology like EEG-heterodyning, you would likely think otherwise. Silent Sound Spread Spectrum. There's a lot to look into. My site's a good start. Akwei vs NSA, also very illuminating. The technology is far more advanced than we could have conceived. They're interacting, electromagnetically, with brains at the synapse level.

       Technology 's main Purpose is to get you to externalize your mind because they cant get into your head, period. Control will be achieved only when they  teach us to externalize our thinking into devices and objects. If you put your thought process outside yourself, then it can be manipulated by forces outside your mind. This is the very real purpose of technology. It's a spiritual thing that the mind cannot be overcome. Strip yourself of technology and nothing can penetrate your mind. They can kill you, torture you. But they can't truly mind control you, they cannot get into your head in the true sense, but you can be deceived easily  into accepting programming  manipulation and suggestions forced on you by physical or emotional stress. But even that is not permanent .

       I will look into it man...But they don't call the human mind last frontier for nothing. Theosophists such as Alice Bailey and
Albert Pike talk about the whole new age being  about externalizing the human mind, to break it, control it, and overcome it. It's a spiritual thing, to understand.

       Exactly, you are giving access to your thought process that is not otherwise possible. The mind itself cannot be penetrated but if you externalize its functions you can then replicate mind control outside the mind. The laws of nature are always in balance a complete equilibrium of energy and power. Your will of the mind cannot be overcome, but you can invite suggestive control by allowing it in. Same goes for the spiritual world, which always requires an invitation whether intention or by accident.

       The greatest trick has been convincing us to believe we are not part of the Spiritual world around us. We have been deceived to unplug from the Source so we become seemingly lost and confused. Good forces cannot overcome bad forces and vice versa, they are always in equilibrium. What we see is an illusion of overpowering caused by the deception of one side giving away its spiritual ground to another like a shift in equilibrium but the whole system is always still in complete balance. The Good and Evil dynamics we observe in struggle are not differentiated by the Source or the Creator. They are one and the same to the Creator. Mind and matter/ Spirit and matter are one and the same, in the Aether, in the closed system or medium of Creation itself. The matter or materialization of the spirit world, is a theatre in which the spiritual self acts out the scenes of the free Will's expression of itself in material form. Scenes of life and death, suffering, joy in a material expression of the spiritual world. In this medium of Spirit's expression in material form, one spirit can be deceived by any another,creating a matrix within the Medium of creation where spirits are deceived in material form by others seeming more clever into believing they are nothing more than finite carbon form that will cease to be after few material years of existence. This tormented spiritual Will being expressed in the material form forgets itself, and its spiritual origin. But in truth, Its entire suffering and material creative nature is but an expression, a costume of some sort. Easily removed when realized. It  appears as though the deceived spirit in material form is lost in this matrix but the Source Creator has always maintained that spiritual mind as a protected  tether to the Creator, even in this  material expression and cannot be overcome or overpowered by deceptive means of clever spirits trying to achieve a hierarchical control in the medium of creation. Which creates a world seemingly  separate from the Creator or Source. But this is just an illusion. The real creation, that is the spiritual self while allowed to express itself in material avatars, it cannot be lost or destroyed, it is part of the Creator itself. The Creator  doesn't need to babysit this medium of creation, it is just an expression of the Free will given to the Spirits which forever are part of the Creator. Hence,the Spirit's material torment is its own creation, easily overcome by remembering its origin as an infinite being of the Creator or True Source.

       Raves and festivals: if you don't realize you are spirit of equal power in a powerful spiritual world then the real self aware spiritual world around you will overcome you because  it knows you are unplugged from the Source by your own ignorance. It then can torment you with spiritual confusion you cannot decipher because you forget to trace yourself to the Source power. Akin to someone finding you with memory loss on the street and convincing you that you owe them money and that you are someone else just to manipulate you because they know you have memory loss.
