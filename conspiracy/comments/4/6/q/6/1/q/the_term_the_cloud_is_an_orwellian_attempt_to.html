       Sounds like the term originated with Google.  No surprise.  Think how different it would sound to say "your photos, texts, emails, calendar, music, porn, location and passwords will be in OUR possession."

       That's painfully obvious. Offsite storage is incredibly useful and I think everyone should take that 15 free GB of storage Google Drive offers, just because it's so incredibly useful. But one thing it is NOT, is 'secure'. Do not treat it as such, assume it is just shy of being set to public access. You can be slightly, slightly, more confident if you are paying for corporate level offsite storage with complex legal agreement regarding data security, but in the end, always remember that this data is vulnerable and should be treated as such when you choose what to back up.

       In fairness, that's been the methodology of many things since the internet was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get anywhere on the internet requires going through other people's machines (routers) and it was only in the recent years of the internet (past decade maybe slightly more) that encrypting data in transit became the norm for non security minded applications.  At any point in time those places could steal, or alter data in some manner. (This is why SSL makes such a huge deal about certs being signed and matching the end host.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, email used to be stored on someone's machine until you downloaded it via pop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Storing data on the internet is nothing new.  It being marketed to the masses in a marketable buzz word is what is new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course yes there are always security risks the minute you have data outside of the machine you own, but it's important to remember that has always been the case.

       I work in tech on the west coast. Not a brogrammer, but definitely not an innocent bystander. Getting my little slice of the decadence. A lot of people at these tech companies at all levels are stoned to the gills all the time (hard to cope with this madness otherwise). A lot of what people are getting paid for is pipe dreams with easy ZIRP money thrown at them.

       Most people I talk to, even tech oriented people, think "cloud software" and then immediately think "that's too big for my comprehension." They say things like "I really need to learn cloud software" or "what exactly does cloud mean?" If there was an Orwellian attempt to confuse people away from understanding it, it's working.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have worked with multiple cloud platforms and totally understand it. It's just a database that controls a web-based service, and the database is not owned by the customer. Most people understand remote data storage, like Dropbox or Google Drive, to be "cloud software." But it's really much bigger than that. All social media is technically cloud software. Netflix is cloud software. Email services like Gmail are cloud software. Salesforce is cloud software.

       On one level, it's just marketing noise. One gig, IT director's technical skills were last updated in 1995, only skill was bullshitting the other execs and managers at that particular corporation who had no frame of reference for how backwards the systems were. Migrated some servers from the closet to VM's at a (shitty) datacenter that was literally down the street. Huge latency and multiple weekly outages. Never saw the actual SLA, though my job was to call them and bitch when that happened. Speaking to some managers (big part of my job was to keep their expectations consistently low), and he'd told them their apps were "in the cloud", i.e. now made of magic.

       Sure, I get that most people can't be expected to understand how the backend works or makes it possible, but I think on some level they have to realize that if the data is not stored on their phone, it has to be stored somewhere else.

       "On two occasions I have been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question." -- Charles Babbage

       So, maybe you're right.

       I first saw the term in documents about 6 years ago. We joked that you could replace the term "cloud" with "web services" and it all would look like stuff advertised a decade before. It was just a buzzword - one that management took to mean three things: Unlimited, simple, and free, much to everyone's dismay.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase "commoditize IT" has been bandied about forever because management can't stand the costs. The complexity never goes away, though - it just gets obfuscated.

       For the most part, those people don't understand the basics when it comes to computers because they own devices with streamlined, dumbed-down operating systems that make no mention of components, etc.  On your PC, Windows will at least mention your hard drive(s) and make you understand the basics of what they do.  It makes you decide where to put things when you install/download.  It makes you choose portions of programs to leave out or opt into.  On a phone, you go to an app store and tap an icon.  Every other decision is made for you and you learn nothing about the piece of tech in your hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dated a girl who was a phone-only net user.  She was otherwise quite intelligent, but as far as she knew, her iphone might as well be magic.  One funny thing in particular I remember is that she had heard the word "processor," but she didn't know what it was, what it did, or that her magical internet phone even had one.  I explained to her that her telephone was really a computer and the basics of how it worked.  It blew her mind.  She really never even made the connection of "smart phone = computer."
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the younger guys at work who have never had any experience with a PC are the same way.  They're handed something that does everything for them and the most common explanation you can get from them is "it just works."

       But many have found that understanding and knowledge are impediments to very exciting stories. If we want to make up very exciting stories, all your facts and knowledge just get in the way. Now, stop spoiling the fun by trying to "inform" and "educate" people.

       I always laugh when I hear someone talk about "the cloud" like your information is floating around in the sky, waiting patiently for you to access it.
      </p>

       When you think about the concept for what it is, it sounds stupid.  Why on earth would I want my personal information stored on some corporation's hard drive?!

       Local storage is certainly an option; however, as we amass TB's of photos and videos backups will become unbearable.  Using someone else's compute and storage isn't all bad under one condition.  Encrypt Everything!!!!!!!  GPG, veracrypt, SpiderOak, etc.

       Yeah we don't need those 10 megapixel photos, it's a lockstep marketing ploy to increase storage capacity needs. Get that 64GB iPhone instead of that useless 16GB one. People don't realize when they post a 10 megapixel photo to Facebook it's scaling it down to like 2 megapixels. MicroSD expansion slots are awesome and smartphone manufacturers are

       TrueCrypt went bottom up (I actually think it was compromised), and encryption is not a panacea.

       The Cloud is a term older than the Internet. It was used for the old telephone networks to indicate that it is not known (or relevant) which specific machines do which specific jobs (routing data packets according to dynamic routing tables). Voice has been digitized since the 70s. A cloud was drawn on diagrams to indicate the dynamic, amorphous, and ultimately irrelevant set of specific steps taken to route the conversation. Those who have used Visio for decades have been used to the Cloud icon for many many years.

       The Cloud is an all-encompassing term. Yes, it means the file is stored on another computer. This isn't always a bad thing, but can be if the government tells DropBox to let them see inside your account. However, the real promise of the Cloud is decentralized and distributed, so your one file is stored, partially, on multiple computers in a way that can't be accessed by a central controlling "authority." Examples are Maidsafe and Storj.

       If corporations wanted to, they could make apps that are both secure and accessible with security audited open-source clients performing end-to-end encryption. They have zero incentive for that, ample incentive not to:

       So let's say you have half of your evil files saved on your computer and the other half is on a "cloud". If the man wanted to find these files, they could either backdoor into your personal computer or find your files on a cloud. On your personal computer they would just have to have your address to find what IP address is associated with it from your service provider. They they scan that subnet for mac addresses until they find your computer. A ten year old hacker could do it pretty easily. To get to the info on the cloud will take a lot more steps and when they finally find it, it will be encrypted. They would really want to find that info

       I feel pretty safe putting my evil cat pictures on the " cloud".

       Not really possible. Facebook gathers data about users that don't have a profile by accumulating tidbits from their friends; this is the infamous
       <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/">
        shadow profile
       </a>
       . Even if you stay completely offline and don't upload anything, you will have a fairly accurate trail of information following you wherever you go because the dumb family/friends use social networks and just leave the default privacy options on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when I bought my Android smartphone, it immediately asked me to log into my Google account. I tapped "Deny" because I thought it would be funny to do that. It turns out my phone couldn't connect to any network and was basically useless until I found the option to force the prompt to reappear and actually logged in with a valid Google account.

       Guys, no.

       The cloud means your information can and probably will be separated into many parts and stored piecemeal on many different computers (owned by someone else), each specialized to store that kind of data.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is different from before when your information would be stored on one large computer owned by someone else. That was just called the Internet.

       That said, go ahead and encrypt anything like normal and put it up there.  They might be able to get the file but they still can't decrypt.
