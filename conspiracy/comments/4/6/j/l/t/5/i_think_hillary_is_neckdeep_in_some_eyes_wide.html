       Would love to hear more info from you guys about her involvement in these kinds of fucked up nefarious activities.  Check out this totally contrived and fake moment that she tweeted.  The child doesn't look comfortable having that monster so close

       EDIT: She helped intimidate and discredit victims of Bill's abuse, and Bill is really good friends with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein. Hillary goes on vacation with war criminal Henry Kissinger. Bill Clinton is accused of helping the Bush Sr administration with trafficking cocaine through the Mena Arkansas airport. The Clintons are career politicians who have somehow become multimillionaires after decades of "public service." I personally believe that elite child abuse is rampant, and there are many good reasons to think that the Clintons have status within powerful elite circles. How is Hillary still a serious candidate, one that the media bends over backwards to praise and defend, after all the countless scandals she has been involved in? People are afraid of this witch, and for good reason

       Not surprising, looks fake. What I cannot understand is that her sheep twitter followers think that this is a "genuine moment." As far as her being involved in more fucked up shit, nothing surprises me about her. I read on here a while back that when she was a lawyer she defended somebody who raped an underaged girl or something.  At this point, placing the blame on her for anything else would be like overflowing a trash can.  She has been blamed for war crimes, lying, and murder and she is STILL going to be the democratic nominee because people are too stupid to look some shit up online.  You should see some of the people in the south, they absolutely love this heinous bitch.  Vote for Jill Stein if you want a woman president, not this abhorrent evil whore of Israel.

       There's defense, and there's going to the ends of the Earth (literally, to Brooklyn from Fayetteville, AR to get a Nobel-associated forensics guy to agree to testify for her after the crime lab dun goofed) to fight for the client (an indigent for whom she was a replacement for a public defender) and being so laissez-faire and laughing about it. The case is worth looking into, I still can't figure out how/why she went to the extreme effort she did. (I suspect "his family had a farm in Green Forest and he didn't want to work the land" might have something to do with it, but that's just a wild guess.)

        this story
       </a>
       is a good summary and has a video of her discussing the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm kind of fascinated by the horrific thing, because I can't figure it out, why she worked so hard to get this guy off (he was up for 30 years for violently raping a 12-year-old girl - she still can't have children - and she pled him down to time served after two months. She also smeared the child, saying she liked older men and came from the wrong side of the tracks. Just weird. The rapist died in 1992, the year Bill became President).

       Even the devil deserves legal representation.

       William Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sir Thomas More: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?

      <p>
       William Roper: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sir Thomas More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!

       Thanks for that, asshole. I actually scored in the 99th percentile on the Law School Admission Test, so I know more about logical fallacies than you do. I never claimed that Hillary is definitely involved in child abuse rings. I said that I suspect that to be the case. If that sounds absurd to you, you should read up on the Finders cult, the Franklin Scandal, Jimmy Savile, and Dennis Hastert.

       You are correct that my performance on the LSAT does not, by itself, prove that I know more about logic than you do.  But speaking of links, YOU should watch the documentary Conspiracy of Silence and read this
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3">
        famous reddit post
       </a>
       that reveals how elites have repeatedly covered up for each other to get away with child abuse.  Also, the Thatcher administration was

       .  I don't want to get into a pointless pissing contest with someone on reddit.  In fact, the point of this sub is to try to uncover the truth.  Beware when you check out the links, because the truth is hard to stomach

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Speaking at a press conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the former secretary of state and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination said that deporting the children, many of whom are seeking asylum, would send a “responsible message” that would deter Central American families from sending their children to the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Specifically with respect to children on the border, if you remember, we had an emergency, and it was very important to send a message to families in Central America: Do not let your children take this very dangerous journey,” Clinton said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that the border crisis has largely passed, however, Clinton said U.S. immigration authorities should focus on expediting the deportation cases of children and people locked in family detention.

       Sorry, I was lazy and didn't watch more than 10 seconds of the video - I should have clarified that I thought the tweet wording was creepy. :) And yep, I don't see how she can make a promise like that given her previous treatment of the subject; she's been a real heartless hawk on immigration, actually less compassionate than some Republicans.

       I can assure the she who is referred to by FRIENDS as "The iron dragon lady" is indeed a ritual abuser of children. As per Gennifer FLowers Bill said "Hillaries eaten more pussy than have" sadly, seldomly with adults. Not just her, the majority of those you would call "the powers that be" are practicing occultists. Theres a lot of info here:

       Based on reddits collective inability to think objectively about Hillary Clinton, I entirely expect this to be on the frontpage in no time.

       Not at all. She helped intimidate and discredit victims of Bill's abuse, and Bill is really good friends with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein. Hillary goes on vacation with war criminal Henry Kissinger.  Bill Clinton is accused of helping the Bush Sr administration with trafficking cocaine through the Mena Arkansas airport. The Clintons are career politicians who have somehow become multimillionaires after decades of "public service." I personally believe that elite child abuse is rampant, and there are many good reasons to think that the Clintons have status within powerful elite circles. How is Hillary still a serious candidate, one that the media bends over backwards to praise and defend, after all the countless scandals she has been involved in? People are afraid of this witch, and for good reason
