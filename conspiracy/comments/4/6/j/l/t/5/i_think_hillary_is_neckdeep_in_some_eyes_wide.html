<p>EDIT: She helped intimidate and discredit victims of Bill&#39;s abuse, and Bill is really good friends with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein. Hillary goes on vacation with war criminal Henry Kissinger. Bill Clinton is accused of helping the Bush Sr administration with trafficking cocaine through the Mena Arkansas airport. The Clintons are career politicians who have somehow become multimillionaires after decades of &quot;public service.&quot; I personally believe that elite child abuse is rampant, and there are many good reasons to think that the Clintons have status within powerful elite circles. How is Hillary still a serious candidate, one that the media bends over backwards to praise and defend, after all the countless scandals she has been involved in?

    <div class="md"><p>Not surprising, looks fake. What I cannot understand is that her sheep twitter followers think that this is a &quot;genuine moment.&quot; As far as her being involved in more fucked up shit, nothing surprises me about her. I read on here a while back that when she was a lawyer she defended somebody who raped an underaged girl or something.  At this point, placing the blame on her for anything else would be like overflowing a trash can.  She has been blamed for war crimes, lying, and murder and she is STILL going to be the democratic nominee because people are too stupid to look some shit up online.  You should see some of the people in the south, they absolutely love this heinous bitch.  Vote for Jill Stein if you want a woman president, not this abhorrent evil whore of Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s defense, and there&#39;s going to the ends of the Earth (literally, to Brooklyn from Fayetteville, AR to get a Nobel-associated forensics guy to agree to testify for her after the crime lab dun goofed) to fight for the client (an indigent for whom she was a replacement for a public defender) and being so laissez-faire and laughing about it. The case is worth looking into, I still can&#39;t figure out how/why she went to the extreme effort she did. (I suspect &quot;his family had a farm in Green Forest and he didn&#39;t want to work the land&quot; might have something to do with it, but that&#39;s just a wild guess.)</p>

<p>People hate The Daily Mail, but <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2658801/I-never-trusted-polygraph-Hillary-Clinton-LAUGHS-recalls-helped-suspected-child-rapist-walk-free-prosecution-lost-crucial-evidence.html">this story</a> is a good summary and has a video of her discussing the case. </p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of fascinated by the horrific thing, because I can&#39;t figure it out, why she worked so hard to get this guy off (he was up for 30 years for violently raping a 12-year-old girl - she still can&#39;t have children - and she pled him down to time served after two months. She also smeared the child, saying she liked older men and came from the wrong side of the tracks. Just weird. The rapist died in 1992, the year Bill became President).</p>

But speaking of links, YOU should watch the documentary Conspiracy of Silence and read this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3">famous reddit post</a> that reveals how elites have repeatedly covered up for each other to get away with child abuse.  Also, the Thatcher administration was <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/margaret-thatcher-personally-covered-up-3848836">infested with pedophiles</a>.

<p>Also, as per usual, completely disingenuous--as of August 20<del>16</del>15, she was <em>completely</em> gung-ho about deporting kids:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-child-migrants_us_55d4a5c5e4b055a6dab24c2f:">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-child-migrants_us_55d4a5c5e4b055a6dab24c2f:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking at a press conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the former secretary of state and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination said that deporting the children, many of whom are seeking asylum, would send a “responsible message” that would deter Central American families from sending their children to the United States.</p>

<p>“Specifically with respect to children on the border, if you remember, we had an emergency, and it was very important to send a message to families in Central America: Do not let your children take this very dangerous journey,” Clinton said.</p>

<p>Now that the border crisis has largely passed, however, Clinton said U.S. immigration authorities should focus on expediting the deportation cases of children and people locked in family detention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. She helped intimidate and discredit victims of Bill&#39;s abuse, and Bill is really good friends with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein. Hillary goes on vacation with war criminal Henry Kissinger.  Bill Clinton is accused of helping the Bush Sr administration with trafficking cocaine through the Mena Arkansas airport. The Clintons are career politicians who have somehow become multimillionaires after decades of &quot;public service.&quot; I personally believe that elite child abuse is rampant, and there are many good reasons to think that the Clintons have status within powerful elite circles. How is Hillary still a serious candidate, one that the media bends over backwards to praise and defend, after all the countless scandals she has been involved in? People are afraid of this witch, and for good reason </p>
