       <strong>
        Who Was The Killer Clown?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       John Wayne Gacy's father was an alcoholic who physically and emotionally abused him throughout his childhood. His mother and sisters testified to this in court, and Gacy acknowledged it himself. His father constantly belittled him, beat his mother and once actually shot his beloved dog. Despite it all, Gacy said in prison that he never raised a hand at his father because he loved him and all he stood for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtually nothing else is known about his childhood, but it seems to be distinctly possible that John Wayne Gacy was the product of trauma-based 'behavior modification' programs sponsored by U.S. intelligence agencies, which very often utilized controlled families for transgenerational experimentation. The secret services, for obvious reasons, like to
       <em>
        "keep it in the family"
       </em>
       and there are consequently untold numbers of families connected with the military industrial intelligence nexus who contain dark secrets of incest and severe physical and sexual traumas. Frequently appearing in this context are transgenerational satanic families involved in extremely horrific ritual abuse of the children their
       <em>
        "breeder"
       </em>
       families produce. A glance at the formation of all of these major occult-based orders reveals that they have always been fronts for clandestine U.S. intelligence operations. Among the purposes they serve is the spread of the
       <em>
        "senseless violence"
       </em>
       that creates fear and results in the expansion of police powers and the reduction of civil liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
       During his teenage years, Gacy spent time working at a mortuary and as an ambulance attendant.
       <em>
        "Blooding"
       </em>
       is a term used by the intelligence services and it refers to employing an asset in precisely such capacities so as to desensitize them to the horrific violence humans inflict on one another. If this was indeed his
       <em>
        "blooding"
       </em>
       then he would have been identified as a star candidate. He was reportedly sleeping in the embalming room with the corpses and was fired when some of them were found undressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the sixties, Gacy was living in Waterloo, Iowa, his
       <em>
        "blooding"
       </em>
       perhaps complete, and owned several businesses, including four restaurants, a clothing design firm and a motel.
       <strong>
        He became involved in the Junior Chamber of Commerce, known as "the Jaycees."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This chapter of the Jaycees was deeply involved in prostitution, pornography, illegal gambling and other criminal activities. Gaycee soon formed a close friendship with the president of the chapter, and he was appointed to manage Gacy's motel. The motel was, according to a local prosecutor, a front for a prostitution ring. Many young people of both sexes were employed at the motel, and a 'social club' equipped with stocks of drugs and alcohol was established in the basement. A great number of the guests at this motel were underage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Junior Chamber of Commerce is described as
       <em>
        a "leadership training and civic organization."
       </em>
       It was formed on January 21, 1920 in Hawaii, and members have included President Richard Nixon, President Gerald Ford, President Ronald Reagan, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Vice President Walter Mondale, Vice President Al Gore, Chief Justice Warren Burger, billionaire industrialist Howard Hughes, billionaire  Bill Gates, billionaire Tom Monaghan, and famed aviator and native fascist Charles Lindbergh. Wendell Ford, who served as President of the U.S. Jaycees, served as Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky from 1967 to 1971, as Governor of Kentucky from 1971 to 1974, and as a U.S. Senator from 1974 to 199, during the course of which he was Senate Majority Whip from 1991 to 1995 and Senate Minority Whip from 1995 to 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is being done only to show that Gacy's involvement with the Waterloo chapter of the Jaycees represents his connection with the underground networks of the power elite that are under examination here.
      </p>
      <p>
       By any rational estimation, the Jaycees are one of many Masonic societies operating ostensibly as a 'civic society.' Only males are permitted and its gatherings are all fraternal in nature. Many of their members are drawn from Masonic Lodges. Even the founder of the Junior Chamber, Henry Giessenbier, was a member of the Tuscan Lodge of the Masons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the prominent names in their membership roles are also men directly tied to the
       <em>
        "senseless violence"
       </em>
       occurring throughout the streets of our cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a field trip to Washington, D.C., future
       <em>
        "serial killer"
       </em>
       Jeffrey Dahmer told his friends that he could secure a trip to the White House. They naturally did not believe him, and were surprised when he made a phone call to someone who has never been identified before being allowed on a special tour of Vice President Walter Mondale's office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charles Lindbergh, whose father was a prominent U.S. Senator, came from an influential family that had emigrated from Sweden. There they had been
       <em>
        "the Manssons,"
       </em>
       and the change in name thus saved the aviator from being remembered as
       <em>
        "Charles Mansson."
       </em>
       That may have been much more appropriate, as all of the available evidence suggests that Lindbergh, a native fascist, murdered his son. The transparently staged
       <em>
        "abduction"
       </em>
       and murder were part of another choreographed violent tragedy, as was the show trial and execution of a poor immigrant framed for the crime. It should be noted that Lindbergh was an avid Freemason and painted Masonic symbols on the plane that he used for his famed transatlantic flight. That aircraft had been named
       <em>
        "the Spirit of St. Louis."
       </em>
       Another of his planes had been christened
       <em>
        "the Sirius."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is quite clear that Lindbergh was interested in the occult, and that his wife and doomed son were both born on summer solstices should not be ignored. His wife, Ann Morrow, was the daughter of his close friend Dwight Morrow - a partner of J.P. Morgan, one of the dominant forces within the U.S. Morrow served as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico - all such diplomatic posts really part of the intelligence community - and as the founder of the U.S. Army Air Forces. After his son's disappearance, Lindbergh formed a private
       <em>
        "investigation"
       </em>
       led by himself and a circle of intelligence-connected
       <em>
        "friends"
       </em>
       - including Morrow, Gen. William Donovan, and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. This privately-formed
       <em>
        "panel"
       </em>
       was clearly helping cover up the horrific truth behind the child murder, and the identities of its membership thus provide insight into the nature of the forces behind the
       <em>
        "senseless violence"
       </em>
       of the headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gen. Donovan helped found he Office of Strategic Services, the nation's premier intelligence service during the war, and afterward helped form the CIA. He also oversaw the development of many of the mind control programs, including the research into 'behavior modification' drugs and many of the hypnosis operations being conducted under the supervision of George Estabrooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gen. Schwarzkopf was the commander of the Pennsylvania State Police. Though it was ostensibly civilian, this police force - more than any in the country at the time - was modeled and operated as a military entity. It pioneered the extreme paramilitary and psychological warfare tactics that have been adopted by city police departments throughout the country. Schwazkopf's son, of course, was the general who commanded U.S. forces in the Gulf War - a bloody U.S. imperialist operation organized by
       <em>
        "serial killers"
       </em>
       much more prolific than the man of the hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gacy, like many
       <em>
        "serial killers,"
       </em>
       and like any intelligence operative, always carried a gun. Gacy, like many
       <em>
        "serial killers,"
       </em>
       and like a mind control handler, was said to
       <em>
        "control"
       </em>
       his wife and openly offer her sexual services to his friends and colleagues at the motel. Was she also the product of these 'behavior modification' programs and 'supplied' to Gacy? If Gacy himself was the product of trauma-based 'behavior modification' programs since his childhood, it all begins to make disturbing sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       On March 11, 1968, Donald Voorhees, Jr. gave a statement to the police in which he alleged that Gacy had assaulted and sodomized him. Voorhees' father was an Illinois state senator and also a Jaycee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangely, it was not until early May that Gacy was indicted by a grand jury, and even then no action was taken in the following months. On September 12, Gacy appeared in court and was ordered to submit to a
       <em>
        "psychiatric examination"
       </em>
       at
       <strong>
        the Psychopathic Hospital of the State University of Iowa.
       </strong>
       While there, he told investigators of rampant corruption among the Waterloo elite, and detailed activities such as wife swapping, pornography, gambling, prostitution, and the complicity of the local police. He named numerous prominent individuals involved in such criminal enterprises, including many police personnel and of course members of the Junior Chamber of Commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he was brought before court, Gacy entered a guilty plea. He was sentenced to ten years in prison on December 3, 1968, two days after the 22nd anniversary of Aleister Crowley's death. He was released on parole on June 18, 1970, less than two years into his sentence and shortly before the summer solstice, another major occult holiday.
      </p>
      <p>
       In prison, he was said to always have money, cigars and civilian shirts, all of which were highly difficult to obtain for most prisoners. Was he given special privileges because of his status as a subject in these ongoing mind control operations, or simply because of his local power and his connection to the Jaycees? While in custody, he was subjected to electroshock and aversion
       <em>
        "therapies"
       </em>
       allegedly aimed at
       <em>
        "curing"
       </em>
       him of his homosexuality. Such
       <em>
        "therapies"
       </em>
       were used in the mind control programs sponsored by the U.S. intelligence services, and many of these took place in prisons, universities and psychiatric institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight months after his release, Gacy was arrested again - this time for
       <em>
        "disorderly conduct."
       </em>
       Despite this parole violation, he was released from parole no more than eight months later. Another eight months later, on the summer solstice of 1972, he was arrested and charged with aggravated battery and reckless conduct. He had, according to the charges, offered a young man a ride on June 7, identifying himself as a police officer. He then attempted to handcuff the boy, who was able to struggle free. He clubbed him on the back of the neck, kicked him, and pursued him with his car, hitting him with the vehicle.
       <strong>
        For reasons that remain unknown, these charges were mysteriously dismissed. His fingerprint card on file with the local police carried the alias "Colonel Gacy."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very obvious that a pattern of protection existed around John Wayne Gacy. You or I would not be treated like he has been under the current legal system. The strange delays in action after his alleged rape of Donald Voorhees, Jr. are one indication of this, and the dismissal of these charges is another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still more evidence is in his extraordinarily early release from the rape conviction, and how he was released from parole even after being convicted of disorderly conduct eight months earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pattern of protection surrounds virtually all alleged
       <em>
        "serial killers"
       </em>
       and is evidence that the system needed them on the streets because they were programmed to commit
       <em>
        "senseless violence"
       </em>
       or to be credited with it so that other more prominent ghouls can escape identification.
      </p>
      <p>
       In July 1975, John Butkovitch disappeared. He was a teenage employee of Gacy's construction company, which specialized in drugstore remodels. Gacy had always had unexplained access to unlimited amounts of drugs, and enormous amounts of pharmaceuticals were later discovered in his home. There were rumours that Butkovitch had left for Puerto Rico to traffic drugs, and his family received a collect call from a woman in San Juan who claimed he was alive and well. It is evident that there was an effort to derail any missing person investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It remains possible that Butkovitch was in fact involved in the underground drug traffic. It also remains possible that this was why he was killed, and that the murder was perpetrated by someone else. He had been involved in an undefined
       <em>
        "disturbance"
       </em>
       at the home of a
       <em>
        "friend"
       </em>
       the night before his reported disappearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. intelligence services have always been the controllers of the drug trade. It allows them to accumulate enormous wealth - all of it completely
       <em>
        "off the books"
       </em>
       - while simultaneously fueling violence and chaos. They generated black funds for use in sponsoring the terrorist activities of their brutal conta armies in Nicaragua. They flew from Vietnam for international traffic using their private airline, Air America, and utilized one of Pepsi's bottling plants there as a laboratory for heroin production. The invasion of Afghanistan was largely about securing control of its vast repositories of precious metals and heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drug trade is well-connected with
       <em>
        "serial killings."
       </em>
       Many of the alleged killers and victims use drugs and/or are involved in drug sales. The U.S. military and intelligence services have long been using drugs in their illegal mind control programs. Is it not highly possible, then, that Butkovitch and other drug-related victims in murders connected to
       <em>
        "serial killers"
       </em>
       were murdered in the context of some kind of illegal program? Were they perhaps monitored and utilized as an unwitting, informal 'subject' ever since they first tuned in, turned on and dropped out?
      </p>
      <p>
       The states where
       <em>
        "serial killings"
       </em>
       seem to occur most frequently, and where many of the most famous
       <em>
        "serial killers"
       </em>
       have spent unexplained periods of their lives, are California, Texas and Florida. All three are the points through which virtually all of the illegal drug traffic enters the country through the southern border. All three are also rife with satanic cult activity. Two of the three have recently been under the control of the Bush family, and remain 'outposts' in their political network. Law enforcement officials have identified a
       <em>
        "pipeline"
       </em>
       linking the organized criminal elements of Chicago, Illinois and Texas through drug traffic. This might help to explain the rash of
       <em>
        "serial killings"
       </em>
       in Chicago, including those allegedly perpetrated by Gacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young men and boys continued to disappear in the years after Butkovitch went missing. Despite the parents' insistence that police investigate these disappearances, they were consistently classified as
       <em>
        "runaways."
       </em>
       It is unfortunately typical for elements of the local police act in concert with the dark forces we are confronting here. This occurs in virtually every such case, including the many pedophile scandals in the U.S. and the exposure of the child abuse rings in Belgium, Latvia, France, Italy, Russia, and Portugal, among many other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       On January 6, 1978, Gacy was arrested for deviate sexual contact. A twenty-seven-year-old man claimed that he had been picked up and then knocked unconscious with a rag placed over his mouth. He awoke in a park with burns on his face and a bleeding rectum. The assailant had picked him up from the city's gay district, where Gacy was frequently seen and generally believed to be a police officer. The victim recalled the license plate of Gacy's car, and so he was briefly taken into custody. Several court dates passed, however, and no  action whatsoever was taken against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gacy had served as the city's lighting commissioner and as chairman of local precinct of the Democratic Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was known to be on friendly terms with Illinois Attorney General William Scott, and claimed to serve as an aide to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. He claimed that Mike Rokyo, a local columnist, and Walter Jacobson, a local TV anchorman, were among his
       <em>
        "good friends."
       </em>
       He also claimed that he had worked for
       <em>
        "the Syndicate"
       </em>
       and that he was a cousin of local mob figure Tony Accardo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most impressively, he was photographed with First Lady Rosalynn Carter. He is wearing a lapel with credentials from the Secret Service, indicating that he received a special, high-level security clearance despite his history of violent crime. Furthermore, one of his prosecutors would later observe:
       <em>
        "Two items on [Gacy's] Chicago Police report were blacked out, indicating they were FBI matters."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       In Chicago, Gacy was still continually surrounded by young teenagers. He frequently entertained as a
       <strong>
        clown
       </strong>
       - an important symbol in the occult practices of Freemasonry - at hospitals, orphanages and at elite private parties. He hired many teenage boys to work for his construction firm, and three of them would disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can thus be observed that Gacy was a U.S. intelligence asset operating at a high level within the city's political establishment and within the Mafia, and was well-connected with prominent politicians, judicial officials and media personalities. All the while, he is involved with drug trafficking and underage prostitution. He was a living example of
       <em>
        "the Illuminati"
       </em>
       that is whispered about among youth in every city across our land.
      </p>
      <p>
       On December 11, 1978, teenager Rob Piest disappeared. He had last been seen at the pharmacy where he worked, and had been speaking to Gacy about the possibility of working for his construction firm. The Piest family did not simply identify Gacy as a suspect, but also pharmacy owner Phil Torf. He had been evasive when questioned about the appearance and had refused to provide them with Gacy's address. The night of the disappearance, he inexplicably remained at the pharmacy with never-identified
       <em>
        "friends"
       </em>
       until 1 AM - a full three hours past closing time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Piest family became increasingly frustrated with the inaction of the police, and began threatening to storm the Gacy home. Police moved to pacify them by forming an elite team - a 'Delta Unit' within the police department - to monitor Gacy's activities. Gacy ate and drank with the 'Delta Unit,' invited them into his home and even allowed one to ride along with him in his car.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was said that at times Gacy had virtually become a member of the surveillance team, and the activities of the 'Delta Unit' began to look more and more like a charade. He would recklessly tear through the streets at more than 100 miles per hour, sometimes in school zones and never with the slightest interference by the 'Delta Unit' or any other agency of law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police searched his home, which was said to be meticulously neat. A high school ring that had belonged to one of the missing boys was discovered, along with an Illinois drivers license issued to another boy, and a photo lab receipt that was later traced to Rob Piest. Also discovered were several items of clothing clearly too small for Gacy, and a switchblade knife, chloroform, police badges, handcuffs, marijuana, rolling papers, a hypodermic syringe, and large stockpiles of pharmaceutical drugs. One room in the home was almost completely filled with clown pictures - an eerie signal of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigators found that the crawlspace underneath the house, where some of his young employees had been instructed to dig trenches, was covered with a layer of lime - effective at hastening the decomposition of bodies. Nearly thirty were buried there, and more had been dumped into the DesPlaines River sixty-five miles from his home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police inexplicably did not arrest Gacy after the first search. This was despite the incriminating evidence found in the home, his history of violent sexual crime, his connection to several of the missing young men, the charges pending against him from earlier in the year, and the complaints against him from five different victims - two in DesPlaines and three - in Chicago - who described being drugged and tortured by Gacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the reasons for this delay, it is safe to assume it would not have happened if any of us had been arrested under such circumstances. On the eve of the winter solstice, however, Gacy was arrested again and for the final time -
       <strong>
        <em>
         for marijuana possession.
        </em>
       </strong>
       The possession arrest led to a second search of his home, and during this search bodies were discovered under his crawlspace. Every corner of the house was said to smell of death, and it has never been explained why neither police who searched his home the first time or the surveillance team who made numerous visits to his home failed to act on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the second search of his home, Gacy was taken to Holy Family Hospital for a
       <em>
        "medical examination"
       </em>
       - ostensibly due to his complaints of chest pains. Such
       <em>
        "examinations"
       </em>
       can easily be used as a cover for programming, and it is likely that this was a key interval during which time they would want to adjust his.
       <strong>
        Immediately following his release from the hospital, Gacy read and signed a waiver of his Miranda Rights and proceeded to confess to the murders.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The day before his arrest, the conviction of
       <strong>
        Elmer Wayne Henley
       </strong>
       in
       <strong>
        Texas
       </strong>
       had been reversed. Only a few years earlier in 1974 he was convicted for participating in what one of Gacy's biographers termed
       <em>
        "a homosexual torture ring that killed twenty-seven boys."
       </em>
       In Houston, Henley and two accomplices lured young boys to the home of Dean Corll, where they were raped, tortured and murdered on a special
       <em>
        "torture board"
       </em>
       in Corll's plastic-draped bedroom. Their bodies were then buried beneath a layer of lime in a boathouse rented by Corll, and the parents of several of the victims received mysterious phone calls or letters from people claiming that their sons were alive and well. In both Houston and Chicago, police consistently classified the missing boys as
       <em>
        "runaways"
       </em>
       and conducted no investigation despite the insistence of the parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his confession, Gacy indicated that others were involved in the murders. One of his first questions to police was:
       <em>
        "Who else do you have in station? There were others involved."
       </em>
       When investigators asked him if these other parties were involved directly or indirectly, he replied:
       <em>
        "Directly. They participated."
       </em>
       Asked who these other parties were, he replied:
       <em>
        "My associates."
       </em>
       Asked the location of the body of Rob Piest, which was not found at the home, he replied:
       <em>
        "I don't know. I didn't transport him."
       </em>
       When asked who did, he said:
       <em>
        "I can't say."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This interrogation is soon cut short by a
       <em>
        "Sergeant Long"
       </em>
       and resumes with two attorneys at Gacy's side. Nothing more is said about the involvement of other parties in the murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, the homicide rate in Chicago skyrocketed after Gacy's arrest. And a week after Gacy's arrest, on December 28, a fresh body was recovered from the DesPlaines River. Were people connected with the mysterious case being eliminated?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are glaring inconsistencies in Gacy's confession. He claims that all of the victims were strangled when in fact forensics evidence suggested that at least thirteen were suffocated. The map of the bodies under his home that he provided to police and that was touted by the press as being accurate actually had a number of discrepancies. He had no memory of twenty-eight of the murders, and sketchy memories of only five. He claimed that the murders began in January 1974, but then said that the first had occurred in January 1972. He attributed all of the murders to
       <em>
        "Jack Hanley,"
       </em>
       an alter personality - precisely the objective of the modern trauma-based mind control programs of the U.S. intelligence services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gacy was denied bail and was kept isolated from other inmates at the local jail's medical wing. Personnel at the jail were to have no social contact with him either. Soon after he was placed there, he wrote:
       <em>
        "Since the dark shadow of Satan has come over me, it seems that my fair weather friends have run away."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       During his second week at the jail's medical wing, he consented to a media interview in which he once again confessed to the murders -
       <em>
        with the full cooperation of his attorney.
       </em>
       He ridiculously claimed that many of the victims were male prostitutes with whom he had disagreements on price, and explained how he was able to subdue the young, healthy victims with a dubious story about a
       <em>
        "handcuff trick."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       On January 10, 1979, "not guilty" pleas were entered for Gacy in connection with the seven murders he was charged with. On April 23, a grand jury indicted him on 26 additional counts of murder and thus making the official number of victims
       <strong>
        <em>
         33
        </em>
       </strong>
       . Two days later, Gacy entered "not guilty" pleas to these additional counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In January 1980, jury selection began and despite the intense pre-trial publicity in the local press - overshadowed for awhile by coverage of the massacre at Jonestown - the venue was not changed. Instead, jurors were selected from another county and sequestered. Amazingly, the jury selection process was over in only four days.
      </p>
      <p>
       On February 6, 1980, the trial began. Following open statements, the state called sixty witnesses to testify against Gacy. The defense presented their case
       <em>
        in less than a week.
       </em>
       Gacy was unhappy with his defense team, and sent a letter to the judge that read:
       <em>
        "I asked that my trial be stopped and I haven't heard from you. I asked my attorney why we are not putting on more witnesses, I am told that we don't have money to bring in experts."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       On February 29, the state began its rebuttal of the defense's abbreviated presentation and because of a number of glaring
       <em>
        "mistakes"
       </em>
       they made, the state was allowed to call a number of witnesses whose testimonies had earlier been excluded and who had survived being abducted, drugged and tortured by Gacy. One of them had met with police and the assistant state's attorney shortly after he filed his complaint. He was not allowed to sign a statement against Gacy at the meeting, and was bluntly told that no action would be taken. All of the survivors described Gacy as the sole perpetrator of the offenses, but it remains unexplained as to why the
       <em>
        "serial killer"
       </em>
       freed all of them after subduing and abusing them. Could it be that Gacy was unable to kill alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       The state's last rebuttal witness was a man named James Hanley, whose name they claimed Gacy appropriated for his 'alter personality.' Why had he surfaced so late in the trial? The prosecution claimed that they
       <em>
        "had investigators looking for Hanley for more than a year, but somehow the police computer didn't turn up his name."
       </em>
       It remains unexplained how this could have been possible, since James Hanley had been a plain-clothes detective with Chicago Police Department since the late sixties.
      </p>
      <p>
       After less than two hours of deliberation, the jury delivered a guilty verdict on all thirty-three counts of murder and following only two more hours of deliberation after the sentencing phase, they unanimously elected to impose the death sentence on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In prison, Gacy took up painting and produced many pictures of clowns and of Disney figures. He once said:
       <em>
        "Walt Disney is a mentor to me."
       </em>
       Many
       <em>
        "serial killers"
       </em>
       consider themselves artists, including painters, poets, writers and musicians. Many also have a strange interest in Disney, which is a massive front for mind control operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a wealth of evidence indicating that multiple persons were involved in the murders, and that police were complicit in these operations. Gacy was not questioned for
       <strong>
        <em>
         a full three months
        </em>
       </strong>
       after the disappearance of Gregory Godzik, one of his teenage employees. Godzik's parents had given his name to the authorities a number of times and were growing frustrated. They turned to prominent private investigator Anthony Pellicano, Jr. - a man with a very shadowy background who engaged in a variety of illegal surveillance operations for members of the Hollywood elite.
       <strong>
        Pellicano never checked out Gacy either and later ludicrously claimed that they had never given him his name, and that his parents had told him that he worked at a gas station.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Godzik was seen
       <em>
        alive and well
       </em>
       after the time of his reported abduction, as was another of the victims, John Szyc, who was also one of Gacy's teenage employees. The home of the Godzik family was mysteriously burglarized on the night before news of Gacy's arrest was broadcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       The family of Rick Johnston, another of the victims, believed he had been taken by the Unification Church, a religious cult with high-level political and media connections headed by Rev. Sun Myung-Moon. The group is steeped in mind control operations and has extensive ties to the U.S. intelligence services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another of the victims, John Mowery, had served in the U.S. Marines. His sister had been found stabbed to death in her apartment in November 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if Gacy, though a violent pedophile, was unable to kill alone? What if others really were involved and his home was simply one of several convenient disposal sites for some kind of cult or similar criminal network with which he was connected? If so, did this network receive support from the U.S. intelligence services like it received support from the city police services? In another of his letters to the judge, Gacy wrote:
       <em>
        "As you know, other than the so-called statements made by me, and given in a self-serving manner by officers of the prosecution, there is only evidence that I owned the house that was used for the [bodies], their safekeeping."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of people had lived in Gacy's home for varying periods of time or regularly spent time there, and at least six people were known to possess keys to the home. All denied any knowledge of the murders and of the source of the smell in the home. One of Gacy's longtime employees was identified only by the pseudonym
       <em>
        "Dick Walsh,"
       </em>
       and was said to have occasionally been entertained at Gacy's home. He was said to be evasive under questioning. He was given a polygraph examination, but the examiners were
       <em>
        "unable to render a definite opinion."
       </em>
       There is no evidence that this suspect was investigated further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another of Gacy's employees was Gordon Nebel, who was reportedly employed as the company's bookkeeper. He was, strangely enough,
       <strong>
        <em>
         misidentified
        </em>
       </strong>
       in the surveillance logs taken by officers who were well aware of who he was and of the fact that he worked in the home two days of every week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two of Gacy's associates, Donald Morrill and Ronald Rohde, protected and shielded him from police during the surveillance opeations of the 'Delta Unit'. Neither were investigated in connection with the crimes, nor were a number of names in Gacy's address book inexplicably marked
       <em>
        "H."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       On May 10, 1994, Gacy was executed in Illinois.

       <p>
        In a 1992 interview with CBS Chicago, Gacy claimed he had accomplices, and blamed some of the murders on employees from his P.D.M. Construction company who he said often stayed at his house.

       No they're not. Pointing out that a group has fraternal elements or even that one or more of its founders may have been Masons doesn't make it "Masonic." There are dozens of adult Fraternities out there, many of which have had Masons and members, even founders. The only one that's Masonic is Freemasonry.

        No they're not. Pointing out that a group has fraternal elements or even that one or more of its founders may have been Masons doesn't make it "Masonic." There are dozens of adult Fraternities out there, many of which have had Masons and members, even founders. The only one that's Masonic is Freemasonry.

       This is like saying that a front for the CIA has no relationship with the CIA. There are many 'clandestine' lodges and also bodies that are not officially a part of Freemasonry but well-understood to be appendage groups.

       Here is the biography of one of the most senior Jaycee leaders in Virginia:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brother Litten has also been very active in the community.  Within Patrick County, he is a Past President of the Unit of the American Heart Association, Patrick County Jaycees, and Charter President of the Patrick County High School Band Boosters Club.  He is a Life Member in the Virginia Jaycees and Past President of the Life Membership Council, a Jaycee International Senator, and United States Jaycee Ambassador.  He has been recognized by the Stuart Rotary Club and Virginia Jaycees as a recipient of the Distinguished Service Award and by Epsilon Sigma Phi, the National Honorary Extension Fraternity, Virginia Tech, as a recipient of the Outstanding Public Service Award.

       As you can see, Litten is now the

       in Virginia. Relationships like these recur frequently in the study of these fraternal bodies. The

       Mysterious murders have been known to occur at this college and some remain unsolved.

It is close to Butt Mountain, where Cathy O'Brien had said a secret base some of them still unsolved.

       Freemasonry is certainly an occult-based group, and it is actually a well-known fact that Lindbergh was interested in the occult. Professor Donald Gibson of the University of Pittsburgh

       <p>
        From 1906 to 1939, and on an emeritus basis afterward, [Alexis] Carrell was on the staff at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He co-authored a 1938 book with Charles Lindbergh after Lindbergh had become fascinated with the occult and conservationism. Lindbergh claimed that it was Carrell who got him interested in the occult.

       The earlier page contains a disturbing paragraph written by Carrell in which the rabid eugenicist openly advocates the extermination of the

       According to Greg Ahlgren and Stephen Monier in

       </em>
       , Carrell was

       certainly was. Say, isn't Sirius the Blazing Star in Freemasonry as well?

       It is because Freemasonry is an occult-based secret society that played a key role in the creation of America, and it has remained closely tied to the national intelligence services ever since. I believe it is a key element of the dark forces being confronted in this analysis. You'll find that

        numbers and symbols

       of Freemasonry are a constant backdrop in this area.
