       Trump has spent a negligible amount on his campaign.

       Why is it so hard for people to beleive that americans are supporting someone who for once says he will put americans first over international companies and over illegal immigrants and who speaks put ahainst the main stream media and politicians that take money from lobbists?  He is what everyone has been hoping to hear. Of course his support is real. We can onlyy hope that he is really doing ot for the reasons he says and i dont think anyone cpuld be such a good actor as to fake it on so many interviews without a script.

       I just hope the  establishment doesnt hurt him. My bifgest fear is thestablishment takes him out like Kennedy (s).

       I think you have confused Trump with Hillary. Trump resonates with people by not being intimidated by the liberal PC crowd and not showing fealty to the Republican leadership.

       He only spent 200k on ads in NH, Jeb bush spent over 37 million. Trump won by a landslide there. People like him, they are tired of the PC crap and trump want's to bring jobs back and people agree with him on immigration. He's winning big.

       Political elite get to bribe the newsmedia elite (which are ironically owned by the same corporations) and it's all just money laundering/legalized bribery.

      <p>
       So, inevitably:
      </p>
      <p>
       The political elite bribe the newsmedia elite to report how they want to report and then sell the proles and plebs narratives that somehow twist reality into a place where the federal government reading and cataloguing all of your electronic, voice, and any other communication (including this) is inherently

       I'm not so sure. Hillary won more decisively in Nevada last time around, and as much as I distrust polling, I do feel that they show a real trend nationwide that Hillary's lead is shrinking.

       Money is necessary to get your foot in the door, but I disagree with your conclusion.

       Trump is staying in the limelight because he's good at it, not because he's bribing anyone.

       I don't believe a candidate has ever called one of his opponents ugly during a debate on national television.  That was probably a first.

       I was actually going to do a post saying just the opposite..that Trump proves it is the message people vote for and if you have the right message all the other guys money doesnt matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has spent almost no money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this emboldens a lot of other people to run for office on his message  and be bold.  Youdont have to have money.  The internet gives you a voice.

       Trump began to do very well ealry on long before he got mainstream medoa coverage. That was because people could find out what he stood for on tue internet immediately.  The paid for media is becoming more and more irrelevent in modern elections. It seems to only matter still for old voters.

       His outrageous statements are deliberate and why he keeps dominating the press. The media is trying SO hard to just ignore him, but they can't help themselves. Most beautiful thing I've seen in  my lifetime.

       He does alienate minorities, its the majority that votes for him.  He's popular because he's not PC, people are tired of the PC nonsense and are supporting him as a form of backlash.  But as popular as he is, he's unelectable.  He'll prove something, all right, he'll be pushed out and will prove that what the people believe to be a democracy, is indeed an oligarchy.

       Political elite get to bribe the newsmedia elite (which are ironically owned by the same corporations) and it's all just money laundering/legalized bribery.

       The political elite bribe the newsmedia elite to report how they want to report and then sell the proles and plebs narratives that somehow twist reality into a place where the federal government reading and cataloguing all of your electronic, voice, and any other communication (including this) is inherently

       All while the lawmakers continue to pass legislation that was paid attention to before (remember when reedit blacked itself out to stop SOPA/PIPA/CISPA? Well they got CISA in the NDAA this year and nobody gave a shit because they all got

       It's all different, even now - compared to just two years ago when I got into this strange arena. And I feel like I'm doing a terrible job.

       Because it is a racket. And I'm watching it happen.
