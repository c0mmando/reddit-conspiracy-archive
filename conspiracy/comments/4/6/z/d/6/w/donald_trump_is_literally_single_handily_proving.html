    <div class="md"><p>Thats not happening.</p>

<p>Of anyone would be payingg for delegates it would have been insiders lime bush with his 100 million becuase the delegates are mostly insiders.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard for people to beleive that americans are supporting someone who for once says he will put americans first over international companies and over illegal immigrants and who speaks put ahainst the main stream media and politicians that take money from lobbists?  He is what everyone has been hoping to hear. Of course his support is real. We can onlyy hope that he is really doing ot for the reasons he says and i dont think anyone cpuld be such a good actor as to fake it on so many interviews without a script.</p>

<p>I just hope the  establishment doesnt hurt him. My bifgest fear is thestablishment takes him out like Kennedy (s).</p>

<p>Political elite get to bribe the newsmedia elite (which are ironically owned by the same corporations) and it&#39;s all just money laundering/legalized bribery.</p>

<p>So, inevitably:</p>

<p>The political elite bribe the newsmedia elite to report how they want to report and then sell the proles and plebs narratives that somehow twist reality into a place where the federal government reading and cataloguing all of your electronic, voice, and any other communication (including this) is inherently <em>a good idea because terrorism</em>.</p>

<p>All while the lawmakers continue to pass legislation that was paid attention to before (remember when reedit blacked itself out to stop SOPA/PIPA/CISPA? Well they got CISA in the NDAA this year and nobody gave a shit because they all got <em>paid to store all this juicy metadeta</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all different, even now - compared to just two years ago when I got into this strange arena. And I feel like I&#39;m doing a terrible job.</p>

<p>Because it is a racket. And I&#39;m watching it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually going to do a post saying just the opposite..that Trump proves it is the message people vote for and if you have the right message all the other guys money doesnt matter.</p>

<p>Trump has spent almost no money.</p>

<p>I hope this emboldens a lot of other people to run for office on his message  and be bold.  Youdont have to have money.  The internet gives you a voice.</p>

<p>I looked atpolling.</p>

<p>Trump began to do very well ealry on long before he got mainstream medoa coverage. That was because people could find out what he stood for on tue internet immediately.  The paid for media is becoming more and more irrelevent in modern elections. It seems to only matter still for old voters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the best ones.</p>

<p>Political elite get to bribe the newsmedia elite (which are ironically owned by the same corporations) and it&#39;s all just money laundering/legalized bribery.</p>

<p>So, inevitably:</p>

<p>The political elite bribe the newsmedia elite to report how they want to report and then sell the proles and plebs narratives that somehow twist reality into a place where the federal government reading and cataloguing all of your electronic, voice, and any other communication (including this) is inherently <em>a good idea because terrorism</em>.</p>

<p>All while the lawmakers continue to pass legislation that was paid attention to before (remember when reedit blacked itself out to stop SOPA/PIPA/CISPA? Well they got CISA in the NDAA this year and nobody gave a shit because they all got <em>paid to store all this juicy metadeta</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all different, even now - compared to just two years ago when I got into this strange arena. And I feel like I&#39;m doing a terrible job.</p>

<p>Because it is a racket. And I&#39;m watching it happen.</p>
