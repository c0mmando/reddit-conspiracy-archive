       There is no litmus test. The more nuanced disinfo agents (the ones we actually have to worry about) will deceive and align themselves with consensus beliefs to gain credibility, and then later on they start to drop bits of misinfo/disinfo intermingled with truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're reading too much into the cartoonist thing. There is a whole list of valid reasons I could come up with why someone wouldn't want to admit that publicly. We live in a hypersensitive culture, how is he going to continue producing political cartoons when he says the wrong thing and is labeled 'conspiracy nut 9/11 truther' and ostracized by the whole industry?

       This is the 4th time you've posted about this AMA in the last 24 hours. Why are you so concerned with what some cartoonist thinks? He came, he answered some questions, some people urged him to look at some other information regarding 9-11, he said he would, and he left.

       From an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       AMA:
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a front page "sticky" for a few days. The cartoonist parrots the Official CONspiracy Theory of 9-11-01.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few users called him out and the "sticky" came down relatively fast for an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       AMA. Hope that helps.

       Why can't an AMA include someone who reinforces what we already know?  That a crime that was committed?

       Also, can you comment on the OP's claim that he was banned for this post?

       OK, no prob.  What about the "asking for a litmus test" is a dramatic?  I've used and said that WTC7 is a litmus test of sorts.  It does fit.  Funny thing, I would normally call out a user of 11 days as a potential troll account, but he has a point and asks for other examples that shed light on 9/11.  I'm not sure that fits the usual profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not sure that banning him because he disagree's with the cartoonist is justifiable.  He makes a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the rules we have on the sidebar, which one did he break?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this doesn't appear like I'm going to bat for him or being argumentative.  From an outside perspective, this looks kinda like you're abusing power because he's being "dramatic", and or just disagree with his opposing view.  Like, it's fine to have AMA's of different people and different views, but it should also be OK with saying that you disagree with those views.  If WTC7 came down via demolition, the chances are nil that 1 and 2 came down from something else right?

       Ah but he isn't merely disagreeing with the cartoonist.  He is disagreeing with the cartoonist even being  allowed to speak here because he doesn't subscribe to the inside job theory.  And furthermore he is implying that the mods are by association of inviting the AMA also "disinformation specialists".  And he is obsessively doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like he got banned after the first post he made to this effect, or even the second one.  Nope he was banned after 3 obsessive posts implying that because we had an AMA guest who has a different belief that we are plotting to misinform the users here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough was enough, at this point he is just trying to spawn drama because we won't officially endorse one conspiracy theory over another.  That has been his goal for the last 8 accounts of his banned here.  That we endorse ae911truth and label anyone else with alternative theories as " disinformation specialists ".

       It's an absurdly selfish mission.

       I think I just answered my own question, but let me ask a couple more.  Can you confirm that r/conspiracy is about allowing any and all views/theories regardless of their claims/evidence/fantastical nature?  Is that the goal here?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, do you not agree that it is ripe for potential abuse of the users by providing such a mixed bag that we end up providing no real focus but end up with a slurry of information that one could get lost in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take this as any sort of attack, I simply want to be clear.  Can you give a stated goal of this sub?  Is it intended to be so broad and thus left to other subs like 911truth to be more specific?  Do you think that people who are here looking for more specificity on topics like 9/11, can potentially attack you or the sub because they don't understand that the ultimate goal of the sub is not to be specific, but more of a way to "entertain" anything and everything that could be termed a conspiracy?

       You nailed it man. I don't need to retype what you stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's frame it a different way, some people in the conspiracy community have their pet theories that they feel very strongly about.  So much so, that they proselytise and campaign for their theory of choice to take a front row seat or have preferred placement among all other theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that were to be granted, it wouldn't stop there.  They would then immediately demand that these other theories be banned outright.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has 350,000 subs and 1000 blinking eyeballs at any given moment.  What these people want, is a flashing banner ad that constantly pokes all the eyeballs and reminds them daily that WTC7 fell on 9-11.  The problem with that, is that nothing else gets any attention.  And then if we let the "bullies" run around and sabotage any discussion that isn't wtc7 fell! Soon there is nothing else because the community has become something that doesn't reward people for discussing new ideas.  It actually punishes them for it.  In the end you're left with the 14 people responsible for that mess sitting in here circle jerking each other about building 7, while the audience they fought so hard to "control" no longer visits because it's become uninteresting and mundane.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people don't accept that other theories deserve a little time and they won't accept it.  And /conspiracy is absolutely about all these various ideas and isms and events.  Obviously we draw a line somewhere, we don't want people turning conspiracy into "what is the most ridiculous thing I can post" with an image of triangles superimposed over whatever picture relates to current events.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a big generic sub like conspiracy should be big and generic.  It should welcome a broad variety of topics and a multitude of alternative opinions on those topics.  We absolutely don't shun discussion about 9-11-2001 here and we sure as shit shouldn't shun everything else just to force more attention on 9-11-2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to take a poke at my age because my previous answer didn't satisfy you then that's your duty I suppose.  We both know based on your comment that you get it.  You even opened with "I'm probably answering my own question" because the deal here is so obvious...  We have a group of users that want
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be a billboard for ae911.  We would much rather conspiracy continue to be conspiracy, like it always has been.  They aren't happy about that so they are going to witch hunt mods and spam up any AMAs we host like little evil AE911 interrogators.  To generally make it as unpleasant as possible for anyone to talk about anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it, the cartoonist Ted Rall wasn't even here to talk about 9-11. He probably wouldn't have said anything about it if the people I'm talking about hadn't instantly showed up to an AMA they aren't even interested in, and started interrogating him about his beliefs on 9-11.  It's pretty low brow if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There, now you have a long drawn out answer that is probably more satisfactory!

       They should be as you've stated.  All should be allowed.  I would never want to be the one to not allow something.  Though, its a good thing its not up to me, because I have one thing I wouldn't allow, but only not allowed in conspiracy.  The flat earth issue.  I just don't believe its a conspiracy, more of a belief.  I'm not advocating for a total ban at all, I just believe something like that needs its own outlet/sub.  I think it does more damage than it does actually inform people, but what do I know....
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I did waste your time.  I advocate for people to think things through and that's exactly what I didn't do in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond all of that, its my hope that one day r/conspiracy can go back to the realm of dealing with entertaining things like spontaneous combustion or something, not dealing with real world crimes.  Too many emotions and personal preferences come into play.  That's why you probably have a shittier job than it needs to be.  I hate to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if i were to relegate myself to the 911truth sub only, it's size will ensure relevant info stays neatly tucked away from the majority of people's view.  r/conspiracy has more exposure, good or bad and thus......I think real world issues need to be pushed as much as possible.  OK that's enough about me, take it easy out there.

       Flat earth bores me to tears for many reasons.  It just doesn't seem possible.  I watched several videos and read many posts on it  and I just don't find it very plausible.

      <p>
       Hollow earth is more interesting to me but still seems implausible.

       I find room on my plate for things that simply entertain me, and things that make me want to be more serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a problem with serious issues having stage time at /conspiracy, and I don't have an issue with entertainment having stage time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like spontaneous combustion are perfectly fine, they probably don't get as much time because they don't change or evolve.  But you should post what you find entertaining
       <a href="/r/highstrangeness">
        /r/highstrangeness
       </a>
       specializes in such things and is a great way to get away from all the politics for a spell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately the catch all nature of conspiracy grants all these different subjects a bigger audience than if we were to limit the scope of acceptable subjects.

       alone isn't going to do that.  The mods certainly can't  force real awareness on anyone.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.

      <p>
       The water, is the entertainment factor of a sub like this.  The drink, is people deciding on their own to get involved in the important stuff.

       They should be as you've stated.  All should be allowed.  I would never want to be the one to not allow something.  Though, its a good thing its not up to me, because I have one thing I wouldn't allow, but only not allowed in conspiracy.  The flat earth issue.  I just don't believe its a conspiracy, more of a belief.  I'm not advocating for a total ban at all, I just believe something like that needs its own outlet/sub.  I think it does more damage than it does actually inform people, but what do I know....
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I did waste your time.  I advocate for people to think things through and that's exactly what I didn't do in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond all of that, its my hope that one day r/conspiracy can go back to the realm of dealing with entertaining things like spontaneous combustion or something, not dealing with real world crimes.  Too many emotions and personal preferences come into play.  That's why you probably have a shittier job than it needs to be.  I hate to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if i were to relegate myself to the 911truth sub only, it's size will ensure relevant info stays neatly tucked away from the majority of people's view.  r/conspiracy has more exposure, good or bad and thus......I think real world issues need to be pushed as much as possible.  OK that's enough about me, take it easy out there.
