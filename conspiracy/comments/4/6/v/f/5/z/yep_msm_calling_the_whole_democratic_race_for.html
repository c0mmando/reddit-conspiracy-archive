<blockquote>
<p>The final results are in from Nevada and it looks like weâ€™re going to leave another state with roughly the same number of delegates as Hillary Clinton, maybe down just a few.</p>

<p>I want to be completely clear with you about what this result means: Nevada was supposed to be a state &quot;tailor made&quot; for the Clinton campaign, and a place she once led by almost 40 points. But today, we sent a message that will stun the political and financial establishment of this country: our campaign can win anywhere.</p>

<p>There are 26 primaries and caucuses in the next month, and three straight positive results for our campaign are sure to prompt an over-the-top response from the millionaires and billionaires who are funding our opponent and her many super PACs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to me that Bernie&#39;s team is working hard to challenge Hillary every step of the way. I dont see the defeatest attitude you are alluding to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most important point of this whole dialogue is that it seems that delegates are more important than your vote.  In other words, voting is dead in america.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s thanks to Scalia and his supreme court and their decision of Gore v Bush.</p>

<p>America is not a democratically-elected republic.  It&#39;s a republicly-elected republic; or more to the point, it&#39;s oligarchically-elected republic, which isn&#39;t even a real republic because they&#39;ve sat on their hands, brought us to the brink of shutting down the government; made decisions against the will of the people and in favor of damaging corporations.  </p>

<p>And they do this because they are criminals, gangsters and pedophiles who are blackmailed by the secret society of the intelligence community who are the only ones with the resources to keep eyes on them wherever in the world they go, be it to turkey to share a bath with a 12 yr old male or to ireland to share time with two passed out, drugged 14 yr old girls in exchange for passing legislation that favors the sheep industry for international corporations. </p>

<p>This place is fucked.  </p>

The League of Nations was a facade for British hegemony, which means the hegemony of London-based international bankers.</p>

<p>House writes: &quot;We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admitted on the same basis as our other colonies.&quot;</p>

<p>The report oozes contempt for Americans. &quot;The plain people of this country are inveterate and incurable hero worshipers,&quot; Col. House explains. A man with a slogan that expresses their &quot;undefined aspirations&quot; can manipulate them easily.</p>

<p>Afterwards, they will trust the sloganeer no matter what he does. [Woodrow] Wilson has gained this trust and this accounts for &quot;his exceptional usefulness to us.&quot;</p>

I think it&#39;s crazy that most Dems biggest &quot;want&quot; is single payer healthcare (hell, I know a lot of Republicans who are just ready for any change because the ACA is such a hell of theft - do you know how often I hear &quot;I can&#39;t retire because health insurance premiums would wipe me out&quot;???) and Hillary says, &quot;Sorry, not possible, suck it up, buttercups.&quot; </p>

<p>Her positions: No single payer healthcare. Endless war. Deport kids. She&#39;s a bigger hawk than some of the Republicans (for example, Kasich).</p>

<p>Yet she still has Dem support.</p>

<p>And then look at Trump - he&#39;s pro-Planned Parenthood, admits US funds Al Qaeda/ISIS, lauds Putin, wants to raise taxes on the rich, and says there were no WMD in Iraq. IN A REPUBLICAN DEBATE (I agree with him on some of this, but I&#39;m technically a solid Independent). And Republicans are still voting for him overwhelmingly.</p>

<p>The nation is hypnotized.</p>

Americans are stuck in a cycle of no hope and no change by an elite organised Freemason matrix that makes them believe they have a choice. You don&#39;t need to take the Blue or the Red pill.Don&#39;t take neither. For if you choose the Blue or  the deception then you are already in it and now you are trapping yourself by consciousness of it, and if you choose the Red one, then you choose to play within the knowledge base of the deception itself. The true question is, are you really free in this deception realm when your choices are just the Blue or the Red. You don&#39;t actually have a real choice in the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nor did Obama, Bush junior. Its exactly the kind puppet that&#39;s needed. You just need a follower of orders. Rubio like Obama is descended from minority, and a Senator. That&#39;s his street cred with the dumb voters. Also Great for the GOP PR that they are not an old southern white boys club. Here is a latino, from working class supposedly but his cousin is a democrat...hmm another posterboy of false hope...
But if you look at everything that Rubio has done makes him an institutional Neocon lacky no different than Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super-delegates aren&#39;t set in stone, actually. They pledge initially, but can and do flip.</p>

<p>But something tells me the Superdelegates would rather choose Cruz over Sanders, despite what a lot of Dems claim...it&#39;s become a corporatist war party, not a progressive one (there&#39;s a reason Sanders is a lifelong Independent). Interesting and incredibly sad times for America - hope people can work together to take it back, enough has become quite enough.</p>

<p>A real issue at play is that most progressives in the US have never grasp that the Dem party is not really the party they think it is. I.e. the Dem party has never been a &quot;progressive&quot; one. </p>
