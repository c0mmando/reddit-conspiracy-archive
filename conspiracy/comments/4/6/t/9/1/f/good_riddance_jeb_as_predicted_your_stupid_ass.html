    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but when Obama came out with the whole &quot;Hope and Change&quot; narrative, the media treated him like Jesus. Like the reincarnation of Martin Luther King. (Remember the famous Chris Matthews moment on MSNBC when he said that Obama spoke and it made &quot;a thrill run up [his] leg&quot;?) Trump, by contrast, has been attacked since day one. Maligned, ridiculed, underestimated. &quot;He&#39;d be gone within a week,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s treatment was never like that. Obama really WAS a media creation. So if there was a plan to scam the American people, it was Obama. (He&#39;s been exposed since and has lost most of his initial luster.)</p>

<p>But Trump&#39;s rise can&#39;t be equated at all with Obama&#39;s, since one made it <em>because</em> of the media, while the other made it <em>despite</em> the media.</p>

<p>Same thing with Sanders.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think that either man is part of a sinister &quot;master plan&quot; by the Powers That Be. If they were, their coverage would be vastly more different. Like Angela Merkel&#39;s--once she flooded her country with rapists. The international bankers who want to weaken national sovereignty (and remove all impediments to their power) lionized her dissolution of German culture and sovereignty by making her Time&#39;s Person of the Year. <em>That&#39;s</em> the coverage you get when you&#39;re the stooge of the power elite. Like when Obama got the Nobel peace prize two weeks after entering the White House [and having done nothing to earn it]. The Trump and Sanders treatment is quite the opposite, which leads me to believe they&#39;re legit. In summation, don&#39;t suspect foul play when the media is attacking someone; suspect it when the media is universally praising someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah but back then, very few people knew that the media was full of shit. a lot of ppl know that now, so tptb have to work within this new reality.</p>

<p>so now they have their sacrificial &#39;plan a&#39; - clinton and bush - perhaps their first choice, but they know most people will see thru them. they have to clearly attack the controlled opposition with the media to give them an &#39;anti-establishment&#39; appeal, when in reality trump/sanders are just their &#39;plan b&#39;</p>

<p>sanders and trump are both full of shit. their appeal is entirely predictable - engineered, even. sharpen your pitchforks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but these two have a pretty good back story.  Undeniable in fact.  </p>

<p>I think sanders is out of it now after tonight... But controlling either trump or sanders would mean both of them throwing away a lifetime of stances. </p>

<p>Hillary seems like SUCH the obvious choice as do most of the republican candidates.</p>

<p>I do remember the Obama hope/change thing.... But with both those two, it is so different because of their backgrounds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure.... </p>

<p>I think there was maybe 5% in it, so it was close.  Not sure what it all means though.  I try and get my info from Reddit, but there is a lot of bias to sort through and the mods at politics and sandersforpresident delete anything that may be deemed anti-sanders. I&#39;m pro sanders, but they are hurting themselves by censoring anything that may offend them.  Makes it difficult to truly gage what&#39;s going on and how well he is actually doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Others haven&#39;t been thinking this since he was first forced into the public eye as a possibility?</p>

<p>Who do you know that could even mildly tolerate anyone from the Bush tribe?  They truly are despised.  By all walks of life.  And can you even blame them for holding the members of the Bush crime syndicate in such ill-regard?  With the former president, he can barely even show his face in public anymore.  Sr. was so hated, even the slimiest world&#39;s top spy boss couldn&#39;t rig the vote against so many, so vocal against him.  W...Even with the round-the-clock inundation of pro-Bush/his policies messages, pushed heavily by the owned media, the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">big six</a>, people still turned out in droves to &quot;play&quot; vote against him.  Thanks to good old <a href="http://m.cjonline.com/news/2016-02-19/kansas-judge-bars-wichita-mathematicians-access-voting-machine-">Diebold</a> and his slimy brother Jeb, he easily held them off though on his repeat term.  Today, he&#39;s a joke.  A liar, who cost the county TRILLIONS needlessly.  The people know...</p>

<p>When there&#39;s literally no one you know that can even stand the guy, yet he mysteriously keeps &quot;winning&quot; these over dramatised contests, people will then really start questioning their placebo button &quot;voting&quot; privileges.</p>
