       All my life I've thought conspiracy theorists were for the most part over analyzing and trying to make something out of nothing (for lack of a better word). I spent some time over the weekend watching the aforementioned documentary and a Federal Reserve documentary my friend sent me (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtiOEpOnqtI">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtiOEpOnqtI
       </a>
       - excuse the title). Both documentaries have opened my eyes to, what I assume, a small aspect of the injustices currently pervading our world. I feel disgusted by what I witnessed in the past few days and what I've been told for years. If the evidence wasn't so outstanding the crimes would be unbelievable (as they have been to me for many years).
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize for pigeon holing a group of people into my personal 'crazy' category. Clearly many of you have a far greater grasp of reality than I do. Now that's off my chest, I ask if anybody has books or other quality documentaries where I can relearn what has been happening throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm astounded and disgusted. I apologize to those of you who have critically thought through these injustices and not taken the atrocities at face value. These documentaries tore my world apart and shook me to my very core. If anyone hasn't seen either documentary I mentioned, I'd certainly recommend them.
      </p>
      <p>
       ** Thank you all for the replies. I have compiled a long list of documentaries which I will work through at some point. I plan on going to the bookstore tonight to pick up some literature. You have made a good and lasting impression on me which will hopefully grow into a better understanding of the world we share. I need to return to work now, again thank you.

        Ring of Power
       </a>
       Although geographically separate, the city-states of London, the Vatican, and the District of Colombia are one interlocking empire called Empire of The City. The flag of Washington’s District of Colombia has three red stars, one for each city-state in the three city empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Corporate Empire of three city-states controls the world economically through London’s inner-city, militarily through the District of Colombia, and spiritually through the Vatican. From the mystery religions of ancient Egypt to the Zionist role in 9/11, Ring Of Power unrevises 4000 years of revisionist human history with never before seen revelations.

       Like the other poster said....welcome to the club.  In the next weeks/months you may experience periods of mania, depression, anger (when you find nobody cares) and you might start to doubt again.  Its a back and forth cycle and your mind attempts to reconcile the shattering of a core belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was working on a post on tips to help people wake up.  It explains the common stages of this back and forth.  Here is a link in case it's helpful.

       the first time i looked at this subreddit, i was thinking "psst, this is all bullshit", then a few posts intriuged me, and i kept looking more and more into here. Then i felt the subreddit was making up conspiracies to justify their ideology, so i turned away for awhile until i was drawn back a few months ago realizing what a shamthe world we live in is.

       I was emailing my friend today about the 9/11 documentary and he sent me the link to a 2004 poll which showed the amount of people not believing in the official story to be nearly equal (six point difference). I assume more people have changed their mind in the past 11 years, so there's a good chance I've been in the minority.

       This is what makes people who don't agree with the 'standard explanation' appear crazy to others.  There is not a non-biased group that can level the facts and say "it was possibly this or it was possibly that."  It is either 100% one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we have always heard the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle.  My personal belief is that the US Government learned of 9/11 plans and through the backdoors and frontdoors and ensured the results of 9/11 would be remembered forever.

       At this point I think OP can and will find and focus on subjects that are important to them - and feel anything I recommend at this point would just get in the way of their journey.

       I spent a few weeks sick with bronchitis and spent many days watching 2-5 hour long 9/11 videos. They're engrossing.

      <p>
       One thing though, this subreddit has become FILLED with shills. You'll notice it more as you learn things. On bigger posts here, I have gotten massively downvoted and attacked for saying that 9/11 wasn't carried out by Bin-Laden. Don't let vote scores sway you - look into everything. The reality of the world becomes more clear.

       evidence of revision, even thought it lacks heavily in quality, is just so damn sad... So much evidence yet the bastards got away not only with killing JFK but his brother too, and MLK, and countless others. We live in a f*cked up world alright.

       We do.  Really fucked.  I haven't brought myself to the RFK, MLK portion yet.  It's really difficult to absorb, and I want to do it when it can have my full attention. The story behind who put it (evidence of revision) together is really interesting.  That person labored endlessly to make something so important, so impactful, I'm always astounded when I view it.  I can't recall their name right now, but someone hunted them down once and learned their story.

       "The Greatest Story Never Told" it's about Hitler, WW1, WW2. Can be found on youtube or its own website. Great doc from an unbiased pov. Gives a better perspective of what happened and what led to that happening than what is taught in school and shown on History Channel.

       I've seen parts of it (it's very long), and while I found it decent for the most part, it's not entirely unbiased. Everybody, and consequently every doc or article, has some bias. We tend to be able to pick out bias more easily in people who have a different point of view than us, but it's still there.

       From experience bias usually comes from an emotional standpoint. In regards to Hitler I assume it'd be tough to put together an unbiased book/film.

       The documentary ends with "Heil Hitler". How more biased can you be?

       This is not a doc you should invest your time with OP. Especially since you're just getting started with looking into the injustices against mankind. It's not bad, but you have to realize that whoever made it did so with a purpose.

       I see now I did misunderstand your argument. Apologies. But now that I do understand it I don't agree. To be initiated into this topic is an emotional rollercoaster and not an intellectual endeavor. It becomes the latter, but at first it is about a shock experience, more or less. Dennis Wise is a guiding light in this, dry books about the Federal Reserve might not be that guidance you need straight away.

       The documentary is also rather long. I plan on looking into some reading on the subject from a few authors. I don't particularly love being in front of screens and books are easier for me to cut through the bullshit. Notes in the margins help me much more than those on a notepad.

       I need to invest time into relearning what they failed to teach when I was in school. It wouldn't surprise me that Hitler was painted in a different light. He is still such a hot-button topic 70 years later.

        <em>
         The Power of Nightmares
        </em>
       </a>
       by Adam Curtis, which documents the rise of the Neocons in the US and the paralleled rise of Radicalized Islam in the Middle East. Also, his film
       <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/bitter-lake/">
        <em>
         Bitter Lake
        </em>
       </a>
       , which takes a detailed look at the West's relationship and involvement in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of Curtis's films would be considered "conspiracy" based, in my opinion. None of what he presents is hidden, or secretive, but rather a detailed presentation of history that isn't offered through the mainstream media.

       Your suggestions are about understanding public relations.  Most people don't understand how marketing spin creeps into every aspect of "information" and media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophically- Derrida, Chomsky and Mcluhan all do a great job in breaking down messages to their agenda.  Knowing how to think critically will teach you more than any historical conspiracy website on its own.  Century of Self is great because it gets into Bernays and the tradition of public relations/ marketing and group psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched Better Call Saul last night and there's a whole scene that was an native ad- where they don't even mention the brand of the product they're advertising.  But as soon as the show was over- bam:  this show has been brought to you by "INSERT BRAND NAME HERE".  It was brilliant.  They created a sense of distrust around competition and a catharsis when the competitor was taken down a peg.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is happening all around us and nobody is going to teach you to read the fnords.

       +1 for Curtis. You hit the nail on the head perfectly, what he talks about isn't even contested, its all pretty much taken directly from archive material and interviews. It gives really powerful credence to some pretty controversial ideas. I think on
       <em>
        The Power of Nightmares
       </em>
       I would also add that it explains in beautiful detail how propaganda and reality became so confused during the Cold War when you had groups like Team B presenting CIA black propaganda as factual evidence back to the Senate and creating this paranoid atmosphere that just made everything so much worse.

       Having your eyes opened can make you a tad more receptive to conspiracy stuff.  But instead, be sure to double check everything. Don't accept anything on face value.  The Powers That Be try to control sources by feeding shit into good sources to lose them credability and also truth to shit sources to gain them credability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result (apart from never believing or trusting your government again) is you'll never really know truth from lies or info from disinfo.

       I'd highly recommend James Corbett's exhaustive list of podcasts. 
Most every subject you can imagine is touched on. His work is also good to help win over skeptical others. 
The man is an absolute gem.

       To cut a long story short, after over 15 years on this, here's my own conclusion:-  Vaccines are being used to induce highly profitable diseases (mostly autoimmune) which leave us dependent on expensive drugs for life, this is how the corporations increase the size of their drug sales market.  They are also used to reduce fertility rates in nations where TPTB want the population down.

       I fully support parents’ rights to choose not to vaccinate, but there are consequences to that decision.  I have had many conversations with parents in the middle of the night when their child has a fever and had to explain to them that because of their decision to not vaccinate, research indicates that their child is at a significantly increased risk for life-threatening diseases, and so will need invasive testing in the ER.  It will take hours, and it will hurt their child.  I tell them that the diseases we vaccinate against aren’t just nuisances; they kill and maim children every day, and they are almost completely preventable. By not vaccinating you're going to be highly profitable when we have to save your kid from meningitis and to just do the tests costs money and guess what you're going to a doctor to do the tests.

       If you have time: The Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin is a comprehensive overview of the Federal Reserve and money/banking in general. Highly recommended.

      <p>
       Also John Perkins work. Confessions of an Economic Hitman and The Secret History of The American Empire. That last one gets a little soft towards the end though.

       On YouTube everything is a rich man's trick. There is the book behold a pale horse. Mae Brussell archives has pretty good info, mainly covering topics from early 80's and back but I think you will find interesting the same names keep appearing in all this research. There is a pretty good website where you can read about various topics in this vein, bibliotecaplayedes.com

       Where are you on your who did it part of the awakening?
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is to decide if the Wahhabi-ist Arabs or the Zionists were behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you draw the right conclusion your total world view will change as if you have been extracted from a cult. You will re-study many historic events and the demons of depression and helplessness will trouble you at times. It's how the dark side works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay strong and true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a follower of faith but I recommend you establish a moral compass and contemplate the wonders of the universe. We are all connected. But you know that now. We've been calling for you to awaken and join us for long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be your turn to awaken others soon.

       Without brothers and sisters such as yourself 'now' has the potential to be a very dark and desolate place.

       I'm going to caution you, though: a lot of people here
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       over analyze and make something out of nothing. You don't need to be all or nothing. Just sometimes ask questions when things happen. It's funny, you can always get people to agree that politicians lie, but any time you accuse an individual politician of lying, you get called a nutjob.

       Now you can watch
       <a href="http://www.911missinglinks.com/">
        9/11 Missing Links
       </a>
       for an in depth education on who the actual perpetrators were, their false flag attack patterns through history leading up to and committing 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've found this vid to be the most direct, honest and to the point when it comes to WHO did it. Most docs dance around the subject of who actually did 9/11 like a drunk chick at Mardi Gras...not this one.

       I won't suggest books here but i want to give you a couple hints if you are interested in the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) don't take the conspiracist SJW route and start to just scream "unfair!" because that's the way people stop processing and start expressing.
If you process everything you need to, you will understand that there's little you can do in real life to change things. Instead use the knowledge you gain to better understand the reality around you and adjusting yourself to the new found level of complexity.
It will challenge you and make you grow. After you have grown, still don't go SJW over it. Rather than explaining people they are wrong on a subject, make them smart questions that will point out controversies, or hint playfully at one in their thinking.
If you attack directly you will only reinforce their actual thinking patterns. A real thought challenge always come from unsuspected ways. Real life ain't a documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Think in terms of probability. Don't take nothing for granted until you see it with your own eyes, but assess chances based on your knowledge and understand the meaning.
Most CTs that have grown in wisdom ( imo ) know little with certainity, but they will mostly agree that the chance aliens colonized our world in the past, while that may be improbable, is much more probable than history going the way we have been told ( look as my only judgement on these matters it's an evaluation of chances, there's not anything i can be put under attack without reasoning unless by emotional appeal so with this stance i atleast force an equal dialogue if someone wants to disprove )
      </p>
      <p>
       Use conspiracy minded knowledge to understand the epidemy of mental infancy and develop your own independent thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest take away from this community is to never take anything for granted in matter of knowledge. 
Assess chances personally and make your own evaluations, never fall in the SJW departmented. Their mindset is: as soon as i think i know something more, i'll stop processing it further and start yelling it. Don't be that guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also don't go overboard with it because the rabbit hole is really that deep and you can get your life sucked on it. Read only with a fresh mindset and if you feel gloomy, first refresh your mind. It's the best way to keep a healthy level of doubt without falling to the temptating "i knew!".
      </p>
      <p>
       As r/C_S_T motto goes: it's the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it ( Aristoteles ).
      </p>
      <p>
       A SJW is like mars, full of passion with little strategy. A wised up CT is like yupiter, a wise man achieving by strategy. This is expecially the case when your weapons would be words.

       Yes i have been down the rabbit hole for 2 years consecutively for some time each day and while it really helped my knowledge and thinking patterns in abstract, it did hurt my mindset so i now limit it and when i'm out of it, i try to don't even acknowledge it's existence.
It's not yet time at social level to be open about these things, we need the seed of doubt to spread before we can start. Things are going to get out of hand sooner or later and the more we come near that moment the more people will wake up. The average individual, even when enlightened, can do little by himself.
As you said in your example - is not our job to convince, as it outside our range of chances. We can only plant the seed of doubt and it's up to each individual to pick it up or dimiss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a whole, we are in the hands of the gods, like it has always been. Our power is limited; we can risk if we want, but i prefer to take the small-but-safe steps about spreading truth. It was never a safe business to get involved with, history give some insights.

       1) I actually had to look up SJW and I can assure you I will not be taking that route. After I feel adequately researched I may entertain the eventual urge to sew seeds of doubt in other friends and family's minds. First and foremost I'm looking to shape my reality into one with a stronger and truer foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I am going to print out and take another look at logical fallacies so they will be easier to spot. It's been a while. I've learned in my life that getting sucked in to any one thing is usually detrimental, so I will take the staircase instead of plunging in to the 'rabbit hole'.

       good to have you onboard though, show a few of your friends those vids and get a pyramid effect going amongst them with this information

       you're Right :D

       You do know the term "conspiracy theorist" was coined by the CIA to discredit those who didn't agree with the 'official narrative' on JFK's murder

       Aha! An  original thinker, which is Not the 'average person' who can't spell theorist let alone 'conspiracy'

       People have been "conspiring to succeed" for as long as people have been paying for sex!

       Thank you for your post. Don't beat yourself up for being naive before. We all started out that way. Also, once you go down the conspiracy rabbit hole, the world can become a very depressing thing. Keep in mind that the way to defeat all of the evils you will learn of, is to live your life well. Find joy and peace in your life, and share that joy with others. If we all did that, and lived it everyday, then the powers that be would no longer have any control over us.

       I'm so happy for you--Welcome. Now when you hear someone talking about being 'awake' you'll understand that they really mean that and not in any kind of hyperbolic way either... Anyway here's a quick list of my favorite youtube-available videos that tore open my mind... Evidence of Revision, parts 1-7 (JFK, MLKJr., RFK, and Jonestown), September Clues (9/11), We Need to Talk about Sandy Hook (Sandy Hook), Boston Bombing (many different clips and docs just start poking around with an open mind you'll soon find the truth is buried in a shallow grave and easy to dig up), Apollo Moon Hoax (Something Funny Happened on the Way to the Moon)(or read Dave McGowan's "Wagging the Moondoggie" essay series that'll make you ashamed you didn't see all this stuff on your own already)

       One more thing I meant to recommend to you to check out... Go to WantToKnow.info and poke around as your curiosity dictates... It's a site built by a guy who used to be the translator for the state department for Indonesian and Chinese under Bush Sr., Clinton and George W... And he had a moment of clarity that opened his eyes all at once and changed his understanding of the world around him all at once much like just happened to you recently and as an eventual result he decided to create a place on-line where you could get the straight skinny on everything via easily verifiable mainstream media mentions of things which usually are outright denied and covered in layers of disinfo. With curiosity and some spare time you can open your eyes for the first time on the truth of many many different topics via this website. Check it out.

       One of my favourites is Zeitgeist The Movie/ It relly gets into the controvesy surrounding 9/11 as well as the blatant idiocy of America's banking system. It's on Netflix along with the second film that looks int a more global view of the behind-closed-doors choas. The scond includes an interview with the Ecconomic Hitman mentioned in this thread.

       Welcome to our world. I'm sorry for your loss. You can never go back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that there is a lot of disinformation, much of it propagated by the simply naive but much of it also propagated by those who would discredit "Conspiracy Theorists". It can be very difficult to find out where the line is, now that your reality has changed. Remember that there is still great beauty in the world. You can get sucked into the rabbit hole easily; don't forget to walk away and spend time with friends and family and feeding the ducks or whatever you do for mental health and relaxation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much work to be done. Trying to wake up other people can be an exercise in frustration; a viable path is working with others who are similarly minded to yourself. Our power is greatest within our sphere of influence; that starts with changing ourselves, and then our world changes, as you're finding out. Then it extends to our friends and family, and our community, and then the wider world. Focus on where your power is greatest

       No need for apologies. Most of us have been in your shoes. But it speaks well of your character.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weird thing is that so much of this stuff is just transparently obvious (like Sandy Hook) once you look at it. For weeks I kept asking myself 'how could I not have seen it? how could I have been so willfully blind?' They win by inculcating a mindset where people refuse to simply consider the possibility (no way! that's crazy!). So my suggestion to you is to try to jettison that mindset about everything. Be willing to consider anything no matter how nuts it sounds, because who knows? But at the same time, you need to be very skeptical and careful about accepting claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have said, these waters are full of disinfo agents. They work by telling you partial truths. You want to believe them, and you do because you agree with what they say, but then they misdirect you in the end. Another thing they like to do is get us fighting amongst each other about 'the truth.' The 911 truth movement is a great example. So many people arguing over their version of exactly how it was done and exactly who was involved. They want to keep us distracted with in-fighting and spending days and weeks and months trying to figure out 'the truth.' But be never will. And that's ok because at some point it doesn't really matter. We can see the outlines well enough. The question is what can we then do with that knowledge? I'm not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another word of advice is to be skeptical of anyone trying to make you afraid or hateful of other social groups on the basis of nationality, race, religion, political party, etc. The powers that be don't care about that stuff. In fact they deliberately create those divisions and sow dissent. The wealthy bankers and their henchmen in politics and the military and esp. the intelligence community -- they're the bad guys. Everyone else is just being duped and manipulated by them.

        Here is a post I made a little while ago about my journey into conspiracy theories
       </a>
       with several links. For the record I'm no longer so sure about the Apollo missions being hoaxed. I'm pretty sure they were. Or at least some of them. But I'm not sure. And there are problems with some of the claims made in the links I provided in that post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, here are a couple of links I did not include in that post:

        And here is the link to the site of Mile Mathis,
       </a>
       who has a fairly unique perspective, which is saying quite a lot. After you learn about the JFK and RFK assassinations, I suggest
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/barindex2.pdf">
        checking out his take on it.
       </a>
       Quite different than the mainstream conspiracy theories....still not sure what to make of it, but I definitely like his way of thinking through these issues.

       This might seem irrelevant, but I would recommend that you balance your "stone turning" with reading about Taoism, physics, and classic philosophy. They can provide an anchor for when you find yourself staring into the madness that men create out of natural order. Remain skeptical of all things, but above that, give all things a fair chance before you ever commit to a particular stance. Remember that misguided people and their words are everywhere, not just in the "mainstream" world. Happy hunting.

       I am surprised that nobody pointed out the excellent documentaries at TragedyAndHope dot com (although somebody mentioned the book that the site was named after).  When I started to get lost in the rabbit hole, I came across them and they really helped me to learn my way forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       They produce more podcasts than documentaries, but there are several outstanding documentaries, as well as documentaries by like minded affiliates.

       Zeitgeist is low quality. It's a Marxist attempt at dismantling religion.
Yes, it's interesting and worth watching, it's poking holes in ancient belief systems and I feel we need to focus on more current events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not for or against religion but be aware that a lot of these docu have agenda. And where there is agenda there is often Zionist funding.

       You might want to be careful of a couple things though.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, some fringe political parties use docs like these to promote their own propaganda (libertarians talk about freedom and big government being the bad guy, yet their platform is destroying all social programs and letting the poor get fucked over by any big corp, they only care about destroying the government and what little help it gives to the people [libertarians see the crisis of 2008 and say "don't blame the nice banks! it's the governments fault, let the nice banks control the economy with no oversight (free market) and the world will be a better place!], or the greens will tell you that a couple windmills and solar cells is all that is needed to replace fossil fuel and nuclear, which is bullshit, humanity needs nuclear energy or it will be a regression back to the dark ages).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly the "conspiracy environment" is filled to the brim with disinformation artists, con artists and other nutjobs selling you their own version of the kool aid. David Icke swearing that world leaders are actually lizard people and the moon is a mind control device for example, or the UFO folk with their "Disclosure" bullshit (thought by quite a bit of people to simply be propped up to distract people from real conspiracies, or to flood uselessly the FOIA system with bullshit UFO questions to slow down the process of actual real researchers). Also be careful of the "it's the Jews/Jesuits/Free Masons/Lizard people" crowd (anyone telling you the world is controlled by one entity is probably insane), although I assume any healthy human being will usually just laugh this sort of crap away.
      </p>
      <p>
       ps: not necessarily directly related, but Robert Anton Wilson and his theory of "reality tunnels" is a useful philosophical aid to navigating the conspiracy realm.

       Thank you for posting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2001, I had voted for Republican candidates for 25 years in two Deep South states (Tennessee and Alabama).  I spent the first 15 years of my career with the Department of the Army.  I was totally unquestioning of my government, particularly the US military.  I knew what to think and what to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that convinced me something was wrong with the official investigation of the 9/11 WTC tower attacks was when my own federal Senator, Republican Senator Richard Shelby, who was Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when the investigating commission report was completed, and who saw the complete unexpurgated version of that report, told the nation publicly that the 28 pages that were concealed from the public were not related to national security, and the American people had every right to view them.  He was subsequently accused of, and investigated for, divulging classified secrets in a Fox News broadcast that was never aired; in other words, they accused him of treason. Fox News claimed that they halted the broadcast before any damage was done, but the accusation was out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Shelby backed off on the 9/11 Commission Report, and he was moved from Intelligence to the Senate Banking Committee, where he could do no more harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shelby was put on notice:  "Shut up willingly, or we
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       shut you up."
      </p>
      <p>
       Shelby went about as far as any Congressman could in 2004 to put the truth before the public.  I commend him for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Shelby was replaced as the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee by US Senator and former Governor of Florida, Bob Graham.  Graham had the guts to continue fighting both the Bush and Obama administrations to declassify those 28 pages of a 9/11 intelligence report that it is believed detail the efforts of members of the Saudi Arabian royal family to aid the 9/11 terrorists (most of whom were themselves Saudi) when they were training in Florida.  (15 of the 19 hijackers carried Saudi Arabian passports).  That Saudi family, which was living in Sarasota, left the US just before the attacks occurred. Were they tipped off that they should leave? If so, by whom?
      </p>
      <p>
       The 9/11 intelligence report contains no smoking gun, but where it came even marginally close to the truth; the source of that truth was immediately and conclusively shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know even the smallest percentage of the truth about what happened on 9/11/2001, and we
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       will, but I'm damned glad there are a few people left who are willing to defend our right to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe that the WTC attacks were inside jobs?  Not really.  It's certainly possible, but not really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe that there is a whole lot more to the story of what happened that day, and we have been deliberately kept from knowing the truth; and fed a bunch of lies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely, without question, I do believe that.

       Thank you for the reply. I remember reading somewhere about Mark Dayton (current governor of MN and former senator) who left Washington after one term because he couldn't deal with the corruption. At some point I'm going to look at the funding difference for senators who investigated the 9/11 attacks. I assume there was some level of corruption there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment about the Saudi's really wouldn't surprise me. Wahhabi's (to me) are very scary people and to this day I can't believe we are in bed with them. Oil payed for in blood. Again thank you for the post.

       If you haven't read Republic Lost yet than you haven't even started your journey, that goes for most of you in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i find that the natural evolution of thought as one delves into this rabbit hole tends to veer more towards the explanation of things rather than analysis and strategizing for the consequences. In my 20 year journey for what i thought would be facts and truth, i have come to realize that finding the answers to the big ones is not nearly as important as understanding and dealing with the fallout of things that seem to always inevitably happen to our species. To me finding out bush was behind 911 or that JFK was taken out by his own co-workers, isn't going to tell me anything i already can't see for myself, and any ONE person who could take the fall for such high level corruption isn't even relevant by the time the chips have fallen, so i turned the page to the next chapter to look at the real systemic abuse that is unfolding within our peoples. And bombing buildings and starting wars for oil is the least of our problems if you have look at any of the other facts surrounding almost any major decisions by 'leadership'

       It brings me joy to see others strive to seek the truth and set themselves free despite what the truth may be. The chasm between what is going on and what we're told is going on is absolutely enormous. We must remember that we have to be the change we want to see in the world.

       Somebody else on here already recommended the "Creature from Jekyll Island" it's more than about the federal reserve. It took me back to my high school/college history classes and showed me an entirely new perspective on history. It'll open your eyes to the reasons behind so many wars, the relationship between nations, and the benefits of a new world word coming into existence. 
Definitely worth the read and you'll be surprised at how easy it is. And I've never been a book reader, I'm more a documentary man.

       Alot of people don't know that the Fed is just another front, which is why it is permissible to mention it on MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Exchange Stabilization Fund is the controlling agency of not only the Fed but also the IMF and numerous other financial entities and apparently for the CIA black budget.

       Thank you so much for posting this. Many of us have posted here before about how frustrated we get trying to rationally and politely discuss the truth behind issues like these – often to the point of just keeping our damn mouths shut. It takes a lot more information to unseat core and treasured beliefs than it does to initially indoctrinate, and it can be painful. So, to have you come here and demonstrate that our efforts are often not in vain means a great deal. I browsed the links here and heartily upvoted. PM me back if you want to get into the horrifyingly depressing world of vaccines.

       You only have to understand a few facts to become skeptical of the official line, especially as it relates to 9-11.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Steel frame buildings do not entirely collapse due to a few fires inside it. Freefall of a steel frame building requires all steel beams to be cut in very quick succession which can only occur with planted explosives. A smattering of internal fires simply cannot cause a steel frame building to collapse and freefall.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Watch the Building 7 videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the one piece of evidence that simply cannot discounted. It is the smoking gun. An undeniable fact.

       First of all kudos on opening your mind and eyes, many never make it. Now that you know about the fed and 9 11, I suggest you watch "we need to talk about sandy hook" on youtube. Most through documentary on the topic ever. To better understand the fed I suggest you read the creature from jekyll island. Welcome to the club, heres your tinfoil hat..lol wear it with pride

       I'd like to congratulate you on peeling back the first layer. You may not quite realize it but it is a Victory over certain hypnotic forces that have been forced upon you. You undoubtedly want to shout what you know to be the truth from the rooftops, make everyone understand it as you do with the full extent of the conviction in your feelings. Unfortunately, you can't fight that battle for others. They accepted the hypnotic suggestions and none can break them free from that if they don't desire to be free. People begin to love their chains and that is what binds them to them. Stay positive, regardless of the appearances; they have no power!

       Welcome! The hole is deep. Do sooner than later some research on medical issues, vaccines, cancer, HIV etc, to serve you and your closest, and to understand the medicine is the plague, more often than not. And while some revelations may drag you down, can happen in the beginning, it'll turn to strength. Truth = the only real freedom

       is a good place if you want to build up a knowledge base for yourself of proven historical conspiracies.

       It helps to be able to talk about things that are solidly proven before moving into the gray areas of modern fuckery.

       I was just in the comfort zone before, there was a documentary that I watched years ago blowing the lid on the UN. The guy at the started seemed like he was just ranting. As the documentary went on the guy seemed more matter of fact. I do not remember the name of it right now.

       This is not really about "conspiracies" but the psychological building blocks which enable them. A lot people have problems with believing into conspiracies either because of the negative programming of the word itself and their self centered/limited perspective of human nature. But that's crucial to get over the "I can't fathom why" aspect which stops people from even considering the unthinkable.

       The Human History movie is probably the most mentally deranged documentary on YouTube claiming to "tell the truth about the world". Spirit Science's videos are interesting for a laugh or an uplifting but of wishful thinking nonsense, but not much more.

       The fact that you're linking RationalWiki, is only making me believe more and more than you're a shill...

      <p>
       RationalWiki is the go to "debunking" site for anything even remotely conspiracy related. It's where people who do no research go to dismiss anything that goes against what the mainstream media tells them.

       The nature of reality is not what we've been told. Look into quantum physics. Everything is made of atoms, yet atoms are simply energy vibrating to a certain frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can energy make up a solid world?

       All religions and ancient scriptures have a common theme, because they originate from the same place. How much of our history do you think we know? Remember we only have theories on how the pyramids were built. And their connections and similarities with other ancient sites around the world, prove that our history is not what we've been told.

       We only have theories on how the moon got there, so the first part is true.

       As for the second part, how do you know it's not alien spacecraft? Honestly, how do you know what you know?

       Our brain simply decodes waveform vibrational information, into what we see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. How do you know that you see all there is to see? Other animals can decode things we can't decode. Perhaps aliens exist outside visible light, perhaps they control the planet and humans are just a slave species. But how do I know what I know?

       Because it's the most reasonable thing to think. There is no evidence for much else. Spirit science also cited the "studies" regarding water molecules after receiving "negative energy" and "positive energy". Of course, James Randi still has his million dollars and there is still no proof of any supernatural phenomenon.

       Have you examined the lengthy refutations of those theories, too? I guarantee the cost of finding thousands of people willing to be complicit in mass murder and buying them off is more than the cost of a couple of planes (who's to say the conspirators would've even owned the planes?)

       The north side approach Pentagon flyover is a well-orchestrated hoax. I'm not saying that it is, but think about it: two random dudes suddenly appear in 2006 who have the money and resources to track down Pentagon witnesses in Arlington, pretend to objectively assess the evidence, all in a professionally made documentary set to a catchy soundtrack, then pretty much disappear in 2008. CIT has 13 witnesses, while there are about 100 people who saw Flight 77. Lloyde England could just be screwing the CIT guys; he knew their website and he knows about conspiracy theories.

       Yeah I guess you're right, it's all just a coincidence. Phew I was starting to think we're all slaves to alien rulers, but you just reassured me that maybe Bush knew about it, but that's it. Any connection to the secret societies he's a part of, is just a coincidence. The ancient rituals these elite people take part in, is just for fun and games. They claim to be Christian, or Jewish or whatever, then hangout at the Bohemian Grove to do mock human sacrifices in front of a burning owl statue, just for fun. Skull and Bones, laying in a coffin getting masturbated on by the other members, just as fraternity nonsense.

       These two guys that interviewed all these Pentagon witnesses, are the well-orchestrated hoax here. Obviously liars, and obvious Lloyd England was just screwing with these liars. His FBI wife is just a coincidence, he told them "it was planned" just to mess with them. Yep, makes sense to me. Thank you for believing RationalWiki.

       Lloyde England could've been messing with them, OR he, being knowledgeable about conspiracy theories, got confused about his own recollections that day when confronted with what he may have considered to be evidence on the internet of a North Side approach. He agrees that it was probably planned because he is coincidentally interested in conspiracy theories. When he said "It was planned... I'm in it... We came up on the highway together", it is obvious that he is metaphorically talking about him and the world-changing event of 9/11 crossing paths in life. When he said "we came up on the highway together", me means he witnessed history, not that he helped plant the light pole with another guy.

       And he claims a man helped him pull the light post out.

       Now look at the size of the light post... do you believe two men could possibly pull that light post out? Why is there no damage to the hood of the car?

       I think you should do some conspiracy research into the occult. If you think Freemasonry is just a gentlemen's social club... then you are grossly mistaken.

      <p>
       The true knowledge of our history has been suppressed. The reason they might call themselves the "illuminati", meaning "enlightened one", is because they are enlightened to the true knowledge of our past, they understand the nature of reality, and they keep it from the common people, because we are just common people. Empire as ruled over the common man throughout history... it's still going on today.

       I find it hard to believe that the poll could have been lodged like that... a speeding jet, vs a moving car... and yet the only damage in the original photos is a hole in the windscreen barely the size of the poll itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the satanic pedophile rings... there is so much evidence, so many whistleblowers, more than enough for me to know that this stuff is absolutely rampant in this world behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this might sound strange to the hard headed atheists that dominate this website... but this stuff exists for reasons beyond just fetishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimmy Savile is one of the most known examples to be confirmed to be a part of the satanic pedophile rings... and he has close relationship with the Queen and royal family.

      <p>
       Do you really believe MI5 didn't do a background check on the man before allowing him in Buckingham palace?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media will have to bring it up when it gets exposed on such level, but then do their best to put the lid on it, and keep it disconnected with all the other incidents, so you don't realize just how big it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the queen, as she sits on her gold throne, do you think she actually cares about all the starving children in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway... yeah there are bloodlines that rule the world, and they are being exposed.
      </p>

       The cracks are beginning to show, the light is shining though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's a lot to take in... but the reason they do these things, is to bring down the energy level of the planet. There's a reason our world is a lot closer to fear and hate than peace and love... it's because they want it that way.

       The picture is more than enough to demonstrate that the lack of damage to the hood and the back seat is explainable. Lloyde is the only recorded witness of the car incident, so he could always be remembering wrong when he said the car spun around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there any easily attainable evidence of Jimmy Savile's abuse before he died?
There is, of course, a limit of how big of a conspiracy can be kept secret. Compartmentalization to allow something like 9/11 to happen is one thing, but when there is an occult background with a stated motive to preserve power, it's kind of hard to not have that leak. An Illuminati like that is very unlikely to exist. There are no leaks I know of from people in the inside, beyond a few sparse quotes by Rothschilds and Rockefellers about how powerful owning the banks can make you.

       It's easy to pick out the problems with the film on your own if you do enough research. A constructive criticism of the film would be enough to be a 100+ page PDF.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example is that the film says that the angled cuts on the steel columns at ground zero are characteristic of linear-shaped demolition devices. It admits that "some of these cuts were made by ironworkers", but then shows an interview with first responder Kevin McPadden saying that he noticed the cuts on the very first day at ground zero. McPadden is the guy why said that there was a countdown over a firefighter's radio for the demolition of WTC 7 and his entire story (he has changed his story a few times) with that has been discredited.
      </p>
      <p>
       The film asks "what purpose would slicing the steel in a V-cut or a 45 degree angle cut serve?", the answer is for the same reason linear-shaped cutter charges are used: to make the steel fall a certain way. The same idea applies to cutting a tree down. They probably did it like that to make sure it didn't fall on anybody or themselves. I have not seen any photographs taken on the day of 9/11 that show the steel cut like that. Ironworkers made all of those clean cuts, and some arrived at ground zero the day after 9/11.

       Thank you for the thought out reply; I definitely need to do more research on the subject. I am very interested to find out if the structural integrity of the buildings was sound. It seems most of the documentary would come in to question if the buildings weren't built well. Before this weekend I hadn't done much research into 9/11 as the shock is still very much with me. I definitely need to stop taking things so much at face value and do independent investigating. Much appreciated

       It's generally a good film. But quite a few points in New Pearl Harbor can be debunked. For example, the Mineta testimony that he witnessed a stand-down order in the PEOC at about 9:25. It can be debunked from many angles, but I'll focus on the two pieces of evidence it cites to support his testimony: the CNN report of the slow evacuation, and the Secret Service log.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The CNN Report
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It cites a CNN report aired at 9:52am stating that the slow evacuation started about thirty minutes before, thus at around 9:20am. However, it also states that the evacuation lasted at least thirty minutes, meaning that a later arrival for Mineta is not excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scene Mineta describes in his other interviews, with people running out, is consistent with a post-9:45 arrival time to the White House grounds:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/bn.06.html">
         In the last 10 minutes or so, the people who came out -- the last several hundred I saw leaving the grounds, were told and ordered by the Secret Service to run. They were running through the gates.
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mineta's statement in an interview:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/min0int-8">
         I grabbed some manuals and some papers, went down to the car, and we went over to the White House. As we went in West Executive Drive,
         <strong>
          people pouring out of the Executive Office building, people running out of the White House, and I said to my driver and security guy, "Is there something wrong with this picture? We are driving in, and everybody else is running away."
         </strong>
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Internal Secret Service Timeline
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The "recently released Secret Service timeline" the documentary cites is, in actuality,
       <a href="http://bluecollarrepublican.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/t8-b16-misc-work-papers-fdr-secret-service-timeline.pdf">
        a collection of unclassified working notes
       </a>
       written by 9/11 Commissioner Miles Kara. You can see the words "unclassified extract" at the top. These timelines are rough compilations of disparate information as it came in. It's unverified and contradictory in nature. These are not sober, corroborated, post-facto timelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       These notes are sourced from disparate classified documents which Kara was allowed to see and take notes from. The 9/11 Commission's time of 10:12 - 10:18 for the shoot-down order is likely based off these notes. The PEOC shelter log, declassified under a FOIA request in 2010, is possibly one of the classified timelines Kara took notes from. Notice also the note says "9:37 - VP", which means Vice President Cheney was moved to the PEOC at 9:37, according to the timeline. This contradicts the claim that Cheney was in the PEOC at 9:25. The official arrival time of 9:58 contradicts it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entries in Kara's notes for 9:25 - 9:31 are not meant to be conflated with the 9:34 - 9:37 entries. The first set of entries do not refer to AA 77, but likelier refers to phantom American Airlines 11, which was falsely reported to be heading toward Washington at 9:25. The F.A.A. was monitoring the projected flight path of AA11 on the TSD display.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's tempting to line up the AA 77 radar track post-facto with the entries in the notes, but that offers the mistaken impression that someone outside F.A.A. was tracking Flight 77 before 9:32 -- that contradicts all known evidence. Miles Kara expands on the topic of the Secret Service logs in his
       <a href="http://www.oredigger61.org/?p=3785">
        blog post here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence I've seen strongly points to Mineta's arrival to PEOC post-9:45, specifically 10:15. He describes the flight path of the target as between Great Falls and Reagan National Airport, which was a straight line (not a loop like A.A. 77), and this matches closely with the projected flight path for United Airlines 93. Phantom 93 was indeed reported at 60 miles out from Washington at about 10:20. It's projected flight path was tracked by the F.A.A.
      </p>
      <p>
       Researcher
       <em>
        Woody Box
       </em>
       argues that Mineta lied in his testimony. He argues that he, with Monte Belger tracked an unacknowledged 5
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       plane, which was posing as a hijacked airliner. Then, when summoned to testify before the 9/11 Commission, he simply pushed the event of the fifth plane onto Flight 77.  Woody argues that if Mineta were to truly testify about the plane that was tracked, it would reveal an
       <em>
        Operation Northwoods
       </em>
       -like scenario. But Woody's evidence for a "fifth plane" is spotty at some points. I also think that if Mineta lied, it's sensible to push it onto phantom Flight 93 and have a more plausible timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mineta's timeline is also too narrow. He could not possibly leave where he was and arrive to PEOC in fifteen minutes. Mineta was in his car talking to Richard Clarke on the phone at 9:20...not in the PEOC. That's just one of the several errors found in
       <em>
        New Pearl Harbor
       </em>
       .

After I feel adequately researched I may entertain the eventual urge to sew seeds of doubt in other friends and family's minds. First and foremost I'm looking to shape my reality into one with a stronger and truer foundation.

       2) I am going to print out and take another look at logical fallacies so they will be easier to spot. It's been a while. I've learned in my life that getting sucked in to any one thing is usually detrimental, so I will take the staircase instead of plunging in to the 'rabbit hole'.

       The north side approach Pentagon flyover is a well-orchestrated hoax. I'm not saying that it is, but think about it: two random dudes suddenly appear in 2006 who have the money and resources to track down Pentagon witnesses in Arlington, pretend to objectively assess the evidence, all in a professionally made documentary set to a catchy soundtrack, then pretty much disappear in 2008. CIT has 13 witnesses, while there are about 100 people who saw Flight 77. Lloyde England could just be screwing the CIT guys; he knew their website and he knows about conspiracy theories.
