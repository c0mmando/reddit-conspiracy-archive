<hr/>

<ol>
<li><p>NIST was working with LLNL to test and characterize these sol-gel nano-
thermites, at least as early as 1999 (Tillitson et al 1999).   </p></li>
<li><p>Forman Williams, the <strong>lead engineer on NIST’s advisory committee,</strong> and the most prominent <strong>engineering expert for Popular Mechanics,</strong> is an expert on the 
deflagration of energetic materials and the “ignition of porous energetic 
materials”(Margolis and Williams 1996, Telengator et al 1998, Margolis and 
Williams 1999).  <strong>Nano-thermites are porous energetic materials.</strong>  Additionally, 
Williams’ research partner, Stephen Margolis, has presented at conferences where 
nano-energetics are the focus (Gordon 1999).  Some of Williams’ other colleagues at the University of California San Diego, like David J. Benson, are also experts on nano-thermite materials (Choi et al 2005, Jordan et al 2007).  </p></li>
<li><p>Science Applications International (SAIC) is the DOD and Homeland Security 
contractor that supplied the largest contingent of non-governmental investigators 
to the NIST WTC investigation.  <strong>SAIC has extensive links to nano-thermites, 
developing and judging nano-thermite research proposals for the military and 
other military contractors, and developing and formulating nano-thermites 
directly</strong> (Army 2008, DOD 2007).  SAIC’s subsidiary Applied Ordnance Technology has done research on the ignition of nanothermites with lasers (Howard et al 2005).   In an interesting coincidence, <strong>SAIC was the firm that investigated the 1993 WTC bombing</strong>, boasting that  <em>“After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, our blast analyses produced tangible results that helped identify those responsible (SAIC 2004).”</em>  And the coincidences with this company don’t stop there, as <strong>SAIC was responsible for evaluating the WTC for terrorism risks in 1986</strong> as well (CRHC2008).  SAIC is also linked to the late 1990s security upgrades at the WTC, the Rudy Giuliani administration, and the anthrax incidents after 9/11, through former employees Jerome Hauer and Steven Hatfill.   </p></li>
<li><p>Arden Bement, the metallurgist and expert on fuels and materials who was 
nominated as director of NIST by President George W. Bush in October 2001, 
was former deputy secretary of defense, former director of DARPA’s office of 
materials science, and former executive at TRW.<br/>
Of course, <strong>DOD and DARPA are both leaders in the production and use of nano-thermites</strong> (Amptiac 2002, DOD 2005).<br/>
And military and aerospace contractor TRW has had a long collaboration with NASA laboratories in the <strong>development of energetic materials that are components of advanced propellants, like nano-gelled explosive materials</strong> (NASA 2001).<br/>
TRW Aeronautics also made fireproof composites and high performance elastomer formulations, and worked with NASA to make energetic aerogels. 
Additionally, Bement was a professor at Purdue and MIT.  <strong>Purdue has a thriving 
program for nano-thermites</strong>* (Son 2008).  And interestingly, at MIT’s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology, we find <strong>Martin Z. Bazant, son of notable  <em>“conspiracy debunker”</em> Zdenek P. Bazant</strong> (MIT 2008), who does research on granular flows, and the electrochemical interactions of silicon.<br/>
Zdenek P. Bazant is interested in nanocomposites as well (Northwestern 2008), and how they relate to naval warfare (ONR 2008).  MIT was represented at nano-energetics conferences as early as 1998 (Gordon 1998). Bement was also a director at both Battelle and the Lord Corporation.  Battelle <strong>(where the anthrax was made)</strong> is an organization of <em>“experts in fundamental technologies from the five National Laboratories we manage or co-manage for the US DOE.”</em>  </p></li>
<li><p>Hratch Semerjian, long-time director of NIST’s chemical division, was promoted 
to acting director of NIST in November 2004, and took over the WTC investigation until the completion of the report on the towers.  <strong>Semerjian is closely linked to former NIST employee Michael Zachariah, perhaps the world’s most prominent expert on nano-thermites</strong> (Zachariah 2008).  In fact, Semerjian and Zachariah co-authored ten papers that focus on nano-particles made of silica,
ceramics and refractory particles.  Zachariah was a major player in the Defense 
University Research Initiative on Nanotechnology (DURINT), a groundbreaking 
research effort for nano-thermites. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>NIST has a long-standing partnership with NASA for the development of new 
nano-thermites and other nano-technological materials.</strong>  In fact, Michael 
Zachariah coordinates this partnership (CNMM 2008).</p></li>
<li><p>In 2003, two years before the NIST WTC report was issued, the University of 
Maryland College Park (UMCP) and <strong>NIST signed a memorandum of understanding to develop nano-technologies like nano-thermites</strong> (NIST 2003).<br/>
Together, NIST and UMCP have done much work on nano-thermites (NM22008).   </p></li>
<li><p>NIST has their own Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST 2008).<br/>
Additionally, <strong>NIST’s Reactive Flows Group did research on nanostructured 
materials and high temperature reactions in the mid-nineties</strong> (NRFG 1996). </p></li>
<li><p>Richard Gann, <strong>who did the final editing of the NIST WTC report,</strong> managed a 
project called <em>“Next-Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program”</em>, both 
before and after 9/11.  Andrzej Miziolek, another of the world’s leading experts 
on nano-thermites (Amptiac 2002), is the author of <em>“Defense Applications of 
Nanomaterials”</em>, and <strong>also worked on Richard Gann’s fire suppression project</strong> 
(Gann 2002).<br/>
Gann’s project was sponsored by DOD’s Strategic Environmental 
Research and Development Program (SERDP), an organization that sponsored a 
number of LLNL’s nano-thermite projects (Simpson 2002, Gash et al 2003). </p></li>
<li><p>As part of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer, NIST 
partners with the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head (NSWC-IH) on 
Chemical Science and Technology (FLCTT 2008).  <strong>NSWC-IH is probably the 
most prominent US center for nano-thermite technology</strong> (NSWC 2008).<br/>
In 1999, Jan Puszynski, a scientist working for the DURINT program, helped NSWC-IH design a pilot plant to produce nano-size aluminum powder.  It was reported that <em>“At that time, this was [the] only reliable source of aluminum nanopowders in the United States”</em> (SDSMT 2001), however, private companies like Argonide and Technanogy were also known to have such capabilities.</p></li>

 on nanothermites, goes on to say that “Superthermites can increase the

 wave … used in many applications, including … explosive devices.”
The article says that such nanoenergetics enable “building more lethal
 weapons such as cave-buster bombs that have several times the

<p><strong>Plus, the combustion available in the official story (fire/jet fuel) cannot account for the actual, measurable data:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>Excuse me - are you trying to muddy the waters, or are you just a complete idiot? Thermite != nanothermite. Congratulations on failing chemistry 1.0.1. Or are you now claiming thermite brought down the Twin Towers?</p>

<p>Correct. Nanothermite is far, far more explosive. Thanks for refuting yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you now claiming thermite brought down the Twin Towers?</p>

<p>I&#39;m claiming nanothermite accounts for the VOCs where as the official story combustion (fire/jet fuel) cannot</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>So this is the point where you prove it&#39;s non-existent. The published papers I produced prove otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Researchers <strong>can</strong> greatly increase the power of weapons by adding materials known as superthermites that combine nanometals such as nanoaluminum with metal oxides such as iron oxide, according to Steven Son, a project leader in the Explosives Science and Technology group at Los Alamos.</p>

<p>“The advantage (of using nanometals) <strong>is</strong> in how fast you <strong>can</strong> get their energy out,” Son says.</p>

<p>Son says that the chemical reactions of superthermites <strong>are</strong> faster and therefore <strong>release greater amounts of energy more rapidly.</strong></p>

<p>“Superthermites <strong>can</strong> increase the (chemical) reaction time by a thousand times,” Son says, <strong>resulting</strong> in a very rapid reactive wave.</p>

<p>Son, who has been working on nanoenergetics for more than three years, says that scientists <strong>can</strong> engineer nanoaluminum powders with different particle sizes to vary the energy release rates. This <strong>enables</strong> the material to be used in many applications, including underwater <strong>explosive devices,</strong> primers for igniting firearms, and as fuel propellants for rockets.</p>

<p>Ah, thanks for demonstrating perfectly the arrogant ignorance of the Truther, more befitting a religious zealot. Whatever happened to having an open mind and seeking the truth? Clearly, it&#39;s vastly over-rated when you &quot;know&quot; so much. Still, I guess you&#39;ve got to have blind faith, when the actual evidence is so weak <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/04/conspiracy-theory-poll-results-.html">more Americans believe in Bigfoot</a> than 9/11 conspiracy theories. But, who cares? You &quot;know&quot; the truth!</p>

<p>I guess your touching faith also extends to you proclaiming your &quot;peer reviewed&quot; paper as proof, even though it&#39;s nothing of the sort. &quot;Evidence for energetic materials&quot; does not equal controlled demolition. What truthers like you are doing is as weak as those who proclaim because we don&#39;t know exactly how the pyramids were build, &quot;It must be aliens!&quot; I don&#39;t need to account for the VOC&#39;s. I could just claim there was a secret underground storage tank between WTC1. Because that would explain the spikes every bit as well - and there&#39;s every bit as much evidence for that as explosive demolition. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That isn&#39;t required to prove that any kind of thermite was present on 9/11. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, one of the frequent arguments made for controlled demolition - we see it here virtually every time a building catches fire - is the lack of precedent for steel-framed buildings collapsing. But it cuts both ways. There are no cases of &quot;nanothermite&quot; being used in building demolition. There are no cases of buildings even 1/3 the size of WTC1 + 2 being brought down either. </p>

<p>This lack of precedent also means you have absolutely nothing to compare 9/11 with. So your VOC spikes are utterly meaningless - not least because they do not show the behavior you would expect from their actual use in the manner alleged, if they were the product of thermite combustion. That would be an immediate spike on 9/11 - when the thermite <em>actually</em> combusted, followed by a slow decline. Have another example: if there was a sudden spike of radioactivity five months later, would you take that to mean the building had been nuked? Or that there were quite possibly, other sources?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thermite was used in 1936. Many years before it was built up on the nano-scale to become the much more energetic/powerful/tunable/explosive nanothermite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation needed, as they say. Because you have abjectly failed to show this happened at all on the practical level. But let me see if I&#39;ve got this right. Thermite was used in 1936, then vanished entirely from the map, suddenly re-appearing for one day only, in 2001. And despite doing such an apparently wonderful job, has never been used again since. Yeah, that&#39;s very plausible /s</p>

<p>But I&#39;m happy let you have the last word. Frankly, I&#39;m getting bored of you shrieking &quot;Peer-reviewed! Peer-reviewed!&quot; like a parrot, with no apparent idea of what it means or what the paper in question <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> prove. Perhaps you can then fly off to Venus on your patented spaceship and search for Bigfoot there.</p>

<p>So to recap:</p>

<p>I disproved your entire statement. You tried moving the goalposts. And you can&#39;t use the official story to account for the measurable data. Got it!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stick to the unrefuted published papers/science. You stick to Bigfoot. Suits us both.</p>

<p>It is less significant than you seem to think. I can name you one practical implementation of nanothermite research outside the military that even you might be holding in your hands soon (if you are a firefighter, for example, you might have seen one already somewhere). </p>

<p>Sorry, according to published science, thermite <strong>has</strong> many explosive characteristics. It <em>yielded better explosives</em> back in 2000.</p>

<p>These credentialed papers (multiple from 2002 and one from 2000 - <strong>even though you said nothing 15 years later</strong>) explaining the explosive properties/applications of nanothermite (including military) &gt; your reddit comment which has since been proven false to begin with. </p>

<p>Additionally, thermite accounts for the measurable data (VOCS) where as the official story combustion cannot. </p>
