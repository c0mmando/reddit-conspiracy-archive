       People seem to think they would know if they were living in a fascist police state. Yet, we’ve seen throughout history that it's very difficult to judge one's own time objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think people at Nazi rallies in the 1930s made a conscious decision to turn to the dark side? “Hey honey, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this for some time. I’ve decided to go ahead and become evil. Fascism and mass death are just really in right now; I hope you understand.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not. The Nazis came in and turned the economy around, created millions of jobs, and enjoyed widespread support. There are Germans alive to this day who say the pre-war years were the happiest of their life. And yet we look back today and say, “wow they were living under a comic book level of evil. Luckily nothing like that could ever happen here.”

       Didn’t William Binney, a legend at the NSA, who worked there for 32 years and eventually became its Technical director, call the organization’s current surveillance practices “a totalitarian process – [it] means we are now in a police state."

       Haven’t we been in a continuous state of National Emergency since 1976? Here’s what the Michigan Journal of Law has to say about this matter: “Unbeknownst to most Americans the United States is presently under thirty presidential declared states of emergency. They confer vast powers on the Executive Branch including the ability to financially incapacitate any person or organization in the United States, seize control of the nation’s communications infrastructure, mobilize military forces, expand the permissible size of the military without congressional authorization, and extend tours of duty without consent from service personnel. Declared states of emergency may also activate Presidential Emergency Action Documents and other continuity-of-government procedures which confer powers on the President, such as the unilateral suspension of habeas corpus—that appear fundamentally opposed to the American constitutional order.”

The present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters.

       Aren’t we subjected to constant propaganda? The U.S. military pays the NFL millions of dollars each year to showcase soldiers and veterans at halftime. The DoD works hand in hand with Hollywood; for example, a Defense Department report stated Transformers III “will give us the opportunity to schowcase the bravery and values of our soldiers and the excellent technology of today’s Army to a global audience.” In fact, a 1948 law that outlawed domestic propaganda in the U.S. was repealed in 2013.

       Indeed we are. That's why every protest ends with police shooting and beating. Non-conformity isn't tolerated ultimately. That's why it's good we have cameras to document the impunity with which police enforce the laws that make the state ever more powerful. This behavior has a label called soft authoritarianism. Though it's becoming less soft everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're going to get beat hard by the pigs if we're doing the right thing, even shot. If we allow them to continue, without protest, they become appeased. The blood will flow from nations not just streets then.

       It is less intense in some areas than others. Islands like Guam and Taiwan and New Zealand have it pretty good. And you can go to more remote places in the US like Montana or Wyoming, and there's less people who will bother you and have a greater de facto freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no place on this earth that isn't ruled by a government. Some places are just less able to be actually controlled because of their remoteness, and they don't matter to the government as they pose no real threat or gain.

       Great post! Don't forget that the CIA/Military imported a lot of Nazis into the US after the end of WW2. These people did not suddenly become leftists. It is also worthwhile to recall that the US 1% support Hitler, and while Hitler did get the German economy moving again, he did it by outlawing labour unions and strikebreaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a nice list of the properties of fascist states on the web, and the US meets nearly all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big differences between then and now are 1. Technology. They can do things now that were only dreams for the Nazis. 2. Financial Control. They have endebted us all to the point where we are effectively slaves for them. 3. Near world-wide control. The only countries not in their system are North Korea, Iran, and Cuba. The rest they can turn off their banks at their will.

       The stock market better reflects the 1% and how they are doing, and right now, despite what the government agencies tell the people, we are at nearly 25% real unemployment and near record levels of poverty and income inequality.

       What sucks more is living 20 yrs from college and seeing it all happen, actively speaking out against it, and having no one seem to care,  because of cognitive capture in their own stupid small minded lives and families they think are special.

       There's a show on amazon based on PKD 'the man in the high tower'.  It's supposed to be a 'what if the nazi's won' scenario.  Well jokes on you, it's a social commentary; and a reality not a fantasy.  Yep, the flags are different but the ideology is the same.  Thank operation paperclip for that.

       While I agree to a certain extent, I usually try to remind myself that our understanding of political terms is based on the Hegelian dialect and somewhat manipulated already. Fascism, sort of depends on communism as it's antithesis and we are lead into a false dichotomy. But otherwise I agree.

       In regards to your downvotes: I do not hold a belief towards the holocaust being faked/exaggerated but I do not think that one should be downvoted for simply asking another to look into it.

       Because they got fucked over hard after ww1 and lost a large percentage of their land. Ww1 was started  excuse Germany made a deal middle eastern  counties and was moving oil by train to germany. This pissed England off. You must think the US is much worse than nazis then?

       You're also trapped by cognitive dissonance: the Treaty of Versalles doesn't automatically justify the aggressive expansionist war policies conducted by the nazis from the mid/late 30s onwards. All sides sucked and were evil.

       WWII was a conflict between multiple interests vying for supremacy among themselves. Not a single of those isms, be it the Anglosaxon corporatism, the axis fascism, or the soviet communism gave two shits about anything else other than their respective economic self interests.

       Liberals tend to have a problem with that; they can’t envision the concept of discourse itself, choosing instead to violently (emotionally, irrationally, and in a way that speaks to psychological damage) attack contradictory viewpoints. They go so far as to, well, eat each other. Because eventually they HAVE to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of dissent is so foreign to them that their cognitive dissonance regarding it makes them behave as though they’re not mentally stable.

       But that’s liberals, and that’s another topic.

       So you have absolutely no reply whatsoever and can’t refute anything I’ve said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why reply at all? You’re just embarrassing yourself. Could you maybe pick out ONE thing–just one–that was wrong? Or was none of it wrong? It hurts your feelings to be told the truth, of course, but that’s expected. Still, it doesn’t make me wrong. And it doesn’t make you right.

       Either you forgot the "/s" or your utter lack of self awareness did not allow you to comprehend that you kinda, sorta, proved my point.

       Wow, national socialists being socialists. What a ludicrous concept!

       National socialists being nationalists with a totalitarian government that socializes various industries. How insane!

       No, words don’t magically mean different things. That nigh all European parties are further to the totalitarian end of the spectrum than elsewhere doesn’t mean that liberal parties elsewhere are “conservative”. It just means that Europe is

       liberal.

       Because they got fucked over hard after ww1 and lost a large percentage of their land. Ww1 was started  excuse Germany made a deal middle eastern  counties and was moving oil by train to germany. This pissed England off. You must think the US is much worse than nazis then? Look at all the counties they have have invaded.
