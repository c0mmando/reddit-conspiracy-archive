        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been here for 8 years on reddit, and things sure have changed a lot. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is one of the few remaining places on reddit for real news. This sub looks like what the front page of reddit looked like for the first 3 years of its existence. It was about exposing things, the real truth, and learning about the world. This is what Aaron Schwartz wanted, before they killed him and killed reddit. </p>

<p>All the uncomfortable truths are delegated to this ridiculous-sounding &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; which drives people away who are on the fence. These things that are often talked about on this sub <em>are</em> conspiracies, but they&#39;re also news, they&#39;re speculation or facts about how the world actually works beyond the face of things as we see them. This label of &quot;conspiracy&quot; is a form of censorship in itself, it pushes all the big deal stories to this one small corner of reddit. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re newer to reddit, 4 years or less, I bet there was one day when you found this sub. I bet you went through the frontpage of this sub and couldn&#39;t believe what you were reading. You probably thought &quot;Why aren&#39;t these things being discussed on the news subreddit or the politics subreddit, if they are true?&quot; You may have looked in to a specific story or two, and started realizing that there is something to many of the things talked about here. So you subscribed to the sub, you started reading it regularly. Maybe you decided you don&#39;t care about this divisive label of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, that it means nothing to you. What idiot would be afraid of theorizing about potential conspiracies, given the endless <a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/53_Admitted_False_Flag_Attacks/43969/0/38/38/Y/M.html">lists of historical examples?</a> What kind of sheep is so trained to be afraid of the truth that they run away from it thinking they&#39;re doing themselves a favor? You start to question things in a deeper way once the tricks of culture become more obvious.</p>

<p>Obviously not everything in this sub is true, far from it. But there are some startling facts that have been presented over and over and have basically been proven to be true. Things like the actions of the intelligence agencies in overthrowing and controlling governments of foreign countries. The funding and support of ISIS by the US and Israel, via Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The fact the BRICS banks and the IMF/World Bank are run by overlapping groups of people. The fact central banks and corporations have far too much control over government, wresting control of it away from the people. The US-Israel connection of funding and arms and police training. The connection of Greater Israel with Zionism and the six-day war. The drug trade from Afghanistan, where 90% of the worlds poppies are grown, for US pharma and illegal drug trade profits. The drug wars caused by the US in Central and South America, for profit. The way the biggest oil companies have infiltrated the governments of the world for their own profit. The demolition of Building 7. Regulatory capture. Compartmentalization. Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>These things are very real. These things matter, and drive current events. They are generally provable to be true. They are &quot;open secrets.&quot; </p>

<p>This is the difference between the MSM (including the front pages and main subreddits of reddit) versus places like this subreddit that actually care about the truth, is that they will actually <em>look in to</em> those open secrets. They will expose certain interesting tidbits that are selectively ignored by the corporate media. </p>

<p>Once you start to realize this is the case, and that <em>really</em> sinks in, then if you&#39;re anything like me you experienced a psychological trip of sorts where you realized how bullshit many aspects of our society really are. That deep down advertising is actually predatory and evil, it&#39;s not that people just say that as a funny cliche. That there really are a bunch of psychopaths with no morality or compassion in many many positions of power, because those are generally the only people with the motivation and willpower to go to the terrible depths necessary to acquire a billion dollars or a high political position. They will sacrifice anything for it, including their morality and the lives of others. They have no problem sleeping at night. </p>

<p>You see the ideologies people believe in, like Christianity, or nationalism/patriotism, or sports, or even scientism (belief in the findings of the scientific establishment above scientific theory itself). You see the greed, people borrowing and spending their lives away, trying to get some sort of emotional perk out of it to make up for the hours of drudgery they had to put themselves through to get the money in the first place. People trapped in cycles, in bad patterns that merely reinforce how fucked we are as a society. You see the denial, you see people shut down when you try to talk about the edges of what they think&#39;s &quot;allowed&quot; to talk about. You see people safeguarding their emotions beyond what&#39;s reasonable, beyond facts themselves. </p>

<p>After a while, it crushes you to see it too openly, how many people fall for the bullshit. Everything is so messed up. It&#39;s practically unbelievable. If you were like me, you are probably <em>still</em> in some stage of disbelief at certain aspects of reality even though they are provably true. Cognitive dissonance is something we all suffer from after living in this bizarre culture, the only difference is some of us try to rectify it and others just essentially distract themselves until they die. </p>

<p>This is serious business. These topics strike at the heart of what we think about society, how we think we should treat each other, and what we think of ourselves. What we should be honest about, and what we should hide. What we consider important, and what we consider frivolous. </p>

<p>We here are lucky to have the emotional motivation to seek out true important information, even if it is uncomfortable to digest. Others are not so lucky and hide from the truth out of fear, generally fear of losing social standing or losing income. You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. You cannot save the willfully ignorant, they must save themselves. All you can do is actively make important information available to those who have not been exposed to it yet. There are many thirsty people out there who simply can&#39;t find water, so to speak. If you&#39;re &quot;in the know&quot;, it&#39;s your job to share this information with others so that we can see our world and our human behavior more clearly. This is the information that our culture, media, and schools deliberately ignore despite being true. Once we can clearly see what we as humans <em>are actually doing</em>, then we can start to make adjustments and modifications to it that will have an impact. Otherwise we are just shouting at mirages and illusions. </p>

<p>Did you know that 40,000 people worked on the atomic bombs that blew up Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but only a few hundred of them actually knew what they were making? This is the power of compartmentalization. Everyone makes their little part, and only certain people have the knowledge to see how all the parts come together. Those people are playing the rest, in a sense. Human society is like this in a way, we are all &quot;making our piece&quot; and the pieces come together in ways many of us don&#39;t anticipate that profit a very few, like a war or bank bailouts. We each only see our little world, our motivations and fears in our daily lives. We react correspondingly to the avalanche as best we can. Few question where those motivations and fears came from in the first place, and fewer question if they&#39;re even necessary at all. </p>

<p>We program ourselves like a computer, our actions in the present create the conditions that allow the future to occur. &quot;Be the change you want to see in the world&quot; as Gandhi said. But also be the change you want to see in yourself. You can do it, you&#39;ve been doing it your whole life. Just take their reigns of your own mind for yourself. Take off the training wheels of mainstream culture. It is not your friend, it is there to control you. To put your motivations and fears in to little boxes that serve the corporate and governmental machinery, all through your TV or internet connection. 5 corporations own 95% of American all media, from TV to movies to magazines. And it just keeps getting more propagandistic and consolidated, week after week. Did you see one of the biggest Hillary funders just bought The Onion?   </p>

<p>The first casualty of war is the truth. The time to talk is before there is a war. Now is the time to spread the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s getting to a point where the corruption is so solidly ingrained in the system that it doesn&#39;t even matter if we know anymore. Let&#39;s face it, even those of us who know that shit is fucked still won&#39;t ever get together and do anything about it. The general consensus is that if shit goes down, then everyone is gonna Rambo up and somehow fight the power. What a load of shit. Without any structured resistance we are all fucked, and whenever anyone even tries to organise something it gets shilled, bought out, shut down or any other manner of discrediting it and diverting/distracting the people once again. Look at the tea party movement, or Anonymous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, that&#39;s a common problem of modern movements in the US. Occupy wall street had that problem too, it got infiltrated, derailed, and then maligned in the public eye through the media. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t fully realize <em>that</em> fact yet though, this is another thing that can be talked about more. No one will fall for this trick if everyone knows about it. This would make a movement that would be resilient to infiltration. </p>

<p>There are ways around this stuff. There are good plans and good ways of doing things. We just have to talk about them a lot so everyone knows about them, because the mechanisms that are supposed to be doing that for us (school, media, culture, etc) are not. So it&#39;s up to us to spread the word about these vital things so less people fall for the tricks. It&#39;s not all in vain. Giving up is giving the powers that be exactly what they want. If they could have a society of 300 million people who had given up in defeatism but still show up for their jobs, they would take that society in a second. That&#39;s probably what they&#39;re trying to eventually engineer. But they always push it too far too fast, and history shows people generally do have a breaking point. </p>

<p>America is unique because of the amount of pharmas and drugs affecting so many people, along with an intensely pervasive and overwhelming culture, make the variables a little strange to compare to historical examples. Large-scale poverty and lack of jobs leading to calls for revolution is nothing new, though. There&#39;s a lot to consider, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the problems that seldom gets talked about is that, although there are many of us who recognize many of the problems, we don&#39;t all have the same goals in mind for the solutions. Some of us are still clinging to various aspects of our leftist, cultural Marxist conditioning and are determined to have various leftist platforms retained or strengthened. This fragments us as to goals, or outcome. We all see the main problems, but we have conflicting solutions, and that keeps us from being effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the silver bullet, if one exists, is Basic Income.  Once people are no longer enslaved to work they can spend more time self educating and becoming more politically active.  Or they will have the time to research and develop potentially disruptive technologies that have a chance to lift us from this current dark age.  Right now we do not have economic freedom and because of that it&#39;s easier to control intellectual freedom and political activisim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that basic income will be necessary and will be a great thing at first. It will free up tons of people to do lots of things once there is a universal unconditional basic income. </p>

<p>My fear is that having this dependency on a government could create a lot of chaos. Right now 1 in 7 Americans depend on food stamps to survive. Imagine if that was 90% of Americans. Imagine how much power that gives entities that might take over the government, as corporations have currently done with the US government. Having such a concentrated amount of power over people opens the doors for people to be fucked with en masse, which is one of my biggest hesitations about basic income. It is a long-term worry, as compared to the short-term benefit it would initially bring.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I think <em>locally-funded</em> basic income is the way to go. Instead of collecting the tax money nationally or internationally, gathering it all up in a pile of trillions of dollars, and then sending it out, is just asking for corruption, imo. Too much concentrated money in one place. So instead, I think there should be a system of local basic incomes instituted. Where the money is gathered in a local community and the rules are made by the community. So while it would be unconditional (ideally), the amount and exact terms would vary as you go from locality to  locality. This fixes the concentration problem and creates some competition between systems which makes it less corruptible. </p>

<p>With automation and globalization, basic income is inevitable. In the future there will simply be less jobs than people wanting jobs. Unless we get better at dividing labor and institute a 20 hour work week or something. But to do that would require nationalizing healthcare, since companies could not front that burden of extra healthcare cost for so many new full-time employees. Also incomes would have to rise, which there is no incentive for because there is a labor surplus and no labor movements (probably also because there is a labor surplus and people are in competition with each other as workers, instead of being able to band together to ask for more rights and pay). So with no incentive for wages to increase, it seems obvious they&#39;re either going to let a lot of people go poor and destitute and the middle class die along with the consumer economy that is the engine of the US economy because no one has money to spend, or there is going to be a basic income system. The companies are shooting themselves in the foot by destroying the middle class and I think that realization is slowly starting to dawn on them. The middle class are the people that buy companies&#39; stuff, and less and less of them have disposable income as the years go by, so the companies will have no consumers and thus no profit. </p>

<p>So if we&#39;re going to save the economy, there will either have to be a huge war that makes the US the only economy left standing, so it can sell repairs to all the countries that got destroyed, like we did in WW2. And even if that happens, god forbid, it wouldn&#39;t work forever, it&#39;s not a sustainable game plan to maintain an economy to keep destroying the world to repair it for profit. So the only thing left is &quot;helicopter money&quot;, aka giving out money to everyone, aka basic income. There&#39;s no other way to motivate sales outside the military-industrial complex, and I think that has grown quite enough already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already have national Basic Income and it operates at a surprisingly low cost: Social Security.  Approximately 0.4% administrative costs.  Expanding that to include everyone and not just the elderly would put a lot of scrutiny on them to keep it honest.  Again, one of the ideals is that Basic Income enables people to be more politically active and call out politicians if they try anything fishy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is &quot;income&quot; in itself. Income is simply a religious talisman, a creation of human belief where it only has power when you believe in it. Too many people believe that trinkets, paper with fancy pictures on them, gems, gold, or whatever is something that should be valued. If that belief were replaced by values on each other, on other people rather than &quot;money&quot; then society will change. They can only control you if they control your beliefs, you give them power by believing in paper that they can print. Money is an illusion, if a giant comet hit the earth today, you would soon find out just how  valuable that money/income is: ZERO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are first up against ourselves, our own insecurity that we cannot make concrete judgments without society&#39;s convoluted perception. Everything is simple when you strip away the layers of lies. These manipulators we are up against, their only tool is deception as method of control because they need us to form their power structure, without us they have nothing . It&#39;s all about human control and therefore robots won&#39;t replace us, that would be like freeing the human population, but rather they will integrate us with robotic technology so we are more easily maintained/ manipulated. We are the Centre of everything, and the whole power structure requires control of us, not the destruction or replacement of the slave class.</p>

<p>Edit: once you realize the whole power structure of our world is a stage, a sort of theatre of well orchestrated fictious  events and facts..and the only thing real is the actors and the Audience(us), the target whom they wish to deceive in order to prevent us  from seeing what is the real nature of our existence. Waking up to this deception is the only thing you need to accomplish. We don&#39;t need to save the world, the world is made up of the will of many. 
 Each must find its own way out of the darkness. Often we Truthers feel that despair only comes in finding out we cannot change the will of others to seek the truth, but trying to changing manipulate  the will of others is the first evil, isn&#39;t? For good or for bad. I like to think Truth has its own intrinsic value to heal even without it being accepted by others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is indeed the silver bullet. If people felt secure about being able to keep living, knowing that there is an unconditional financial safety net for them in the worst case scenario that they won&#39;t be able to provide for themselves, people would actually feel a lot more inclined to work, voluntarily. People would choose jobs based on what they feel would be the best they could do for humanity. If working was voluntary, people would actually aspire to work, because they would feel motivated to contribute to the mutual effort of taking care of those who aren&#39;t in a position to be working currently, for whatever reason. Because people actually like to take care of each other. We&#39;re naturally biased to want the same basic well-being for each other that we know is necessary to be able to carry on. Or at least that&#39;s how I think people really are.</p>

<p>But this bias is suppressed by our culture so much that most people would say that, actually, they find this sort of thinking quite counter-intuitive. A lot of people are convinced that life is supposed to be overwhelmingly difficult for everyone, that people ought to work because they should have to work, that giving people money to enable them to help themselves is a waste of money because it will spoil people into some kind of lazy brats who just want to do drugs all the time. People are actually convinced that this is what the average human naturally wants to do if provided with free income.</p>

<p>However, the truth is, we do not need the government to help each other. Our culture wants us to be isolated individuals looking out primarily for ourselves, probably in part because that strategy is so effective in helping to keep people from organizing and changing things in their own corner of the world, on their own. We&#39;ve grown up to think that it&#39;s a bad idea to live close to our friends and relatives, that it&#39;s a bad idea to work with people you&#39;re close to, and that it&#39;s especially a bad idea to help each other financially. That is all bullshit. </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with teaming up with the people closest to us. That is where the change in our culture needs to happen. We shouldn&#39;t expect the government to help us out, we shouldn&#39;t expect the activists to protest and make change happen, we shouldn&#39;t expect wall street billionaires to share their money with us, we should work more with each other and help each other as much as we can. Make sure your friends and loved ones aren&#39;t overwhelmed with the amount of stress in their lives. Parents, allow your children the opportunity to not have to work for a while if they feel like that would help them a lot. And then children are supposed to help their parent when they become too old to work and their retirement savings fall through and their social security is insufficient. Family members are supposed to be there for each other in difficult financial times. If people just loved each other more and didn&#39;t allow our divisive culture to suppress their gut feelings of wanting to care for each other more and wanting to be generous with each other, the world might not need a revolutionary uprising or an apocalyptic event or any government at all. Or God.</p>

<p>This. </p>

<p>Why is there no subreddit dedicated to this one goal? </p>

<p>This thread hits right on the head for me and got me thinking, why isn&#39;t there a subreddit for people to go to, point out flaws and wrongs in societies (laws, political corruption, economics structures, homelessness, world hunger, lack of electrical gridlines, lack of resources in general, lack of good education or any, any form of discrimination against another human made of the same stuff as you and I regardless of age/gender/race/nationality/ect, legal loopholes, legal monopolies, ect) and then work together to construct logical and possible (within the confines of our infrastructure) solutions to solve these problems?</p>

<p>If we&#39;re looking for a step to better humanity as a whole, wouldn&#39;t that be the first logical choice? In a nutshell, a place for humans, whom have a strive to better mankind and help achieve it&#39;s peak, to discuss and create logical and peaceful resolutions to better humanity worldwide.</p>

<p>While yes, most of you think &quot;What can of ideas, solutions, or hell, even a change could a bunch of redditors or people on the internet accomplish?&quot; </p>

<p>Truly think about it; these &quot;Leaders&quot;, &quot;Scientists&quot;, &quot;Politicians&quot;, ect. that the majority of the population hold above them are all just other Humans, they are made of the exact same goey and wiggly shit as you and me, they have just been given these titles and &quot;power&quot; either due to their knowledge, finances, or birthright. </p>

<p>So with that in mind, I&#39;m gonna go over those three key items that give other humans &quot;power&quot;, get to the point, and finish this rant of mine;</p>

<p>Knowledge; Education is not a piece of paper, while most colleges do achieve a very well done and streamlined method to educate you and further your intellectual power, colleges/schools/ect main and primary purpose IS that piece of paper.</p>

<p>Everything you learn (and then plus some) at these institutions I can 100% promise you can find and learn on the internet or at a library. The only difference between the two (in our society) depends on; your ability and capability to learn, and whether your future/dream career needs a degree/education. </p>

<p>So when it comes to a human whom has a title of &quot;power&quot; above you due to Knowledge, that is an illusion you bring upon yourself either due to your unwillingness to educate yourself or holding the belief a piece of paper gives one access to a higher form of information otherwise inaccessible.</p>

<p>Finances; At this point in my rant I really don&#39;t need to put much thought, I think most people on this subreddit know money is a joke, it isn&#39;t backed by anything but other government and people&#39;s debt and it&#39;s a glorified slaving system at it&#39;s finest. So with that, I&#39;mma try and wrap this up;</p>

<p>So, how does the normal average joe earn good money? </p>

<p>Higher education. </p>

<p>So if you&#39;ve come to terms with the fact that you need a fancy piece of paper (That indicates you&#39;ve listened to someone telling you what you could have learned from free resources) to get a high paying job, you&#39;re now going to pursue an education.</p>

<p>You are pushed to believe that you need a degree to get anywhere in life. Which, to a point, is true. Higher education is needed. However, the large cost of tuition is not. </p>

<p>So, you go out and attend college for a major that is specific (usually) to a few different career opportunities. To pay for this degree, you now have pull out student loans. Unless, you’re lucky enough to receive FASFA or other scholarships. (Student loans in the US tend to have the highest interest rates.) Most students have to work their way through college to make ends meet, while trying to pay on their loans. </p>

<p>After you’ve finally completed college and graduated, you’re ready to start your dream career with your diploma. So you start filling out applications, you write up a resume that’s spot on, and you nail your interviews. You’re feeling great about getting the job you want. But you never receive a positive call. It turns out, there’s someone else who holds the same degree as you, and they got the job. </p>

<p>It turns out like that Every. Single. Time. and if somehow you&#39;re the one who got the job, someone in your same boat more than likely didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So, for the argument sake, say you didn&#39;t get the job, so now, before you know it, you’re a year or maybe two years out of college and you still haven’t landed that dream job. You pick up a job that your training is extremely too extensive for. You start to feel like you wasted years of your life on a degree that, right now, is essentially worthless. To top it off, you’re stuck paying these students loans that extremely high interests rates on them. </p>

<p>The bottom line is: you’re around 25 years old, 50,000+ in debt, and wanting to start your life but you can’t. You’re stuck. You did everything that society has told you that you should do and you’re now you’re stuck paying for it the rest of your life while working these dead end jobs, unless you’re lucky enough to finally land that dream job. </p>

<p>So in this system, if we wish to better ourselves we must help push this slave system and keep it alive with our own struggle, that&#39;s how perfect it&#39;s built for those in power. </p>

<p>So when it comes to a human whom has a title of &quot;power&quot; above you due to Finances, It is because of the illusion you give to money, it is how far you are willing to hold money dear to you. These financial tyrants in &quot;power&quot; do not single-handedly perpetrate these crimes on humanity, they are carried out by those whom are stricken by the harsh world of finance, whom have been pushed to the brink of death due to the lack of this paper god, and the system that requires it&#39;s need. Much like someone addicted to opiates, when it&#39;s come to the point of death or survival, morals are thrown out the window. These people should not be to blame, it is this vicious cycle and system that causes these eventualities. When money is viewed above morality by the masses, the vicious cycle of &quot;power&quot; continues.</p>

<p>At this point in my rant I&#39;m supposed to go to Birthright, finances weren&#39;t supposed to be very long but look at how that went, I tend to get into too much detail and rant if you can&#39;t tell already.</p>

<p>Birthrights are very straight-forward, essentially, it&#39;s dad giving you a boost on your bike and showing you how to ride instead of learning it yourself. It&#39;s anyone whom had parents or relatives with a mass of finance or &quot;power&quot; that got passed to their lovely kin.</p>

<p>So when it comes to a human whom has a title of &quot;power&quot; above you due to Birthright, it&#39;s the previous two illusions, they just got a nice and early start my friends.</p>

<p>Alright, so now that I’ve attempted to bring these illusions of “power” to light, truly think; </p>

<p>What is so different, on any level, between us and those in “power”?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>They just have enough broken humans, and a system built to produce more broken humans to protect and strengthen them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get a bunch of downvotes seeing this as just some leftist hippy rant, or maybe not, but I would just like to thank the OP of this post to spark the encouragement to write this whole rant, I normally don&#39;t post whatsoever on reddit, let alone Conspiracy, but I felt I just needed to get my outlook out there. </p>

<p>TL;DR - I believe the strongest problem with society as a whole are the forces that drive us to continuously separate us from every level, age/gender/race/power/nationality/income/interests/ect, and our inability to join together as HUMANS to formulate a legitimate plan to solve all the world&#39;s problems with logical solutions.</p>

<p>SUPER DUPER TL;DR -  Our world is screwed unless we make a positive change in our government and our society as a whole and as one in entirety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your first question,  I did. Twice. Both were infiltrated by obvious  pranksters, trolls, shills, whatever. Then, I was shadow banned, allegedly for linking my new sub in threads on this one and also for creating posts which called out specific people, despite those people being public figures who always get discussed in other media...and so on. Then, I was banned, my efforts mocked, and I left because, Why keep wasting my time. </p>

<p>I learned, sadly, after 3 years of Reddit, that the moment you get close to the places that truth seekers try to find, efforts to actively derail, and then overtly silence, you are made- relentlessly.</p>

<p>I tried on a couple other sites, but the users and forum weren&#39;t conducive for my efforts, and I have the responsibilities mentioned above which make it so that I cannot devote the necessary time to this. (Job, children, etc.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so now we&#39;re getting somewhere. The problem is that reddit is still seen as the default gathering place of the internet, despite the fact that we can&#39;t actually discuss anything of substance on it. That makes it seem like the most important thing we could accomplish is to replace reddit with a new version that the elite will never be able to control. Or rather than replacing reddit as a whole, there needs to be an independent site for discussing how to better humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right with the challenge being presented with using a SMC to essentially decompose the entire point of Facebook and similar social media sites being used to cull social data or bring the masses into a certain wave of thought. There would also be the question of how we could tie this into real, on the ground action that would actually make and impact. I know there are several movements going on already that have attempted social revolution (zeitgeist, collective evolution, just to name a couple) that haven&#39;t necessarily provided much to answer the question, &quot;I&#39;ve woken up, been awake for a while, now what do I do?&quot; </p>

<p>Being awake is one thing, but using that awareness to bring others to that same level of conciousness and commit to some real action is something else entirely. Fortunately, people are thirsty for a change of pace, most who are even slightly aware are realizing that things aren&#39;t adding up in the main narrative. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all just people trying to express joy, and I&#39;m very strongly interested in joining with others and work towards cultivating this joy as a collective, not just as some small group or set of individuals. </p>

Or independent, which may as well not even exist, because it is so ingrained in us that the left or the right are the only options and a moderate view is crazy talk.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t say these things. You can&#39;t speak your mind without labeling yourself in extreme terms, even if you disagree with what those parties represent. It&#39;s a pro wrestling show. It&#39;s good guys vs. bad guys. They&#39;re putting on a show for the public, but backstage they&#39;re talking over their spots and who will say what to get heat with whichever group they&#39;re talking to at that time. And each election gets more ridiculous than the one before it.</p>

<p>Our country has always been divided over issues. But it&#39;s become so much more extreme lately. I don&#39;t even like discussing politics because you never know what sort of can of worms you&#39;re going to open up when you do so. I hate that I can only tell a very small select amount of people what I really think about all of this and everyone else I either have to ignore it or give some wishy washy answer to whatever they&#39;re rambling about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel for you brother. I consider myself very lucky that I can watch from afar, and that I will at least have some warning when shit starts to collapse. I am still constantly amazed with how out of control things have gotten on the world stage, and especially in America, in the last few years. I know there was decades of shit going on setting it all up, but your country is now Nazi Germany 2.0 (I won&#39;t even get into the details of how literal this statement is, I&#39;m sure you have all heard of operation paperclip, and all the other financing/colluding the went on before/during and after the war). And there appears to be no attempt at hiding it anymore either. Your own people are getting the short end of the stick, but are so helplessly entrenched in the system that there seems to be no way out. I hope someone figures it out, for your own collective sake and for that of the rest of the world. 
People shouldn&#39;t have to kill each other because someone else tells them to. We shouldn&#39;t be killing one another over land or resources, we have the technology, even in the public sector (not to mention all the important technology hidden over the last century) to live in a post-scarcity society. How hard is it to forgive one another when we make mistakes? What happened to Altruism? And love for your fellow man? I&#39;m not religious, so perhaps I just don&#39;t get swept up in the religious fervor, but why must all religions be mutually exclusive? I know that everyone wants to live in a better world. When are we going to get our shit together and make it happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this entire thread has just hit me again and again, maybe it&#39;s not the first thread with this many responses and this kind of discussion, but for me it&#39;s the first with so many different aspects/views that, more times than not, I can relate to or just overall resonate with me.</p>

<p>On top of that, there seems to be a lack of heavy or absurd criticism, any argument seems sound or at least reasonably sound viewing the argument with another&#39;s point of view.</p>

<p>Only thing left I can say or contribute is this;

<p>for some reason to me this thread could be summed up with this, and sadly (or perhaps ironically) from what I&#39;ve witnessed looking for said clip, it seems heavily censored and pulled from youtube, yet it&#39;s something so non threatening whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think things are on a generally bad enough track that something bad will happen of its own accord. There&#39;s always something for people to get legitimately upset about, you just have to wait. We are on a train headed toward a cliff. The important part is priming the minds of the population to understand and react to what happens in an intelligent and appropriate manner, which is the opposite of what the MSM trains people to do. </p>

<p>All you have to do is help people connect the big dots, the big ideas about what actually drives current events. This is the meta-game, to help people realize the truth. The rest happens by itself, and like you pointed out is often a way for getting in trouble. </p>

<p>Instilling an opinion is much easier and more tricky than building a wall or stealing, and this is taken advantage of by greedy people and organizations without morals or compassion. We have to beat them at their own game by creating our own culture, fight fire with fire. We must have more &quot;cultural pressure&quot; (Think Civilization V) than the corporate media, if we out-talk them volume-wise, we win because we have more of a presence in the American culture. This is why we must each become our own mini-media broadcasting station of sorts, as I have done to some extent with the articles I occasionally write. Find a medium you like, and say your truths loud and proud. If you get corrected, that&#39;s good, learn from it. This corporate media flood can easily be overwhelmed by genuine self-created culture if people make the effort. We know what resonates with us, and one heartfelt truth can make more of an impact than a thousand focus-grouped corporate advertisements ever could because it resonates deeply with people. </p>

<p>People just have to rise above their fear and speak their truths out loud where people can hear them, that&#39;s all. If we all did this, there would be a cascading effect. We all have our own story, we just have to tell it where people can see it. </p>

<p>If enough people do it, people en masse <em>will wake up</em>.  Most people generally go along with what the culture is. If we change what&#39;s in the media people consume, we change the culture. This is a cultural victory, a victory of minds and opinions, this is how we should try to win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not despair for all it takes is time. Don&#39;t forget that you were once just like those that you speak of, we all were. And if you think that certain people are unsalvageable (they&#39;re not, nobody is, but let&#39;s pretend that&#39;s the case for the sake of argument), you still need to take into account that with every generation more and more will come to the same realizations that you have.</p>

<p>You see, young minds are more open, more plastic, less prejudiced, and this isn&#39;t just because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">anchoring</a>, it has to do with the fact that children can reject what was previously learned with much more ease than adults. If you present multiple points of view to a child, they will choose the one that makes the most sense. You just have to refrain from saying &quot;you&#39;re right&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot;, because then they will trade their opinion for whatever opinion will appease you the most. It&#39;s critical that you don&#39;t force them to believe anything, they have to reach conclusions on their own.</p>

<p>All you have to do is catalyze them to engage in rational though by providing contrasting opinions, even if you don&#39;t agree with them, and tell them to keep an open mind because there&#39;s always the chance that what they believe in is incorrect. With this, they should arrive at logical conclusions on their own. Remember: you&#39;re not teaching them the truth, you&#39;re teaching them to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think protesting is putting yourself on the receiving end of power. If you want to make real change you have to operate from a place of strength, not weakness. Protesting sets you up as the victim, demanding that some individual or group stop an action that you should have been involved in stopping in the first place though direct action. I.E stop supporting that institution or countering it directly with the tools at your disposal.</p>

<p>A better solution is for people to directly invest in taking over the supply and demand of the corruptible influences. Or use common law to go after the violators of freedom directly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You indicated the our big problem. We tell ourselves that we will never unite and so we rarely ever try to do so. If some of the more competent and committed members of a community like this come together to do research and create news and/or information outlets, we can make a difference. We fear disruption from the powers that be. We fear ridicule. At some level we know what to do and have a bucket of fears/excuses keeping us from doing it. We need to unite in common cause, with confidence and dedication, and most importantly, not halted by fear. Fear is the real glue of the control systems in our lives. When we don&#39;t buy the beliefs that lead to the fear, the control systems falter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet, there is a grass root movement growing all over the planet, where alternative systems are quietly being built. People are growing their own food, opting out of taxation system, building alternative power generators and bartering. They are using alternative therapies, eating organic food and sharing their cars and homes. 8 years ago almost none of that was possible and now if you talk almost anybody in the street they are aware. When all realize that it is affecting everybody, there is nothing to hide, it will be the end of the old systems. The tide is coming, and it will be beautiful and terrifying at the same time.
However, when you finally wake up from the brainwashing, often you feel like you just want to leave and go somewhere else. It can be overwhelming</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had what I thought was a great insight on why that&#39;s so.</p>

<p>The thing is, no one is willing to fight while they still have something to lose. Being a society that takes &quot;bread and circus&quot; to a whole, absurd, new level, I find it easy to understand how hard it is for people to even imagine giving up on the comforts of modern society to try and change anything.</p>

<p>The other thing I noticed is how the powers the be have been losing patience and abusing their position. Instead of keeping the cow happy while milking it, the banks are knowingly generating crashes that bring misery to the population. The state is intervening and exposing its true malign surveillance intentions like it didn&#39;t before, and it may just be that a big catastrophe or a poke in the people too much could tip the start of a movement like Occupy or like the 60&#39;s that actually goes further and brings bigger change.</p>

<p>To make it simpler, we are way to concerned about safety in a world where safety doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s and illusion, but it&#39;s what controls the masses. That simple but so powerful feeling. Safety and its analog, and the actual controlling part: fear.</p>

<p>In the words of Benjamin Franklin: &quot;Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety&quot;.</p>

<p>What took me longest to understand, and I believe I still haven&#39;t FULLY gotten, is how safety is an illusion. Any safety. And how deep is our craving for it, all of us, as human beings. My conclusion is that there are only two real motivators to human beings. We act either out of fear, or out of love. Pretty heady stuff.</p>

This has been a slow, deliberate, or even accidental, process over the course of many, many years. Things were put in place many ages ago to make it the way it is now. Obama only added to things that were in place when Bush was in office, who added to things that Clinton did, who added to things that daddy Bush did, and so on and so on. Things get changed, tweaked, whatever, but its never been an immediate process. And whoever gets elected next, no great changes will occur, despite what both sides tell you.

You are noticing because of the drastic measures to try and sustain this illusion in an non-sustainable world.</p>

<p>This is the illusion of control - ever since the dark ages of kings, the churches were way better at it than the corporations unfortunately advertising killed the church and the banks and corporations are controlling the worlds economy right now and they have no idea what they are doing - that disjointed bunch of morons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a conversation I was having yesterday I proposed a series of scenarios beginning in 2017 that lead to escalation. A few sizable politically charged demonstrations pop up in metropolitan areas throughout various states as a result of an election &#39;upset&#39;, perceived by the losing side. Various protest groups such as BLM, a second attempt at the Occupy movement, some of these backed by Groups like Oath keepers decide to follow suit, some of them turning violent after a strong police presence and coercion.</p>

<p>At a few of these demonstrations, individuals allegedly claiming loyalty to &#39;ISIS&#39; will manage to smuggle/manufacture suicide vests into one of the assemblies, and take considerable amounts of lives. Thus escalating the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/30/nypd-bill-bratton-anti-terror-unit-black-lives-matter">powers afforded to police forces</a> to &#39;contain&#39; the increasing violence and tension.</p>

<p>I feel this has potential to escalate to a point of no return, though it is hard to predict considering the overlapping variables.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually got into a heated debate with my SO about this the other day. She felt if we were taxed/burdened/starved/ect enough by the government that the people would eventually strike back and take over, much like with Mexico and it&#39;s government cycle. She even used some of the previous Washington DC protests as examples. I however told her something very similar with your argument, I feel the day and age we are in now is too different, I feel with the majority of the population being sheeple, the minority of those who would truly stand and fight against these injustices would just be taken out one by one whether or not they are protesting violently or peacefully.</p>

<p>Just look at the Oregon Federal Reserve standoff, it&#39;s been completely covered up, the final half of the standoff was live streamed through phone conversation, if it&#39;s still on youtube (found it while typing this; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=616S8t9tek4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=616S8t9tek4</a>), I&#39;d suggest looking it up and then reading all news articles that have been posted afterwards, it&#39;s quite disturbing really.</p>

<p>People who were promised amnesty for walking out peacefully are now being locked up for life because the FBI supposedly found a dig site on the lands that had &quot;Indian remains&quot; as well as the protester&#39;s &quot;Urine and Feces&quot; defiling them.</p>

<p>EDIT; I also want to stress, these people weren&#39;t the most bright and shining examples of what we&#39;d want to fight for our rights, most of them were bible thumping and patriotic, not to say those aren&#39;t good traits, these traits in these people however were just very... extreme.</p>

<p>EDIT#2; lol, I dunno why I feel I need to add to this, but the point I was trying to make with the OR guys was
TL;DR - Eccentric ≠  Terrorists, and while they were negotiated with thus proving they aren&#39;t, I feel they were viewed as gun-toting crazed rednecks trying to take down the government because they can&#39;t have guns or marijuana. </p>

<p>I agree that &#39;The people&#39; aren&#39;t likely achieve any kind of &quot;victory&quot; from a violent revolt, but I do share magnora&#39;s view that centralized Government tends to fail one way or another when enough time has passed.

    <div class="md"><p>IMO our job right now is to help more people wake up.  We get to critical mass, the 100th monkey and solutions will present themselves automatically.  Below are some steps that might help wake someone up. </p>

<p>1) Know what you are talking about.  Before you try to sell me your Truth you should know your material and more importantly, know how to communicate it to me in a way I can understand.   This is your responsibility.  If the Truth can be told so as to be understood, it <em>will</em> be believed.  </p>

<p>2) Open your mind to the possibility that you might not have the whole story either.  If you can’t do this then you are no better than the closed minded masses you are preaching to.  An enemy of Truth is thinking you already know it, so remember to practice humility.   </p>

<p>3) Motivational Interviewing.  This technique is used by therapists to help people change destructive behaviors.   We may be able to use some of the steps here.  When practicing Motivational Interviewing it is important to do it in a non-confrontational way.   This cannot be stressed enough (see humility comment above).   What we are trying to do is lead the person to come to the realization themselves.  If they can experience their own lightbulb moment, by their own effort, their changed belief will have a much better chance of taking root.</p>

<p>The first thing we do in Motivational Interviewing is identify which Stage of Change a person is in, and then meet them at that stage.   There are 6 Stages of Change:</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1:  Pre-Contemplation</strong>
The person is not open to change. They are closed minded, fearful or entrenched.  Immediate denial and anger is common response.</p>

<p>Stage 1 Primary Task:  Raise awareness by offering factual information. Point out provable facts they can research on their own. You can point them to the information but they have to do the work themselves. You can’t do the work for them and you must respect their freewill if they choose to ignore.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2:  Contemplation</strong>
The person will contemplate your ideas but is skeptical or ambivalent.  “So what if 911 was an inside job, it doesn’t affect me”.   </p>

<p>Stage 2 Primary Task:  Resolve their ambivalence.   Show them how 911 DOES affect them.  Focus on their core values – For instance, if family is a core value then talk about how the Patriot Act affects the safety of their family.  Perhaps courage is one of their core values. Frame your argument around this.  Add in open ended questions about what it means to have courage. The goal is to get them thinking critically and talking through it.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3:  Determination</strong>
They are starting to see the light and are determined to learn more but don’t know what to do, where to go, or what information is valid. </p>

<p>Stage 3 Primary Task:  Help identify valid sources of information.  Realize that most people need to be gradually introduced to some of these topics.  For me the starting point is 911.  It was a watershed event that has enough factual information that can be used as a launch pad to open a person’s mind.  Realize that cognitive dissonance can set in and cause a person to relapse back to Stage 2.  If this happens you must “meet the person where they are at” which means going back to Stage 2.  It is common for people to go back and forth between stages.  </p>

<p><strong>Stage 4:  Action</strong>
The person is taking action toward change but has not stabilized the process.   This can be a frightening time for some people as they begin to see the world for the first time.  The loss of their world view and the realization of things as they are can be traumatic.  </p>

<p>Stage 4 Primary Task:  Offer encouragement and help reinforce their new beliefs.  Point out new facts or recent events that strengthen the new belief.  A new belief is like a small plant that needs to be nurtured.  Identify risk situations that could cause the person to relapse. For instance warn them about the volumes of disinformation or explain to them how paranoia is common and offer coping mechanisms.   </p>

<p><strong>Stage 5:  Maintenance</strong>
Has achieved change and is working to maintain or strengthen the new belief or behavior.  They are waking up.  </p>

<p>Stage 5 Primary Task:  Maintain supportive contact.  Highlight the progress that has been made.  Set new goals and introduce new topics that will further expand their awareness.   Encourage them to share their knowledge and help others wake up, perhaps using these steps.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 6:  Relapse</strong>
Experienced a relapse and went back to previous beliefs or behaviors. Fear, cognitive dissonance, ambivalence, normal life stress, etc. These are common causes of a relapse. </p>

<p>Stage 6 Primary Task:  Re-frame the relapse as a learning opportunity.  Talk about how normal it is and share a story about a setback of your own.  Meet the person at whatever stage they are now at and begin again.  If the person has truly been exposed to Truth they will feel drawn to begin again.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People will always focus on resolving internal issues before working on external. As long as internal issues remain unresolved, they won&#39;t lift a finger to work on anything else, no matter how much they believe in it. I believe that more people are aware of the issues then we think. They just won&#39;t act.</p>

<p>We are too involved with ourselves. The focus is on the self. There&#39;s a reason Apple makes everything with &#39;i&#39;. It works.</p>

<p>First it was the programs by Edwards Bernays (Freuds nephew) and Anna Freud (Freuds daughter) - driving consumerism and focus on the self/ego. Highly successful programs which various governments took part in. There&#39;s a BBC documentary called the &quot;Century of the Self&quot; which shows just how far these programs progressed. 4 hours long, but well worth the watch.</p>

<p>Then came the debt cycles. Auto and home loans were manageable, at least early on. But credit cards and then student loans sealed the deal. It is very difficult for someone who is in serious debt to focus on external issues. The weight/stress of debt tends to ensure an internal focus.</p>

<p>Finally, social networking popped up to promote narcissism, especially in young people - the future of any nation. It&#39;s all about the likes, the selfies. The Ego takes precedent above anything else. If Edward Bernays was alive today, even he would be shocked to see the level it has reached.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also social problems, family problems, alcohol/drug related issues, but those would be understood pretty clearly - a person dealing with these issues is going to be internally focused.</p>

<p>Education about the issues is a good start. But unplugging from the Ego, the self, the debt is also required. And these things take a lot of time and effort to resolve. And these things are not usually seen the cause of people to be docile. </p>

<p>You watch a YouTube video explaining a problem, with evidence. You believe it. It burns you. You might comment. Then you move on. Mitchel &amp; Webb Look, Key &amp; Peele. Cats. Babes. Etc. Someone else will deal with the problem...</p>

<p>(sorry for the bad grammar, english is not my native language)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, writing from a stream-of-consciousness perspective helps keep it fluid and engaging. I just go with the flow of my thoughts with a basic starting topic in mind and let it grow from there, edit it a bit along the way, and then re-write the title after I stop and step back and look at what I have written as a whole. Then I post and re-read and edit a few times until I&#39;m happy that it says what I really want to say. </p>

<p>This process really works for me, took me about 2 hours in all to make the OP, which I think isn&#39;t bad especially considering how cathartic it is to see how much it resonates with other people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post.  I would like to share my experiences with you, if you don&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in all of the &quot;conspiracies&quot; that you listed, but I believe in at least some of them, particularly as it relates to the financial system as well as wars in general, which would include ours and Israels.</p>

<p>I came to my &quot;conspiracy&quot; views differently than most.  That is, rather than reading them online and coming to believe them, I came to believe them in principle before reading about them online to gain more insight.</p>

<p>This came about from the years I spent living in third world countries.  I have lived in a few, but let me focus on Kenya, which had the biggest impact on me.</p>

<p>In the third world you see humanity in it&#39;s most raw form.</p>

<p>In Kenya, (I did not see all these things, but heard about them and researched the things that happened before my time) you saw very direct corruption.  You saw:</p>

<p>Police working hand in hand with criminals.</p>

<p>The government issuing arms contracts in order to get kickbacks that were needed to fund the next round of elections.</p>

<p>The government literally printing money and pocketing it in order to fund the next elections (this is an important thing most people don&#39;t realize.. most political corruption exists not to put wealth in personal pockets (although that is done) but rather to win the next election.</p>

<p>You also saw the political leaders of the Kalenjin and Kikuyu tribes manufacture conflicts in which people died in order to strengthen their own position within the tribes.</p>

<p>Later, laughably, when there was an actual reform movement that might end the Kalenjin and Kikuyu back and forth tradeoff in power that had existed since independence, the two tribes actually got together and now share power so they could keep the corruption rolling (and this duo exists in power today).</p>

<p>When I saw all this is shocked me.  Americans read stories like this and talk about how corrupt everything is in Kenya and other african countries, and it is.</p>

<p>It was when I returned to the US that I realized that everything is the same, just covered with a heavy layer of veneer.  </p>

<p>the politicians do favors for campaign contributions.</p>

<p>Wars are manufactured to gin up popular support.</p>

<p>Money is printed and dolled out to friends (not literally, but the effect is the same).</p>

<p>And, in essence the parties go back and forth in power, and when threatened basically team up, hence the inherent friendliness between the Clintons and Bushs while there is outward hostility by both to Sanders and Trump.</p>

<p>The lesson I learned from all of this, which is what I really wanted to share, is that I don&#39;t carry a psychological burden from this.</p>

<p>The people in Kenya (or Colombia, Albania, and other places I have been) don&#39;t carry a burden from observing the world as it is and on a day to day basis accepting it for what it is.</p>

<p>That is how I view it. Yes of course I try to get my friends and family to understand reality, but it&#39;s a long sale.  You can&#39;t jut tell them or they will think you are nuts. </p>

<p>So i slowly let info creep into their brains, but all the while I don&#39;t carry a psychological burden, I just accept the world for what it is.</p>

<p>EDITED out a few spelling mistakes.</p>

<p>That is a deep thing to realize. We are all just humans in the end, everywhere in the world. Thank you for sharing your perspective. My psychological burden has downsized a lot to be more in accord with the amount of power and influence I actually have, but I don&#39;t think it will ever go away completely because I still have <em>some</em> power, and I should try my best using my abilities and resources to make a positive impact on culture, because that will continue on long after I die. </p>

<p>However I fully respect and understand people who have no desire to try to change the world and just feel burned out. There&#39;s no obligation for any one person to fix the world, it is a huge huge mess. But, &quot;being in the know&quot; in a way, we are a bit privileged and it&#39;s nice to help others to find their way, people who simply haven&#39;t been exposed to vital information yet. So thank you again for sharing your perspective and taking part in that process that helps out everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowledge without understanding is nothing but pure arrogance, this world needs more understanding if humans truly want to grow as species and learn the truth... all this must be done before we reach our full potential, sad part is very powerful minority will never let this happen. Also they know that FREEDOM is the most important thing on this planet and that CONTROL is everything to them and with lies, distractions, manipulating and advertising this so called american western culture (i&#39;m sorry but it seem usa is gone and was designed to rise and fall from the start, just like roman empire and even germany... its like they always have a backup plan, china is next big thing i guess.) they will change and own this planet, culture is a very powerful weapon and with todays tech everything becomes easier with each passing day !</p>

<p>This world is headed to a very dark and dystopian future for majority... one can only hope that before its too late people will realize what truly matters and do the right thing not for them selves but for everyone else, The World as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;ve stumbled through life trying to work out why there is so much unnecessary suffering. We have the technology to grow food enough for all, purify enough water for all and give everyone the basics to make life a little more manageable. There is a point to be made on over population, there are too many of us for the current system to provide for. We are to wasteful in our production of goods, we don&#39;t recycle nearly enough as we should and we are making a mess of our only planet. But that&#39;s just one road. </p>

<p>We could have society that is raised and nurtured on our best traits. Love, sharing, joy, community, harmony. Call it what you want. Instead we are raised in a system that perpetuates greed, materialism and drags us ever farther away from our true selves and what we really need to be happy. Which is to feel worth, to feel loved, to feel part of something bigger and better than ourselves. </p>

<p>We could have a future filled with robots and virtual reality and technology we can&#39;t even imagine right now. We could automate practically everything we do to allow us time to soul search and learn and laugh. </p>

<p>In another life, another world, there are a group of smart almost hairless monkeys who are overjoyed that they have overcome manual labour by building machines to do the work for them that takes up so much of their time. Now they can spend that time with family and friends, enjoying the small glimpse of existence that is afforded to them. They can use that time to live.</p>

<p>And on another planet, a very similar group of hairless monkeys who have already built the machines to give them a better life will continue to bicker and argue over meaningless stories and plastic shapes and how many &#39;things&#39; they that are &#39;owed&#39; or &#39;want&#39;. </p>

<p>They will continue the constant battle to appear &#39;better&#39; than those around them and never grasp that reality. We are all here, we are all suffering, we are all one and we are in this together. I don&#39;t know who said it above but it made me smile wider than I have in a long time. &quot;WE are HUMAN&quot; Every single one of us. No me, no I, no them, no they. We are human. All of us.</p>

<p>I would like to add that you can&#39;t restrict the search for truth to what you can definitively prove. </p>

<p>There is an esoteric nature to this world, and whether or not you choose to accept that reality will greatly influence the &quot;truths&quot; you arrive at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;This is serious business. These topics strike at the heart of what we think about society, how we think we should treat each other, and what we think of ourselves. What we should be honest about, and what we should hide. What we consider important, and what we consider frivolous.&quot;  This paragraph is so huge.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned the good people in my life that love me will at least listen for a bit.  It&#39;s still pretty crushing that most people don&#39;t even want to talk about these things, and perhaps entertain alternative thoughts.  I don&#39;t care if my perceptions are wrong.  If I&#39;m wrong, great, show me.</p>

<p>I told some friends that the onion was bought out, nobody gave a fuck.  Their moon landing bit still makes me laugh to tears.  Where there was satire and humor there is now propaganda.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve suffered from depression for at least 20 of my 40 years.  On and off meds.  It&#39;s become debilitating in the last couple. Now I pretty much sit in a bedroom, listen to music, and paint.  I made a step last week to navigate back out of it.  I got a psychologist that I think has enough wisdom to help me out without meds.</p>

<p>Godspeed</p>

<p>Second, the cultural/entertainment betrayal has been the toughest one to take. Politicians, meh, I always kinda knew they were full of shit (though realizing they&#39;d create false flags was a step beyond). But seeing blatant cultural propaganda and societal brainwashing trotted out as entertainment has been the shocker for me. It&#39;s tough to watch any television -- my god, what they&#39;ve done to &quot;The X-Files&quot; is staggering -- and most movies. At least I&#39;m reading more.</p>

Talk about compartmentalization; most of these people aren&#39;t evil, most don&#39;t have a clue about the potential harm their industry does.  I am now basically sitting around, fighting depression and existential angst, and wondering how to put my skills to use in a way that I can live with (certainly not editing COPS, which I had an offer to work on).  I&#39;m open to suggestions from everyone here.  What kind of videos could/should I produce? I should make a post of my own about this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you though, there&#39;s all kinds of opportunities to do, especially with the internet now. It&#39;s just a matter of finding a format that works and using that to make yourself an income. </p>

Nothing will stop the machine. The machine (mostly the arm of the media) will control what is seen and how it is seen. the real truth we can all live with is there is nothing we can do. I am all for trying to get the truth out, I try every chance I get. It will never matter, the media will label you/I a crazy and thats it, game over. If you dont believe me, try and not let your own children or grandchildren experience christmas, tell them santa is a lie (its the truth) and see what your own community will do you you and how they will treat you and your children. See how your children or spouse look at you. I think that is the simplest test one can do, cancel christmas at your home. If you can do that you might stands a chance fighting the machine.

    <div class="md"><p>I really liked this post, thanks for sharing.</p>

<p>The power of propaganda to alienate human beings not only from the truth, but from their own capacity to live an authentic life, is really quite troubling. No other art form in the history of man has been so thoroughly (and successfully) opposed to the notion of human freedom than that which calls itself &quot;public relations&quot;.</p>

<p>There is simply no room for autonomous thought in a culture that provides economic incentive for mass manipulation, which is why it&#39;s no surprise that reddit abandoned it&#39;s original goal, <a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2009/02/our-freedom-from-press-shirts-dont.html">to free users from the limited perspectives offered via conventional media</a>, long ago.</p>

<p>If that original mentality had held up over the years, as moderators formed closer relations with admins, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/27/277352_reddit-cofounder-alexis-ohanian-visit-.html">perhaps Alexis wouldn&#39;t have felt it was acceptable to run social media consulting firms while seeking out contracts from DoD off-shoots</a>, perhaps the lassiez-fare attitude about moderator corruption would be addressed, perhaps <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wouldn&#39;t have to serve as a replacement for <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>.</p>

<p>Losing nearly all of reddit to consolidated interests, out only to control the curation of content on the medium was a  devastating blow to the free flow of information. Although, if there is a bright spot for truth in the current climate, it is perhaps that the lessons learned on reddit, with regards to how power is subtly consolidated behind the backs of most users, will enable other replacements (like voat, snapzu, or hubski) to ward off such threats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been into &quot;conspiracies&quot; all my life like UFO&#39;s big foot etc, but in particular military and gov corruption since 9/11. I&#39;ve done it all-handed out leaflets. Created docs met dr.griffen, hosted programmes, and I&#39;m sorry to say it but I feel like I may have wasted my time. I&#39;m 40 now. It took so much energy out of me over the last 15 years and I&#39;m not sure that seeing the world &quot;the way it really is&quot; or just being generally aware of high level elite manipulation has added any quality to my life, if anything it just makes you more depressed. I&#39;m also surprised that I never see any pro new world order posts for example, I&#39;m not for killing people and perhaps crisis actors and staged events are one way around this for tptb to achieve their agendas. A one world system would be awesome, things are getting better in a sense that our quality of life has improved vastly over the next hundred years, and I can only see more abundance and less labour for our future children. Money is also a concept that is bound to change, there are huge changes coming in the next 200 years and onwards, there will eventually be no need for corruption. Put it this way, if the un/America/the bilderbergers got everything they wanted tomorrow, how do you think the world will look? We all walk around in white clothes saying hail rothchilde? Common now who&#39;s been watching too many movies? Let&#39;s say everyone&#39;s tracked, good, no more terrible atrocities, there are real killers and assholes and religious freaks out there. Cars farming transport everything automated, great so humans are free to create. Integrating with technology and biotech to improve ourselves perhaps catalysing our evolution/self healing life longevity , we will be the ubermarch neiche talked about. To get to this level a lot of ideals cultures and control need to change in the world, who are we to question certain agendas? It&#39;s not like they can just come out and tell the truth to the world, of course we have to be led in step by step. Minds don&#39;t change overnight. As for media, what I&#39;d give just to sit and enjoy stupid programmes like the Big Bang theory and be entertained, what a great life it would be. Again it comes down to blue pill red pill, but don&#39;t be so sure that the blue pill is all that bad, it may not be the truth, but it will protect you from going fucking insane. /rant fin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a scientific study once that studied cultural movements. In particular, this one studied the acceptance of nuclear power in the US. Americans were skittish of atomic energy after the atomic bombs dropped in WW2, and didn&#39;t like the idea of building these nuke-energy buildings in their areas. But from 1950 to 1975, nuclear energy went from being wildly unpopular to being mostly popular. That&#39;s a large cultural shift. The study looked at the people who worked to cause this particular shift. At the start, small groups worked very hard to try to sway people, they did all the things you did, leaflets, TV and radio shows, and so on. After 5 or 10 years of doing this, people got super burned out, saying it wasn&#39;t working. The point at which it was nearest hitting critical mass and succeeding was the moment at which the largest number of supporters were completely burned out. From their perspective, they had been pushing for years and years, without seeing much change. However the change <em>had</em> been happening, it was just very glacially slow and in addition very difficult to detect because of the &quot;echo chamber&quot; the advocacy people had in effect placed themselves in during their advocacy. It&#39;s hard to get a good read on what is happening in the big picture when you&#39;re so close to something. </p>

<p>The combination of factors leads to people like you. I thank you for all the desire to guide people toward the truth. I can guarantee you if you were hitting on things worth talking about and people were able to find your message, you had an effect. 99% of the people affected probably never said anything, nor will you ever be aware of your effects on them. That doesn&#39;t mean those effects didn&#39;t happen. If you are putting truth out there in to the culture, you did a good thing and you should be proud of yourself for doing it without needing the immediate feedback of knowing your work had an effect. You were incredibly ahead of the curve with some things it looks like. Don&#39;t fret, the doors are opening. There&#39;s 7 billion people, it&#39;s going to take some time for everyone to get on the same page. </p>

<p>I can understand your frustration, it&#39;s justified. You can give up and stop spreading the truth if you want, you&#39;ve already done a lot. I wouldn&#39;t blame you one bit. Just know that you <em>are</em> having an effect when your word gets out there. Bit by bit, this is how culture is shaped. </p>

<p>“A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.” -Greek Proverb</p>

<p>Planting the seeds of ideas that will grow in to the culture of the future is a very important task, and anyone who takes that task seriously is someone I appreciate. We build a better society by starting the important conversations that may seem unconventional, but are oh so important. Don&#39;t be afraid to take time to relax too, though. Everything is best in moderation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our earthly evolution seems to have been solidly usurped by the forces you speak of. But, we are a part of a larger system, dynamic, nature, call it what you will. And it is here that we are not just a cog in a wheel but subservient to forces greater than are humanly possible, understandable (for the most part), etc. Yes, I&#39;m talking beyond the physical realm.</p>

<p>I get the feeling on Earth School, we are exactly where we need to be. And by saying that I am not giving in. Rather, the masses have. I will still do my best to be a human being and not a robot. Rise above and hopefully let go of what you think you and your identity are. Live as benevolence would.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not giving up but rather wondering what life actually is. I really get the feeling it is much much much more than what we see, realize, write about, etc. Those who direct us can only steer this ship so much, for they themselves are a part of a much larger &quot;system&quot; (and I&#39;m understating greatly.) And perhaps even they, are serving this great &quot;good&quot;, actually, I bet they are.</p>

<p>Live your life as you see fit, but try to understand what you are. And look into Love, not tradition, culture, media, etc. Discover it for yourself. The ship has sailed but perhaps we don&#39;t have to stay on the ship and again, those driving the ship only think they are driving the ship. Someone else is controlling the wind, currents, drivers, etc. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post. I discovered Reddit around 2006, due to Digg&#39;s V3, which drove me to look for an alternative. I distinctly remember the first exposure. I could not get past the front page because there were so many interesting and in depth articles... time sink!</p>

<p>Reddit was critical in my awakening and that happened from a 9/11 post to Loose Change&#39;s video in 2007, and that was on the front page. Let that sink in. A sincere&#39; Thank You&#39; to Aaron Schwartz. And he was murdered.</p>

<p>As for the psychological burden. It&#39;s not easy. But we are already in a war, in fact we were born into it. A war that has been raging for millennium. The few ruling/controlling/enslaving the many. And the main battleground is your mind. Deception is one of the primary tools of the controllers, and hence the Truth is always enemy #1. Thus, those who seek, reveal, and speak the truth will be targets.</p>

<p>The question is not &#39;Am I deceived?&#39;, the question is &#39;In how many unique areas am I deceived and what is the depth of deception in each?&#39;. Thus it is impossible to ever be fully awake, and never assume or think you are. The Truth is buried under layers of lies. Keep your eyes and mind open, use and sharpen your critical thinking skills. Always ask &#39;Cui bono&#39;?... who benefits? Remember the Alt/Truth community is thick with shills, disinfo agents, charlatans, and wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing.</p>

<p>Turn off your TVs, Radios, and computers. We can plainly see how the Smartphone is being used to control the masses. But the smartphone is but a portable computer. I&#39;m becoming convinced the most powerful tool of control to date is the network connected computer, in any form. The coming VR craze really concerns me, that device takes it to a whole new level of immersion and entrainment.</p>

<p>We&#39;re already in a war. The decision for each person is whether they acknowledge this fact, and if they/you do, then are you ready to defend yourself and fight back?</p>

<p>Free your Mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually like the title of conspiracy. If you put forward good evidence and a cogent argument, most people can see that pretty clearly. And shills are so easy to spot and shut down.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you put forward flimsy crap for evidence and a ridiculous argument, people quickly see what it is.</p>

<p>And when you mix it all together, side by side, people can develop a pretty good eye for bullshit versus fairly obvious truth.</p>

<p>And at the end of the day, people can look at what is here and decide that there is something to it. That conspiracies do exist and affect them on a daily basis. That if you look just past the headlines and the MSM, there is real nasty shit going down. If we get a few more people every once in a while to see what the real deal is, eventually we will hit a critical mass. </p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t hurt that the PTBs are becoming so transparently incompetent and obvious about it. The Republican party establishment screwed with Ron Paul last election, now the Democrat party establishment are screwing with Sanders this election. For anyone watching this happening, they are becoming very aware of the establishment conspiracy to elect their establishment candidate, going so far as to making an absolute mockery of what should be a democratic process. The foundation of everything that Americans value is being flushed down the political toilet.</p>

<p>So keep reminding people that conspiracies do exist and they are being hurt by it daily. In the job market, in their paycheck, in their ability to raise a family in safe environments with clean drinking water, with personal rights and freedoms as guaranteed in the constitution and the declaration of independence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. I am glad you still remain positive. This is something that I have struggled with for a while now. I was positive at first, very outgoing and willing to talk about things. Over the years my enthusiasm in trying to help people wake up has come crashing down. I realized that most people simply don&#39;t want their idea of what is reality to change. They will fight tooth and nail to keep themselves ignorant. I have too many other areas of my life that are important to me and deserve my time that I can&#39;t spend hours every day/week fighting with people who flat out do not want to wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend wasting time on the willfully ignorant, as you&#39;ve seen it&#39;s futile. However, there are lots of ignorant people who want to learn, maybe 1 out of 10, so just keep trying to connect with those who wish to learn and grow. </p>

<p>Focus your attention and energy on people who use it to better their own understanding. Don&#39;t waste energy on people who are trying to remain ignorant, they must fix themselves. Do not cast pearls before swine, as the saying goes. They do not appreciate them. Save your important ideas for those who may appreciate them. Plant your idea seeds in fertile ground, not on concrete, and you get much better results. I just wanted to let you know that it can still be an exciting adventure of exploring information and growing with others, you just have to find them, and not to be too frustrated by the masses of people with their head in the sand. They&#39;re doing it to themselves, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about them any more than you can turn off the sun, so just focus on the people you can affect and things become much more pleasant. That&#39;s my strategy, anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m afraid this subreddit is about as good as it gets these days. Voat is nice sometimes, and fark can be good just to center yourself, it&#39;s fairly centrist and is funny. There&#39;s not many great sites out there right now as far as I know. You can try googling &quot;reddit alternatives&quot;, I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a couple good ones but I haven&#39;t found anything quite like here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re at the point where even the most adamant deniers truly know deep down that the system and society is broken, corrupt and nearly un-winnable. People remain willfully ignorant because of societal desensitization caused by the foundation set upon one from birth. The public or even private education systems are not designed to teach us useful information, consequences of our actions, how to survive in society, or even prepare you for a life of debt. School is there to hold your hand and stuff ideas full of &quot;America&#39;s great, you can be whatever you want to be&quot;. </p>

<p>So with a defeatist attitude right out the gate, we are subjected to aiming super high in gaining dream careers that are never as easy to achieve as advertised. Since people are taught this way from a young age, it&#39;s hard to convince people that everything they learned is a lie. This was a carefully constructed process put into effect over generations to weed out 99% of people from becoming very rich, a core value in society. People would rather join the corruption than oppose it. </p>

<p>So real social change is close to impossible for the average Joe to accomplish, the &quot;real&quot; changes that have occurred lately; fraudulent third wave feminism, socially engineered racism and the gay agenda were all backed by the political elite and millions of dollars to divide and concur the majority, to keep them from forming. </p>

<p>Thus I am merely citing the issues and obstacles in accomplishing the OP&#39;s dream goal. As a Christian, believe his corruption is intentional and is operated on a spiritual level, against principalities and powers and therefore corrupting the minds of the elite. There is no reason anyone should be held in higher esteem than another person but here we stand divided.</p>

<p>I would love more people to gain motivation and seek the truth but the real truth is that we live in a modern world full of people who want more, more, more with selfish ambitions who would more like to cover their own ass than help their fellow man. The internet provides us our best chance to save as many people as possible before all hell literally breaks loose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are serious huh? Ok here is what you don&#39;t understand obviously. </p>

<p>The entire premise of this sub is toxic by design. It breeds a mindset of superiority because of so called knowledge. You don&#39;t know anything more then anyone else. Your mind has gotten so stressed cause you won&#39;t stop. In turn your mind begins to make patterns where there isn&#39;t any.</p>

<p>What do you really think is gonna change by if you really got to the bottom of 9/11? What would it do? I can tell you it would destroy the way of life for millions of people within this country. The dollar would lose its value because there wouldn&#39;t be faith in our own government.</p>

<p>While you say fine fuck it. What about those that are not prepared or will riot and subsequently die in the coming waves of civil unrest?</p>

<p>No nothing is going to be done by anyone in here because of one reason you won&#39;t come from behind your anon status. You hold it so dear to yourself because you fear the man. You have this unwarranted fear for no reason. Some youtube video of a person getting fucked up by the cops that started well after the initial contact occurred. </p>

<p>All the sudden its fuck the police. So many in here are just children that are mad cause they feel they deserve better well you don&#39;t deserve anything. This world owes you nothing and you will get even less. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t need to question the establishment you know what cause they are unwilling to change it. For over a decade we have had a two party system in our government and no one has changed it. </p>

<p>Hell if flytape is actually a us citizen he should be able to run or president. I use him cause I know who he is. Anyone that is a us citizen should be on the ballot by design. Yet none of you talk about that. No its 9/11 or Fuck da police. Our food is poison. </p>

<p>Just mindless shit without solutions to the problems. None of you talk of the real issue with out country today either. Education. What did you learn in school? Like really learn in school.</p>

<p>The time for us is done people its done. We can change one thing that&#39;s the way our kids and their kids are educated. Not a one in here has said a word the fuck about it. </p>

<p>No its blah the sheep......chem trails and flat earth people are stupid....look what bullshit someone is involved in.......fbi coverup.,......sandy hook false flag........</p>

<p>FUCK all that nonsense. There is nothing you can do too change the narrative. Nothing. Pick a fight you can win. Why waste time with shit you can&#39;t. Goddamn physics professors and shit are on the 9/11 case for decades and nothin has changed. Why do you think that is? </p>

<p>Revolution isn&#39;t going to happen within the usa. It won&#39;t get that shit out of your head. People see no reason to be at war right now with each other. They got too much to lose. So get them motivated for their kids. You can this subreddit has some real shit diggers in it that can go after education and tear it apart. </p>

<p>Not some stupid shit from a publisher talking about common core and making it sound like it was a common core spokes person either. Really make some shit happen. Something no one can attack you for within the other subs. </p>

<p>that&#39;s my two sence just downvote as per usual</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s full of real people. Least the ones that comment. I doubt any type of shill behavior is needed. Trolls sure cause its so fucking easy to piss them off in here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 100% of lazy fucks that are content with bitching and feel their contribution is reposting stories someone else wrote at some time.before.  It&#39;s nothing more then recycled <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> , <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> , <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and so on. </p>

<p>Same shit with bernie supporters. They donate their insignificant amounts of money and feel it&#39;s what makes a president. Lol what they don&#39;t realize is that people like Hillary or Trump make more then that in a day off interest from the banks their supporters own. </p>

<p>Like police. People want to bitch about DUI checkpoints or asset forfeiture. Yet they don&#39;t want to pay taxes. Lol if you had people pay their property taxes I doubt police would issue as many fines. They wouldn&#39;t need to seize shit so they can pay for equipment.</p>

<p>No we are supposed to think the police are all evil. Like they are not human. They are not allowed to make mistakes. They fuck up hell I doubt anyone in here could make it one night. </p>

<p>Participation is what makes them compliant. They continue to participate within the game that is designed by the Masters. Even I do. Cause I for one don&#39;t break the rules that are set. I am content with my life because I did the unthinkable.</p>

<p>I applied myself and made something out of my life. Holy shit what a concept. </p>

<p>Sure my life sucked I wasn&#39;t even able to make it to the next paycheck and I was pissed. All the time. Then I thought about it. I figured out that I could change my own outcome without help.</p>

<p>My wife supported me with my decision. People don&#39;t know the difference in here cause they just want! They feel they deserve it cause they want it. Lol you deserve nothing and will get less from this world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the devoted who read this far into the buried comments,</p>

<p>I always think its funny. I made a post like this a few days ago. This one says keep talking, gets sticky gets gold. One critical difference though. Talking makes money for reddit and other media we&#39;re basically against. Going out and doing something disenfranchises the powerful, even if it&#39;s just talking.</p>

<p>Truth is we&#39;ve been at war ever since WWI. That&#39;s not going to change. Talking about how governments are morally corrupt in every specific instance, like were gonna be able to take them to court and punish them somehow, is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Talking and voting only matters if people respect each other. The powerful have no respect for us, further than is required to subdue us.</p>

<p>What will always matter is that when people rise up you support them immediately, even if you completely disagree with their politics. Any blow to the power structure you can be a part in makes a difference. By joining together we deny the establishment our cheapened labor and thus refined resources.</p>

<p>We must practice taking our power back as often as we can.</p>

<p>We have a larger enemy, the establishment. Ally, rally, protest against it.</p>

All your problems will be &quot;solved&quot;... provided you bang you head long enough on the floor during your full kowtow to the Chinese.</p>

<p>Sometimes we get so fixated on the past, that we get blindsided by the future. Bam! It&#39;s coming, and it&#39;s going to hit hard. All your USA internal conspiracies will vanish in an instant. And you&#39;ll have a whole new set of bogeymen to worry about, your new Chinese masters.</p>

<p>Stop fixating on the past! Wake up to the future. China is already at war with us. China is goose stepping across Asia. Russia is goose stepping across Europe. And the USA is doing nothing. Little green men, and now little red men are everywhere, including every Western country.</p>

<p>If the USA doesn&#39;t stop fixating on internal self-criticism, it&#39;s only a matter of time before those green and red men are on your doorstep too. FFS get out of YESTERDAY&#39;S mindset!</p>

<p>I think a viral video would make this a lot more accessible, so if anyone wants to use the text from this post or any other one of mine, go for it. I&#39;m not great with making videos but I could try to learn. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always infinitely more. We all need to keep digging, but we shouldn&#39;t get over-obsessed with the pursuit of digging as that can be bad too. Don&#39;t forget to stop and smell the roses sometimes on this trip through hell. There&#39;s still plenty of beauty out there, and I think this sub is a beautiful place because I can write something like this post and actually resonate with people who understand what I am getting at.</p>

<p>Have you heard GLP is likely a disinformation front? There is evidence it&#39;s a US intelligence agency&#39;s disinformation front program. It&#39;s one of many places where theories like &quot;flat earth&quot; or &quot;CERN opening a wormhole&quot; come from. These theories are repeated ad nauseum on GLP and other sites, and some people start to buy in to it. They tie it with &quot;conspiracies&quot; to scare people away. </p>

<p>This is the trick sites like GLP use and why they&#39;re useful to governments and companies, to be like a lightning rod to &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; to gather them all in the same place, and then poison the well of public discourse with crap nonsense theories, thus discouraging legitimate discussion. Especially since they instantly ban anyone who mentions anything I just mentioned above. </p>

<p>Occasionally there is something good, but it&#39;s a pale shadow of what it used to be, and astoundingly worse and more controlled than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, especially when you try to interact with it.</p>

<p>I would write something, but I&#39;m spent for this evening.  Saving this thread.  Great comments.</p>

<p>edit: Now that I&#39;ve had some sleep, I really want to thank you for this post.  It&#39;s exactly the kinds of things I think about <em>all the time</em>, and often it feels like I am the only one who does.  Thank you for expressing things that are oh so difficult to even broach.  It&#39;s tough enough to say these kinds of things to your closest friends, let alone to the general public.  </p>

<p>There are people like you and people in this thread that I wish i could know in real life.  There are too few people who truly <em>think</em> about the nature of this thing called life, the way you have here.  I agree, if we truly want humanity to continue, (and sometimes I don&#39;t think we deserve to go on) we must express the kinds of things you have here.  There is no option.  We can&#39;t keep going on as things have been, it&#39;s a sure path to destruction.  Again, you are a wonderful person in my book.  Keep this up, and we might have to elect you to run this joint!~</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You see the ideologies people believe in, like Christianity, or nationalism/patriotism, or sports, or even scientism (belief in the findings of the scientific establishment above scientific theory itself). You see the greed, people borrowing and spending their lives away, trying to get some sort of emotional perk out of it to make up for the hours of drudgery they had to put themselves through to get the money in the first place. People trapped in cycles, in bad patterns that merely reinforce how fucked we are as a society. You see the denial, you see people shut down when you try to talk about the edges of what they think&#39;s &quot;allowed&quot; to talk about. You see people safeguarding their emotions beyond what&#39;s reasonable, beyond facts themselves.</p>

<p>I started crying while I was reading that because it&#39;s so fucking true. Thanks for taking the time to write this, it&#39;s a comfort to know there are still people who care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be a lonely world and even lonelier when you find enlightenment comes and grows at a cost. How do you choose? When coming closer to the truth only pushes us farther away from others and our lifelong false knowledge and sense of peace and security and oneself . I ask myself,
How much can I handle knowing, how far can I go, how much lonelier will it get?
Will I ever be carefree again in the world I knew, will I ever wake up from this nightmare world of present, will I be cursed to symptoms of oppression, forever cynical, on guard, factoring and questioning every angle present while holding together normalcy in a state of constant suspicion? I share knowledge that most don&#39;t want to know. I wonder will I leave this earth without making a difference without setting it free. I can&#39;t let that be because that&#39;s not who I am bc even though my heart is inherently good and light im not a chump sheep. I&#39;m glad there&#39;s this little corner of Reddit I feel safe here, it&#39;s comforting to come here, learn and read others posts and feelings and find out more and know that they are not too far from me &amp; mine in this state of mind when I have those kind of moments in this world of uncertainty I&#39;m glad there are other learning open minds and I get back to optimistic, I&#39;m ok, Im not so alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m at a crossing point myself..  I am constantly reworking the way my life operates since becoming aware of our reality.  It started with comparative mythology, moving onto eating right, removing toxins from my environment, body and mind, not supporting corporations I don&#39;t agree with by bringing my purchasing power else where, reading lots, rewiring my bad habits, meditating, sharing info with those that ask (esoteric rule of introducing occult[hidden] information is only when they ask) and knowing how to present my thoughts clearly and concisely, finding a job that doesn&#39;t support the government (income tax) through my pay etc.  I have scared more than my fair share of friends away in the early years.  My hair (at age 23) started changing white from being in perpetual shock from each new finding.  Book after book just left me with more questions.  I finally reigned in most of that and focused my research and time on productive activities.</p>

<p>I have to smoke green two-to-three times a day to blur the edges and not think so much about our current paradigm.  I have to express my despair through art, music and other creative outlets or consume other art constantly or else I would probably not be here today.  I have brought another life into this world recently, and I am trying to do every thing I can to make this hardcore world comprehensible to her.</p>

<p>So here I stand.. staring at what I wish the world would work towards, versus where I see the world heading based on today&#39;s actions.</p>

<p>There are a number of people who have come together to create and participate in a gift economy; an alternative to our screwed up system. It may or may not be the answer, but in the very least, it is a group of people assembled (virtually), exploring other systems besides the one we have. It is a beautiful concept and, I think, well worth a few minuites of your time. <a href="https://www.hylo.com/c/sustainablehuman">https://www.hylo.com/c/sustainablehuman</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading this made me want to share a bit of information about myself that perhaps someone will benefit from, hopefully as much as I have. I was 14 years old and a friend of my fathers gave me a bunch of dvds, one was a 9/11 theory that to me was enough to be quite convincing. From then on I&#39;ve always tried to see what&#39;s what and never have my opinion influenced by people whom i don&#39;t trust. This lead to a difficulty managing school and education, employment and maintaining relationships with a majority of people. Luckily I&#39;ve had 1 person stick by the whole time and together we&#39;ve developed a backbone that we deem unbreakable. We build a relationship around the morals that compel us to never be lead astray and never settle for anything that we feel doesn&#39;t comply with our ethics. I would like to mention how heavily the Zeitgeist documentaries impacted us, we truly believed/believe this is the way humans must go to obtain a righteous life. A band called Enter Shikari also have help motivation levels stay high and not lose focus of what is at stake. It seems to be an amazingly sturdy foundation and honestly we can&#39;t understand how other people set up partnerships anymore. I&#39;ve recently enrolled in my first proper education after a few years of this horrid feeling that I would never find proper motivation in a career that could fund our lifestyles, which many people will understand is a atrocious feeling, the feeling that this world has nothing but empty entertainment and no place for someone daring to hold themselves to a higher standard. Philosophy I have found has some incredibly interesting areas, I in particular am driven towards understanding human morals, ethics and what it is to be happy and how we can achieve a honest, happy life. Without this discovery I feel I would have wound up unhappy, unmotivated and before me viewing a world that had nothing to offer and little reason to be. I wish that upon no one and if anyone still searching for that something that will wake you up in the morning perhaps philosophy has something to offer you. For me, it already is playing a hugely important role to finding happiness and meaning in my life. It&#39;s funny how posting something so sincere to me will have no impact at all and perhaps I&#39;m a terrible writer currently and my attempts to convey an emotional retelling to inspire someone will be fruitless but I have 1 goal in life and that is to inspire people to see for themselves how great they can be and to never let themselves be held back or pinned down. As far as I can tell we have no purpose here so at some point in my life I decided to make one for myself and here it is. Lastly, because I&#39;m tired and rambling and have always wanted to type this lyric somewhere..We&#39;ll never let go of the microscope. No matter how callous the shells. We&#39;ll harness the heat of the sun and we&#39;ll burn you out of fucking existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore you must always keep in mind that a path is only a path; if you feel you should not follow it, you must not stay with it under any conditions. To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life. Only then will you know that any path is only a path and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you to do.</em> </p>

<p><em>But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition. I warn you. Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary.  All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. ... Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn&#39;t, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn&#39;t. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.&quot;</em>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good nice thank u! I feel the same way. I don&#39;t watch any MSM anymore because of how fake I know it to be. And yes its hard knowing all these truths and not being able to do much about it, besides just repeating what we already know to other people, which I try to do, whenever I see the opportunity.  But I disagree with you that we are &quot;stuck in a cycle&quot; working to buy things. I mean there are plenty of people with legit, useful, or interesting jobs, like doctors, engineers, technicians, dentists, teachers, etc. That really try to make a difference or do some good. What else can people do, if not work to make a living? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I walk through life everyday like the scene in World War Z when Brad Pitt injects himself with the virus and walks through the hoard. It&#39;s tough to say the solution to the current system, but the system is doomed for a collapse if no reformation or revolution occurs. The cure is to loosen government control, in my opinion. Exchange services and labor instead of using the notes the federal reserve lets us use. They&#39;ll lose tax revenue gradually and become more dependent on us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s no blueprint for any sort of organized effort to overthrow TPTB. Previous wars and takeovers were fought without the benefit of media and sedative drugs on the side of the state, providing a level of complacency people are terrified to be without, thus ignoring the real issues at hand.</p>

<p>While we&#39;re too cognizant to buy the BS, it&#39;s still incredibly effective. But lately, things ARE moving too fast, because they realize they&#39;re beginning to lose the info war. Regardless of awareness, people don&#39;t want to give up their guns, and they don&#39;t want a chip under their skin (mostly). These types of things are going to be pushed heavily to the next generation, and our job is to keep the young people informed enough to reject these ideals.</p>

<p>it is not always the case, that knowing the truth can help you make better decisions as it is only so when your decisions can affect the outcome.</p>

<p>and the more you know, the more you see, the more you realize how insignificant and helpless you are in steering the big picture.</p>

<p>it is a ride, with a fixed path the road is only wide with lots of distractions hence we dont notice</p>

<p>I bet you went through the frontpage of this sub and couldn&#39;t believe what you were reading. You probably thought &quot;Why aren&#39;t these things being discussed on the news subreddit or the politics subreddit, if they are true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. That&#39;s you mind reading. You cant read minds, so stop thinking you can. This is also indicative of you living in a reddit bubble.</p>

<p>When I first came to reddit in 2013 this was the second sub I looked for. I knew I would be reading things here that wouldn&#39;t be posted any where else on reddit and I didn&#39;t expect them to be. Conspiracy theorists or whatever you want to be called are always shoved in to there own little corner unless they are on a forum made just for them. What happens here is nothing that hasn&#39;t been happening on the internet for 20+ years, if you didn&#39;t wrap yourself up in your reddit comfort blanket you would know this already.</p>

<p>The things spoke about on this sub reddit have been topics of discussion on other forums for over a decade. Nothing new comes out of here, and in that sense <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a lot like the rest of reddit. Full of ignorant, reddit bubble living, circle jerking morons having the same conversations over and over again while they drastically over estimate their influence, the influence of their favourite sub and the influence of reddit in general.</p>

There&#39;s still plenty of beauty out there, and I think this sub is a beautiful place because I can write something like this post and actually resonate with people who understand what I am getting at.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you though, there&#39;s all kinds of opportunities to do, especially with the internet now. It&#39;s just a matter of finding a format that works and using that to make yourself an income. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend wasting time on the willfully ignorant, as you&#39;ve seen it&#39;s futile. However, there are lots of ignorant people who want to learn, maybe 1 out of 10, so just keep trying to connect with those who wish to learn and grow. </p>

<p>Focus your attention and energy on people who use it to better their own understanding. Don&#39;t waste energy on people who are trying to remain ignorant, they must fix themselves. Do not cast pearls before swine, as the saying goes. They do not appreciate them. Save your important ideas for those who may appreciate them. Plant your idea seeds in fertile ground, not on concrete, and you get much better results. I just wanted to let you know that it can still be an exciting adventure of exploring information and growing with others, you just have to find them, and not to be too frustrated by the masses of people with their head in the sand. They&#39;re doing it to themselves, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about them any more than you can turn off the sun, so just focus on the people you can affect and things become much more pleasant. That&#39;s my strategy, anyway. </p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Weaponizing portions of the underprivileged (i.e. non-capital owning class) against another part as a sort of divide and conquer that also clears the path for the ruling elite.</p>
