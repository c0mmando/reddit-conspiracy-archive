        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that <strong>the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center&#39;s designers anticipated</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/docs/aircraftcomparison.gif">FEMA&#39;s Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.</a>  Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity</p>

<p>Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707</p>

<p><strong>Statements by Engineers</strong></p>

<p>John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698">Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913">The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Factor-of-safety">One aspect of engineering that is not widely understood is that structures are over-engineered as a matter of standard practice.</a>  Steel structures like bridges and buildings are typically designed to withstand five times anticipated static loads and 3 times anticipated dynamic loads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but that&#39;s nonsense thinking. It was overengineered for impact AND for fire AND for collapse.  There was a bigger, hotter, longer lasting fire in 1975 in WTC 1.  The building was completely unharmed structurally.  Why?  Fireproofing.  So you mean to tell me that 25 yrs of advancment in fireproofing and sprinkler systems makes it somehow less functional to the point of causing the building to fail?   Are we devolving into mentally retarded people?  Perhaps, if you buy the 9/11 story: certainly.</p>

<p>The buildings were of course designed for impact, 2x bigger impact in fact.  Planes are lighter now than they were then. </p>

<p>Finally, IIRC Steel structures are designed for 5x static load and 3x dynamic load (in this case, the top portion falling would be dynamic load).  (I&#39;m sure in the case of WTC it was greater because it&#39;s an important building that&#39;s bigger than most)</p>

<p>Holding up the argument of &#39;just because doesn&#39;t mean&#39; to all three of these engineering <em>facts</em> means youre just going to have to skip your gut reaction and use your actual mental factulties. </p>

<p>9/11 did NOT go down because of impact or fire or impact+fire.  Building 7 is your proof.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting to the point of wondering if I should call DSS on people who still believe in 9/11&#39;s official conspiracy because they cannot handle scientific facts and therefore will be a great threat ot the safety of their children as a direct result of not being able to process factual information.  People who believe in the 9/11 official conspiracy are making real conspiracy theorists look bad by comparison because they have no evidence.  I&#39;m grouping 9/11 official conspiracy people now in the lizard aliens group.</p>

<p>This is actually false, the only people who claim this are debunkers trying to re-write historical fact.</p>

<p>NIST, NCS NCSTAR1, p. 6: “An additional load, stated by the Port Authority to have been considered in the design of the Towers, was the impact of a Boeing 707, the largest commercial airliner when the Towers

<p>Nope, <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/the_world_trade_center_work_of.html">Skilling was the designer. Robertson was the engineer</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1962, the authority selected Minoru Yamasaki as the architect. After considering various models, the authority eventually decided that two 110-story towers would anchor the 16-acre site. Yamasaki selected the Seattle-based engineering firm of Worthington, Skilling, Helle and Jackson <strong>to design the structure. The partner-in-charge was John Skilling. Robertson, then 34, was selected to make it work.</strong></p>

<p>The same article also quotes Robertson: &quot;Robertson says tests revealed that if a plane was flying <strong>at approach speed</strong> when it struck one of the towers, it would remain standing.&quot;</p>

<p>No, because it is trying to re-write history.</p>

<p>John Skilling died, i think 1998-9, so he has never been able to call bullshit on Leslie E. Robertson government puppet remarks and outrageous claims.</p>

<p>That is why the historical record, you know, the same thing historians use, is the <strong>ONLY</strong> verifiable record, anything written after the fact is, at best, suspect and dismissible.</p>

<p>We know for an absolute fact these building were part of a controlled demolition, this is all semantics anyway. </p>

<p>No, we&#39;re meaning to tell you that fireproofing isn&#39;t stronger than 500 mph hunks of metal flying at it.  The planes that hit the building stripped off the fireproofing in that area, exposing the beams to the flames.</p>

<p>Ok.  But using the chart supplied by the OP, the planes that hit the Twin Towers were still 42,000 lbs heavier.  That&#39;s quite a bit more force.  Can you handle <em>that</em> scientific fact?</p>

<p>But that top portion was still much heavier than the buildings were designed to hold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the destruction of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 were caused by fire, this would make them the first steel framed high-rise buildings in history to suffer total fire-induced collapse (combined with structural damage from the airplane impacts in the case of WTC 1 and WTC 2). They would also be the first fire-induced collapses to exhibit nearly all of the features of controlled demolition and none of the features of fire-induced collapse</p>

<p>Then explain how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This <strong>violates basic Newtonian physics,</strong> IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Then explain to me you do not agree with basic science, i will explain for you...</p>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its interesting you think the planes were the cause of the total collapse of each tower. The main problem is that you fail to realize the strength of a steel structure of any kind, particularly these two massive towers. <strong>The idea that the top section of a steel tower would crush through the supporting structure below is preposterous.</strong></p>

<p>The whole argument about whether or not the steel could melt or weaken due to jet fuel is irrelevant and a distraction from the real questions. Even if the fire was capable of instantly vaporizing the 3 to 6 floors it consumed, the result would be that the top section falls through the vaporized gap, and suffers an equal distribution of destruction until converted gravitational potential energy (kinetic energy) is spent and the system comes to a stop.</p>

<p>Assuming the beams did weaken to the point of bending or melting, the result would be even less dramatic, as the top section would sag through the weakened floors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, it&#39;s safe to assume that you know the amount of force the twin towers as a whole building, partial building, and each individual floor could withstand.  And since you&#39;ve got that in the bag, I&#39;m going to assume you have the correct calculations of the amount of force the tops of the towers exerted on the lower portion of the towers...right?</p>

<p>And you&#39;ve definitely got down the weight distribution and exact setup of the support columns for the buildings, correct?</p>

<p>I mean, obviously you have all that info, so then my assumption that you have accurately scaled down all those calculations and have come up with the conclusion that a bowling ball will precisely produce the accurately scaled-down force on your K&#39;nex tower (that is accurately scaled-down as well) is correct, right?</p>

<p>And you&#39;ll have all that info in your video so that your experiment can be exactly reproduced by anyone, anywhere...right?</p>

<p>Otherwise...your experiment will mean absolutely nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not quite. My demonstration does not need any scaling. To accurately scale the strength of the tower for my experiment would only better my argument. The K&#39;nex tower would be <em>much</em> less strong than a properly constructed steel building. If a bowling ball will not fall through a plastic basic truss, no way in hell would it fall through one made of steel.</p>

<p>edit: And the bowling ball is only to exaggerate the load. Realistically the dynamic load from just the top of the building would be much less. As far as the calculations go, people have done them and posted results on the web. Some have made easy to understand videos with actual load calculations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s making a lot of bad assumptions here.  Namely, that the building below should be treated as one huge block.  He fails to understand that the brunt of the force will be mostly on that 95th floor.  Some energy is being displaced to the rest of the building, yes, but the majority of the force/energy is being slammed into that 95th floor.  You then have to calculate how much force can one floor withstand before it buckles.  IIRC, each floor could withstand 2-3 floors buckling on it...not the weight of 15 floors.</p>

<p>So, that 95th floor is going to get crushed with barely any resistance, and in doing so adds to the weight of the top portion, in turn adding to the overall force that will be applied to the 94th floor...and so on.</p>

<p>The hardest part about bending metal is starting the bend...once that happens, it gets easier...and that&#39;s what happened to the columns as the increasing force collapsed on each floor.</p>

<p>False analogy.</p>

<p>Fourteen floors were not “dropped” onto the rest of the structure.</p>

<p>The falling upper blocks in each Tower crushed mostly intact columns.

<p>Wasn&#39;t making an analogy.  Was simply making an example of the effect of force.</p>

<p>But the collapse started because the floor(s) below the impact area sagged and pulled the top down.  This allowed the top portion to fall the way it did.  If the top portion simply started to collapse because of it&#39;s own weight, and the floors didn&#39;t give out below it, I would be inclined to agree that it <em>should</em> fall towards the damaged area more...but that&#39;s not how it happened.</p>

<p>Because the term &quot;global collapse&quot; is just a phrase NIST used to emphasize that the entire building collapsed, not just a portion of it.  It&#39;s not a new collapse method or anything that needs to be taught.  You can figure it out by simply looking at the context in which it was used.  Reaching for straws with that one, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a list of &quot;required reading&quot;  here? And I mean with real science and not fucky handwaving. There exists a body of evidence that is actually incontrovertible, though it&#39;s not super strong evidence. Enough weak evidence, though, is strong evidence, and I believe that exists. So what I mean is, I don&#39;t want to be pointed towards  bullshit strong evidence that I can easily refute just while reading (which a lot of the 9/11 cockamamy I&#39;ve read is). I want a list of real, albeit most likely mostly weak, evidence that together points towards an inside job. It exists, I&#39;ve read a decent amount of it, enough to mostly convince me (there is /definitely/ some shady shit going on), but mostly you guys seem to think that bullshit about the planes not being able to go that fast (they kept most of the speed they had at cruising and had just rapidly descended and leveled before impact, if anything they should have been going faster) and other equally ridiculous things are real evidence. </p>

<p>If we are ever going to get real truth, a public outcry for real truth, or anything like that, we need to stop inflating the facts. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Testing the Hypothesis that Mini-Nukes Were Used on the WTC Towers - Steven E. Jones</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Empirical Facts:</strong> All nuclear weapons (especially FUSION/Hydrogen bombs) release copious high-energy neutrons which will activate steel and other materials. This is called neutron activation and cannot be avoided, and much of the induced radioactivity remains for decades.</li>
<li>I have studied fusion for decades, and have made frequent measurements of neutrons (as well as charged particles).</li>
<li>Several months ago, I tested WTC dust samples and a solidified metal sample for radioactivity using a Geiger counter: I found ZERO RADIOACTIVITY. This experimental evidence goes strongly against the mini-nukes hypothesis since neutron activation levels were zero.</li>
<li>I also tested some sand gathered from a nuclear-bomb test site decades ago for comparison – and the Geiger counter showed hundreds of counts per minute. This also shows the long life of the radioactive residues due to nuclear bombs – the sand still yields high Geiger-counter readings decades after the nuclear bomb blast.</li>
<li>Note that concrete pulverization is often achieved in controlled demolitions with chemical explosives, e.g., the Seattle Kingdome demolition.</li>
<li>Mini-nukes are not needed for pulverization nor for “top-down” demolition as observed for the WTC Towers.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1962, the authority selected Minoru Yamasaki as the architect. After considering various models, the authority eventually decided that two 110-story towers would anchor the 16-acre site. Yamasaki selected the Seattle-based engineering firm of Worthington, Skilling, Helle and Jackson <strong>to design the structure. The partner-in-charge was John Skilling. Robertson, then 34, was selected to make it work.</strong></p>

<p>The same article also quotes Robertson: &quot;Robertson says tests revealed that if a plane was flying <strong>at approach speed</strong> when it struck one of the towers, it would remain standing.&quot;</p>

<p>Your careful selection of sources that only point one way, and refusal to acknowledge others, is extremely telling. </p>

<p>False.</p>

<p>John Skilling hired Robertson and is described in media accounts

<p>This is a historical fact.</p>

<p>In <em>City in the Sky,</em> Robertson is called the “rising young engineer with Skilling&#39;s firm” (p. 159). </p>

<p>In Men of Steel, Robertson is referred to during the design phase as “one of the up-and-coming engineers on [Skilling’s] staff,”Skilling’s “young associate,” whom Skilling “assigned... to help him prepare a proposal” to the Port Authority’s board. Skilling’s firm was named Worthington, Skilling, Helle, and Jackson. Clearly, Skilling was a senior partner at the firm and <strong>Robertson was his subordinate</strong></p>

<p>No, even NIST admits they didn&#39;t prove it.</p>

<p>NIST states that:</p>

<p>Oh.... Wait....</p>

<p>&quot;However, the debris impact test condition simulated an instantaneous impact by a burst of debris whereas the actual scenario involved a three dimensional field of debris, with a depth, width, and height, continuously impacting the target(s) for a finite duration over a large area. <strong>In addition, since the samples used in the tests were not restrained in the same way as actual structural elements would be, the response of the steel component and SFRM to debris impact in terms of dislodgement of SFRM may differ somewhat from that of an actual structural member.&quot;</strong> - NIST NCSTAR 1-6A Appendix C pg. 264</p>

<p>NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram).   </p>

<p>Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s an issue with this analysis. The analysis assumes a 707-320 was the reference. However, if the analysis was referencing a 707-120, the kinetic energy of a 767 would be about 25% higher. If the 707-320 is the proper reference, the kinetic energies are nearly the same.</p>

<p>I cannot find a source for the actual white paper being referenced. Best I found was <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a022793skilling">this</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The analysis Skilling is referring to is likely one done in early 1964, during the design phase of the towers. A three-page white paper, dated February 3, 1964, described its findings: “The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact.” However, besides this paper, no documents are known detailing how this analysis was made. [GLANZ AND LIPTON, 2004, PP. 131-132; LEW, BUKOWSKI, AND CARINO, 10/2005, PP. 70-71] The other structural engineer who designed the towers, Leslie Robertson, carried out a second study later in 1964, of how the towers would handle the impact of a 707 (see Between September 3, 2001 and September 7, 2001). However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), following its three-year investigation into the WTC collapses, will in 2005 state that it has been “unable to locate any evidence to indicate consideration of the extent of impact-induced structural damage or the size of a fire that could be created by thousands of gallons of jet fuel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also possible that the towers ability to withstand an impact and fire were overestimated. It would be interesting to see the actual analysis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been repeatedly offered and completely ignored. Facts and reality don&#39;t phase you guys. That&#39;s the problem. Reality provided, you ignore it. Not provided, you lie and say it doesn&#39;t exist. Which actually underlines your dishonestly and ignorance. It&#39;s not like this is state&#39;s secrets either. The fact that you are unaware of common information (it&#39;s even in several common documentaries) which completely refutes these lies confirms you are not looking for facts, but rather delusion. If you were honest, you would at least be aware of the engineer&#39;s position on the matter. Until you make an honest effort to learn rather than only consider confirmation basis, you are entirely dishonest. You are on an ant mound proclaiming the high ground. Stop lying to yourself. Stop lying to us.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the facts. They were never <em>designed</em> to withstand impact from jets. Anyone who says otherwise are ignorant or liars. AFTER they designed the building they decided to see if it <em>could</em> withstand impact. It was literally back of a napkin math, which confirmed it could in fact survive impact. The additional qualifiers is that they assumed a 707 without full fuel and it be accidental. Meaning napkin math and reality are worlds apart. They assumed, at most, little fuel, and less than a 250mph impact. Reality is a slightly larger, heavier aircraft, with full fuel, and roughly double the impact speed. The building did in fact survive the impact even though the real world provided a massively larger energy impact.</p>

<p>This is another distortion or lie constantly provided here. They calculated <em>if</em> it would collapse, <em>instantly</em>, from impact. According to the designers, they are thrilled with the survivability of their building, having survived an impact far in excess of what they accounted for. Even though the buildings collapsed, they are thrilled they stood anywhere near as long as they did. They did not calculate if the structure would be fundamentally compromised from even a lessor collision of their assumptions, let alone the massive impact it absorbed. They only validated if it would not instantly collapse from a much lessor impact.</p>

<p>That&#39;s said, they dramatically feared fires from such a collision. In fact, they feared fires in general. That&#39;s why massive amounts of fire retardant was required. Which was not properly installed in the first place and was past expiration in the second place. Lastly, the impact striped much retardant in addition to deforming and weakening the structure. In spite of all this, the fact the buildings stood as long as they did makes them consider it an overall success in spite of the fact they eventually collapsed.</p>

<p>I encourage you guys to actually research a topic rather than swallow lies. I&#39;m tired of correcting the lies here and being down voted as a reward for being knowledgeable and factually accurate. This lie constantly comes up here. You too can be correct if you bother to honestly research instead of only seeking confirmation bias.</p>

<p>But if you actually want truth, feel free to do searches here [and elsewhere]. Note, my current username will not be helpful.</p>

The building did in fact survive the impact even though the real world provided a massively larger energy impact.</p>

<p>And that is false, as we have already learned and which you have conveniently ignored:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 7007-DC8) traveling at 600 miles per hour... ...such collision would result in only local damage and could not cause collapse...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From John Skilling&#39;s 1964 white paper, as cited in NIST NCSTAR 1-2, Appendix A (pp. 306 ff).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In spite of all this, the fact the buildings stood as long as they did makes them consider it an overall success in spite of the fact they eventually collapsed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Hooray, 300+ firefighters were duped into entering the buildings which  survived an aircraft impact each so they could be killed too in the collapse that was unforeseen but, in hindsight, inevitable!&quot; That makes sense only to you. </p>

<p>That the WTC was designed only to withstand a collision with a Boeing 707 that was seeking to land at a nearby airport, and therefore low on fuel, is an obvious lie. Why is it an obvious lie? Well, because if you take into consideration planes that are landing at an airport, then you must consider planes that are taking off, and such planes are fully laden with fuel.  </p>

<p>And the first structures outside of the military and the nuclear industries whose design considered the impact of a jet airliner absolutely has to have gotten it right, right? ...because? Because the person making the assumption about this design in no way could have been wrong about their design specifications?</p>

<p>If &quot;engineers are always right&quot; is your logic for this being a sham, then you&#39;d better just end it right now.</p>

<p>Landing and taking off are different. Something being designed for <em>one</em> isn&#39;t always designed for another. </p>

<p>then you must consider planes that are taking off, and such planes are fully laden with fuel.</p>

<p>You really love throwing around &quot;you must&quot; as if you understand the design principles at hand.</p>

<p>No, you mustn&#39;t</p>

<p>Quintere goes on to agree that the lack of insulation (or poorly applied insulation) is a leading cause of structural collapse.</p>
