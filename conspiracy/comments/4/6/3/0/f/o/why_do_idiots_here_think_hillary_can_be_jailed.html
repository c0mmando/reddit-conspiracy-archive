    <div class="md"><p>Just leaving it at that is a form <em>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification">System Justification</a> Through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">Learned Helplessness</a>&quot;</em> (also called <em>&#39;establishment <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">stockholm syndrome</a>&#39;</em>).  If you stop at &#39;well they won&#39;t do anything about it anyway&#39; instead of offering up real solutions so that we can either work with the government or totally circumvent them (agorism / anarchism / DIY ethic / build your own damned internet), then all you are really doing is inducing others into cynicism, nihilism and despair and enrolling them into a psychological shutdown response.</p>

<p>So my suggestion is that if your&#39;e going to complain about the government, then offer some kind of solution as well otherwise you&#39;re just giving the stagnant slothful spectacle support unwittingly.  Example: &quot;yeah well fuck the government, here&#39;s what WE can do about it.&quot;  I want to also say that I offered 5 solutions in this comment.</p>

<p>Hillary be damned. I&#39;ve got more portant shit to worry about than what shill gets to play POTUS. Local politics to shed light on. Local media to stir up. People to keep housed and fed.

<p>Boycott their monetary system. I guarantee you that if everyone were to do this with the same vigor that they pursue political solutions which are guaranteed not to work, they would all be unrecognisably changed or flat out destroyed in less than a year.</p>

<p>Not &quot;abandon free trade&quot;, not &quot;elect this asshole&quot;, not &quot;send wall street bankers to jail&quot;, not &quot;overhaul foreign policy&quot; or any of that shit, just stop allowing them unlimited rope to do whatever they like and hand the bill to the profitable department of the economic activity of their slave populations.

    <div class="md"><p>This is funny because it demonstrates just how deep the tentacles of your slave master&#39;s whip actually have embedded themselves into your worldview.</p>

<p>Did I say don&#39;t trade with people? Did I say don&#39;t take advantage of an economic system? Did I even say don&#39;t use a monetary system? All I said was; Don&#39;t use <em>THEIR</em> monetary system. That entity which is manifest in the fiat currencies of the nation states of the world, and controlled by their banking apparatus. That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, actual hard currencies, commodities, any financial instrument at all which circumvents their monetary infrastructure is just fine, and indeed what will actually eventually result in their overthrow. If one simply abandons money and lives like hippies, that accomplishes nothing, people have tried to do that for a long time now and the results is that they&#39;re the butt of jokes about people that drop out and go grow beans in a forest, man. Move the productive economic activity of the bulk of humanity off their economic platform though, and you remove their ability to skim off the top of that activity and make their power plays etc in so doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m growing my own food and saving my own seed.  I collected so much heirloom rhubarb seed that I gave to a seed library and that drop alone probably could supply all of North carolina (like a half a gallon size ziplock).  People forget that with the right conditions, the world is abundant.  But the controllers want you to be living in fear and disempowerment and be scared and cold and lonely and pathetic.  It&#39;s time for you to crack a gardenng book and get off their shitty food system first of all by becoming a vegetarian and growing your own food.  Its not easy, but sq ft gardening is a good way to jump start a more successful attempt with a prescribed formula that does in fact work always to a high degree. Then you master that and branch out.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a real solution. I&#39;m preparing for collapse by learning wildcrafting, weed foraging for food / herbal medicine, but if it doesn&#39;t happen, then I&#39;m still learning valuable skills to make money go further.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another solution: communications.  If you&#39;re tired of mainstream media, buy a 25 usd software defined radio usb stick RTL-SDR and download skywave linux livecd distro to start getting alt. media broadcasts on shortwave.  You can also hear the police / em bands and FAA telemetry info...it lets you listen in on any radio wave from 0 up to cellphone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now we wait as the system self cannablizes by slowly people realizing it is rigged against them. This is not defeatism, it is patience with the common man&#39;s understanding of the nature of their world. It would happen overnight if people were not so easily confused by talking heads and TV. The Veil is too thick, no point in making them think they have a chance. Is not the cleverness of the corrupt politic to make the slave class think he can change things? It is precisely this &quot; hope and some change&quot; they use as the  tool of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. Pretty much everyone here wants the same thing. </p>

<p>However, the government is huge. It doesn&#39;t all work together in unison. The chances are H will not go to jail, but there&#39;s possibility that she won&#39;t get off Scot-free. Some whitehats in the federal government are moving to do <em>something</em>. That&#39;s their leg work. Ours is just to keep on doing what we all do: be vocal.</p>

<p>Remember when this email thing first came to light? Most people shrugged it off, said it was not a big deal. Look at the change over time. </p>

<p>However, this is r/conspiracy after all. Maybe TPTB need a scapegoat. Maybe H has exhausted nearly all her usefulness. Maybe this is all according to plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sorry but if theres all these whitehats you talk about, and theyre actually able to do something, then more would get done. To think they cant stop a cop from being released but they can punish Hillary is absurd, sorry m8. We do gotta be vocal and vigilant and actually do something, but having any sort of faith in the government as it is, in my opinion, is useless. All of the &quot;good&quot; they do is negated a million times over every day by the terrible things they do, and will do. Maybe Im cynical, yeah. But Im not cynical enough to think we cant change it. Just cynical enough to think nothing will get done if we dont do it. Weve relied this far on the government to be ethical, we cant any longer. For me, even with Bernie in the whitehouse, shit is still fucked. To me, they could hang Hillary on national TV and shit would still be fucked. We have a long way to go, my friend. Good discussion here. My best wishes to you and your future. I hope we are happy one day </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And just because you think that doing something is better than doing nothing does not mean we will eventually end up with a more just system, or that your actions will count for anything. </p>

<p>Just like this post. No body will up vote it and less than 20 people will actually read it. </p>

<p>Humanity is loosing all battles my friend, and there is nothing that we can do about it. Not giving up will not prevent it, at best postpone it. Accepting vs not accepting it really has no impact. It&#39;s people that keep buying into the concept of democracy and your vote counting for something that is the problem. The truth is that democracy is a failed concept, and your vote really means jack shit. </p>

<p>The rich is getting richer, and the poor has a hard time getting food and resorting to alcohol and drugs to try to get something good out of this life and hope to get to die a premature death. Look at the USA and the black population in some cities and neighborhoods. It is a disgrace. Number one country in the world my ass. The same thing is happening in France, UK, Sweden and where ever democracy is strong.</p>

<p>The system could care less if you went to vote or not. You mean jack shit. Face it. And if you still believe democracy, tell me why Goldman Sachs payed 300M USD to Obama, Hillary and Romney in the last election? And if that means anything, you still have pretty much the same setup every fucking election. Democrats or Republicans. And they are sooo different. Really. </p>

<p>There are people having assets worth trillions of dollars. Try to take it away from them. You can&#39;t. Their money is not in bank accounts nor declared. You going up against them is like 1 David against 1 billion Goliaths. </p>

<p>Yes, David did win. </p>

<p>But that my friend is a fictional story.</p>

<p>It appears as if democracy gives power some the power to rule the rest. There are way more people in poverty than there is rich people, yet this system continues to preserve itself. Democracy actually gives these people legitimacy. </p>

<p>The poor are always going to be too poor and too fatigue to organize and be able to take what they want. The elite will not air their agenda, will discredit them, and they will instead resort to drugs to deal with their depressions. </p>

<p>I am not a lefty, I am a hardcore capitalist. But capitalism and democracy is not the same thing. </p>

<p>What I do believe in however is direct democracy. Through a smart phone. On anything and everything. </p>

<p>Fuck the politicians. Fuck Hillary Clinton. Fuck Bernie Sanders. Fuck the democrats and fuck Obama. Fuck the Republicans and their lame mutha fucker retards for candidates. </p>

<p>I am not an American and can&#39;t vote but the only dude I actually respect is the only one with some balls to say it as it is. That&#39;s right, Donald Trump. At least I get a show for my money.</p>

<p>The others are just liars, hypocrites, inconsistent and totally old and lame. I am not sure what the fuck I am watching or hearing. </p>

<p>It is all just bullshit. </p>

<p>All of it. </p>

<p>Including this fucking post.</p>

<p>Now go fuck yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;How exactly does one &#39;win&#39; when one has convinced themselves - and now actively tries to convince others - that nothing can be done about the reality they live in?&quot;</p>

<p>Good question. I am just telling you, that the alternative you are proposing, does not actually lead to you winning either. </p>

<p>It might be your only chance, and you&#39;d like to keep that little chance open, but in reality you and others stand no chance. How do I know that? History tells us that. People have been fucked and killed for thousands of years. And the masters just keep getting more and more powerful than ever in history. </p>

<p>How do you go up against someone that manages 10 trillion USD? A  system that manages 100 trillion USD? You really think staying positive is going to help? </p>

<p>I guess I am not offering any alternative paths, but one way is to stop supporting this notion of a working system, and keep electing between the same options every fucking time. Pest or cholera, Democrats or Republicans. Maybe it&#39;s time for a real revolution. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve never heard of any successful revolution that didn&#39;t require force and Government takeover and shutdown. But even that they are steps ahead. All people that are not happy with the system, are being fed drugs to keep in line, and which will die prematurely. The media keeps everyone in check. </p>

<p>How are you going to start a revolution when the media silences your voice. How are you going to get your voice out? How are you going to organize, and increase in numbers, when all you get is arrested. </p>

<p>Just look at occupy Wallstreet and how that was handled by the Government and media. </p>

<p>A real revolution starts with people like those in Oregon. I guess it has to be white people too, because if they weren&#39;t, that whole things would have been over before the first media crew ever got there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you guys understand the implications of Hillary&#39;s server being completely exposed for such a long period of time. Most of you guys just want to see her behind bars because she&#39;s a corrupt individual, a liar, a thief, and the last one you want to see in power. </p>

<p>For starters, she sended a huge amount of emails from her unprotected server before it was found the device had been compromised. At this momment, they have review about <a href="https://foia.state.gov/Search/Results.aspx?collection=Clinton_Email">27156 emails</a> and release them under the freedom of information act.</p>

<p>About 22 of those emails that were revised were deemed more confidential than top secret, and the stablishment couldn&#39;t release them even under the freedom of information act.</p>

<p>Now, the emails the FBI have received from Hillary are about half of the total. She printed half of the emails on paper, and whipe the server and all of its contents.
This means 2 things,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.- The FBI only have the printed equivalent of the content of the emails, no metadata remains, they cannot be traced back. After all, they are just a bunch of papers with ink.</p>

<p>2.- And most important. The other half of the emails she sended have dissapear from the server, alongside any trace of the data. The FBI and other inteligence services can&#39;t even check the server and trace if they had been leaked, or to whom? Many of them fear the information have been leaked to independet hackers, or even Chinese or Russian hackers.
And the worse part of all this is, they have no idea what was in those emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think you are angry about her, you have no idea the absurdity they have going on in the CIA, NSA, FBI and other inteligence agencies. They have lost resources, positions, and even good soldiers have given their lives to protect this information.
I don&#39;t believe the military industrial complex care about those lives in particular, but good soldiers, and military equipment and facilities are not exactly plentifull.</p>

<p>This is not about her commiting a crime, she has pissed off the people above, compromise their future survival and cost lots and lots of money. The FBI is just waiting for an order to imprison her.</p>

<p>So yeah, I do think she has a fair chance to be jailed. If it hasn&#39;t happening already is probably because she&#39;s running for president; and since Jeb&#39;s chance of winning is fairly low at this momment, they are rooting for her to win the Democratic nomination and the presidency to avoid candidates like Sanders or Trump that haven&#39;t being bought by political donors.</p>

<p>If she doesn&#39;t win this election, her career is ruined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole problem, when it comes to cops, CEO&#39;s sons, and anyone else who is the target of a major case, is something that sets the US justice system apart from other nations.  That something is the fact that unlike other nations, there&#39;s no single criminal justice system.  Rather, you have basically two types.  The first being federal, the second being state.  What makes things very difficult though, is the fact that state laws vary by state.  (No kidding right?)  </p>

<p>To explain further, consider the following:</p>

<p>In the state of Mississippi, a person who shoots and kills an intruder in their home can be tried for capital murder for doing so.  Regardless of whether or not their own life was in danger.</p>

<p>In the state of Florida, for comparison, the idea behind justifiable homicide prevents this from happening.</p>

<p>On a federal level, things take a weird turn, taking it a good bit further.  While a person might be found not guilty of murder in Florida, they could still be tried federally for denying a person their civil rights or liberties; even after having been found not guilty of murder. (Zimmerman nearly found this one out, the Govt was considering a civil liberties case against him.)</p>

<p>Other nations don&#39;t do this.  They have a unified criminal justice system, meaning that there&#39;s not a mish mash of state level and federal courts.  There&#39;s only the federal court system.  Furthermore, they place a greater weight on the evidence, with some going so far as to having it be a case you having to be able to prove your innocence. Granted, you&#39;re still considered innocent until proven guilty, but the requirements to prove that guilt are far less than what they are here.</p>

<p>One good example of the difference can be found in the German criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Law in Germany is codified and is predominantly federal. The Penal Code is a revised version of a legal code introduced after the unification of Germany in 1871 and is therefore influenced by Prussian legal concepts. The system of criminal justice is derived from the civil law, rather than the common law that provides the basis for the systems used in Britain and the United States.  Criminal cases get their initial hearing at any of the courts of the three-tiered Land system--local courts, regional or Land courts, and the higher regional (appellate) Land courts--and can be appealed or revised from the lowest to the next two levels or from all three courts to the highest court in the criminal justice system--the Federal Court of Justice. Prosecutions leading to a maximum sentence of one year are heard by a judge of the local court. In more serious cases involving possible sentences of up to three years, the judge is assisted by two lay judges, comparable to jury members in a common law system. Criminal cases in which the sentence exceeds three years are referred to a Land court, where they are heard by three judges and three to six lay judges. A Land court of appeal presided over by five judges usually hears only appeals from the lower courts, plus cases concerning extraordinary crimes in violation of the Basic Law, such as treason and genocide.</p>

<p>Most interestingly, Germany does not use the same system that the US does when it comes to dealing with laywers.  Rather, in Germany it is the Judge who opens the trial by taking all the evidence presented both by the prosecution, and the defense, and reading through that.  The Judge then directs questions to the accused, and takes notes.  Once the Judge has finished questioning the accused, both the prosecution and defense are given time to direct questions to the accused.  There are no opening or closing statements, no jury to sway.  Just a single judge who has assistance in making a final decision.  </p>

<p>By removing the trial by jury, the German legal system completely removed the chance of a person being &quot;too famous&quot; or &quot;too well known&quot; to be convicted.  Consider if you will the OJ simpson trial.  Now imagine that trial with only facts and evidence presented, and no Jury present.  No &quot;If it does not fit&quot; speech at the end, and just OJ having to stand and answer direct questions addressed to him.  </p>

<p>In the end, it&#39;s because the US uses a system that places more weight on a jury of peers (figure of speech) that make it easier for someone with enough money or pull/power to dodge being convicted. That, compounded with the mishmash of laws spread out over every state mean that those who are convicted fall into two specific groups:  The poor, and damn unlucky.  (There&#39;s also the third group of morons that think they can defend themselves, but those people are just delusional and should know better.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t as much about Sanders being able to do the impossible.. it is about enough American voters going against the establishment candidate and supporting a guy who says he wants to overturn Citizens United and will actually break up the big banks and regulate Wall Street (and isn&#39;t getting paid by them while he&#39;s saying it).  Maybe Bernie can&#39;t actually do everything he wants because he&#39;ll have a Congress who refuses to go along with it but if millions of people are waking up tot the idea that you don&#39;t always need to vote for the establishment candidate and aren&#39;t falling for Hillary&#39;s lies then that is a good thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>basic economics on that states that reckless speculation weeds itself out via failure and public understanding of it and will not put their money in that direction. The housing and banking market was HEAVILY regulated. The credit ratings company went private and started selling bogus product ratings to the highest bidders, and that was with tons of oversight from the SEC. Our biggest economic boom as a country was pre-regulation, regulation stepped in. My career is in market speculation for technical engineering consultants, we are completely unregulated and do just fine. The FDA regulates all life sciences and honestly that is the most corrupt industry on the planet behind the financial sector. The two largest regulatory bodies in the country and completely inept and only beg for assistance post a tragedy, they never prevent them. Regulation is not effective, public investment dollars via Venture Capitalism, stocks and other equity purchasing options can either extinguish a bad company or prop up one that is doing the right thing. Regulation allows for manipulation of loops holes while the free market is determined by the general public deciding whether or not to invest their $</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually shit went bad after they repealed the parts of Glass-Steagall that prevented commercial banks from participating in speculative investing...We loosened the reins and it took less than 10 years for our banks to collapse our economy.  And, unfortunately, reckless speculation doesn&#39;t weed itself out because we bailed the banks out and let them combine and become more powerful.  Now we literally cant afford to let them fail or our entire economy goes under.  They have control of everything.  When 5 major banks run everything the consumer doesn&#39;t have a true free-market decision on who to invest thru... no matter who you invest thru your money ends up with the same people.  It&#39;s essentially a government backed banking monopoly that the tax payers have to bail out when they start to fail.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1). The G-S act was just an expedition of the inevitable. A non-regulated market would not have bailouts. </p>

<p>2). Regulation allows for combined power because of it removes competition and profitability is no longer the lifeblood of a company, what becomes the lifeblood is the ability to work angles of regulations and tax breaks. It becomes more fiscally responsible at that point to higher lawyers to comb through massive amounts of regulatory info to find how to get a &quot;competitive&quot; edge, while in an unregulated market, competitive edge is determined by relative and absolute CE. Wal-Mart focused their financial efforts on buying bulk, and transportation and distribution infrastructure, eliminating any competition that buried their heads in the sand. Kodak refused to acknowledge that Digital Cameras and cellphones were their direct competitor to their cameras and lost out tremendously. The opposite example of this is google realized Microsoft would no longer be directing search traffic by default and would be sending it Bing&#39;s way. Google responded with Chrome and the Google Search bar, and they are still in business. I highly doubt if they stuck their heads in the sand the government would have bailed google out.</p>

<p>3). Politicians and Regulators main goal is to ensure their positions remain for them to sit in, if their is nothing for them to have oversight on, then they are defunct as a contribution to society and will therefore find things to regulate to ensure their existence. 95% of regulation is based on knee jerk reactions to a one-off situation.</p>

<p>4). the reason our money ends up in the same hands continuously because of laws and regulations that filter it that way. If you as an individual can fully decide in a free market where your money goes, then you as the consumer have full power over the market. With regulation, that limits your power</p>

<p>But ignoring that, where does the 1472% come from?  Or more precisely, where does that 421 number for 1975 come from.  The very crime statistics your link refers to shows 9 rapes/100k in 1975.  The population was ~8.2mil then (~9.6mil now).  So that math doesn&#39;t work even without taking any of the changes to the definition of rape over the years.  Be funny if the hard numbers in the very first sentence were wrong, right?</p>

<p>But whatever, &quot;[Sweden&#39;s] economy is going to collapse within two months&quot; according to you.  Is it OK if I come back here and point out how your dumb ass was, of course, laughably wrong?  Ahh, whatever, I&#39;ll do it anyway.</p>

<p>Is that supposed to be a hand-wringing response to what you see as my <em>personal</em> definition of rape?  Do you need a fainting couch?  What a strange and juvenile way to interpret that. We aren&#39;t talking about my personal definition.  We&#39;re talking about how Sweden defines what constitutes rape from a legal stand point.  Again, from the <a href="http://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/rape-and-sex-offences.html">BRS data your link relies on</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of reported rape offences has increased since 2005. The increase can be partially explained by the entry into force of new sex offence legislation on 1 April 2005. This legislation entails, among other things, that certain acts which were previously classified as sexual exploitation are now classified as rape. The effect of the statutory change appeared in the statistics such that the number of reported offences in respect of sexual coercion and exploitation declined in the years immediately following the statutory change while the number of reported rapes increased. As from 1 July 2013, the sex offence legislation was again made tougher; among other things rape was expanded to include cases where the victim reacts passively. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get that you aren&#39;t doing your own thinking since neither the numbers not making sense nor the number of victims not changing by the same ratio as the offenses didn&#39;t click.  But not even reading the information?</p>

<p>I look forward to your source from the Swedish government that says their economy will collapse in two months.</p>

If they say they are, they are really a cryptofascist knowing that marxism will fail and lead inevitably to fascism.  Sanders is not nor ever will be a fascist, it doesn&#39;t suit his temperament or his ideology--he is one of the few people who believe that people should have a choice.  Key word: people.</p>

<p>If anything, he&#39;s a populist, one of the few people in our political system now that actually believes in true democracy.  Cannot say the same for republicans.  Their big fear is &#39;tyranny of the majority&#39;...which is another way of saying you are afraid of democracy (ie: &quot;republican&quot; rule by a representative).  Now Sanders thinks money in politics ruins &#39;democratically elected republicanism&quot; and he&#39;s right.  No one disagrees on any side of this statement, it&#39;s just that Sanders is the only one other than maybe the Pauls that are actively fighting this trend.  The other politicians WANT MORE money in politics.  They are corrupt through and through.</p>

<p>Sander wants to be president to force certain things.  Money out of politics, stop the spying, stop war, legalize cannabis, and giving everyone health care.  It&#39;s not fucking hard to understand these are things the vast majority of people in america want.</p>

<p>The health care is the thing of debate.  Republicans play this game where they say it will ruin the economy.  Well yes it would if we also continue to have war all over the planet all the time.  Sanders says we can easily pay for it if we change our priorities from spending 50% of the government&#39;s checking account on war, the national security state and defense cronyism</p>

<p>And by the numbers, he&#39;s completely correct.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT
I really want this to be the last thing to say about sanders, but you know these goddamned idiots or idiots that look like shills come here and bernie bash and don&#39;t have their facts straigt.  I mean if we wanted to debate about things that are real: fine.  But saying &#39;ermagerd socialist&quot; is just not any legitimate way to approach a true discourse on the politics of Sanders</p>

<p>Now Sanders thinks money in politics ruins ‘democratically elected republicanism” and he&#39;s right. No one disagrees on any side of this statement, it’s just that Sanders is the only one other than maybe the Pauls that are actively fighting this trend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which explains why Trump has taken zero donations and is self-funding, while Bernie is not.</p>

<p>Oops!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sander wants to be president to force certain things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, so a marxist dictatorship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>stop the spying</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidence of this is where?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>stop war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grow war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>legalize cannabis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Degenerate bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and giving everyone health care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WE ALREADY HAVE HEALTHCARE, FOR FUCK’S SAKE. Health insurance is not healthcare. No one is denied healthcare. Illegally forcing everyone to pay for insurance FIXES NO PROBLEMS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not fucking hard to understand these are things the vast majority of people in america want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, sorry. Most Americans aren’t degenerates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The health care is the thing of debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Immigration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well yes it would if we also continue to have war all over the planet all the time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, even without any military expenditure at all, single payer would destroy the economy. Socialism only works when someone else is footing the bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And by the numbers, he’s completely correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like he needs a remedial math class, since no one else agrees with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, when you rob from the rich and give to the poor the poor become more poor.  This is some hawk logic I tell you.</p>

<p>Also, Sanders is not a socialist. He&#39;s a social democrat.  He uses the word for shock value and because he wants to change it&#39;s negative connotation.  Keep in mind, he&#39;s still very much an american, more so than many in fact.</p>

<p>If you really think Sanders wants the government to decommission all corporations and split them up and give fractional ownership to everyone, then you really haven&#39;t been listening to him whatsoever.  Instead, you&#39;ve been listening to very attractvie &quot;journalists&quot; (propagandists really) on FOX having what seems to be an 8th grade education telling you disfinformation.  You fell for it.  That&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>However, the government is huge. It doesn&#39;t all work together in unison. The chances are H will not go to jail, but there&#39;s possibility that she won&#39;t get off Scot-free. Some whitehats in the federal government are moving to do <em>something</em>. That&#39;s their leg work. Ours is just to keep on doing what we all do: be vocal.</p>

<p>Remember when this email thing first came to light? Most people shrugged it off, said it was not a big deal. Look at the change over time. </p>

<p>However, this is r/conspiracy after all. Maybe TPTB need a scapegoat. Maybe H has exhausted nearly all her usefulness. Maybe this is all according to plan. </p>
