    <div class="md"><p>I noticed the same thing after the boston bombing.  The media was treating the tzarnierv brothers as if they&#39;d been found guilty.  There were about 10 &quot;facts&quot; used against them that were demonstrably false, but asking for evidence was met with a &quot;wait until the trial&quot;.</p>

<p>Once dzhokar was finally tried- and the defense was very unhappy with lack of cooperation from the prosecution and FBI in providing evidence and details, one thing DID come out which had been lauded the whole time.  They released a video of dzhokar dropping a backpack at the event, and they also released records from his burner phone.  I believe they also showed a photo of the boat where he allegedly wrote his &quot;manifesto&quot;.</p>

<p>I still firmly believe this was an intelligence operation.  I don&#39;t know that they ever released information regarding the weapon that killed the officer- nor did they cleanly charge tamerlan with the murder of the drug dealers. The case was closely managed and the friend of their who was assassinated in florida in a huge red flag.</p>

<p>BUT, my point is that there WAS &quot;evidence&quot; (you can doubt it&#39;s validity, but it was used in the court) against the brothers to try them for the bombing.  It was tightly guarded until the trial and even the trial was closely managed.  I suspect the same will be true with san bernadino- though I don&#39;t know that they get to have a trial since they were killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even saying he&#39;s not &quot;guilty&quot;.  But I do have a lot of questions about his representation.  And a lot of people plead guilty to cop a plea.  If you want to get into it, I can find plenty of people who have plead guilty who were later proven innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.  You discuss the probable quality of a trial for the Sen Barnadino people as if you are an expert in jurisprudence and procedural fairness -- but you don&#39;t even know if dead people get trials.  Your Dunning-Kruger is showing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hilarious thing about the neighbor, theres something like a 15 or 20 year history between Farook and his neighbor, back to their teens, the chances of two renters living next to each other in rented accommodation for that number of years with landlords proclivity for periodic evictions, is slim.</p>

<p>and could the impoverished teenage Farook have afford the rent on the house that the adult govt worker could afford !?</p>

<p>and Farook is supposed to have gone off to university then returned (to an empty apartment/house !?)</p>

<p>this neighbor relationship is pure prefabricated story telling for the MSM and the gullible viewers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>apparently the neighbor bought the guns for him as well, pushing the anti gun narrative. I think people are starting to realize these events are entirely bullshit but for some reason &quot;normal&quot; people don&#39;t want to discuss it? idk how anyone could believe this shit. The media trampled all over his apartment on live TV, 2 days after the attack. That has never happened ever at any crime scene.</p>
