        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When anyone says anything against the &#39;Jews&#39; a minority of whom obviously do control, without a shadow of a doubt, the banks, government and media, one is immediately labeled an anti-Semite.</p>

<p>Zionist Talmudic Jews and the Zionist Christians who unwittingly fund them are not Semites. They do not hail from the land of the Semite. They are Khazar and European in origin and have no geo-ethnic ties to the so called &#39;holy land&#39;.</p>

<p>Therefore the small group of Jewish impostors who run the banks, the media and government are not Semites. They are Zionists. </p>

<p>Personally I take issue with Zionists. Not the Semites.</p>

<p>Why? Because they enslave us financially, spiritually and intellectually causing us great suffering. And while I follow no religion, I am not an atheist. I have respect for other&#39;s belief systems as long as they don&#39;t encroach on my freedom to exist, given that my moral code and self expression does not offend them either.</p>

<p>And yet these Zionists, they have hijacked all three Abrahamic faiths to revive the most abhorrent passages of their holy texts that whilst suited to the days they were written in are no longer suited to the modern scholarly and intellectual world.
Only a fool would think that an eye for an eye or the chopping off of a limb in this modern day is just and right. Yet these words exist from days when there was no debt enslavement. When theft was not needed to survive. </p>

<p><em>Note: if you think religions are fairy tales that cause more trouble than good then yes perhaps they are fairy tales but the harm they cause might actually be engineered by a small group of people. Suck it up, read and learn. It&#39;s what I had to do in order to begin to comprehend the mess we are in currently.</em></p>

<p>Yet these Talmudic Zionists believe that the Jesus Christ of the Christians and the Muslims is a false prophet and should be boiled in hot excrement for all eternity. That might have been an accepted line of thought 2000 or so years ago. But the Talmudic Zionists believe in these words to this very day.</p>

<p>Why? Because they are hell bent on forcing the holy land&#39;s completion, upon which their messiah will finally appear to rule the world. Their words not mine. </p>

<p>The Zionists, which includes the Wahhabi&#39;s of Saudi Arabia, who converted from Talmudic Judaism in 1666 to further their hidden agenda, are the people whom I despise. I despise them because over the years they happily enslave and abused the real Abrahamic followers for political and financial gain without remorse. </p>

<p>Not only do they revive the belief in the fundamental roots of these religions. They do so for the sole purpose of radicalising the younger generations so that they wage war against one another. Not only inter-faith but among their own religion. At times subjecting even their own Jewish brothers (the true Semites) to the most abhorrent of exploitation in order to create divide amongst as all, ultimately to justify war.</p>

<p>Those among us who have opted for the hedonistic lifestyle and remain unaffected by all of this are unwittingly sucked up into failed relationships, single parenting, racial and sexual divide, porn or substance addiction and lead the loneliest of existences. To those of you in a dark place right now. You have the Zionists to thank. Specifically the Zionist controlled media which includes the news, music, TV, Hollywood and the porn industry. </p>

<p>Can none of you see this?!
Can none of you realise that the hatred we foster against the Jews, Christians and Muslims, against men and women or whites and non-whites is engineered by the Zionists?</p>

<p>Real ethnic Jews, Christians and Muslims are the real Semites and I do not take issue with them. They have been taken advantage off by the Talmudic Zionist for many many years. Yet the real Semites and true followers of Abrahamic faith have lived side by side in communities for centuries before this attempt to cause them to divide. </p>

<p>You see the problem is that you have all been brainwashed to react in this way and you do so despite the fact that you are &#39;goi&#39;.</p>

<p>You unwittingly protect the group of people who cause the most amount of suffering to us all (especially the Semitic people) with that one simpleminded and misguided reflex use of the phrase &#39;anti-Semite&#39;. </p>

<p>You were put on this planet with a mind. With the ability to think. Yet you have handed over that jewel to those who would cause you to suffer whilst profiting from your very existence.</p>

<p>You submit to their financial, spiritual and intellectual enslavement whilst repeating their slogans of hatred. And unwittingly waging war against the true Semites. </p>

<p>If you still use the phrase &#39;anti-Semite&#39; after reading this then not only are you a real anti-Semite, but you are celebrating your financial, intellectual and spiritual self enslavement to the Talmudic Zionist system of divide and conquer.</p>

<p>The irony is that perhaps the Talmudic Zionists are correct when they refer to us as cattle or goi. </p>

<p>After all, if you no longer think, then you are no longer human. </p>

<p>So please feel free to take action that others might learn.</p>

<p>Let me add that until the phrase anti-Semite is dropped as being bogus, we do need to point out the damaging irony behind it by explaining as I have done so above, the falseness of the phrase and the self enslaving purpose it serves. </p>

<p>Semite: a descendant of &#39;Shem&#39;, a son of &#39;Noah&#39;. Also a member of any of a number of peoples originating from the ancient levant region (modern Middle East). These include: Akkadians, Phoenicians, Sumerians, Eblates, Hebrews, Arabs (yes, you read that right), Babylonians and Hittites. &#39;Semite&#39; is an ethnicity.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em>
- Semite/semitic = ethnicity, on the same level as caucasian, asian, afro-american, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jew/jewish = religion, on the same level as christian, muslim, buddhist, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ethnicity = like hardware, physical, genetically backed.</p>

<p>Religion = like software, logical, a set of beliefs and values, a code of conduct.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zionist Talmudic Jews and the Zionist Christians who unwittingly fund them are not Semites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;While the conjunction of the units anti-, Semite, and -ism indicates antisemitism as being directed against all Semitic people, the term was popularized in Germany in 1879 as a scientific-sounding term for Judenhass (Jew-hatred)&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar case to the <a href="https://www.google.hu/search?q=%22indians%22&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=705&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwibm4Gd2ILLAhVG_Q4KHZeoBbcQ_AUIBygB">Indians</a> who are as Indian as I am.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Real ethnic Jews, Christians and Muslims are the real Semites </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and I&#39;m sure most of the nearly 3 000 000 full or partial Mizrahi Jewish descents in Israel love their country, which means they are Zionists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are Khazar and European in origin and have no geo-ethnic ties to the so called &#39;holy land&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discuss it at Stormfront or r/Europe, when communities like those accept them as Europeans I will consider them European too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I take issue with Zionists. Not the Semites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of the Semites are Zionists. There are even Israeli Arab Zionists. Nearly the 30% of the Israeli Jewish population originate from Middle-Eastern and Northern-African countries and aren&#39;t any less patriotic than the Ashkenazi Jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? Because they enslave us financially, spiritually and intellectually causing us great suffering. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does the average Israeli nationalist enslave you financially, spiritually and intellectually?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet these Zionists, they have hijacked all three Abrahamic faiths [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t hijack any religion. Actually, Zionism is rather a nationalist movement than a religious one. Both Theodore Herzl and Ben Gurion were atheists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Zionists, which includes the Wahhabi&#39;s of Saudi Arabia [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They aren&#39;t Zionists, they are just not as obsessed with Israel as the Shiites or some of the &quot;free thinkers&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After all, if you no longer think, then you are no longer human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, sadly there are many people here who are driven by their emotions and refuse to accept or think about anything that doesn&#39;t fit into their narrative. Hopefully you are not one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you volunteer to be the first to submit to lobotomy then you might be able to gain traction/s. Instead my I suggest you use your mind to understand usury. Then you will understand many things. </p>

<p>You must also take the time to understand that the non-radicalized believers do not cause harm nor do they indoctrinate. They suffer the same usury hell on earth that you and I do. </p>

<p>It is the Talmudic imposters who have infiltrated and subverted the Abrahamic faiths by radicalization who cause war and suffering through their strategy of divide and conquer, that is funded by usury that we are all compliant with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you understand what I meant with the lobotomy thibny. It&#39;s just that what is currently inside people brains are what driving them to do those things. And they pass it down to their childrens. Radical or not, there will always be this question of : this god is real and this one is not, still dividing the world. </p>

<p>I agree that non-radicalized people doesn&#39;t cause harm, but they still do things in the name of X, where X is a tale from Y millennia agos. </p>

<p>American believe in god like no tomorrow, in god we trust, but yet they blindly support their leader who is the root of many wars, deaths and misery around the world. Non-radical believers still sheep around who they worship, which can/will/have create(d) problems around the world. </p>

<p>Religions are dividing religious groups, creating conflicts, yet unite those whi share the same religion. It&#39;s kinda hard to understand that they are myth, simply. A myth is something that someone said that sound plausible but no one have proof of. 
I understand the need for anwsers, I just don&#39;t understand how can someone blindly think something is real when they have been passed down their own beliefs from their parents. Who in their turn got the same treatment from their own parents. </p>
