        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fox news completly invented a translation, and I don&#39;t mean they missed a few term, I mean they completly invented everything I&#39;m going to translate the video for you. Here is the video:
<a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2016/02/22/25001-20160222ARTFIG00365-quand-fox-news-invente-les-propos-de-marion-marechal-le-pen.php">http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2016/02/22/25001-20160222ARTFIG00365-quand-fox-news-invente-les-propos-de-marion-marechal-le-pen.php</a> </p>

<p>What she said: </p>

<p>And so we already know this is only the beginning and that in these conditions I think the party we represent in the future will lead, I hope, to come in buisness and change radically. </p>

<p>...difficulty, if you want, explain that it&#39;s not the immigrant himself, the person, that we target and attack, but the immigration policy in total has a nasty effect.
But we have to realise, the principles of reality applies, I know that in France... </p>

<p>And so if you want to propose a spiritual model completly outdated to youngsters in identity crysis, and that is the real subject that&#39;s why we, anyway we want to stop immigration as much as we can regardless of the origin... </p>

<p>...And France is concentrated in order to form cultural secession, and so to make no immigration effort. I think today the big drama is partly.... </p>

<p>That&#39;s not at all in my plans ! </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think about that at all because my party president is admirable and competent</p>

<p>What fox news said: </p>

<p>There are security consequences, radical islam has emerged, terrorism is one of the most radical drifts, it&#39;s just the beginning in this situation our parties are led to come to power I hope. </p>

<p>I would like to remind that France is europe&#39;s leading exporter or ISIS soldiers that underline a malaise. Don&#39;t burry your head in the sand, the areas with the strongest immigration rates are the areas that are the most insecure. This immigration policy has failed. </p>

<p>The politicians are complicite or blinded by this reality because of political correctless, they do nothing while salafist immam are enlisting young french people and some associations are standing as the advocates of the jihad. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t make a big integration effort, I belive the big drama is that muslims express sympathy towards radical islam and this particular islam isn&#39;t compatible neither with democracy nor with the values of the republic. </p>

<p>Of course but I have no carreer strategy </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t decided weither to be president or prime minister but it&#39;s not my goal, I go where people need me.</p>

<p>Stuff like this happen all over the Corporate Owned Mass Media, to some extend, because they do not give a f@@k, they only care about the money they earn and the criminals they serve. For as long as they can provide believable propaganda they are doing good. The majority of people in USA and Europe are sadly clueless and brainwashed. Most Presidents and Prime Ministers are nothing more than puppets for the corporate elite, enabling the extraction process of public funds into the pockets of a few Oligarchs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire MSM is guilty. They will cherry pick one point and twist it around for their own ends. Meanwhile the original speakers entire series of points are completely ignored.</p>

<p>The worse is when they have their panel of experts spinning everything around and around until it isn&#39;t recognizable any more. They did it to Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and now are doing it to Sanders and Trump.</p>
