      <p>
       First I explain what needs to happen, then why these help dismantle.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) . You must push, around the world, with extreme pressure, to
       <strong>
        <em>
         decriminalize all drugs everywhere at the UN level
        </em>
       </strong>
       , by retracting the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances and institute a new policy of decriminalization to be implemented simultaneously to all participating countries.  This requires making the case that it's a fundamental human right of freewill, consumer choice and personal biological sovereignty over our own persons to decide what goes into our bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) . You must push, around the world, for the ability to convert your government to an ad-hoc, a-la-carte government taxation style in which citizens will choose to pay for the services they will use.  Default 'enabled' is acceptable as long as there is a nonbureaucratic means to opt-out.  Want to home-school your kid?  Fine, opt-out of the portion of taxes that pay for public school.  Don't want to pay for military?  Fine, opt-out and it gets defunded.  Think the police are corrupt?  Downsize them by withholding funding.  These withholdings must be done with complete anonymity, public record of this is not allowed, nor is any attempt to 'shame' anyone for their choices by first or third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) . You must push, around the world, for the ability to publicly sentence a corporation to death, since it is a person.  This means dissolution by the people.  You can call it what you want, dissolution (of articles of incorporation), impeachment, corporate death, disincorporation...it doesn't matter.  If the public believes a corporation has done something so egregious, they should be able to have a mechanism by which they can vote to destroy a company without using the legal system; or if it must use the legal system, there is a streamlined process that high-prioritizes a class action lawsuit of the people of the US versus the company wherein the desired outcome of the prosecution is immediate takeover of ownership to the public / government, liquidation of all assets, firing of the board members without any pay and cancellation of their golden parachute severence packages, 50% of the assets of the company going to non-executives of the company divided evenly after their normal severance and unemployment is paid, and dissolution of the company.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) . Transparency and an end to blackmarkets.  You will be able then to follow the money.  And spurring competition and a true free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cryptofinancial elite live in the shadows, and from the shadows of their international secret society networks, they traffic drugs.  The whole bread and circuses of the drug war has been well exposed as a total fraud on the public.  The internet ruined their game.  We have the info, the sources, we've put the circumstantial evidence on the corkboard and triangulated their activities to a simple, easy to understand fact: we occupy afghanistan for 15 yrs and yet heroin and pill abuse is at an all time high in america.  The Janus face of the establishment has been exposed.  It's a racket.  The silk road is now an international, occulted effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of their money comes from the drug war.  It's just as important as securing nonrenewable resources.  It all comes down to gold, guns, drugs and oil.  It takes gold to get guns, but when you have the most guns you can get the rest.  The folks with the most gold are governments, mafias and the clergy.  Some groups are all three of those groups (vatican city).  Figure it out.  If the pope wanted opium gone tomorrow, guess what would happen?  A pope drone fleet would spray monsanto products across all the globe and make that plant go extinct.  And still have gold leftoever.  This is my point.  There is no such motivation, in fact, the opposite is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       End their phony drug war and they will lose a lot of money.  Decriminalization will cut off their easy money supply, but they will still make money on it.  Just less.  And we'll all be able to see it since it will be a matter of public record once it's legitimized, legitimately regulated, tallied, etc.  Like alcohol or firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) . A la carte governement means that people will decide, not the government, what services get paid for.  This gives people back the power of purse from an insane government.  The NSA would end tomorrow since people don't like paying money to be spied on and betrayed by their own 'daddy' government.    50% of america doesn't like paying for the government to create more terrorism by killing wedding parties in the middle east.  It's not moral to impose that on them.  They can vote with their money.  War would dry up quick.  Solar farms would become a priority.  GMOS would end.  We get what we want, not what moneyed interests think we should have.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) . Nothing is more demoralizing than a corporation that can make a product that kills large numbers of people, or causes huge amounts of people to lose their homes, their jobs and their livelihoods based on wicked managerial decisions and greed, and continues on as if nothing happened; or better yet, the managerial team gets fired with a multimillion dollar severence package--when any one of us would get a cardboard box of our effects, a smaller than normal final paycheck, and boot-kicked by security out the back door.
      </p>
      <p>
       These corporations need to experience the
       <em>
        true death
       </em>
       and there needs to be a mechanism for
       <strong>
        <em>
         collective anger and will
        </em>
       </strong>
       to be able to overcome
       <strong>
        <em>
         money
        </em>
       </strong>
       because some corporations have enough money that even large numbers of people with all their pooled resources cannot overcome them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when this happens, that wealth needs to be taken from them and distributed 50% back to the communities they affected and then 50% to the employees who lost their jobs; although they should be shamed for working at a company that did wrong...I think it's enough that they lost their job to send them that message.

       BINGO! It stopped their ability to monopolize their propaganda via the MSM ... the ONE thing all their planning for global domination failed to see coming, even as late as the mid 1980's TPTB hadn't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       acknowledged the technological tsunami coming! This is becoz on the whole they are a conservative lot and they liked the "status quo" of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Internet or 'Information Revolution' had been a game changer BUT 'they' are doing their damndest to have 'control' of it, and in some ways countries like the UK and Australia
       <em>
        already have blocked
       </em>
       their citizen's access to various websites they deem 'bad'
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing you didn't mention OP which I believe needs to be implemented is acepting the use of cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) that are unable to be manipulated by "the biggest players" ... and being unable to use large chunks of Btc to "play with the on the moneymarkets", the chances are things like taxes would be used for the purposes they are needed for rather than some politician's fanciful dreams
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your idea to be able to "kill corporations that have crossed the line" is fantastic BUT the argument against doing so wil be "the loss of many jobs If you do so" ... which is a major hurdle
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in the next 10-20yrs many jobs are going to be 'lost' to robotics, driving and warehouse jobs come to mind, and many people are going to find themselves out of work and with NO jobs
       <em>
        available
       </em>
       to be had, let alone actually getting one!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the 'elephant in the room' as it's quickly going to become a HUGE problem, and 'money' as we currently know it is going to
       <em>
        have to return to
       </em>
       what it originally was, simply a means of keeping track of exchanges of 'energy', which is the
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       goods and services traded,
      </p>
      <p>
       so I could basically 'swap my productivity' for another person's  and keep track of it online without a 'bank' or other "central authority" in the middle of the transaction (except for the Btc fees, which are very low &lt;1%) Trade needs to continue BUT how the 'wealth' from that trading is distributed amongst the people is what really needs to change
      </p>
      <p>
       Great post OP, It's really heartening to see there are people out there
       <em>
        trying to
       </em>
       figure out ways to actually 'deconstruct the current situation
       <em>
        and replace it
       </em>
       with something else, instead of the masses who say "
       <em>
        someone should
       </em>
       dooooo something!" ... but they have NO idea 'what' "should be done"!  Thanks for sharing your thoughts matey, some need further thought but it's a fantastic start and I agree with the majority of it. Add some Bitcoins into the mix and you've won me! :D
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR: Great stuff OP, well thought out and a good start. I LOVE the idea of  The Company Killing via public opinion, I just wonder how it could be made possible with minimal 'collateral damage' to the workers who were just pawns (those who had NO knowledge of the criminality occuring, anyone who knows is complicit and deserves punishment)
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about the coming automation/robotics/self driving vehicles and AI revolution which is going to cost a LOT of people their jobs, how do we mitigate that problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       Iceland are the people to watch! Alas things like this are much easier to achieve with 300k people,  than 300 Million!  We need to begin with "changing the average guys knowledge" which seems to be happening at an increasing rate. The knowledge being shared via the internet is killing TPTB, let's keep it up everyone (Time Person of the Year 2006)

       One little problem is that many people will decide to pay for nothing, and continue to use the roads etc. Things will work for a while and then fall apart. Then people may decide to fund the roads, but it will be too late. The economic damage of not having the roads or the bridge will be done.

        Agree on alot of levels, but decriminalizing it, doesn't remove them completely, they would just interject themselves as a regulatory body, similar to FDA and SEC. Imagine the power you would give to a body called the "Narcotic Substance Regulatory Commission". However, there are good examples in other countries that decriminalizing can remove alot of danger and power hording. But Addiction and Substance Abuse/Use is a Bio/Psycho/Social bi-product. There is alot of truth to what you are saying, but i think we fail to recognize how deep the tick is buried and how quick it will adjust to its environment. They've moved from Religion to Military Industrial to Politics and Finance, where the power lies, they'll be there.

       Also, Al La Carte Government is a great concept on paper, but nearly 400 million people deciding things in unison is cumbersome and never works. The trick is to grant limited access to representatives with an outside oversight group that has the power to impeach them at a moments notice, without a "peer" trial. Politicians cut for each other like rats cut for cheese. Also, police are under educated meat heads a lot of the time who are looking for a legal way to kill someone. Remove their lethal force and the corruption of that is gone. They can go to the military if that's their aim. I have never understood how Fire and EMS are called when needed, they don't go around causing heart attacks or fires and then putting them out, but police roam around looking to justify their positions. I believe that as a public servant, they should sit in an office till they are needed by the public.

       I agree with #2 but the police part. Without military spending, the police go back to being public servants and thus it's a self-rectifying situation.

       I would like to see optional taxation. I would also like to see the ability to allot more to public services. That would make things a lot better for everyone. Especially the middle class.

       We need to stop funding immigrant/minority welfare and corporate welfare. If people got to keep a good portion of their money before taxes, then they would be more willing to work harder. And those that are worthless bottom-feeders can go away.

       The biggest problem is the top and bottom feeders. They are responsible for the destruction of European values and society from different angles.

If you want to accomplish something, people need to collectively agree to stop paying. No more taxes every year. No more funding congressional reps. Take away their cash flow.

       Ending the drug war does nothing to bring financial information out of the shadows. Sure it dents their cash flow, but only for a short time while they readjust and corner the market on legal drug sales.

       Not sure what you mean by 'A la carte government'. The Swiss already use a system of government with lots of national referendums so people get much more input on issues rather than politicians making critical decisions. However the power of the media nowadays means that rich people can influence opinions so effectively they can often sway popular votes. When you pick a new form of government you have to be extremely careful. Simply saying 'A la carte' isn't good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       There already is a great system to punish people and corporations. It's called the legal system and has been developed over hundreds of years to be very effective. Sadly corporations and rich people have bent and control politics so much that the full legal system is not implemented against corporations. You don't need to come up with some cash back system to destroy companies. Simply use the legal system in place right now. A company kills 100 people due to a bad pesticide, a court sends lots of people at the company to jail due to manslaughter for falsifying safety reports.

       I like your enthusiasm for making the world a better place. Sadly I see a 'solution' that hasn't been thought through more than how long it took you to smoke the 1/8 you bought last night.

       Even though you are wrong, or at least I do not fully agree with what you believe about our legal system's effectiveness, you were pretty civil there until that condescending and insulting final paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a most douchemanlike way to discourage further discussion, as if you just couldn't control yourself from expressing your perceived superiority. The reality is that it exposes to all your lack of control over your own ego and inability to be civil and constructive.

       Agreed. The legal system isn't perfect but it's about the best thing we got to tackle different levels of power between interests in a 'fair' manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also agreed that I was a douche at the end for a reason though and not out of lack of control. I've read so many posts from Marijuana freedom fighters about legalizing that claim to solve the worlds problems but in fact have so little thought behind them I get close to violently ill.

       If you want to coddle reefer lovers solutions to fix the world be my guest. Post away on how amazing his solutions are. Personally I'd rather provide some more thoughtful comments and slap a little sense into the discussion.
