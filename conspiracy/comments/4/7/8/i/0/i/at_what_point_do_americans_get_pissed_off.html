<p>Millions of people losing their homes in the 2008-2009 time frame didn&#39;t do it.  Continual war(s) didn&#39;t do it.  So, all I&#39;m asking here is, what will be the straw that breaks the camels back?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve gone insane recently.</p>

<p>Or a better word is totally demoralized.  </p>

<p>This older dude at a party said he didn&#39;t believe any conspiracy around 9/11 and if he did, it wouldn&#39;t matter anyway.  Just focus on your family.  I hated this attitude, but you know he may be right.  There&#39;s not much to be done and just reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and gabbling about being disempowered isn&#39;t helfpul.  </p>

<p>So I&#39;ll vote, hope for the best and in the meantime I&#39;ll be gardening as hard as I can to try to grow as close to 100% of my food as I can (vegetarian). I may add chickens this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things have been progressing slowly intentionally.  No matter how bad things are they appear &#39;normal&#39; to each generation because they don&#39;t have anything to compare to.  </p>

<p>The scary thing is that the slow progress could be planned to stop at some point with a switch thrown where there is a real change.  We can observe things all around us that may be in preparation for this switch, but they are dismissed by the majority due to normalcy bias.  For example this story: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/homeland-security-bullets_n_2688402.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/homeland-security-bullets_n_2688402.html</a>  Does Homeland Security really need enough bullets to kill each American five times over?</p>

<p>The complete control of media helps perpetuate this sense of normalcy.</p>

I&#39;m not sure how hardset the plan of control for the next 20 years is, but 1996 was a much different world from today, so nothing&#39;s out of the question.  Resistance seems to be invaluable, rather than futile as is often intoned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it will be an economic shock that sets people off. As bad as it&#39;s been since 2008, the Fed has burned through its economic zombie plan of zero interest rates and quantitative easing. The rest of the world is in terrible shape too, since globalization has ensured that everything is economically intertwined. </p>

<p>A small shock could easily set off the next leg down and the Fed is out of ammo. Some European countries are trying negative interest rates to push banks to lend even more. There was article today in The Economist talking about how the Fed could send out helicopter money - literally printing money and sending it directly to citizens. </p>

<p>That this is even being considered is a warning sign that the economic problems of the world are desperate.</p>

<p>Of course, the government has contingency plans to deal with mass unrest. The question is will the military and police abide. </p>

<p>Chris Hedges who has covered revolutions in various parts of the world over his career, has talked about what has happened during uprisings. Sometimes it ends well, but many times a fascist group takes over.  There is a great interview with him on the Real News Network:</p>

<p>The American public has, generally speaking, become sedated with consumerism , pharmaceuticals, lies upon lies spreading fear and violence(media), and the many social issues the establishment use to divide the public. Divide et Impera, Divide and Conquer.</p>

<p>This current election is evidence that the general public is fed up with how the establishment is running things. The large support for Bernie and Trump are evidence of this. Unfortunately, I think the public is being fooled just like they were when Obama with his Hope and Change PR bullshit campaign brought people to vote but to continue their slavery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t.  It&#39;s like portugal and the drug abusers: decriminalization of all drugs there didn&#39;t increase the number of users in a decade--which means that there&#39;s some percentage of society that&#39;s gonna do drugs and a larger group that isn&#39;t, irrespective of rules and regs.</p>

<p>Similarly, and irrespective of reality or Truth, there&#39;s a percentage of people who are smart and know facts and don&#39;t trust their government based on those facts; and there&#39;s a huge percentage of retard assholes who don&#39;t know their asses from holes in the ground ... and they&#39;re going to continue to derp along in their little pathetic lives, working ever more maddening hours for ever QE dwindled value, justifying and defending their captors, forever, even finding creative ways to express their love and joy for psychopathogenic behaviors such as spreading more &#39;freedom&#39; in the form of illegitimate wars.</p>

<p>Basically we&#39;re fucked.  Because of the slumbering masses who throw the alarm when you try to put it closer to them.</p>

<p>The silver lining is, if you become a pscyhopath and enjoy their total and complete suffering and ruin as &#39;they deseverved&#39; in the next few years, it&#39;s ok.  It&#39;s justified.  You did your best.  No one can fault you if you stood up and said your piece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  I do believe you are correct.  The typical fat, jingoistic, unthinking &#39;Murican will go to their grave without so much as even considering for a moment that they&#39;ve been had, just like cattle heading to the slaughter.  I think sometimes that I just wish I didn&#39;t give a shit any longer.  I wish I could take the blue pill, if only to stop this constant pit I have in my stomach.  I think I would, except that I catch myself dreaming of a different world.  One we could have, if we (collectively) cared enough.   </p>
