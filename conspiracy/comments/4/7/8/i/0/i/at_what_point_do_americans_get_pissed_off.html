       Just off the top of my head here: wages have been flat for 30+ years, we have a military industrial complex that is completely out of control, we are being spied on, we now torture and can hold people indefinitely and without due process, we have less than 1/4 the population of China but house the most prisoners in the world who don't exactly come out "rehabilitated", we have a revolving door between congress and K street, we have fake "liberals" who betray the poor and disenfranchised at every turn, we are fed propaganda to such an extent it's mind boggling, our schools no longer educate, our colleges cost a fortune and enslave those who only want to learn and better themselves, the middle class has been decimated, and our representatives do essentially nothing while pointing to social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions of people losing their homes in the 2008-2009 time frame didn't do it.  Continual war(s) didn't do it.  So, all I'm asking here is, what will be the straw that breaks the camels back?

       This older dude at a party said he didn't believe any conspiracy around 9/11 and if he did, it wouldn't matter anyway.  Just focus on your family.  I hated this attitude, but you know he may be right.  There's not much to be done and just reading

       These things have been progressing slowly intentionally.  No matter how bad things are they appear 'normal' to each generation because they don't have anything to compare to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary thing is that the slow progress could be planned to stop at some point with a switch thrown where there is a real change.  We can observe things all around us that may be in preparation for this switch, but they are dismissed by the majority due to normalcy bias.  For example this story:
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/homeland-security-bullets_n_2688402.html">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/homeland-security-bullets_n_2688402.html
       </a>
       Does Homeland Security really need enough bullets to kill each American five times over?
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete control of media helps perpetuate this sense of normalcy.

       You can take away a lot from Americans and many of us will hardly notice.  Especially if the media tells us that losing it is a good thing.  But not internet porn.  The revolution will come when they try to ban internet porn.  I guarantee it.

       For the most part, they don't treat reservists and municipal officers well enough to expect them to enforce endless martial law.  I'm not sure how hardset the plan of control for the next 20 years is, but 1996 was a much different world from today, so nothing's out of the question.  Resistance seems to be invaluable, rather than futile as is often intoned.

       I think it will be an economic shock that sets people off. As bad as it's been since 2008, the Fed has burned through its economic zombie plan of zero interest rates and quantitative easing. The rest of the world is in terrible shape too, since globalization has ensured that everything is economically intertwined.
      </p>
      <p>
       A small shock could easily set off the next leg down and the Fed is out of ammo. Some European countries are trying negative interest rates to push banks to lend even more. There was article today in The Economist talking about how the Fed could send out helicopter money - literally printing money and sending it directly to citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       That this is even being considered is a warning sign that the economic problems of the world are desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the government has contingency plans to deal with mass unrest. The question is will the military and police abide.
      </p>

       Chris Hedges who has covered revolutions in various parts of the world over his career, has talked about what has happened during uprisings. Sometimes it ends well, but many times a fascist group takes over.  There is a great interview with him on the Real News Network:

       The next presidential election. Occurrences like the Bundy Ranch and general government resistance will probably start sparking up here and there... Our government is ready for social unrest (militarized police). Bill Cooper even told us before he died that the NWO's plan was to divide us as a nation and to have the citizens turn against one another.

       As long as the average American can:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Buy cheap worthless food that harms their bodies
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         Watch any kind of distracting entertainment

       What if you drove a van into neighborhoods and ran a very loud nuclear siren for 1 minute and then drove off?  Would it be terrorism?  Or just a thought provoking prank?  It doesn't violate noise ordinances because it has to be for a certain amount of time.

       Moar pain. Plz sir, may we please have another? I don't think we the people is gonna do squat. It will take much moar pain. Unfortunately. In the past decade and a half we pretty much let artificially created fear and bullshit take it all, and by and large the people are to busy just trying to make it to be well informed.  Truth is, maybe a good solid banking collapse might help. And I am starting to think it needs to happen sooner rather than later. What can not be sustained will not be sustained. (Unless you are a big bank ,of course) I am not feeling very optimistic.

       Don't forget the U.S. publicly supporting terrorism. Oh sorry "moderate" terrorists which is code for proxy army /mercenary group.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American public has, generally speaking, become sedated with consumerism , pharmaceuticals, lies upon lies spreading fear and violence(media), and the many social issues the establishment use to divide the public. Divide et Impera, Divide and Conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This current election is evidence that the general public is fed up with how the establishment is running things. The large support for Bernie and Trump are evidence of this. Unfortunately, I think the public is being fooled just like they were when Obama with his Hope and Change PR bullshit campaign brought people to vote but to continue their slavery.

       Supposedly another economic crash might be enough to wake everyone up and end the slave debt system we currently use.

       They don't.  It's like portugal and the drug abusers: decriminalization of all drugs there didn't increase the number of users in a decade--which means that there's some percentage of society that's gonna do drugs and a larger group that isn't, irrespective of rules and regs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, and irrespective of reality or Truth, there's a percentage of people who are smart and know facts and don't trust their government based on those facts; and there's a huge percentage of retard assholes who don't know their asses from holes in the ground ... and they're going to continue to derp along in their little pathetic lives, working ever more maddening hours for ever QE dwindled value, justifying and defending their captors, forever, even finding creative ways to express their love and joy for psychopathogenic behaviors such as spreading more 'freedom' in the form of illegitimate wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically we're fucked.  Because of the slumbering masses who throw the alarm when you try to put it closer to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The silver lining is, if you become a pscyhopath and enjoy their total and complete suffering and ruin as 'they deseverved' in the next few years, it's ok.  It's justified.  You did your best.  No one can fault you if you stood up and said your piece.

       Well said.  I do believe you are correct.  The typical fat, jingoistic, unthinking 'Murican will go to their grave without so much as even considering for a moment that they've been had, just like cattle heading to the slaughter.  I think sometimes that I just wish I didn't give a shit any longer.  I wish I could take the blue pill, if only to stop this constant pit I have in my stomach.  I think I would, except that I catch myself dreaming of a different world.  One we could have, if we (collectively) cared enough.

       Something to add to the list: People will stay happy as long as they take their med's.

       If something were to happen to the supply of all the happy pills we take you can count on all hell breaking loose.

       Occassionally some of the more reactonary fascists play with removing number three.  All it takes is an imbalance and dissidence spreads.  They really need to enact a basic income or swaths of people will die of hunger, exposure and disease.

       What if you drove a van into neighborhoods and ran a very loud nuclear siren for 1 minute and then drove off?  Would it be terrorism?  Or just a thought provoking prank?  It doesn't violate noise ordinances because it has to be for a certain amount of time.
