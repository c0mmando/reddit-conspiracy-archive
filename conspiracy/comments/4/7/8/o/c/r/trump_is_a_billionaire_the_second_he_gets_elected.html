They are greedy and good at lying, that&#39;s how they accumulated so much money in the first place.

The guy is a sellout hypocrite, and anyone who trusts him trusts the media and the words of politicians way too much. </p>

<p>You want to judge someone? Judge them by their actions, not their words. Trump is going to sell us out, everyone with an ounce of sense can see it coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but if Hillary doesn&#39;t win she will have lost the only thing that matters to her, which is power and recognition. And that is at least satisfying for all the voters who she has sold down the river to any side that is willing to make her powerful. Trump has yet to sell out America. At least there&#39;s a small chance he won&#39;t completely Hill-dog America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a court order.  Also, what the court order is asking is that Apple disable the timing and bricking feature.  That is used because users enjoy the convenience of short passwords.  If people really want secure passwords, then they&#39;d make a 20 or so character passwords.</p>

<p>Apple knows many people are lazy, so they want to keep this feature, it has nothing to do with real security, it&#39;s about marketing and getting more people into Apple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also wants to increase Defense spending</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you actually listened to his longer explanations on Defense, you&#39;d know he actually believes in cost cutting.  His big rant is about the corruption due to defense contractors gaming the system along with Congresspeople.  Tanks and the such built to appease Congress by providing jobs to constituents, but never wanted by the military.  Could he fix that, probably not, but that&#39;s what he wants to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>building a fucking wall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do have the right to keep a boarder.  Not policing it will come with consequences we won&#39;t like.  I work in Japan, to enter I had to have a valid passport, working visa (which took months to obtain and employer support), proof of graduating college, and proof of no criminal history.  America has the right to choose who can come in and participate in the economy, just like Japan and every other country does.  Why the hell would you want criminals or uneducated coming into the US?  Letting the uneducated in just makes getting jobs harder for poor Americans.  </p>

<p>I deal with people like you on a daily basis, quick to judge and full of idiotic talking points.  I&#39;d go for Trump or Sanders because they&#39;ll try to change the system.  Sanders appeals to the liberals who don&#39;t like to offend anyone, Trump appeals to conservatives that don&#39;t give a shit about PC talking points.  It&#39;s a game where they go to the far end to win the party and then have to go center for the general election.  They both prefer single payer health care, oppose the TPP, increased taxes on the rich, maintain social security, and opposed the war in Iraq. </p>

everytime i see one of you &quot;don&#39;t vote&quot; idiots all i can assume is that you are a republican/being paid by them, to convince people to just not vote because its pointless.</p>

<p>it&#39;s common knowledge republicans only win when people dont vote</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so are you 18 and just learning about political systems? or just completely disconnected from the basic reality of the world you live in?</p>

<p>guess what you are an always will be ruled over by some one unless you choose to buy a ship and sail off in to international waters.</p>

<p>pretending you can exclude yourself from the system is exactly like an ostrich shoving its head in the sand. by not voting all you do is remove an intelligent vote from their system, leaving it up to the idiots to choose for you.</p>

<p>this is exactly why the political system is in the tatters that it is, and morons are left to be the only ones to choose from. you want to make an actual difference get the fuck out there and tear these jack asses platforms apart, ridicule them and push to support the least worse option. </p>

<p>if you do that the liars will have to pander to that, and you might just see people who aren&#39;t complete idiots getting in to the race.</p>

<p>but if your plan is to just disengage, let the idiots make the decisions so you can bitch about how bad the &quot;system&quot; is just quit bitching too because you have opted out of it and have no right to bitch about the outcome.</p>

and did you actually just cite Ukrainian anarchists like they are successful? you have got to be kidding? i mean clearly ukrainians are much better off now than they were 4 years ago right?</p>

<p>you sound like an angsty teenager frankly. what you are doing isnt changing shit, if you convinced a bunch of people to just not vote all you have done is made it easier for them to focus their efforts on those who still do, effectively making you opinions completely irrelevant in the greater discussion, they will still take your tax money, they will still oppress you with their police if you stir up anything that inconveniences them. </p>

<p>all you have accomplished is silencing yourself for them.  your approach ends one of two ways, armed revolt or irrelevance and frankly good luck versus an army of drones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna insult you but you&#39;re completely wrong. Ron Paul got ignored, because he COULD be ignored. Donald Trump was a media darling before the election. He was a bona-fide american original and a huge celebrity. People are constantly googling him, and as a result, the media HAS to talk about him. Trump is WITHOUT A DOUBT, the most famous person running in this election. He has spent almost no money on ads, and is self funding his campaign. The proof is in the pudding, because in every caucused state Donald Trump ads are something you do not see. His media savvy, and prior celebrity status, are the reasons why he gets attention. </p>

<p>As an example, imagine if Kanye West or Bill Gates ran for office. They would get media attention with or without ads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>any one who tells you to just not vote is an agent of this system and only working to preserve this fucked up situation where people disengage with the entire political process. if you aren&#39;t going to vote why even pay attention right? </p>

<p>anyone telling you to not vote is actively trying to suppress your voice because not voting is treated like abstaining, it&#39;s not like if they have less than 5% turn out they just start over or the system suddenly crumbles. </p>

<p>the lower the turn out the happier they are as its even less work for them to do lying to you. if they can just convince you to not vote that is one less vote they need to try and capture from rivals.</p>

<p>this is not a situation that will change just by being a bunch of lazy idiots choosing not to play, you are already stuck in the game, not rolling the dice is not going to help you win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders says all the right things, but to be honest he&#39;s been part of the system for so damn long I just don&#39;t think he can provide meaningful change. Let&#39;s assume he isn&#39;t all talk to get elected. Let&#39;s assume he isn&#39;t the candidate that TPTB put forward to make sure they always win the election no matter how people vote. I would love to see him get elected president and then fight the powerful interests that really run America. He better wear a Kevlar helmet though cause guys before him that went up against TPTB got shot in the head.</p>

<p>I get your point, I simply don&#39;t believe the system isn&#39;t 100% controlled. Bernie is a safe &#39;anti-rich&#39; candidate. He&#39;s been in government so long he knows how it works...and they know he can be controlled. They can throw him a few bones but on the big issues they won&#39;t let him win.</p>

<p>Just my opinion, happy that others think differently.</p>

The only point of voting, then, is that in such a case you will have reasons to denounce the treachery and maybe even think about overthrowing them ; that however requires a non-brainwashed majority. On the other hand, when a Trump gets elected... well, the country really got who it asked for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is more to the relationship between Trump and Epstein than meets the eye. I recommend you read this piece from Vice (a controlled publication, yes, I know). </p>

<p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton</a></p>

<p>The most interesting passage comes when they get to Trump, near the end:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edwards, the lawyer for [under age sex abuse victim Virginia] Roberts and about 10 other Jane Does, said that after he served Trump with the subpoena in 2009, Trump immediately contacted him.</p>

<p>&quot;During the conversation, Mr. Trump was open and forthright,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;I cannot discuss the substance of the conversation. But I will say that it was obvious to me that he was in no way involved in any untoward activity.&quot;</p>

<p>It appears that Trump cut ties to Epstein a few weeks after the non-prosecution agreement was reached. On October 15, 2007, the New York Post reported that Mar-A-Lago had barred Epstein because he hit on a masseuse at the club. Epstein denied to the the Post that he had been banned. One of the Jane Doe attorneys told VICE News a slightly different account, saying that he had been told Trump broke ties with Epstein after Epstein tried to pick up the underage daughter of a Mar-A-Lago club member.</p>
</blockquote>

Epstein had a mad amount of numbers for Trump and his assistants; makes you wonder if T was a consumer of blackmail material vs. a partaker or if he used Epstein&#39;s &quot;services&quot; for clients. Regardless, it does seem that something much more complicated is going on. </p>

<p>Kills me that the guy who ran off with the little black book served more (and harder) time than Epstein...and is dead now.

<p>I think Bernie is the best candidate because he has a history of standing up for typical Americans, instead of just standing up for billionaires or the military-industrial complex like the other candidates. Bernie seems to kind of actually care about the middle class, and has a track record of doing so unlike Clinton and Trump. It may be a long-con but he&#39;s been doing it for 40 years, so I tend to believe him over Trump who has no track record of helping the middle class, and instead just has a bunch of platitudes and memes. </p>

Of course, I would probably vote Sanders if I had a gun to my head, but given that I don&#39;t and that there is no option for a vote of no confidence, I will not be voting for anyone. Sanders is the least of all evils, I&#39;ll give you that, but still -- anyone who believes this statement does not deserve to rule.</p>

<p>&quot;I support President Obama’s efforts to combat the Islamic State in Syria while at the same time supporting those in Syria trying to overthrow the brutal dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad,” he said.&quot; - Bernie Sanders</p>

<p>I&#39;m very disappointed, I thought Sanders may see above the CIA&#39;s rhetoric about Assad and the middle-east, but it appears he doesn&#39;t. Assad is not a brutal dictator, our leaders just want to install a central bank to enslave his nation and Assad refuses to do so. To me, refusing to be a puppet makes you a good leader, not a dictator. </p>

<p>Reversal phase: The media turns their perceptions around on them or the public gets used to the notion.  &quot;Well, why can&#39;t he become president?  So what if he&#39;s a greedy business man? Maybe that would make him a better president.&quot;</p>

<p>Campaign phase: Bring a lot of exposure, get talking heads to say good things about him, flood the airwaves with propaganda.</p>

<p>Role reversal - I will replace &quot;white male conservative&quot; in the appropriate places from quotes Trump has said. Now tell me how you feel.</p>

<p>&quot;When America sends its white people, they aren&#39;t sending us the best. They&#39;re bringing drugs. They&#39;re bringing crime. They&#39;re rapists. And some I assume are good people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The wall will go up and white people will start behaving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Laziness is a trait in the whites. White people counting my money, I hate it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I were running The 700 Club, I&#39;d fire Pat Robertson. I&#39;d look at him with his fat ugly face of his and say You&#39;re Fired!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;John McCain is not a war hero just because he was captured.&quot; - actually that&#39;s a real quote</p>

<p>&quot;All of the men on The Apprentice flirted with me, conciously or unconsciously. That&#39;s to be expected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Donald J Trump is calling for a complete and total ban of white people coming into this country.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now the Baltic Dry Index is at an all-time low. It tracks international shipping. A few years ago it was at 10,000. Now it&#39;s down at lower than 300. You can see real-time screen-shots of the Atlantic and Pacific both empty of cargo ships. This has never happened before in modern history.</p>

<p>Why are there no ships transporting goods (why are there all these crates on the docks, moldering)?</p>

<p>Because there&#39;s no demand for the products due to the fact that people are broke. Americans--who are traditionally the world&#39;s consumers--aren&#39;t buying. As a result, China hemorrhaged this year and their stock market melted down. (A large portion of their economy is based on Americans buying their goods. If Americans are broke, China keenly feels that huge wedge of their economy missing. To fill it, they inflated their currency and tried to get their business class to spend [to make it look like transactions were taking place]. This caused a bubble and now they&#39;re falling apart.) Japan, too, is collapsing (for very similar reasons).</p>

<p>The Tsunami will hit Europe and South America next--then finally reach the shores of the US.</p>

<p>My point in all this?</p>

<p>If Americans are broke, international trade and finance collapse. Trump understands this.</p>

<p>Giving Americans jobs again [and getting them decent wages] isn&#39;t a philanthropic measure. It&#39;s a hard-nosed realist necessity.</p>

<p>Henry Ford made this point back in the 1920s. He called a meeting of all the big industrialists and said that they had to pay higher wages. With more money in their pockets, people spent, and the economy hummed. By having an impoverished slave population, no one can afford the goods--and the businesses themselves collapse. As a result, Ford gave all his workers massively high wages, and the economy took off.</p>

<p>Trump understands this principle. And he sees what globalism did to the world economy. By gutting the world&#39;s breadbasket [America] and ensuring that Americans couldn&#39;t buy goods, boom: financial instability and collapse for everyone else.</p>

<p>Bringing jobs back to America isn&#39;t a &quot;pie in the sky&quot; altrustic dream. It&#39;s a global economic necessity. Without doing it, world economic recovery is impossible.</p>

<p>Trump gets it.</p>

<p>The incompetents who&#39;ve been running things have de-coupled the financial segment of the economy from the productive segment of the economy. And they&#39;ve been trying [and failing] to jumpstart things by pumping money into Wall Street at the expense of Main Street. But it hasn&#39;t been working. The real economy crashed back in 2008, and they&#39;ve been injecting massive amounts of cash into the banking [financial] sector, but it&#39;s failed. It took the Fed 7 dollars of injections for 1 dollar in GDP growth. That&#39;s pathetic. And it&#39;s killing our economy, because they&#39;re siphoning away money from the productive sector of the economy [the people who actually MAKE things and are the real source of a nation&#39;s wealth] and funneling it to their cronies to keep their insolvent institutions from collapsing. It&#39;s like keeping a grangrenous limb on--and causing the rest of the body to die.</p>

<p>A lot of people (and Trump is among them) are starting to realize that something different has to be done, or we&#39;re going to see a global economic collapse.</p>

<p>That new thing is turning back to what made America&#39;s wealth in the first place: Its productive sector. Its industry.</p>

<p>So bringing jobs back to America isn&#39;t just something that sounds &quot;nice&quot;--it&#39;s essential, or we&#39;re going to collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re getting caught up on political correctness and ideology and ignoring the elephant in the room: Henry Ford created jobs and lifted millions out of poverty.</p>

<p>&quot;But . . . but . . . Jews or something.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if he came to vaguely distrust Jews later on in life. Every American in his day was prejudiced. Are you aware that FDR wouldn&#39;t shake Jesse Owens&#39; hand after the 1936 Olympics because he was black? Even Hitler shook his hand. But not FDR. Are you going to be intellectually consistent and now rail against FDR the way you railed against Ford? (I doubt it. Because FDR is a protected icon of the Left. So you&#39;ll casually overlook his racism.) How about his wife Eleanor? Are you aware that she referred to her black servants as &quot;darkies&quot;? And that she railed at having to go to a party thrown by Jewish financier Bernard Baruch? In a letter to her mother, she wrote that she disliked attending &quot;a Jew party&quot;. She complained that, after finally being forced to go, all the Jews were materialistic and added: “The Jew party was appalling. I never wish to hear money, jewels, and sables mentioned again.”</p>

<p>Read more: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Jews | The Jewish Standard <a href="http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/eleanor-roosevelt-and-the-jews/#ixzz415n6HTuL">http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/eleanor-roosevelt-and-the-jews/#ixzz415n6HTuL</a></p>

<p>So are you going to fly into a passion any time the Roosevelts are mentioned?</p>

<p>Somehow I doubt it.</p>

<p>Or how about another liberal icon, JFK, praising Hitler? You realize that when the Germans started cracking down on Jews, Kennedy&#39;s dad Joe famously said, &quot;The Jews brought it on themselves&quot;. That was the family attitude. And it carried over to the future president, who secretly praised Hitler in his diaries, saying--and this is a quote--&quot;fascism is the right thing for Germany&quot;. See further quotes here:  <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/05/24/jfks-secret-diary-fascism-right-thing-for-germany/">http://dailycaller.com/2013/05/24/jfks-secret-diary-fascism-right-thing-for-germany/</a></p>

<p>“The Nordic races certainly seem to be superior to the Romans,” JFK wrote.</p>

<p>He continues: &quot;You can easily understand how that within a few years Hitler will emerge from the hatred that surrounds him now as one of the most significant figures who ever lived.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. I interrupted your claim that Henry Ford and Henry Ford alone held racist views, and that everyone else in 1930 held modern 2016 views. Only Henry Ford&#39;s accomplishments must be forgotten (due to now-politically inconvenient attitudes). No one else&#39;s legacy must be touched by the attitudes of their time and class. Please continue, and tell us how Ford was an isolated case and everyone else at the time held exactly your 2016 latte-swilling, hipster views.... Let me guess: Abraham Lincoln was pro-gay marriage like you are. And George Washington believed in race-mixing like you do, right? Mark Twain, I bet he held EXACTLY your views on Planned Parenthood! Am I far off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show you in what universe Mexico will pay for a wall?</p>

<p>In <em>this</em> universe--where the US ALREADY gives them hundreds of billions in aid. We cut off that aid until they build the wall. (The price of the wall is a fraction of a fraction of the aid.)</p>

<p>They&#39;ll do whatever we <em>tell</em> them to do because they&#39;ll want the rest of the cash. THAT&#39;S the harsh truth.</p>

<p>We can seal that border up faster than you can say &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot;.</p>

<p>Walls work. Ask Israel. They built one and border violence dropped off to almost nothing.</p>

<p>Ask the Soviet Union, who sealed off a much more massive border in the 1920s.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure the Chinese could build a wall in 1320 BC, but . . . but . . . it&#39;s far too hard for Americans in the 21st Century.&quot;</p>

<p>You bet!</p>

<p>The reality is: We could shut down that border and deport every foreigner on our soil illegally within a year. Eisenhower did it with nearly 2 million Mexicans in the 1950s. For every one foreigner he deported, 10 self-deported. And Einshower didn&#39;t even have an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Department (or any of the modern technology and infrastructure we have today). He used the military and boom: Deported.</p>

<p>It works. And it was easy.</p>

<p>And, to this day, I&#39;ve never heard of any humanitarian crisis. Eisenhower killed no one, put no one in gulags, had no concentration camps. He merely escorted criminals back home. So it&#39;s do-able. And proven do-able.</p>

<p>You have no argument.</p>

<p>&quot;But . . . but . . . but it&#39;s un-doable!&quot;</p>

<p>Except it&#39;s not. Because it&#39;s <em>already</em> been done.</p>

<p>All it requires is a President who actually enforces our nation&#39;s laws. Not a criminal ne&#39;er-do-well in the White House. </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m sorry that you identify with the people raping and murdering our citizens. I&#39;m sure you also identify with the rapefugees in Germany. You think it&#39;s their right to enter the West and victimize the populations there. I&#39;m writing this response to you literally minutes after watching a documentary on TV where a girl was murdered in Boston--by an illegal alien. You want to talk about hate? Talk to her family about the hate of the foreigner who murdered their daughter. Look them in the eyes and tell them it was good that she was &quot;culturally enriched&quot; by the Third Worlder and that you still back the same policies of lawlessness and criminality. Express the opinion to them that &quot;there are no victims with illegal immigration&quot; and that we should &quot;keep those borders porous and wide open&quot; because it gives you a sense of unearned moral superiority. Like the limousine liberals who flood the nation with unvetted criminals and then go live in their gated communities behind walls (with private security for themselves and <em>their</em> families). As I said: It&#39;s called unearned moral superiority. It&#39;s when you endanger the children of others while making sure that walls and guns protect yours. For homework, I&#39;m assigning you this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkN4XiqRnrE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkN4XiqRnrE</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Hispanic-American, in case you didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>No one is anti-immigrant. They&#39;re anti-<em>illegal</em> immigrant.</p>

<p>If your family came here legally and were not a burden to the tax-payer: congratulations! They were doing EXACTLY what the system calls for.</p>

<p>Our whole immigration system is designed for people who will NOT be burden on the American taxpayer. It was set up for people who passed background checks, had no criminal records, and no communicable diseases. It was also set up for people who <em>wanted</em> to assimilate and learn the language.</p>

<p>If your parents were all these things, no one is complaining about them. So why are you clownishly acting as if anyone is?</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m sick and tired of hearing all those native-born Americans complaining about &quot;law-abiding, job-creating immigra---&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, wait! That never happens.</p>

<p>So why are you making it up?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t come complaining to an actual Hispanic-American [me] that &quot;all Trump supporters are &#39;honky-tonk racists&#39;&quot; . . . or whatever racially-charged term you used while pretending to be against racists. (Using honky? My God!)</p>

<p>My grandparents (and great-grandparents) came here legally. And I demand that everyone else does, as well. Why? Because I&#39;m a taxpayer. I&#39;ll be damned if my pockets are picked to subsidize lawlessness. Fuck everything about that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not on the hook for Honduras&#39; citizens. Or Pakistan&#39;s. Or Mexico&#39;s.</p>

<p>I owe their citizens diddly-squat.</p>

<p>But you know what? They owe me and <em>my</em> community the money they cost us in terms of educating their children (while they--unlike us--pay no property taxes. That&#39;s $17,000 a year/per kid); for all the free school lunches; all the emergency room visits that bankrupt local hsopitals; the mountains of welfare; to say nothing of the exploding crime rates. </p>

<p>They owe US! And they should be deported, with their nations charged--with penalties and interest for all the social services they bilked the US taxpayer for while here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but theft is immoral--any way you try to spin it.</p>

<p>The American people are tired of being stolen from--and told to like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a question of one man. The entire global economy now realizes how dependent it is on US consumers. They understand now that if America is &quot;equalized with Mexico and the Third World&quot; [as the globalists wanted] the entire world economy collapses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in China&#39;s interest for Americans to buy shit like crazy. To do that, they need money in their pockets.</p>

<p>So China wants a robust US economy. Germany wants a robust US economy. France wants a robust US economy. India, Pakistan, Israel, etc.</p>

<p>They all rely on US sales.</p>

<p>Without them, those ships I mentioned on the Baltic Dry Index stay in port.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing: If America turns into Mexico, the Vietnamese people won&#39;t replace them as the world&#39;s largest consumers. Nor will Honduras&#39; population. Nor Bangladesh&#39;s, etc.</p>

<p>Only Americans have the economic [and industrial] capacity to buy shit. And if that&#39;s imperiled, the economies of the rest of the world are all screwed.</p>

<p>They know that. So Trump will have zero problem holding a summit, and hashing out the best ways to get jobs for Americans. Of bringing industry back from Southeast Asia, Egypt or Central America. Lowering taxes in the US to lure back all the companies that were driven away. Lowering energy costs [which are the largest single expense of any corporation]. Energy costs now are artificially high because of new (and oftentimes unnecessary) regulation. Like refusing to drill for oil lest you disturb the habitat of the red-crested woodchuck. By returning the regulations to what they were in the 1980s and &#39;90s, costs will plummet. Businesses will flock here if electricity is a fraction of what it is in the backward, expensive, increasingly-unstable European Union. BMW <em>already</em> moved to South Carolina for that reason. Michelin, too. A ton of companies have <em>already</em> started moving to the US. </p>

<p>As I said: Global leaders working with Trump to bring industry back to US shores won&#39;t be motivated by philanthropy, but self-interest.</p>

<p>The <em>whole world</em> needs Americans buying shit.</p>

<p>No more Mexicanization of the US economy. China can&#39;t afford it. The E.U. can&#39;t afford it. India can&#39;t afford it.</p>

<p>Without a Middle Class in the States, the whole global system crashes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re 100% right. It&#39;s a battle of warring cartels. The Globalists (who want to consolidate power via a World Government . . . whose foundation they&#39;ve been laying since the League of Nations 100 years ago) and the Industrialists who know <em>economically</em> that the world relies on the US Middle Class to buy their products. Who understand that if you &quot;equalize&quot; America with the Third World, sales will collapse.</p>

<p>So it&#39;ll will be a battle between the discredited globalists (and their thirst to erase borders and erode regional sovereignty) and the industrialists, who understand economic necessity and are indifferent to ideology. The thing is: After the collapse of the globalist &quot;financial economy&quot; with its derivatives and bubbles, the industrialists will have the upper hand.</p>

<p>&quot;We <em>tried</em> it your way. You took the whole global economy down! Now let&#39;s get back to <em>our</em> proven way--of making things.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: Noam Chomsky talked about the fact that in the 1970s, a decision had been taken to transition America away from a &quot;productive economy&quot; [i.e., a country that Made Things] to a &quot;financial economy&quot; [i.e., an economy that generated paper profits through scammy methods like derivatives and credit default swaps]. As we&#39;re learning now, the so-called financial economy is a House of Cards. It looks good at first, but it melts down with ease. Deutschebank, for instance, is on the edge of insolvency because of derivatives. So is Citibank. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are overleveraged hundreds of times beyond their actual assets. (For instance, Goldman Sachs has something like $900 billion in ACTUAL assets, but they&#39;re on the hook for $75 trillion due to derivatives). It&#39;s gotten so bad that the FED can no longer bail them out [because the FED&#39;s total capitalization is only about 3 trillion.] As oil prices collapse, and these banks lose $80 per barrel that they&#39;re contractually obligated to pay, they&#39;re going to go under--and the entire &quot;financial economy&quot; with them. Most people are completely unaware of how fragile the &quot;new system&quot; they ushered in is (and how robust and resilient the old system we <em>used</em> to have was). Physical assets (though harder to manipulate on paper) are more stable. When a nation has a <em>productive</em> economy [based on industry] it&#39;s harder to take it down. But what made the &quot;globalist financial economy&quot; so tempting was that it was so easy to scam and create fake profits on paper. Its Achilles heel, though, was that easy come easy go. . . . That which was generated from thin air tends to evaporate easily into thin air. P.S.--For those that don&#39;t understand derivatives contracts. It&#39;s like insurance. A party can take out a contract with a Middle Man to insure the price of a commodity that they know they have to use to operate. Like oil. Say, an Energy Company knows they&#39;ll need oil to run their plants, and they don&#39;t want to have to stay on top of the shifting prices every day. They want to hash out their costs and make their projections, and it&#39;ll be easier to do with a fixed price. So they might look to get a &quot;derivative contract&quot; with a Middle Man, who can negotiate a set price for the oil (so they don&#39;t have to worry about it on a daily basis). The Middle Man will broker a contract between their new client [the Energy Company] and, say, an oil-producing state [like Saudi Arabia]. So if the contract is written predicated on the assumption that oil will be at $100 per barrel, the Middle Man [like Goldman Sachs] is contractually obligated to pay out on that number. But what if oil crashes? What if oil drops down to $20 a barrel? Goldman Sachs still has to pay out $100 per barrel <em>as per contract</em> (at an $80 per barrel loss). So Goldman Sachs (and all these other institutions) got into the business of insurance [i.e., derivatives contracts]. Now they&#39;re all hovering on the edge of insolvency. It&#39;s a $2 quadrillion bubble. More money than the GDPs of every country on Earth, combined--16 times over. &quot;Talk about &#39;screwed&#39;!&quot;</li>

<p>I dislike racism as much as you do. (Probably more. I&#39;m Hispanic, so I&#39;ve actually encountered racism.) But as heinous as it is, it&#39;d be insane not to look at people within the context of their own societies. Like the pass that Lincoln gets for all his blatantly racist comments. He was a man of his day with a lot of the attitudes of his day. (Just like we are. In the future, there are attitudes we have that will appall future generations--and we have no idea which ones.) So it seems to me logical to forgive people when they lapse into the mental habits of their day. My criterion is simple: Did Henry Ford, the man, murder Jews? (No.) Did he call for them to be murdered? (No.) Does the fact that millions admired him (including Hitler) make him responsible for <em>their</em> acts? (No.) Der Fuhrer idolized Ford not for racial policy (or ideological ideas) but because of the fact that Ford lifted millions in America out of poverty (and Hitler wanted to do the same thing in Germany). The fact that Ford&#39;s company sold internationally (to a million different places) is irrelevant to me. Hell, if he didn&#39;t, Ford Motor Company wouldn&#39;t have exploded in profits and his workers wouldn&#39;t have had jobs.</p>

<p>Your point is: &quot;Yeah, but of the 212 countries he sold to, 3 were really bad!&quot;</p>

<p>On balance, that&#39;s not really a bad record.</p>

<p>You typing on a computer right now that&#39;s based on IBM technology? </p>

<p>You gonna be intellectually consistent and reject every invention EVER of anyone who didn&#39;t like Jews? <em>Really?</em></p>

<p>Is that what Leftist conditioning has done?</p>

<p>Your guiding consideration every day, with every breath you take, is if some product you&#39;re using wasn&#39;t designed by someone who disliked Jews? Then you better stop using lightbulbs, because Thomas Edison [a friend of Henry Ford] also disliked Jews.</p>

<p>That alternating current powering your devices? That was invented by Nikola Tesla. Hint: As a man of his day, he disliked Jews too.</p>

<p>So you better power down all your devices, turn off all the lights you&#39;re using, abandon about 72% of all the products in your home because . . . Jews or something.</p>

<p>(Sounds real rational.)</p>

That&#39;s capitalisms. They want to make money. And they do what it takes to make it. Hillary or Trump, both are the same, it&#39;s an oligarchy, not a democracy. Both are horrible persons and yet people will vote for them. The last good president was murdered to prevent the truth from coming out. Now it&#39;s too late, the system is forged.</p>

<p>The problem that we face is that a huge percentage of our population are &quot;followers&quot; who simply want to be led by someone they see as braver than themselves. </p>

<p>Trump says bigoted things on tv and gets away with it and that appeals to most people, to some degree (not in that it&#39;s bigoted, but that he exercises freedom from criticism.)</p>

<p>Sanders (imo) is comparable because he evokes a similar motif, but instead employing moral high ground as an immunity to criticism.</p>

<p>I really hope we see them both in the final showdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does anyone become successful? They fuck over others to get there. You want to think the world is a level playing field and it just isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>There are a great many things you obviously don&#39;t understand. Maybe I don&#39;t either, but at 37 years old now I have come to a realization. There isn&#39;t anyone with your best interest in mind. Cause of one reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yours and my needs are not the same. I want shit to change and I see Trump doing that. I see him going in and just scaring the shit out of everyone. Fear is the greatest of all motivational tools we have in humanity. Fearing the uncertian.</p>

<p>People love predictable behavior cause they can plan shit. They enjoy labeled cause it makes their world mentally digestible. You would name someone a psychopath because they are a billionaire. I call them a goddamn leader. </p>

<p>Money doesn&#39;t make you happy I know, but you ever had a entire year where you were able to just do anything you wanted? Walk into a store and just pay off everyone&#39;s bill? Have you ever seen a person that didn&#39;t have enough money in the checkout at the grocery store and just said &quot; I got this&quot;?</p>

<p>That is a great feeling to just be able to not worry about money. Everyone remembers the bad shit about others cause humanity will always unite to fight an evil that they perceive as such.</p>

<p>Just like we love.to kill each other. Look at history and tell me that we are not always finding better and better ways at destroying each other. To suppress that is so damn stupid. We need it to keep from killing each other. War has to happen. Think of it as a purge of emotion and general frustration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump... Never been voted to public office in his life, can&#39;t recall him ever presenting a policy of substance or benefit or him ever previously showing such care for the millions of ordinary American citizens.</p>

<p>His life motivations have been centered on making  vast amounts of money and investing in, doing business with, and socially equating with the upper echelons of society. It doesn&#39;t make him a bad person in any way but it does make me stop &amp; wonder why now?? I think he took one look at the Republican lineup and said &quot;I&#39;m greater than these chumps&quot; and thought fuck it, I&#39;ve got all these billions of $$$ to play with.. I&#39;ve achieved great success as evident, I think I&#39;ll become president now..Couple tough lines about economics, bit of racism and fear scapegoating and BOOM... Leader of the free world... </p>

<p>Help us.... Bernie 2016.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is an American hero. He suits up in the worst armor possible and goes to war for the American soul.<br/>
He is the true hero here. Sanders has always wanted this. Of course some people will want stuff from an early age and be right. It&#39;s just a matter of numbers. Sanders drew the winning lottery ticket; he was right all along.<br/>
But Trump.  He did what he had to do to play the game of man.  And he did so successfully. This is where his story could have ended. But he chose to look at his brethren, way too late in life if you ask me, but none the less. He looked at his nation and said to himself: I can improve on this. It will cost me my good name. I will be shunned for generations. Just to be clear, he is the controlling force for implementing Social Democracy in the US in among the republicans. He controls the narrative. Sanders and Trump are reforming the US and therefor the world. But while Sanders is greeted like Jesus, Trump is shunned like the devil. But he still does it. Because he is a fucking true American hero.<br/>
No one will ever thank him. People will think he stood in the way. He will be shunned, his family name will be shunned. But without him, Social Democracy and justice probably would never had come to the US. The real American hero. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your theory there is the media has never hit this so called reversal phase. They have been anti-Trump since he announced he was running. Right now they shill for Clinton/Rubio. Trump gets covered a lot only because he brings in ratings. What are they supposed to do just ignore the lead candidate? They actually try sometimes to downplay him but it just makes them look increasingly stupid.</p>

obama was voted in because no one took a real critical look at his actual policies. they voted based on feeling and emotion, he is the first black guy we have to!!</p>

<p>do you think just not voting is going to change how that will play out? it doesn&#39;t matter which side of the spectrum you vote for, if you allow morons a free pass and never ask them hard questions then the people you disdain for voting are going to elect them anyway.</p>

<p>we are all on this boat together, not voting for the shitty captains isn&#39;t going to stop the ship from sinking, you want change you need to be the captain.</p>

<p>I dislike racism as much as you do. (Probably more. I&#39;m Hispanic, so I&#39;ve actually encountered racism.) But as heinous as it is, it&#39;d be insane not to look at people within the context of their own societies. Like the pass that Lincoln gets for all his blatantly racist comments. He was a man of his day with a lot of the attitudes of his day. (Just like we are. In the future, there are attitudes we have that will appall future generations--and we have no idea which ones.) So it seems to me logical to forgive people when they lapse into the mental habits of their day. My criterion is simple: Did Henry Ford, the man, murder Jews? (No.) Did he call for them to be murdered? (No.) Does the fact that millions admired him (including Hitler) make him responsible for <em>their</em> acts? (No.) Der Fuhrer idolized Ford not for racial policy (or ideological ideas) but because of the fact that Ford lifted millions in America out of poverty (and Hitler wanted to do the same thing in Germany). The fact that Ford&#39;s company sold internationally (to a million different places) is irrelevant to me. Hell, if he didn&#39;t, Ford Motor Company wouldn&#39;t have exploded in profits and his workers wouldn&#39;t have had jobs.</p>

<p>Your point is: &quot;Yeah, but of the 212 countries he sold to, 3 were really bad!&quot;</p>

<p>On balance, that&#39;s not really a bad record.</p>

<p>You typing on a computer right now that&#39;s based on IBM technology? </p>

<p>You gonna be intellectually consistent and reject every invention EVER of anyone who didn&#39;t like Jews? <em>Really?</em></p>

<p>Is that what Leftist conditioning has done?</p>

<p>Your guiding consideration every day, with every breath you take, is if some product you&#39;re using wasn&#39;t designed by someone who disliked Jews? Then you better stop using lightbulbs, because Thomas Edison [a friend of Henry Ford] also disliked Jews.</p>

<p>That alternating current powering your devices? That was invented by Nikola Tesla. Hint: As a man of his day, he disliked Jews too.</p>

<p>So you better power down all your devices, turn off all the lights you&#39;re using, abandon about 72% of all the products in your home because . . . Jews or something.</p>

<p>(Sounds real rational.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sanders says all the right things, but to be honest he&#39;s been part of the system for so damn long I just don&#39;t think he can provide meaningful change. Let&#39;s assume he isn&#39;t all talk to get elected. Let&#39;s assume he isn&#39;t the candidate that TPTB put forward to make sure they always win the election no matter how people vote. I would love to see him get elected president and then fight the powerful interests that really run America. He better wear a Kevlar helmet though cause guys before him that went up against TPTB got shot in the head.</p>

<p>I get your point, I simply don&#39;t believe the system isn&#39;t 100% controlled. Bernie is a safe &#39;anti-rich&#39; candidate. He&#39;s been in government so long he knows how it works...and they know he can be controlled. They can throw him a few bones but on the big issues they won&#39;t let him win.</p>

<p>Just my opinion, happy that others think differently.</p>
