        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Basically, the United States was taken over when Kennedy was murdered by the military/intelligence complex and the citizenry are being &quot;milked&quot; in order to advance their agenda of power. Allen Dulles was famous for saying &quot;Democracy is better left to the intelligent people.&quot; Since that time, the US has been used as the foundation for a global empire by hook or by crook. 
Ray McGovern had this to say <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/">http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, John Kennedy had problems of the same kind, and he fired Dulles. And that was a no-no. You don’t fire people like Dulles. Kennedy embarked on a new course. He talked with Khrushchev, he had people, interlocutors, who talked with Castro, and, worst of all, he issued two executive orders, saying that 1,000 U.S troops would be pulled out of Vietnam by the end of 1963 and the bulk of the rest by 1965. He was going to give up Southeast Asia to the Commies, and God knows what would happen next with the dominoes falling and Indonesia, and my God… So he was killed by the “deep state.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For further information on this, read Russ Baker&#39;s &quot;Family of Secrets&quot;, David Talbot&#39;s &quot;The Devil&#39;s Chessboard&quot;, and James Douglass&#39; &quot;JFK and the Unspeakable&quot;.</p>

<p>The method for the expansion of empire started back when the Dulles brothers were in power. The first incident was Kermit Roosevelt and the staging of the 1953 coup in Iran, called &quot;Operation Ajax&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d&#x27;%C3%A9tat">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d&#39;%C3%A9tat</a></p>

<p>We have seen many more of these coups occur throughout the world, even as recently as the one in the Ukraine.  Ray McGovern, 30 year CIA veteran who used to give the intelligence briefings to the president had this to say: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/">http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the Victoria Nuland—Geoffrey Pyatt conversation, “Yats is the guy.” [Arsenyi Yatsenyuk, Nuland’s preference as premier.] I wake up the 23rd of February and turn on the radio to find out there’s been a coup in Kiev and who’s the new prime minister? Yatsenyuk! And he still is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a list of coups that we know about, you can see them here:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change</a></p>

<p>So what is the goal of all of this beyond simply the expansion of power?  Well, if you are Exxon and the socialist government of Iran will not grant you drilling rights, then you get your friends in government to get them for you by installing the leader of your choice.  Then, to complete the takeover, you get your newly installed leader to take out massive loans from the IMF to install the infrastructure for the corporations and have the citizens of that country pay for it all.  For more info on this read John Perkins’ “Confessions of an Economic Hitman”.</p>

<p>And what if the people do not want to go to war for money or empire?  You simply give them a humanitarian reason to do so.  This has been seen throughout history and we should not expect to see it end any time soon.  From the sinking of the Maine, the Lusitania, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the Gleiwitz Tower, the Nayirah testimony, to the 9/11 of today…  those who have the desire to have power over other people will continue driving people to war under false pretenses.</p>

<p>So why is this important today?  Well, I see a lot of people who think that if we simply elect the right person as president, then things will get better.  This simply is not true.  There is a second government that transcends presidencies.  And if a president were to actually try and put a stop to it, just as the Kennedys did, then he, too, will be assassinated in the name of “national security”.  Whether it is Sanders or Trump… this power will not allow itself to be removed.  For more information on this, read Michael Glennon’s “National Security and Double Government”.  </p>

<p>Overall, this is very complex and very simple all at once:  Powerful people use their power to control other people and rig the system in their favor and use the lie of doing it for the citizens in the name of “national security” to justify their actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I find rather disturbing is the thought of the technologies that the &quot;deep state&quot; likely had access to. It is not science fiction that MAJIC exists, and that this committee, currently of ~300-400 of the most powerful pseudo corporate shadow figures on Earth, has been in existence since its inception in the 40&#39;s-50&#39;s. MAJIC hijacked our scientific progression as a species by hiding new physicists and the physics of the future behind closed doors. T. Townsend Brown stumbled upon the distinct electro-gravitic effect during his research around this time. The implications of this technology were absolutely so radical that further development and research was placed within the realm of USAP&#39;s and black budget programs within the private military-industrial aerospace industry (Lockheed Skunkworks, Northropp Grumman, etc.). These highly advanced, classified technologies, in their current states in 2016, have been developed alongside public, &quot;archaic&quot;, parallel systems such as the Internet, wireless communications, centralized, distributed energy system. The systems well known to the public are utterly vulnerable and designed for control of the masses, while simultaneously hiding the reality of their exponentially more powerful technology. The sole possession of highly advanced technologies give the creators/owners (MAJIC) an upper hand of immeasurable magnitude. In terms of control, this disparity of technology, is essentially a separation of power to the degree of gods vs. mortals. This is the the nature of the world we live in. The implications are that a small minority of humans are likely already traveling the solar system, and simultaneously maintaining tabs on the entire human race via electronic surveillance within the public parallel systems. On the whole, man has achieved godly power with his creative mind, yet he is using it against his brothers and sisters as a means of ultimate control, instead of open-sourcing/advancing our entire species to a level unimaginable to the layman.</p>

<p>All this, in conjunction with the realities explained by OP, John Perkins, and many others, this starts to paint a monstrous and unbelievable reality.</p>

<p>This is the nature of our existence, as understood by myself, and many others, after hundreds if not thousands of hours of personal research. If more interested in T Townsend Brown and the way the electro-gravitic effect is theorized to have worked, and how it was eventually swallowed whole by MAJIC, look into the book &quot;Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion&quot; by Ph.D. Paul LaViollette.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I get why they do it to a degree. Take weather manipulation for example. Imagine if every person had a personal device to control the weather. It would probably be chaos. So for certain kind of techs you really don&#39;t want the general public to have access to them. The bigger issue is more the secrecy, and exclusion. I&#39;m sure most people would be reasonable about it like I am about not demanding access to dangerous techs. But because they are hoarding it all, and only releasing bits an pieces, and we get no input on what is released it&#39;s an unfair situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is astounding. I think the best starting point is to learn up on the history of the world and the dominant monetary system and how it has come to be. From there, you can next learn about some of the great inventors and scientists, like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Townsend Brown. Once you&#39;ve learned some about those fields, you can begin to understand the value of scientific progress, especially to the powerful, ultra-wealthy, elite. You will find that science has always been held back by power, because knowledge is power and knowledge threatens power holds. If everyone was free, there would no longer be economic leverage to maintain a ruler/ruled relationship among human beings. It would be a level playing field, and the most powerful don&#39;t necessarily want that. Think House of Morgan, Rockefeller, Rothschild. Follow the money!</p>

<p>As far as the exclusive technology goes, it&#39;s no conspiracy that the military and its tentacles take advantage of secrecy to maintain an upper hand on opposing forces. You can use the book I mentioned as a resource for some of the info about electro-gravitic theory, or you can simply start googling and attempt to sift the wheat from the chaff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Exhibit A:</strong> </p>

<p>Goethe&#39;s Faust (1808)</p>

<p>Mephistopheles (the &quot;son of hell&quot; in Goethe&#39;s &quot;Faust&quot;, published in 1808) was able to enter into Faust&#39;s study because Faust&#39;s pentagram was poorly made... one of it&#39;s angles was broken:</p>

<p>(Goethe&#39;s Faust, Scene Six, Faust&#39;s Study)</p>

<p>Mephistopheles:</p>

<p>Let me own up! I cannot go away;
A little hinderance bids me stay,
The witch&#39;s foot upon your sill I see.</p>

<p>Faust:</p>

<p>The pentagram? That&#39;s in your way?
You son of Hell explain to me,
If that stays you, how came you in today?</p>

<p>Mephistopheles:</p>

<p>Observe it closely! It is not well made;
One angle, on the outer side of it,
is just a little open, as you see.</p>

<p><strong>Exhibit B:</strong> </p>

<p>Masonic writer Manly P. Hall writes in connection with the broken pentagram that in black magic, the pentagram may be broken at one point by not permitting the converging lines to touch: </p>

<p>&quot;The pentagram is used extensively in black magic, but when so used its form always differs in one of three ways: The star may be broken at one point by not permitting the converging lines to touch; it may be inverted by having one point down and two up; or it may be distorted by having the points of varying lengths. When used in black magic, the pentagram is called the &quot;sign of the cloven hoof,&quot; or the footprint of the Devil. The star with two points upward is also called the &quot;Goat of Mendes,&quot; because the inverted star is the same shape as a goat&#39;s head. When the upright star turns and the upper point falls to the bottom, it signifies the fall of the Morning Star.&quot; (The Secret Teachings of All Ages, p.104, Chapter: Ceremonial Magic and Sorcery)</p>

<p>It&#39;s perversion and subsequent use by practitioners of black magic is probably not the type of knowledge they want committed to primary sources. So I&#39;m not inclined to think that Faust is the first instance of this broken pentagram &quot;motif.&quot; </p>

<p>You clearly just ignored my reply. I said it&#39;s not even hard to reason that a practice of perverting this 8000 year old symbol was in all probability and practicality, an oral tradition, so as to avoid the fate so regularly meet by those who dabbled in witchcraft. </p>

<p>The notion that the broken pentagram was a simple machination of Goethe is patently absurd. Both the Pentagram and it&#39;s perverted variations were in existence milennia before these writings. Obviously, the work is inspired by occult canon. </p>

<p>The Agreement would have transferred some 59,000 tons of gold to underpin this currency. The problem with this was that the US domestic currency would have then been backed by gold which would have been a violation of international agreements meant to stabilize currencies.</p>

<p>Eight days after signing this agreement, President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>

<p>President Johnson suspended the EO-11110 as issued by Kennedy and transferred the bullion to the Federal Reserve. In Indonesia, President Sukarno was gradually placed under house arrest. </p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the only thing JFK was doing that got him whacked, but it was probably the biggest. </p>

<p>I just see the American people as the livestock &amp; domesticated animals in the book &#39;Animal Farm&#39;. All the livestock are worked to the bone &amp; used by the fat greedy piggies (banksters), and the livestock can&#39;t fight back because the piggies are guarded by the fearsome guard dogs (US Military, Police, Intelligence Agencies) who are trained to tear into their prey. So whenever I see America bomb people I always look to see who it&#39;s really benefiting. </p>

<p>Better yet, remember Voltaire? </p>

<li><p>L&#39;homme est libre au moment qu&#39;il veut l&#39;être. -&gt; <strong>Man is free at the instant he wants to be.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, IMHO we were taken over way before President Kennedy&#39;s time. America was taken over the day the Federal Reserve was finally created, which was in 1913. What a bad year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sustained populist movement to vote out party candidates at the local, state, and federal level. Across continuous election cycles until successful. And most importantly - the mistake Ross Perot made - would be to NOT form a &#39;third&#39; political party in replacement. But instead to rely on individual independent candidates and their campaign statements. </p>

<p>To recommend a &#39;pledge&#39; that candidates of said movement promise to adhere to. At the local and state level, to transparently fund the services of government such as schools. And to restrain the powers of the police. At the federal level, to end wars of aggression. To cut the military budget. To cut the black budget and end the security state. </p>

<p>If hundreds or thousands put themselves forth as candidates of this nature. And ran grass roots campaigns. And took the time and the energy to challenge each and every election... some would win. And in time it might snowball. </p>

<p>This is the only way to wrest power from those who wield it unlawfully. And even if they rig the voting machines, with enough support that rigging will become too obvious. At a certain point the system of self-reinforcing controls the parties hold will break. From the bottom up, local and state through to congress. Not the top down, in a futile attempt to try to take the presidency without a power base of support. </p>

And in that event, the government really does win. They have the military power to force total domination. A violent citizen uprising plays into their hands. And they know that, otherwise why else do they so often use agent provocateurs?</p>

<p>The only way to change this situation is politically. By organizing the mass use of legal means of change. And praying the Gandhi factor of world publicity might prevent military suppression a la Prague &#39;68 and Tienanmen &#39;89. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are only 2 ways that institutions like this fall.  They either fall through direct violence or they fall economically.</p>

<p>To address the violence issue:  Why does the government have a monopoly on violence?  If you became a big enough threat to the institution in the name of peace, they would have no problem JFKing, RFKing, or MLKing you.  Having lofty idealism with regards to yourself will not get you results... it will just get you dead without having accomplished anything.</p>

<p>To address the economic issue:  How much are you willing to suffer?  Are you willing to participate in a general strike and not get paid?  Are you willing to possibly lose your job?  You might have a family to feed or simply must depend on yourself to make ends meet.</p>

<p>These are the choices we must face.  Just because chattel slavery has been outlawed does not mean that being enslaved to a system of imperialism does not exist through.  Which are you?  <a href="http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/five-forms-of-slavery">http://freedomcenter.org/enabling-freedom/five-forms-of-slavery</a></p>

<p>Or maybe you are simply a serf, but at least serfs only had to pay 10% to their king.</p>

<p>This is correct.  However, the even bigger conspiracy here is what those very powerful figures are doing with that immense amount of power they&#39;ve accumulated - those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpSBUgbxBU#t=00m07s"><em>trillions</em> of dollars</a> they&#39;ve all but stolen.</p>

<p>What are they doing with all that money?  Well, some military higher ups have gone on record to say that there&#39;s a secret space program that&#39;s been in operation since at that human colonies have been established on Mars and on other planets throughout the solar system since at least the 1940s...and they, further, have gone on to say that these planets are very much inhabited by beings no less (and sometimes very much more) intelligent than human beings.</p>

<p>So the big conspiracy here isn&#39;t so much what TPTB did as much as it is what they&#39;re doing with the money they&#39;ve stolen.</p>

I just recently learned about a lot of these regime changes that the US has been involved in through the Chomsky collection, <em>How the World Works</em>. They don&#39;t teach you this stuff in school that&#39;s for sure! From the book: &quot;James Madison believed that the primary goal of government is &#39;to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.&#39; As his colleague John Jay was fond of putting it, &#39;The people who own the country ought to govern it.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period <strong><em>I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.</em></strong> I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot; </p>

It&#39;s the CIA that must be reformed first. the Military would do well to rid themselves of the close ties to same. As well, stop backing NATO. It&#39;s expensive and they start too much shit.</p>

Kennedy was an Irish Catholic who represented a challenge to the established WASP order of the US. The most basic structures go further back in time toward Britain/UK. On one level, you can view the history of the US as a long attack by the Brits trying to hold the US down any way they can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As noted in the final paragraph, even if the voting system is broken it&#39;s the only legal avenue for change among citizens. The other option leads to civil war. And in that event, the government really does win. They have the military power to force total domination. A violent citizen uprising plays into their hands. And they know that, otherwise why else do they so often use agent provocateurs?</p>

<p>The only way to change this situation is politically. By organizing the mass use of legal means of change. And praying the Gandhi factor of world publicity might prevent military suppression a la Prague &#39;68 and Tienanmen &#39;89. </p>

<p>It&#39;s perversion and subsequent use by practitioners of black magic is probably not the type of knowledge they want committed to primary sources. So I&#39;m not inclined to think that Faust is the first instance of this broken pentagram &quot;motif.&quot; </p>
