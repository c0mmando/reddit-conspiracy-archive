       They have from 72 days from now to 2 years from now to pass the TPP in the US. Obama will not veto it, so it is up to congress to block it. During this window, public pressure must be applied toward congress to not pass the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will cause even faster globalization of jobs, both in-sourcing with visas and traditional overseas out-sourcing. It will create an international corporate court, where they can decide patent law and other laws above and beyond even the powers of any government of any country. They would be able to override the US Supreme Court. By corporations, for corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the already-passed fasttrack bill, the TPP only needs a simple majority to pass and cannot be filibustered. This increases the difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make some noise about the TPP and educate others to reinforce the movement against this, or we will all have to live with the consequences.

       What needs to happen is for some concerned citizens to take this to the Supreme Court on Constitutional grounds, seeing as Congress's "vote on the TPP" is actually a vote to transfer US national sovereignty to a foreign entity. And any member of Congress who votes for the TPP should be arrested for treason.

       Got some bad news for you. You're a few decades late. TPP's ISDS is pretty much no different than the rest of our trade deals' investor-state dispute rules. It actually has more protection against abuse than any other trade deal. So you're late to going full hermit. (Btw, it's not the death of sovereignty either)

       One good thing we have on our side at least is that Sanders, and Trump both don't like it so will hopefully draw more public attention to it leading up the general election. We need people to organize, and make it known any Congressman that's in favor of the TPP is getting voted out.

       If Trump or Sanders win they might do something about the TPP, assuming they aren't just lying like every politician. If Clinton wins, I'm hoping for riots in the street and Congress burned to the ground because that'll keep them from voting on it.

       TTIP is being shoved down NATO's throats; TTP is between several countries in the Americas and East Asia. I believe the US and Canada are the only NATO countries in TPP.

       Yeah seriously, I'm so sick of seeing this on conspiracy! This naive notion that if only your party controlled the congress and the presidency and the supreme court, you could get things done in your country. There is a reason the two-party system exists in America, it is the strongest form of divide and conquer. 
So people like you will be pacified as you stay awake at night thinking about those damn republicans or those dumbass liberals, it's all the same now folks. Really, the types of things that will fix America transcend party politics, because they have to do with truth and revolt, things that both parties are against. Both political parties have betrayed the constitution because the document argues for your sovereign rights as a citizen to disobey and overthrow tyrannical governments. I wish people realized this, I expect way more from fellow r/conspiracy users, Krishna. Both parties are monstrosities at this point, and they should be burnt to the ground and reconstructed with a real form of representation, or none at all.

       Lay back, man, and we'll come to terms with this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of having your local government determine when and where you have committed a crime, a corporate council will make these determinations for all TPP partners, ignoring political borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       In practice, this could mean being sued for a product you invented that is similar to a product in a foreign country. Even though you don't sell to that market, the other company could claim you have affected their sales. Depending on the TPP laws themselves, this might cause you to lose business, or even be forced to stop selling the product. All this, while you never violated a law in your country...
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can be a US citizen, with all the rights that come with it, but you would now be required to follow the laws of foreign countries, in your own country. Because it's about imposing more restrictions on individuals. Why not expand the number of laws they have to follow... laws they've probably never even heard of, and will probably not be informed of, as misinformation of the law, is not a defensible excuse.

       Mag, great post, but I think you've made a factual error.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brought this up in one of your other threads on the topic, but that 90-day clock doesn't start until the bill to ratify the TPP is introduced into Congress, not from when the USTR signed the deal. To my knowledge, no such bill has been introduced yet, so there's still at least 90 days before it can come to a vote. Do you have any source that says otherwise?

        The U.S. Congress is not likely to vote on the TPP implementing legislation (aka ratification) until after the International Trade Commission (ITC) comes out with its report about the agreement's economic impacts in mid-May.

      <p>
       As I understand it, there was a 90 day period between when the TPP text was finalized and when it was signed by all 12 countries. That already happened, it was supposed to be a "discussion period" but the MSM completely ignored it as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that it's been signed, all 12 countries have to ratify it through their individual congresses. Technically, this could happen immediately from what I understand, but congress isn't going to vote on it until the ITC and other organizations are able to study it and make recommendations agreeing with the text.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a theoretical 90-day timeframe until this finishes, but technically they could introduce and pass it today from what I understand. Although that's very unlikely because it has to be fully approved by US big-business organizations first, like the ITC.

       Ah, it appears you are correct on that point, that the 90 days was between PotUS submitting the text to Congress and signing it has passed, in which case it seems that the 72-day timeframe you propose is arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still other timeframe considerations, however. Sen.
       <a href="http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/featured-articles/8427-hatch-says-administration-signing-tpp-just-the-beginning">
        Orrin Hatch says
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The TPA statute is clear, however, that the final text of the agreement and the detailed
        <strong>
         administrative plan must be provided to Congress AT LEAST – and those two words are very important – at least 30 days before formally submitting legislation to implement the agreement.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is one of the more important timelines in the statute, and it notably provides a floor, not a ceiling.  It sets a minimum time frame to ensure Congress has AT LEAST – there are those two words again – 30 days to review all the necessary information and documents before the implementing legislation is formally submitted to Congress.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From what I gather, this has not happened yet. After it does, there are still more steps before the second 90-clock (this one a deadline) kicks in.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, Congress, in consultation with the administration, has to develop a draft implementing bill for the agreement.  Then, the committees of jurisdiction will hold hearings to examine both the agreement and the draft legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following these hearings, another very important step occurs: the informal markups in the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees.  Most people call this process “the mock markup.”
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The mock markup – which, once again, occurs BEFORE the President formally submits the trade agreement to Congress
        </strong>
        [
        <em>
         I think here he is referring to the final implementing legislation
        </em>
        ] – is similar to any other committee markup.  The committee reviews the draft legislation and has votes on amendments, if any are offered.  If the Finance and Ways and Means committees end up with different versions of the draft implementing bill, they can proceed to a mock conference to work out the details and reconcile any differences.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mock markup process is well established in practice and is an essential part Congress’s consideration of any trade agreement.  It is the best way for Congress to provide direct input – complete with vote tallies and on-the-record debates – to the President to demonstrate whether the implementing bill meets the criteria set out in the TPA statute and whether there is enough support in Congress for the agreement to pass.
       </p>
       <p>
        After those steps are taken, a final implementing bill may be introduced in the House and Senate.  Only after the final implementing bill is introduced is Congress under any kind of deadline to vote on the agreement – the votes must take place within 90 session days.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hatch also points out that the 90 days Congress has to vote up or down on the final bill (60 for the House, 30 for the Senate
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the House votes) refer to session days, not calendar days.

      <p>
       ISDS is not hidden away in fine print. It has an entire chapter, chapter 9. This was before TPP was released in full, so it's possible the draft Warren was looking at did not include the full chapter.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Agreeing to ISDS in this enormous new treaty would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations. Worse, it would undermine U.S. sovereignty.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No nation is losing sovereignty. First, they agreed to the deal under their own sovereignty. Second, any nation can leave at any time. Third, the TPP does not prevent a nation from setting laws for the interests of the public, the environment, etc. The TPP Investor-state chapter includes the ISDS system to prevent legislation that is designed to discriminate against foreign investors. The goal is to ensure due process for foreigners.

       As I said above, 1 arbitrator chosen by the investor, 1 by the state, 1 agreed upon by both. I think that's fair.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the tilt toward giant corporations wasn’t clear enough, consider who would get to use this special court: only international investors, which are, by and large, big corporations. So if a Vietnamese company with U.S. operations wanted to challenge an increase in the U.S. minimum wage, it could use ISDS. But if an American labor union believed Vietnam was allowing Vietnamese companies to pay slave wages in violation of trade commitments, the union would have to make its case in the Vietnamese courts.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is literally the point of ISDS: it is a backup for investors when they do not receive due process for their investments. However, I do somewhat agree with the last part. TPP mandates that all nations in the agreement set a minimum wage and agree to other labor standards, but there is lacking enforcement for that provision, as far as I know. I don't see that as an issue with the ISDS part though, but rather the trade agreement itself. In any case, it wouldn't make sense for a union to be able to sue over that, as then they could sue over any lower wage. This is more of an in-country issue.

       This is true. That is why the US is 17-0 in ISDS for all of its many trade agreements. That's the point though! The US actually treats foreign investors fairly, whereas foreign nations do not!

       <p>
        Those justifications don’t make sense anymore, if they ever did.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is absolutely baseless. Expropriation is still a valid concern. Again, the ethyl corp case shows that laws are still made for political reasons, not based on rational concerns for citizens. Even though it's less extreme than expropriation, it still matters.

       This is misleading, probably deliberately. The case is actually about a contract a French company signed with Egypt. Part of the contract was that Egypt would pay a fixed portion of the costs. When the minimum wage increased, Egypt refused to pay the same portion.
