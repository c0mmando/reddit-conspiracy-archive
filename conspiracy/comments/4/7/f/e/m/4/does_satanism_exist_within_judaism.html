        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer, my title does not refer to a majority of Jews, or even necessarily any at all, which is why I&#39;m asking. No one group has a monopoly on evil, and I believe all individuals are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law about anything, and that people of any religion should be judged by the content of their character. I am against stereotyping and discriminating, just asking questions trying to understand certain things.</p>

<p>Ok, some people believe there is a Jewish or Zionist conspiracy happening, with the creation of the state of Israel, the rebuilding of the Temple, and a one world government ruled from Jerusalem as the goals. Some of these people also believe that those running the conspiracy have a rule where they have to tell the world what they&#39;re going to do before they do it, at least with symbols in Hollywood films and stuff like that (Neo&#39;s passport in the Matrix for example), before they do it. So I have two questions. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can a conspiracy be both Jewish or Zionist, and Satanic? Is there a sect of Judaism that worships Satan? What is the potential connection here between Judaism and Satanism? Are we talking about the star of remphan? Worshipping Molech? Because the Torah itself speaks of a covenant between Jews and the Lord, not Satan. So what book, like the Talmud or Kabbalah, or doctrine potentially changed that for a segment of Jews and made them Satanic? Where is the connection between a segment of Judaism and Satanism, if it even exists and it&#39;s not just the theory of anti-semites? </p></li>
<li><p>If those doing this conspiracy do have to tell people before hand what they&#39;re planning, then there must be something in either Jewish books, or Satanic books, that says they have to do this. Does anyone know what this is?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ve heard two theories. One is that telling people exonerates those doing the conspiracy from sin. Someone mentioned this is in the Kabbalah but couldn&#39;t remember specifics, plus the Kabbalah is pretty recent, and I&#39;m wondering if it goes back further? The closest I&#39;ve heard is it saying in the Talmud that if you tell others of your sin, your sin is lifted, but as far as I know that doesn&#39;t specify about telling the people you&#39;re going to do something to about it, it just says tell &quot;others,&quot; so I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s relevant here?</p>

<p>The other theory is that the people doing this conspiracy look at their acts like ritual sacrifice, and that they believe the sacrifice has more magical power or energy if they tell the people about it first. Where is this idea from? Is this in the Talmud or Kabbalah or Torah or any Judaic writings? </p>

<p>How can a conspiracy be both Jewish or Zionist, and Satanic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Talmudism IS satanism. What you’re thinking of being “satanism” is probably more like “secular satanism”, stripped of all its jewish roots.</p>

<p>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold your house is left unto you desolate.
<strong>– Matthew 23:37,38</strong></p>

<p>Then answered all the people (Jews) and said, “His blood be on us and on our children”
<strong>– Matthew 27:25</strong></p>

<p>But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you to councils, and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten.
<strong>– Mark 13:9</strong></p>

<p>Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And I say the truth, why do you not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words, ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.
<strong>– John 8:43-47</strong></p>

<p>Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did, so you do. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers.
<strong>– Acts 7:51-53</strong></p>

<p>It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself unworthy of everlasting life, we turn to the Gentiles.
<strong>– Acts 13:45-51</strong></p>

<p>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, whose mourns must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake… wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith: not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
<strong>– Titus 1:10-14</strong></p>

<p>The Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
<strong>– 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</strong></p>

<p>Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews and are not but do lie; behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet…
<strong>– Revelation 3:9</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanism isn&#39;t really the correct word to use. The oral stories and teachings which eventually led to the Talmud originates with the Sanhedrin while Moses was on Mount Sinai. During the lengthy Babylonian exile the Hebrew people picked up mystery religion (occult). The ones that came back to Israel brought with them these days teachings. The Pharisees and to a lesser degree the Sadducees reigned as the top Jewish religious and political leadership. These are the people Jesus called a den of vipers. In Acts, Stephen is killed for rebuking them in the same manner. Zionist religious and political leaders in Israel ARE Pharisees. Judaism hasn&#39;t really changed all that much since the close of the New Testament. Of course, there is the Zohar, but the case can be made that Jewish mysticism has always played a role in their history. The Zohar and Kabbalah streamline things. </p>

<p>It&#39;s in this context that one will realize that a label such as &quot;satanism&quot;, &quot; luciferian&quot;, etc is a huge oversimplification. To top it off, things can be further complicated by simply understanding that with the occult side of things, the real knowledge is esoteric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about the Talmud is satanic or what about it says you are exonerated from sin if you tell the victim before you do something to them, or that the ritual is more powerful if they know?</p>

<p>I know the Talmud blasphemes Christ, and calls gentiles beasts, and other bad stuff, but first off Jews say the Talmud is just a debate between various rabbis on interpreting the law and that those specific passages are probably debated back by other rabbis (is that true)?, and secondly all those quotes I&#39;ve seen are either racial supremacist, like anti-gentile stuff, or about pedophilia, but I&#39;ve never seen any Talmud quotes about actual occult ritual, or worshiping Lucifer or Satan, or telling the victim what you do to them first, or anything like that. Do those passages exist in the Talmud or not? If not, where are they taught? Where do they originate?</p>

<p>It’s a true enough statement. The document is debates between rabbis, but it’s also the unargued oral tradition of the religion (and not all debates have them on opposite sides.</p>

<p>Of course not. They wouldn’t refer to it by that name. You already know the name; it’s pretty popular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not so simple, Jesus went against some really bad stuff that was going on during his time...but he also violated several severe prohibitions.  If you want to call that blasphemy, then I need to look at the definition of blasphemy again.  Jews do not follow any person as a messiah unless they meet all the standards that are were laid out by the prophets way before jesus was born. Jesus didn&#39;t fulfill the prophesy(not even close, since there was no peace on earth, all jews didn&#39;t return to Israel, G-d&#39;s presence didn&#39;t return to the Service).  The gentiles that are referred to as beasts were the oppressive empires that forced Jews to do inhumane things while in exile, and raped their daughters and wives (you would call them beasts too).  The debates between rabbis are over very very specific parts of the laws (such as how to properly give a dowry, the exact wording and amounts which get extremely complicated when money is owed or borrowed, then there is a messenger involved and so on).  Even the translations about slavery are really not right.  Really a slave was more closely related to indentured servitude which was common back then and how society funtioned.  On top of that, if a Jew owned a slave, they had to treat them as they treated themselves and even better in some cases, i.e. if you only had enough food for one person, you slave had to be taken care of and fed before you ate.  That isn&#39;t what we call slavery today.</p>

<p>Pedophilia is a relative term.  Girls got married back then at 11 or 12 if they had reached puberty.  A girl could also be married off by her father at a much younger age...and no they were not raped. They were raised just like any young person in his house and eventually when she was ready they had a normal physical relationship.  Jewish girls back then are not like little 12 and 13 year olds now.  They were intelligent and raised completely differently.  Only under the modern American mentality of &quot;under 18 is pedophilia&quot;...I think it might even stem from puritans, would this actually be pedophilia.  It was marriage, that&#39;s how things were done in some circumstances back then, and it didn&#39;t have to do with lusting after children.   There is definitely nothing about Satan worship, that would completely violate the first and second commandment...and many others if you include implied rituals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean there is nothing about satan worship that would violate the first and second commandment? Is that a typo and you&#39;re saying it would violate, or are you saying satan worship is allowed under Judaism?</p>

<p>As for the pedophilia comment, I was referring to the passage in the Talmud about having sex with girls three years or younger, because that&#39;s like poking someone in the eye, the virginity comes back if they&#39;re under three, is the quote I read. &quot;Designated bond maid&quot; or something. It also said sex with little boys was fine, or that normal sex wasn&#39;t okay, but &quot;perverse sex&quot; was fine because that wasn&#39;t covered under the law forbidding sex.</p>

<p>Stuff like that is what I&#39;ve read. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but those translations are just incorrect. Judaism is based around sexual morality. It is a main aspect of every story in Genesis.  It is in the Ten Commandments and is also one of the seven Noahide Laws that Goyim are commanded to follow.  Sexual morality is key, meaning no adulty, no incest, no homosexual relations, no beastiality.  Perverse sex is absolutely forbidden.  The only sex that is permitted is sex between husband and wife or concubine which we no longer even have (but she would have to be a woman). So i really don&#39;t know where you got this or who translated it.  Just as my own input, nobody wants to have sex with a toddler anyways who is going to be a good and mentally healthy person.  If are raping children I doubt you are going to care much about keeping any of the other laws either.  Just isnt logical.</p>

<p>Satan worship is absolutely forbidden, I never said it was allowed. It is a violation of the second commandment. &quot;no other gods before me.&quot;  Worshiping anything other than G-d alone is forbidden.</p>

<p>edit: oh I meant that there is nothing about satan worship in zohar or talmud. Sorry the sentence had poor wording. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok so a person can be jewish without any ties to the jewish religion whatsoever.  If you are jewish, then it mean yu either have a jewish mother or you are a true convert who agrees to keep all laws of the Torah.</p>

<p>With that being said, unfortunately Jews assimilate and leave their heritage sometimes. I know many Jews that practice Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism...You name it. I&#39;m sure there are a few satanic ones.  </p>

<p>Zionism is separate from Judaism.  Not every Jew is a zionist, most really arent even if they think they are, because they don&#39;t know what Zionism really means.  It is a secular movement, which is completely against the ideals and life of any practicing Jew.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3SJYRkI2hM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3SJYRkI2hM</a></p>

<p>The only real link between the two is that when the messiah comes, all Jews will return to Israel.  It doesn&#39;t say forcefully, Talmud just says we that will ride on the backs of eagles (airplanes? Be aware this was written thousdands of years before planes) back to the Hly Land and the Holy Temple will be rebuilt so the Temple Service may continue for at least 1000 years of peace on earth (aka end of time).</p>

<p>to answer a few of your questions: No, the Talmud says nothing about telling another person your sins, unless you sinned directly against that person and it will help them forgive you during your atonement process.</p>

<p>In reality there is only 1 Judaism, as prescribed by the Torah and the rabbis of blessed memory that learned from their fathers and rabbis and so on all the way back to Jews all receiving the Torah and hearing G-d speak at mount Sinai after the exodus from egypt.   </p>

<p>Only REAL judaism adheres to the laws of the Torah (which are mostly explained by ancient Rabbis that only wrote them down during the Diaspora for fear of losing the Oral tradition). Any other &quot;sect&quot; is not judaism.  Reform, egalitarian, reconstructionist, whatever they call them, are all just forms of misguided heretical Judaism, and are NOT judaism.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty simple because it is.</p>

<p>Ok so you other questions:  Yes Satan does exist, no Torah observant Jews do not worship him.
He is an emissary of G-d.  Essential he has 3 main roles in one.  He is the instigator (an angel (no not fallen angel) that works directly for G-d to 
1. Instigate (temp one to sin)
2. Prosecute (share the evidence with the heavenly court when your soul is judged [a minimum of about a week once a year between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur])
3. Kill (sounds bad but everyone has their time.  Essentially after you have been judged, if you do not merit another year of life or your time has come, Satan is the permitted to kill you, then your soul is presented before G-d and the heavenly tribunal...scary stuff, no lie...at this point Satan continues his role as prosecutor and if you haven&#39;t worked on yourself and repented (personally..not to a person) all the court sees it, they discuss your life, and then G-d is the final judge presiding over everything...good luck with that)
So Satan pretty much just works for G-d.  he isn&#39;t a bad guy, he temps us offering us a chance to either distance ourselves from G-d by breaking one of his laws (essentially choosing temporary pleasure and death over eternal life (afterlife) and infinite pleasure).   He temps us giving us a chance to reach greater heights and get closer to the Creator of all life and pleasure...so Satan isn&#39;t a bad guy. He&#39;s just very smart and you can&#39;t fool him or get around him so easily.</p>

<p>Any satanism related to kabbalah or judaism comes from people that get their hands on kabbalistic works and have an understanding of hebrew...and have not worked on themselves spiritually yet to the point where they are righteous.  Essentially these people are like toddlers with keys in the cockpit of a jumbo jet.  they have no idea what they are doing and just learn a few incantations that are only supposed to be used by holy people for good and instead use it for selfish reasons.  Worship of the self instead of Divine secrets for the worship of the Divine.
Most of these people can cut themselves off from the jewish people at this point being in violation of numerous laws and can actually forfeit their afterlife in the process (because they chose they only want this world...which is dumb cuz this world is nothing compared to the world to come).</p>

<p>There is nothing in Kabbalah or Judaism about ritual sacrifice.  To kill another person except for in the case or defending yourself or another persons life is absolutely forbidden...in english: &quot;Thou shall not kill.&quot;  Ritual sacrifice was a thing in many many cultures (especially canaanites) and that is why the Torah Specifically forbids it.  With that being said, simply no Jew is permitted to ever murder or their soul is cut off from the afterlife and the jewish people.  Any teachings involving ritual sacrifice could not have come from Torah.  However, there are secrets of the spiritual world that were given to many nations that descended from Abraham that were not Jewish.  These secret &quot;sparks&quot; were all supposed to be used for the advancement of life and love in the world...but obviously people learned them that were not so good at some point.  They did create cults and sacrifices do cause extreme spiritual ramifications in the world.  There are ways to manipulate physicality, but just like murder or anything really bad, the more these rituals are practiced, the more inhuman these people become.  They are degraded to a status of being lower than animals because not just do they act on base animal instincts, never exercising free-will for good, but they also stop living while being &quot;alive&quot; in this physical world.  They have the gift of free will (which animals don&#39;t have) and use it for evil, so they are below animals.  </p>

<p>May Hashem, the Master of the Universe protect us from these manipulative inhuman people.  Soon the Truth will be revealed when His Presence returns (once the Temple service returns).</p>

<p>edit: sorry for all the errors, I wrote this quickly on my cell.  I don&#39;t think I used the word essentially enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing what you have learned. Goyim don&#39;t get this type of education lol. And yes I agree the sects that don&#39;t follow the Torah are not real Jews, but they call themselves Jews and that&#39;s what I was referring to. Like it&#39;s hard not to call the nation of Israel Jewish when everyone there calls themselves a Jew, and they say it&#39;s the &quot;Jewish national home.&quot; I have more questions if you have time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How is Satan not a bad guy? You mention it&#39;s important to follow the Torah but doesn&#39;t the Torah say Satan is bad, or is that just the New Testament? I&#39;m not knowledgeable on that but when you talk about God and Satan working for the same team, part of the same oneness, that sounds a lot like Kabbalah actually, not the Torah.</p></li>
<li><p>You say physical reality can be manipulated. Are you talking about Kabbalah or how exactly? If that&#39;s actually true then I hope good people start working on that because it seems like the bad people are working on it day and night.</p></li>
<li><p>You mentioned Canaanites did ritual sacrifice. Did you ever learn about why? Why did people sacrifice to Saturn or Cronos in various religions? Why did the Canaanites? Was it just superstition and fear thinking it would ward off natural disasters or war, or was there actually some astrological or theological doctrine they were following that said to do that? Did ancient peoples see Saturn destroy Jupiter in space or some astrological event that most people aren&#39;t aware of today, and base it on that, or where did it originate?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is an angel of G-d, one of many.  Rafael is a the angel of healing, Satan is the angel of death.  They all follow direct orders from G-d and cannot deviate.  The reason I say Satan is not bad is because his existence allows for a person to have an evil inclination. Humans have both an inclination for good and evil.  The good refers to doing what is right, not what is easy (often delayed gratification).  The evil is more physical and related to instant gratification and selfishness.  It is doing what is easy or makes you feel good, not what is the right thing to do necessarily.  And I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t instantly be gratified for doing the right thing, that is definitely possible and happens a lot.  I&#39;m just saying the evil inclination is that little voice in your head that we all have that temps us to not do what we know is right (such as being lazy, lying, looking at things we shouldn&#39;t look at and so on).  So, the evil inclination only exists internally after the initial sin from &quot;Genesis.&quot;  Adam was all righteous and pure, always speaking directly to G-d, the greatest prophet we know of (this concept is often ignored.)  He had no inclination to go against the word of G-d because the idea didn&#39;t even exist.  He simply wanted to serve G-d and show his love for Him.  He rationalized that by internalized and accepting an evil inclination, it will give him the opportunity to really choose G-d and choose to do good, because before that, he essentially had no evil inclination, no reason to do anything but the exact word of G-d (like an angel).  It&#39;s a little complex but yeah, Adam made a big mistake by going against His word, even though he had good intentions.</p>

<p>Well, now we really do have to work our way back to the point where we do everything to get closer on our relationship to the Creator.  The evil inclination temps us to be lazy or weak and go in the opposite direction, BUT (a very big BUT) this choice of evil or good ALLOWS us to choose good.  The OPTION of choice (aka freewill) allows us to get much closer to G-d, just as Adam intended, allowing for a greater reward based on effort and not just action.</p>

<p>Yes through Kabbalah the physical word can be manipulated.  Only G-d can create something from nothing, but a person who is very in tune with spirituality can take something such as a bottle of wine and fill hundreds of glasses (the wine and the the bottle have to already exist though).  It is only permissible to use this in the pure motivation and glorification of G-d&#39;s name, not selfish purposes.  Like if it is a ritual on Passover for every person in a large room to have a glass of wine, maybe someone accidentally broke a crate or something, that would probably be a permissible time for a very holy individual to do this.  Elemental changes such as vinegar to oil i think can occur but not in the same way.  It&#39;s more that the vinegar is still vinegar but it gains certain aspects that oil has like the ability to burn in a lamp.  Unfortunately like you said, bad people have learned how to do this, and have been using it for selfish purposes for quite some time.  You have to remember tat nothing is outside of the will of G-d, just think about how during the plagues in Egypt, He proved his mastery over all creation.  Every second of every day, you and all that surrounds you only exists because G-d constantly wills its existence.   He does however allow for people to choose evil just as He allows them to choose good, as you can&#39;t have one without the other. He does have the ability to reward and punish people both in this world and the next, and He does everything measure for measure when it comes to punishments and rewards.</p>

<p>Ancients had a much better grasp of the cosmos than we do now.  I havent studied it a lot but the whole astrological signs thing is legit, however the readings we have today are not legit.  Some of the ancient nations used to worship the overseeing angels of their nations or of the season or even the month they were in.  They were in tune with spirituality but essentially were worshiping the creation instead of the Creator (a big mistake, Abraham was the first of his generation to really figure this out, solidify it and stand up for G-d).  G-d designed the world in a way that certain things could be brought about via specific rituals (like kabbalah again) and many of these rituals were taught to Abraham who had more children after Ishmael and Isaac.  He would reward them by teaching them these secrets (as any father would teach children skills or about life).  Eventually the knowledge was passed down to generations that were less than righteous.  I don&#39;t know much about wars waging in the cosmos, but I do know that Astrological signs have a big impact on events in the world as G-d set the stars in motion.  There were people who could read these signs and they were legit.  Only G-d Himself and manipulate and change the effects of the Mazelot (signs) if a specific individual or nation is worthy.  So people would sacrifice to Saturn or Mars or the moon or other celestial beings as a recognition of their dominance during that particular month or season &quot;in order to gain favor in that god&#39;s eyes.&quot; The rituals did sometimes cause changes to occur but the overall result of the events remained the same.  I like to compare it to a child receiving a gift from his father.  The father designs a computer game for the child and teaches him how to use it.  The child loves the game, and while he is playing he keeps thanking the computer and the program for the pleasure of the game instead of the thanking the father.  Ancients and even people today are able to do &quot;astral projection&quot; and some where able to use this to read the cosmos.  Some parts were more clear and some were vague (as in it could be interpreted in multiple ways).   </p>

He just kept pouring and pouring out of the same bottle until every glass was full only after wrapping a cloth/napkin around the bottle. Nothing dark here, simply people needed wine for religious purposes and so he took care of business. This was a very very holy Rabbi, extremely pious and a leader of the previous generation. No incantations or specific rituals as far as I know, just a good guy pouring wine for his peeps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have raised important questions. I&#39;m afraid the answers you are looking for are very complex and require some pretty heavy knowledge of all three Abrahamic religions to understand. I have a Biblical Studies and Comparative Religion academic background, and I&#39;ve also spent the last two years heavily studying mystery religion and other relevant religions such as Norse, Greek, Roman, and Egyptian. I&#39;ve spent a good deal of time researching Eastern mysticism, Native North and South American shamanism, black magik (A. Crowley), and New Age. I am now in the early process of reevaluating everything Islam because it has become apparent to me that my years at a Christian University (Bible college) gave me a very skewed idea of what Islam is all about. In fact, time and time again, I have had to go back and reevaluate many things because of a new understanding on critical systematic theology or history. </p>

<p>The answers people give you are going to be correlated to their personal understanding of all of these things. To take it one step further, we have to consider eschatology, simply because it is the indicator of were things are headed since the last words were penned on all sacred texts.</p>

<p>You should watch &quot;The Other Israel&quot; on YouTube to start with (on mobile; can&#39;t link). From there you should have a better grasp on some of these things. Understand that the Torah is secondary to the Talmud. The Talmud isn&#39;t God given, but rather comes from the Babylonian religion. That religion was influenced by Sumer, the Assyrians, and other places of less significance. The temple of Solomon was an occult temple. Harrod&#39;s temple and the Tabernacle is where God Sat upon the Mercy Seat in the Holy of Holies. The symbol for Solomon&#39;s Temple is the six pointed star. That same Star is called the star of David today, but it has zero to do with David. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the above, you should have a estimation of the answer to your first question. If you need clarification, I&#39;ll do my best to help you out. Watch that hour long documentary first. </p></li>
<li><p>Yes, there are ancient teachings that dictate how things are to play out. The study of those teachings is called eschatology, and those teachings are known as prophecy. Many people assume that Judaism, Christianity, and Islamic prophecy will unfold organically. The truth is that people are using those prophesies like a checklist. They are trying to bring about the Mahdi, Dajjal/antichrist, Judaism&#39;s Messiah, the return of Christ, and ultimately Armageddon. In order for all of this to unfold, Israel has to build that temple. Check out templeinstitute.org for more info. There is also the Oded Yinon Plan. It&#39;s online to examine, and Ken O&#39;Keefe talks about it often. He&#39;s absolutely right. The Oded Yinon Plan for a Greater Israel is the Zionist plan. There is also The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Many people believe it to be a forgery and BS conspiracy, but how is it that everything is coming to pass? Check that out too.</p></li>
<li><p>Kaballah is sorcery before anything else. One of the key tools in sorcery is deceit.uch of Kaballah is veiled chameleon n secrecy and mystic practices. The temple sacrifices were done for atonement (to make clean) and offering (to find favor or give thanks). Always remember: As above, so below. In the occult, sacrifices are meant to discourage God and his holy angels from entering a evil yet sacred place to those that practice magik. Every notice how humn and especially child/virgin sacrifice seems to be a common denominator within these groups regardless of era or location? Combine that with the pedophilia, and sexual immorality (as described in the Bible and Quran), and you will find that an esoteric belief system is in place by the ruling elite. That is and has always been the truth. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps. I know my answers aren&#39;t real clear or crisp, but thats the nature of this beast. Is Judaism satanic (not to be confused with Satanism)? According to Islam and the Old and New Testament, yes. I know this all sounds rather preachy, but my words would get me blackballed if I were a minister. bin Laden, the Ayatollahs, and Saddam were right- those people that control Palestine are white devil&#39;s according to the Bible alone. It in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great information, but do you really think they are trying to bring back Christ and then have Armageddon? It seems to me like they are trying to get rid of Christ, people like Marilyn Manson and other Hollywood &quot;satanist&quot; types wear crosses to &quot;blaspheme&quot; Christ all the time. It seems to me more like they&#39;re just trying to do the Jewish messiah thing, and in fact I&#39;ve been reading apparently there&#39;s some teaching that tells them the Jews themselves can create a body of people that acts as the messiah, so they&#39;re not even trying to bring back anyone necessarily, they&#39;re just trying to rebuild the Temple and then they will be the rulers and the &quot;messiah&quot; as a group, or something.</p>

<p>Other than that, what you&#39;re telling me is more along the lines of &quot;it&#39;s not the Jews, it&#39;s the Mystery Religion from Babylon.&quot; But then if it&#39;s it the Mystery Religion from Babylon, why are so many of them Jews lol? And if so many of them are Jews, why is it satanic, when the Jews covenant is with the &quot;Lord&quot;?</p>

<p>There has to be some common thread here people are missing between Mystery Babylon, Judaism, and Satanism. Maybe it&#39;s like this:</p>

<p>The Talmud came from Babylon, so the Babylon aspect comes from the Talmud. That&#39;s why so many Mystery Babylon worshippers are Jewish, because Mystery Babylon was kept alive through the Talmud, and Jews follow the Talmud.</p>

<p>So then the question changes from what about Judaism links it to Satanism, to what about Babylonian religion links it to Satanism? </p>

<p>You also mentioned atonement sacrifices, but that&#39;s basically in the Torah, not even needing the Talmud. So are they following like a mixture of these books since the Talmud is still sort of related to the Torah?</p>

<p>Also what is the Mahdi, the Dajjal/anti-Christ, when Judaism doesn&#39;t believe in Christ? And what is Harrod&#39;s temple and the Tabernacle and the Mercy Seat and the Holy of Holies? I know the Tabernacle is where the Aaronhood priests sit or whatever but that&#39;s all I remember.</p>

<p>It almost sounds like you&#39;re saying some Jewish elite view the Talmud as a mystery to be solved cloaking these older Babylonian religions, and they&#39;re not just trying to bring about the Jewish prophecies, but the actual Babylonian prophecies because they think those are hidden within the Talmud? But the thing is why would Jews care about the prophecies of the people who enslaved them? By that logic, why not work towards helping the Amalek religion come into being, and all the other enemies of the Jews in the Torah? What made them so obsessed with Babylon specifically?</p>

<p>But tell me about the satanic practices of the Babylonians. Maybe if I understand what was Satanic about them, I will be able to understand what is Satanic about the current conspiracy. And I will watch that documentary thank you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im going to preface this by saying I am going to reply in chunks. As simple as your questions sound, the answers are fairly complex. It is going to take some time for you to digest what you learn. My suggestion to you would be organization. write down your lists of questions. Divide those questions into categories and organize your thoughts on paper. Find direction, and sort out the fields of study relating to your research. The rabbit hole leads to eschatology, NOT JUST religion. Don&#39;t get overwhelmed. Keep the Machiavellian philosophies nearby. It isn&#39;t immorality, but rather amorality, that is key to understanding the antichrist heart. The Bible  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great information, but do you really think they are trying to bring back Christ and then have Armageddon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. They want this to happen. In the briefest summary of why they want to war with Christ- they think they can defeat Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me like they are trying to get rid of Christ, people like Marilyn Manson and other Hollywood &quot;satanist&quot; types wear crosses to &quot;blaspheme&quot; Christ all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have actually read Manson&#39;s autobiography, and listened to him discuss a great number of topics. In my opinion Manson is highly intelligent, a skeptic, and a contrarian. He has said that the whole Church of Satan/A. Levey thing is completely misunderstood. The reason he does some of those things he does is to reveal hypocrisy in these people who claim to be compassionate. </p>

<p>The cross, both upright and inverted, fall under symbol magik and not the torture device that Jesus died on. The roman cross was shaped like a capital &quot;T&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>apparently there&#39;s some teaching that tells them the Jews themselves can create a body of people that acts as the messiah, so they&#39;re not even trying to bring back anyone necessarily, they&#39;re just trying to rebuild the Temple and then they will be the rulers and the &quot;messiah&quot; as a group, or something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wouldn&#39;t surprise me to find this as an alternative doctrine, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it is the typical belief. It also stands in contrast with what the most well respected clergy in Jerusalem and all of Judaism have taught since the return to Israel. It&#39;s going to be difficult to understand mainstream Judaic eschatology without a firm grasp of Judaic systematic theology. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#/media/File:Talmud_set.JPG">Talmud is massive</a> compared with the Torah. Most every rabbi has a fundamental understanding of the Talmud, but they will focus their studies on a small handful of topics from within the Talmud.</p>

<p>Eschatological doctrines can be really hard to understand even as a devout student of that faith. This is true for all three Abrahamic religions. One has to also consider that the commonly held eschatological views of today may run in stark contrast with the historical views. An example of this is the pre-tribulation rapture (aka dispensationalism) doctrine in Christianity. For almost 2000 years this doctrinal stance did not even exist. Christian mystics in America, primarily Darby, began that nonsense. The Scofield Reference Bible, printed by the WZO (Zionist) publisher Oxford University Press, popularized the pre-trib rapture, and Hal Lindsay brought it new life in the late 70&#39;s IIRC. From there, John Hagee has picked it up and ran with it. He formed the very powerful <a href="http://www.cufi.org/site/PageServer">CUFI</a> and made himself the head. Hagee is the most important Christian Zionist in the world. His influence and control of funding for Israel is undeniable. The mega church pastor, that lives lavishly, rubs shoulders with Cruz, Lieberman, Santorum, and others. Please take a moment to get a clear understanding of this sick shit. Watch this short <a href="https://youtu.be/mjMRgT5o-Ig">video</a>. Its very alarming. There is a strong push from CUFI to preemptively destroy Iran with nuclear weapons. This man want to nuke an entire country, bring about a nuclear WW3, and sacrifice his beloved Jews to bring Jesus back. This is what Christian Zionism&#39;s true agenda is. Hagee is a small antichrist. His audience is massive.</p>

<p>As I have begin digging into the Islamic prophecies Dajjal, I have to keep in mind which sect I am researching. Even then, personal views vary. Just like with Christianity the people that publish their thought and predictions online are mostly (about 95% tbh) heretical fools or they are using apostasy fear mongering as a tool to create click-bait/funnel traffic to their YT channel and website. There are also folks like author Thomas R. Horn that act as preachers but always fail to mention that they own online survivalist supply stores. Horn&#39;s store runs contrary to what Revelations tells us: during the tribulation if you are to die of starvation, then you will die of starvation. The people during that time are clearly fated. And while that may seem all doom and gloom, it really serves to give believers peace. No preparations are to be made. In fact, Revelations also says that those who live by the sword shall die by the sword. During the Tribulation, people that cannot accept that God is in control will steal and kill just to eat. Sons will turn against their fathers. These people will be judged harshly. </p>

<p>The point- Everything you see with these Christian survivalist, Left Behind/Rapture Ready, and apostate local pastors is contrary to the Bible. Things are similar regarding Islam and Judaism.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to stop for now. I&#39;ll edit in more later. I may not hit every question, but I&#39;ll point you in the right direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, so you think the Christian Zionists have a different agenda than the Jewish Zionists? See I believe the Jewish Zionists own the banking, so they choose which preachers to back, and they have infiltrated the Christian Churches even themselves, as crypto-Jewish pastors posing as Christians, or by choosing which dupes to finance. But I&#39;m guessing that guy is totally controlled and is not trying to sacrifice Jews or double cross Israel. He wants the US to attack Iran, not Israel, and that means the blowback will come back on the US, presumably. Also I never heard him say anything about nuking them? I haven&#39;t watched your video though, just others with him in it and I saw his quote about a preemptive attack on Iran. But nothing about nuking.</p>

<p>Let me put the question this way. Have you heard about the human hunts and child killing and stuff alleged in Holland in the 1990s? What I&#39;m asking is what religion do you think they are following in doing that stuff? Or what about the movie Eyes Wide Shut. Assuming the ritual shown in that film really goes on in real life, what religion do you think they are following in doing that? They play a Christian sermon backwards, they&#39;re all dressed in black robes except the priest guy dressed in red (also what&#39;s up with red? Rothschild, red shield, red square... why red?), and it seems to be basically an anti-Christian ritual combined with sun worship.</p>

<p>What religions would be anti-Christian like that? Islam has motive, Judaism has motive, and obviously satanism and Luciferianism. But I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be following Aleister Crowley or Anton Lavey. There&#39;s evidence both of those are CIA type guys who played a role, at least that&#39;s what Miles Mathis argues. Either way they are too recent. This goes back farther than them. So if the people doing those kinds of rituals are Satanists, what kind of Satanist, what is the origin of this that predates Crowley? Are they still following ancient Canaanite religion? Or what? </p>

<p>What about the Cremation of care? They are worshiping Molech. So does that mean they&#39;re still ancient Canaanites or where did they come up with that ritual? What do they believe that would have them worshiping a giant owl and simulating child sacrifice? That&#39;s what I want to know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Christian Zionism  is different than the standard fare. Both wish to accomplish the same goals. Rebuilding the temple and removal of Palestinians/Judah into Jordan IIRC. While in exile Judah (Palestinians) will become mighty archers and will get their vengeance on Israel and pour out some of God&#39;said wrath on these people that God finally rejects. Jermiah, Isaiah, and Revelations make this clear. Judaism teaches the Messiah is yet to come. Their Messiah will come after the same prophetic events that Christian Zionism teaches. I have no problem with the theory that Mossad, CIA, or Jesuit have infiltrated  the Christian church, but the church already sold out under 501(c)(3) IRS status. Futhermore, most Christians get their educational material from Lifeway. That company has a lot of power, and it isn&#39;t ever discussed.</p>

<p>Did I say Hagee wants to nuke Israel lol? I just bought my first tablet, and I&#39;m adjusting. Also, every joint in both hands are swollen beyond belief. My hands are numb. It from my new job. Anyway, you are correct regarding Hagee&#39;s charge for a preemptive strike. Check out the video. The issues within the Christian Zionism and traditional Zionism will become obvious. There is plenty on the subject.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with the Holland incidents in the 90s. Eye&#39;s Wide Shut? Well, it&#39;s pretty clear that Kubrick knew the elite, had insider information about the occult, and used symbolism to full effect. In all honesty, I can&#39;t really use it for source material or to verify a single thing. At best, it&#39;s all speculation or arbitrary. Anything of that nature ruins the integrity of my research. I utilize due process for this subject matter. If I were speculating about MKULTRA, it would be acceptable as long as I didn&#39;t misrepresent myself. With that said, I&#39;m not going to speculate on something I can&#39;t footnote. </p>

<p>The occult is the occult. It doesn&#39;t matter if we are talking about two island nations that were completely isolated from one another. The exoteric religion is always pagan, and the esoteric is the occult. The most famous of all the Jesuits, A. Kircher, invented the field of Egyptology. Beyond that, the Jesuit order played with science, alchemy, and various types of magic. Kirche, also known as the last renaissance man, was Jewish. His surname is Askenazim. I know this because he is my blood relative. Yep, that&#39;s my fam. We are Jews with a famous Jesuit relative.Anyway, Crowley combined various teachings of magik, and he made remarkable claims. I do believe that the occult is ever evolving, and any notion of a strictly kaballahistic cabal/network is nonsense. The occult has never been stagnant in the quest for enlightenment. The occult combines the best of the best. If two different types of magik produce the same result, they go with the one that is easier. They aren&#39;t loyal to any one esoteric system. Satanism is a generic and arbitrary term like conservative and liberal. Those terms originally pertained to fiscal ideology, but that isn&#39;t true any more. Now they are terms that polarize people. If you are a Christian, than any system that doesn&#39;t elevate Christ to the status of Messiah is antichrist/satanic. If ithe isn&#39;t holy it is wicked. That which isn&#39;t pure is unclean. That principle is key to the occult. As above, so below has multiple implications, but here it stands to show the duality (not to be confused with dualism) of heaven and earth is very much absolute from both perspectives. </p>

<p>Ok, the Bohemian Grove video is rather shocking. Combine that with the words of Nixon, Clinton, HST, an article in Hustler, etc, it becomes hard to deny that black magik is at play during that one week a year. However, Alex Jones has no clue what he is talking about. Moloch is not represented by an owl. Moloch is represented by a taurus/bull. The owl is part of Native American totem magik as well as European witchcraft. Along with the praying mantis, these creatures both represent the serpent. The serpent is, of course, the creature that promised omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence to Eve, and Adam by extension. The serpent promised them god status, and that is the endgame that the occult have in mind to this day. There is more to the owl and the ritual. I believe that the ritual is a mildly esoteric truth found in the deceit of Persephone. The owl comes into play even. The water represents the river in Shell that separates our domain from Hades. The sacrifice in a grove (literally a hedged up sacred garden) is meant to make the area too unclean for God to be present in it. &quot;Be gone care.&quot; The sea magik is for the same purpose. Those things also seem to feed the vampirism cravings of different  anders of spirits, demons, and other evil beings. That&#39;s the gist anyway. If you want to understand the significance of Persephone a bit better, you are going to have to really apply yourself, and be patient. Even then, it still secret knowledge, so you won&#39;t ever figuse it out completely. Again, Alex Jones is a moron. Hope that helps you some. I know that everything I say just creates more questions than answers. It&#39;s a vicious cycle that leads an ever growing hunger to learn more. At some point, you hit brick walls, no progress is being made, and you shift your focus to Islam and probably Hinduism thereafter. Maybe that&#39;s just me.</p>
