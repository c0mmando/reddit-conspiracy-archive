        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Being an American myself, I can&#39;t help but notice the terrible thing that the administration of my country has done in recent years, like the Patriot Act, Gitmo, the legal grey zone in the Middle East for PMCs, invasions of Yugoslavia, Iraq etc etc.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, Washington, Hamilton, Jay and Adams founded the United States in hope that it would become a country that would encourage free speech, impose a fair and efficient legal system, where equality would be sacred, a country that would protect democracies. But in recent years, it has become exactly the opposite. The US is the only country that is <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/20/mapped-the-7-governments-the-u-s-has-overthrown/">actively toppling democracies</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0">this</a>.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid, I was proud of waving the US flag at neighbourhood barbecues. I saw it as a symbol of freedom. Now when I look at it, I see a symbol of oppression. It shames me greatly to see the flag dishonoured by the tyranny that the US has now become.</p>

<p>When the Declaration of Independence was signed on the 4th of July in 1776, we swore to destroy the imperialism of the British - now, I am afraid, that we have become just like them.</p>

<p>But maybe this is just me. What do you think?</p>

<p>&quot;Panem et circenses.&quot; Translates to &quot;bread &amp; circuses&quot;.  Look at the super bowl.  People care more about grown men grunting on some fake grass, than they care about what kind of shit is going on.  Our consumer society provides an endless number of things to distract from what is most important.  It doesn&#39;t hurt that team sports also play into our sense of tribalism, fake pride in a few men that are highly overpaid and toss a ball around, just because they play for your city...  we are intelligent but stupid erect apes, and are about to go extinct, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Football is smoke and mirrors as well. The supreme Court ruled games are not legitimate sporting events, should be considered strictly entertainment, and any fixation of the results can&#39;t be protested. Cities construct massive multimillion dollar stadiums with high finance money, who&#39;s interest is payed for by the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Yet, multi billion dollar casino conglomerates are allowed to operate sports books with money borrowed at an interest from the banking elite.</p>

<p>Truly sickening how the profit can always be traced back to the same group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the critical mass wording is what tripped me up.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s still the problem of people feeling like they&#39;ve got no time to protest, between jobs, kids, etc.  But the trouble is, nothing will get better until people make that commitment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember the protests of the Afghanistan/Iraq war over a decade ago. Thousands and thousands of people, world-wide. War still happened, and the voices that were once shouting in protest in front of political centers world-wide, are now whimpering online, disorganized and pathetic. Protests of people in the hundreds of thousands, world-wide, just didn&#39;t work. I imagine there will be a tipping point though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only a matter of time.  I once read about some poor woman from I think it was Michigan who had to work about 3 jobs, one of which made her ride the bus for hours each way.  While she was merely trying to scrape enough together to live, her kid (about 5 or 6) found a gun from someone staying at her place, took it to school and killed a class mate.  The kid if I remember had no idea what he was doing, he was probably only doing what he&#39;d seen on TV.  Something like that will trigger it.  If she could just earn an honest living, she could have taken care of her kid, and the girl would have lived.  These kind of injustices are going to keep happening.  The arab spring story, at least in one of the countries and I forget which was very sad and caused the explosive reaction.  A fruit seller who barely made enough for his family, often had to bribe the police to sell on the street.  One day he either didn&#39;t have the bribe money, or the cop was particularly brutal, and I think he took away the guys business.  He later showed up in front of the police station and set himself on fire.  He lived for a few days, and the story got out about the corruption.  It started the whole thing.  Something like that is going to happen sooner or later.  We have too many people who are barely making it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true but it&#39;s breaking down on an economic level. Look at the Baltic Dry index. They got too greedy. Got too eager to transfer the wealth out of America, and concentrate it into a few hands. They killed the golden goose, and nothing wakes people up to reality like an empty wallet. What comes now is the people want to know who to blame. And unfortunately the evidence is all over the internet. So yeah they can try to start a war to cover their tracks. In fact they are trying to do that right now in Syria. But it may not work anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I could agree with you, but let&#39;s face it, the average american is really, really stupid.  The vast majority will believe anything the government or propaganda tells them.  That&#39;s why they have the lower classes fighting among themselves for the few scraps available.  For over 30 years wages have stayed the same, but prices have gone up on everything.  Millions lost their homes a few years back and yet they still didn&#39;t awaken.  Endless wars are now what we do, and no one bats an eye.</p>

<p>Something will eventually trigger an awakening, but by then it will probably be far too late, especially where the environment is concerned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This (minus the whole Satanic thing). One could say the country was controlled from the very beginning. If this sounds crazy to some, I suggest you check out the 1783 Treaty of Paris. Also, check out the ties Columbus had to the Knight&#39;s Templar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious of your opinion: Do you think the satanic underlyings of the secret societies don&#39;t play a role in their overall goal? Or is it purely for the material aspect of controlling the entire world and the satanic symbolism and initiations serve as a means to &quot;brainwash&quot; and control its members into accomplishing that goal?</p>

<p>Also, still waiting for your reply to my message ;P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think they have two separate systems. One for those initiated and one for the masses. Most of it stems back to the occult/esoteric teaching of Cain and Abel, and the two bloodlines. &quot;Satan&quot; or the serpent in Eden, is not the fallen angel that most believe is Lucifer/Baphomet/etc. It&#39;s a completely different entity. You have &quot;God&quot; and &quot;this entity&quot;. This is all very hard to explain, which is why I&#39;ve been putting off the reply to your PM (there are books written about this stuff), so to put it in a PM, it&#39;s hard (I&#39;m trying), and like I said, it will probably end up as a self post. I write it out, then re-write it. You really need to research the two bloodlines of Cain and Abel.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is anything really &quot;Satanic&quot; about the symbols. It&#39;s just an illusion to make you scared to research what they know. It&#39;s like a poker face. If it&#39;s scary and you&#39;re religious or atheist, you scoff at it, and don&#39;t look into it. They rely on this secrecy and the unwillingness of the masses to look into it. I&#39;m not sure what exactly it all is, but, from what I do know, it&#39;s 180 from what you may think. It&#39;s more about fear and knowledge than anything &quot;demonic&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is materialism. We as a society are falling deeper into materialism and losing the light(Lucifer, pure spirit). The symbols haven&#39;t changed since the beginning of time. They&#39;re not evil for who gave us that knowledge???  These symbols are linking up with a lot of people subconsciously as they stare at a material object telling them what the (man made, &quot;satanic&quot;) world is and how it is and how you should feel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have bad news for you, America has always been what it has sworn to destroy. However, it is only the elite (with a few notable exceptions among them) who are primarily to blame for misleading the public by keeping us ignorant. </p>

<p>The vast majority of Americans are good, well-intentioned, moral people, it is why the elite have always had to drape themselves in the flag and notions of virtue to disguise their greed, authoritarianism, and brutality. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t be angry at people for being ignorant when they truly do not know more than the lies they are told, but we can blame those who keep them ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to agree with this. The difficult thing is what to do about it. Do we participate in the political process? Is there a way around it? And if not, is there an option of armed revolution? Who would you even go after? The powers that be will be on helicopters out of here at the first hint of trouble, imo. A war in which we all kill each other and then other people come in and pick up the pieces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only a matter of time.  I once read about some poor woman from I think it was Michigan who had to work about 3 jobs, one of which made her ride the bus for hours each way.  While she was merely trying to scrape enough together to live, her kid (about 5 or 6) found a gun from someone staying at her place, took it to school and killed a class mate.  The kid if I remember had no idea what he was doing, he was probably only doing what he&#39;d seen on TV.  Something like that will trigger it.  If she could just earn an honest living, she could have taken care of her kid, and the girl would have lived.  These kind of injustices are going to keep happening.  The arab spring story, at least in one of the countries and I forget which was very sad and caused the explosive reaction.  A fruit seller who barely made enough for his family, often had to bribe the police to sell on the street.  One day he either didn&#39;t have the bribe money, or the cop was particularly brutal, and I think he took away the guys business.  He later showed up in front of the police station and set himself on fire.  He lived for a few days, and the story got out about the corruption.  It started the whole thing.  Something like that is going to happen sooner or later.  We have too many people who are barely making it. </p>
