        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">78</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-02-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US has been at war some <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/america-war-93-time-222-239-years-since-1776.html">222 years of its 239 year existence, which is 93% of the time.</a></p>

<p>We have the most powerful military in the world, bigger and more powerful than the next 14 countries <em>combined</em>, most of which are our allies. <a href="http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/chart_1-2.png">Graph</a> </p>

<p>Wars are created as a means to make profit via industries that relate to war. This can be surprisingly broad, from bullet and gun makers, to tanks, vehicles, missiles, planes, satellites, to intelligence communities, soldier training, and mercenaries, to oil companies that gain access to new land and markets, and banks who can infiltrate newly-toppled governments and ensure the country gets hooked on <em>their</em> loans. This is the bizarre melding of military actions with the actions of industry. It also includes companies that rebuild buildings after wars demolish them all, something the US profited from greatly after WW2. All this and the other things I didn&#39;t mention makes up 1/4 of the US economy. </p>

<p>This means, if wars stop, this entire sector has massively reduced purchases from the government and will collapse, and thus the US economy would also collapse. So it is <em>required</em>, in the minds of some, that war continue forever. If there is not a war, they do not get paid. They have a very vested interest in creating wars and having them last as long as possible and use as many resources as possible in the process. </p>

<p>Sometimes wars are slack and it is hard to get one started. Right now the US finds itself in a position where the US was blocked by Russia from invading Syria, so they turn to equipping domestic police to continue increasing sales of MRAPs and body armor. Congress calls it a &quot;jobs program.&quot; </p>

<p>The US has military bases 63 countries, and is deployed in over 150. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/articlePictures/map%20iran.JPG">The US has Iran basically surrounded, as they&#39;re one of the few noncompliant countries, after the 1979 Iranian Revolution where they bucked the US-installed Shah who had ruled since 1953.</a></p>

<p>The Military-Industrial Complex (MIC) has overtaken the US government for some time now, as Eisenhower warned of in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y06NSBBRtY&amp;t=9s">his departing speech.</a> </p>

<p>Nowadays, only <a href="http://ta1.universaltelegra.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/im.jpg">certain political candidates</a> are allowed to run. Ones that are war-compatible. They are allowed to vary on any issue except war. This is why Ron Paul was ignored by the MSM so hard. Since there are only 2 parties to control <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Countries_That_Use_a_First_Past_the_Post_Voting_System.png">as the British designed, for easier control</a> (Australia being one of the few former members British Empire not to have a First-Past-The-Post election system). </p>

<p>With the media, government, and a large portion of industry supporting war, it&#39;s no wonder we are continuously forced in to war. It is no wonder they do exactly the maximum they can get away with, without causing a rebellion. It&#39;s the only reason the draft ended, because people woke up to what bullshit it is and got pissed. The culture changed, and they had to concede that point to the masses. This can, and will, happen again. </p>

<p>This is what Major General Smedley Butler meant by the title of his 1935 book &quot;War is a Racket&quot;. There is no exaggeration in this statement, it is a pure statement of fact. Through compartmentalization, they can have each person thinking they&#39;re a hero, or doing what they&#39;re supposed to be doing, when in reality they are the cogs of the machine of war to benefit the owners of the Military-Industrial Complex. </p>

<p>There are no &quot;bad guys&quot; as war teaches us. The other side thinks we are the &quot;bad guys&quot; and we think <em>they</em> are the &quot;bad guys&quot;, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IwCXBXY.jpg">it&#39;s all smoke and mirrors.</a> The difference between me and another american is no greater than between me and a Russian. We are the same humans, caught up in the same fraudulent artificially-created situation. Obama and Putin have far more in common than any American does with Obama. The allegiances we feel to our systems of authority are largely manufactured to benefit the people who run them. Everything is to maintain and reinforce the status quo. You think this country and government is broken? Well the billionaires mostly don&#39;t. They think everything is working just great, and they also want to make it work &quot;better.&quot;</p>

<p>The psychopaths who hold the reigns of the MIC are dragging the rest of us along for the ride. They are benefiting in the billions, selling arms to both sides and laughing as they play propaganda on both sides that makes one side hate the other. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like that kid who will start fights by telling kid A that kid B said he was a jerk, and kid B that kid A said <em>he</em> was a jerk. And then sits back and watches A and B fight. It&#39;s like that, except people&#39;s life&#39;s work and income depends on this game continuing. And it&#39;s not kid A vs kid B, it&#39;s nation A vs nation B. And you don&#39;t just tell them, you shout it through a dozen media stations and websites 24/7, until everyone is saturated with the message you want them to believe. This is the power of buying in to ideologies like nationalism, you give this power away to those who wish to control you.</p>

<p>If no one joined to fight a war or manufactured arms, it would be impossible for it to happen. If no one hated other countries, there would be <em>no</em> support for government to initiate wars. They think regular people have to genuinely believe that warmongering is for their own personal benefit, in order to continue the war-making machinery that is so profitable for some of the 1%. In order to accomplish this, the American public is completely awash in propaganda convincing them Muslims are bad, Syria is bad, Assad is bad, Russia is bad, Iran is bad, etc etc. People start to buy in to this after seeing the 100th suicide bombing in a movie, or after the 100th racist rant they hear from a fellow American. </p>

<p>&quot;The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.&quot; - H.L. Mencken, 1918</p>

<p>&quot;Of course the people don&#39;t want war. But after all, it&#39;s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it&#39;s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it&#39;s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.&quot; - Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials, 1946</p>

<p>&quot;Government is the Entertainment division of the military-industrial complex.&quot; - Frank Zappa</p>

<p>Time to wake up, shed the chains of ideologies designed to abuse us, and ask for what we really want. I am tired of humans being tricked in to killing humans for the profit of a very few, all supported on flimsy narratives force fed to the public. Aren&#39;t you tired of it? War is abuse of humanity. Abuse of the many by the few. I&#39;ve heard it said that war is a collective societal breakdown. If that&#39;s what the MIC wants, then this breakdown has to be brought on by creating confusing situations through media and actual war, scaring and motivating people in to behaving so that the MIC can get its way.</p>

<p>The cultural movement that made the draft disappear after Vietnam could also make war disappear altogether. We just have to want it bad enough, as history shows. We have to make others want it too. Ending war is like getting a junkie off drugs, and our country is addicted to war.</p>

<p>The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. </p>

<p>The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck. </p>

<p>I saw three speeches he made recently where he seemed to condemn the MIC, but those sources presented in that post seem credible at first glance, I will have to read through them carefully. But if he truly is that ardent of a supporter of interventionism and military spending and doesn&#39;t plan on challenging any of that as he has recently said he would, then we are fucking doomed to decline socially, economically, and geopolitically as a country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me (from looking at Bernie&#39;s voting record) that he votes against wars but votes for funding wars.</p>

<p>I picture a scenario where Bernie is against the wars, but once the wars have been approved he doesn&#39;t want to send our military personnel into a war zone without adequate supplies. This scenerio makes sense to me because Bernie has also sponsored bills that would help heal military veterans. He sponsored a bill that would have used unallocated funds from counterterrorism to fund the VA and 41 republicans voted against it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An excellent point, I&#39;ve yet to read up on those sources still but your appraisal sounds accurate. I can see his reasoning if that is the case and I can&#39;t condemn him for that if what you&#39;re saying is true. After hearing Sanders recent speeches I can&#39;t imagine he genuinely supports the staging of interventions. </p>

<p>He had a great round table discussion with Killer Mike, Nina Turner, and Dr. Cornell West recently about MLK&#39;s legacy, (check it out if you haven&#39;t seen it yet, it&#39;s on youtube but doesn&#39;t have many views for as good as it is), and he mentioned Dr King&#39;s opposition to the Vietnam War, I have a hard time believing that anyone who supports King&#39;s beliefs about war and is then endorsed by prominent Black figures for his adherence to King&#39;s ideology that Sanders is pro-MIC. It would certainly be the only thing he has lied about. So I&#39;m certainly skeptical about claims he is a warmonger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, Russia and China, the world&#39;s second and third largest superpowers have a very restrained and realistic foreign policy not dependent on war. Russia has already proven itself several times by protecting and aiding over a million refugees from Ukraine, engaging in a restrained and defensive intervention in Georgia, and ending the US/Turkey/Qatari/Saudi backed ISIS and Islamist rebel military campaign in Syria. </p>

<p>As for China... the US&#39;s foreign policy in Africa is based on violent coercion and force projection through brutal oppression by arming and backing violent dictators and Islamist groups (see AFRICOM&#39;s operations), whereas the Chinese approach is based on cooperation through investment and drafting mutually agreeable trade contracts. </p>

<p>Not to mention that China&#39;s policy is actually effective and has long term sustainability, and is giving the Africans an alternative to IMF extortion and brutal US hegemony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans made robots so there&#39;s no reason they&#39;d be any better. </p>

<p>And humanity has changed plenty of times. Ending war does not seem like a reach. It&#39;s like ending the era of Kings. It seemed impossible for a thousand years, then it slowly happened as people woke up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason robots (or software really) will be better is because it will be made to be better.  For instance, Google&#39;s self-driving cars already have higher scores than humans.  And <em>most</em> importantly, they lack greed and arrogance.  The best thing for humanity, and the planet, is to have a super smart machine run things.</p>

<p>Ending Kings? Now instead of one man trampling our rights we have 1,000.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. AI will become self-learning within 20 years. And by that I mean exceeding human-level awareness. </p>

<p>AI can evolve without limit, the human IQ ekes forward only every 10,000 years or so. And AI can study the entire Internet.</p>

<p>Now vote for me or burn in an eternal lake of... wait, that&#39;s religion.</p>
