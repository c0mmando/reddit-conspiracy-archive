    <div class="md"><p>I think Graham Hancock is correct for the larger picture, but incorrect in details and methodology. This is of course a consequence of him being shut out. I think he is doing great work, but I wouldn&#39;t take everything he says as gospel. I think you would agree there, but some people can&#39;t even handle constructive criticism of their heroes. No one is ever going to be completely right on everything, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to dismiss them completely.</p>

Anyone who says they do, you know they are a liar and deceiver. But... We can learn from all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are saying, but that is not the case. Well respected and qualified researchers (many fringe) are blacklisted. That is the problem. I&#39;m not saying free range. If you go against MS history/archaeology, you wont get access. If we are talking about Egypt, they do not allow those who question the age of the pyramids, because it contradicts the MS theories and religion of Islam. That is wrong (completely unscientific)!

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. However some people have been clearly shut out of sites where others are allowed or even when they are the sole researcher/discoverer. In some cases they&#39;d rather the site gets ignored and consumed by nature than even have one person write about it.</p>

<p>There should be a gate keeper for these sites. The problem is that the gatekeepers often have political and ideological axes to grind (or in some cases are illegally selling antiquities.) There should be a credential check and an annual limit on researchers, and if there are too many valid researchers, let  them research on a seasonal rotation.</p>

<p>The Vatican likely does have a good smattering of antediluvian insight and are aware of the true nature of the Abrahamic Control Cult deception.

    <div class="md"><p>Would you believe me if I said personal revelation? </p>

<p>After reading much here, and then reading more of Vatican documents, compared to claims throughout history about Jesus&#39; wife or offspring, I started asking myself <em>why this obsession in the Catholic Church about the role of women? Why the importance of Mary, as a conduit to Jesus? Why can&#39;t women perform roles in the Church that involve the science of the faith?</em> </p>

<p>If all the conspiracies in the world lead back to these Saturn-Satanic cults, wouldn&#39;t the biggest misdirect be that God was male, instead of female? Who&#39;s more effected by the moon, men or women? Why do these Masons build phallic monuments AFTER they introduce goddesses? Columbia is America&#39;s, and the obelisks don&#39;t go up until the financial scam is in place. Even within the Catholic Church, the collapse of society is supposed to be if Russia submits to Mary and the Church, which is the female bride of Christ... Judaism is also passed through the maternal line, not paternal. </p>

<p>Also, Tori Amos planted a seed. <em>Muhammad, my friend, it&#39;s time to tell the world. We both know it was a girl, back in Bethlehem...</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because what other reason would they have to keep the documents hidden away from people who wish to view them?  I could understand having them wear a &quot;moon-suit&quot;, and limited access, but to totally seal them off lends to think that they have something <strong>very</strong> big to hide that would falisfy the entire religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>w/ respect, it appears to be a clearly stated &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; - with plenty of &quot;context&quot;:  clearly about the bullshit lies that are broadcast from the halls of organized religion (christianity and judaism, very specifically).</p>

<p>a similar post lacking &quot;context&quot; would look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The reason their archives are sealed is because they probably have documentation thoroughly disproving their dogma.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>who? what?? huh?!  that has no context.  </p>

<p>let&#39;s not confuse &quot;context&quot; with &quot;details&quot;.</p>

<p>/zero violation of any rules &amp; upvoted:  fair &amp; good theory.</p>

<p>i hear you... and agree (ideally), but i really don&#39;t think it violates the intent of #12.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Graham Hancock is correct for the larger picture, but incorrect in details and methodology. This is of course a consequence of him being shut out. I think he is doing great work, but I wouldn&#39;t take everything he says as gospel. I think you would agree there, but some people can&#39;t even handle constructive criticism of their heroes. No one is ever going to be completely right on everything, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to dismiss them completely.</p>
