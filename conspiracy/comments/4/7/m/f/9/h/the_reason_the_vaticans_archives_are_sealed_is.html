       Why would they need to keep it secret?  If it was just "so the documents don't get damaged", then they would have restricted access, not closed access without a pass.  The only reason they keep it sealed off is to keep secret the fraud that christianity is.

       Not only disproving Christianity, but the documentation on how the Flavian's of Rome created it to continue the Roman empire, via the Holy Roman Empire. Also, other "banned" books/artifacts/etc throughout the ages, detailing human's real past and other mysteries. Those who have/hoard the knowledge have the power.

       I would love to know too, but they gate keep this, via "evolution theory" and not allowing indie archaeologists to explore many sites. One has to ask, why so much red tape? What are they hiding? Graham Hancock is on the forefront of this, but it's possible, even he is wrong about the age of humanity. Truly fascinating stuff.

       I think Graham Hancock is correct for the larger picture, but incorrect in details and methodology. This is of course a consequence of him being shut out. I think he is doing great work, but I wouldn't take everything he says as gospel. I think you would agree there, but some people can't even handle constructive criticism of their heroes. No one is ever going to be completely right on everything, that doesn't mean you have to dismiss them completely.

       I completely agree. There is truth everywhere and each person/theory are building blocks. One rabbit hole, leads to another, and another. I think people have lost the art of entertaining ideas and seeing where it may take them (if you think about it, it's the ultimate RPG). Life is a journey, and no one has the answer. Anyone who says they do, you know they are a liar and deceiver. But... We can learn from all.

       I see what you are saying, but that is not the case. Well respected and qualified researchers (many fringe) are blacklisted. That is the problem. I'm not saying free range. If you go against MS history/archaeology, you wont get access. If we are talking about Egypt, they do not allow those who question the age of the pyramids, because it contradicts the MS theories and religion of Islam. That is wrong (completely unscientific)! That's what I'm saying.

       You are correct. However some people have been clearly shut out of sites where others are allowed or even when they are the sole researcher/discoverer. In some cases they'd rather the site gets ignored and consumed by nature than even have one person write about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be a gate keeper for these sites. The problem is that the gatekeepers often have political and ideological axes to grind (or in some cases are illegally selling antiquities.) There should be a credential check and an annual limit on researchers, and if there are too many valid researchers, let  them research on a seasonal rotation.

       I'm convinced the Pyramids were free energy generators. Everyone was able to grow in prosperity, so they wiped all record of it, and we rebuild every 5000 years or so. I guarantee there's pyramids underwater or that have been destroyed by intentional land mass movements.

       The Library of Alexandria was destroyed to preserve the rise of Abrahamic Control Cults.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vatican likely does have a good smattering of antediluvian insight and are aware of the true nature of the Abrahamic Control Cult deception.
I always find religious "conspiracy theorists" to be strange birds as they attempt to "see a matrix" through yet another matrix.

       Yes, allegedly more 'heretical' texts that didn't support the fake religion/ power structure that Rome was creating hence the Templars getting the treatment afterwards. The notion that much of scripture is literally accurate I think is the cause of many issues; it's not and is allegorical. The 'kingdom of heaven' is not some place up in the sky and 'ascension' is not physical

       You should read "Another Roadside Attraction," because everything Tom Robbins wrote is brilliant, and, also, it has a main character stealing the mummified body of Jesus out of the Vatican's basement.

       Catholicism doesn't deny it's pagan roots. They just state that how God has revealed himself, through the progression of world religions. But it is a bit messy when they start acknowledging gods vs God.

       Would you believe me if I said personal revelation?
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading much here, and then reading more of Vatican documents, compared to claims throughout history about Jesus' wife or offspring, I started asking myself
       <em>
        why this obsession in the Catholic Church about the role of women? Why the importance of Mary, as a conduit to Jesus? Why can't women perform roles in the Church that involve the science of the faith?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If all the conspiracies in the world lead back to these Saturn-Satanic cults, wouldn't the biggest misdirect be that God was male, instead of female? Who's more effected by the moon, men or women? Why do these Masons build phallic monuments AFTER they introduce goddesses? Columbia is America's, and the obelisks don't go up until the financial scam is in place. Even within the Catholic Church, the collapse of society is supposed to be if Russia submits to Mary and the Church, which is the female bride of Christ... Judaism is also passed through the maternal line, not paternal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Tori Amos planted a seed.
       <em>
        Muhammad, my friend, it's time to tell the world. We both know it was a girl, back in Bethlehem...

       Because what other reason would they have to keep the documents hidden away from people who wish to view them?  I could understand having them wear a "moon-suit", and limited access, but to totally seal them off lends to think that they have something
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       big to hide that would falisfy the entire religion.

       Yes, if they had a moon suit at a pass, I'd let them in.  For ancient documents that may be soiled, they would need a moon suit to be let in, but they would be able to do so.

       w/ respect, it appears to be a clearly stated "conspiracy theory" - with plenty of "context":  clearly about the bullshit lies that are broadcast from the halls of organized religion (christianity and judaism, very specifically).

       Yep I would say the Pyramids alone pretty much do that. Not just in Egypt but worldwide. What happened to those civilizations or rather possibly the one big global civilization I would love to know.

       Playing devils advocate... but wouldn't allowing just anyone to have access to these sites/artifacts ultimately degrade and erode the sight/artifact?

       I think Graham Hancock is correct for the larger picture, but incorrect in details and methodology. This is of course a consequence of him being shut out. I think he is doing great work, but I wouldn't take everything he says as gospel. I think you would agree there, but some people can't even handle constructive criticism of their heroes. No one is ever going to be completely right on everything, that doesn't mean you have to dismiss them completely.

       Yes, if they had a moon suit at a pass, I'd let them in.  For ancient documents that may be soiled, they would need a moon suit to be let in, but they would be able to do so.
