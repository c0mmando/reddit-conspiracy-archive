       This is rage inducing and yes, I consider it a conspiracy. The San Fransisco limousine liberal hypocrites are in full damage control mode about Sanders and are openly now censoring the internet.

       The corporations (Reddit &amp; Twitter) are going to do what they can to make sure a corporate candidate wins.  Hopefully Bernie is aware of this and prepared.  Not to mention the Diebold people and mainstream corporate media conglomerates.  The opposition will be real to the first candidate without a SuperPac running for President.

       But why do they accept anti-Hillary posts and articles? Trust me I know since I used to be on that sub every day. I stopped just today because the repetitiveness is so nauseating. It's just anti-Hillary... pro Sanders... all day. I'm sort of apolitical at this point so I don't really have any dog in this fight.

       Because the community that overwhelmingly supports Sanders would revolt and abandon the sub in droves so they wouldn't be able to at least control and manipulate the narrative anymore. Now they can at least censor key stories that expose how corrupt the whole system is.

       I hear that the mods are pro Sanders. I saw a screenshot on Imgur that only reflected that sentiment. I posted something that was pro Sanders, but almost seemed like a veiled attempt of being pro Hillary (because of the title) and it was removed on a technicality after days of being on the sub. Trust me when I say that everybody on that sub is pro Sanders... from top to bottom.

       [#63|+1665|103] You probably saw it, headline after headline proclaiming that supporters of Bernie Sanders shouted down civil rights activist Dolores Huerta with chants of “English only!” at a presidential caucus in Nevada. Deeply disturbing. The problem, that never happened. [

       Well I guess you're right then. I haven't been following it as closely as you have apparently. If that's the case then the shills there are using some real nuanced tactics. I guess that they've had all of human civilization to refine them. I probably have just made the mistake of underestimating the opponent.

       Supposedly one of their biggest tactics is repeating things like "I support Sanders but the system is too corrupt to get him elected", which is a subtle way to persuade Sanders supporters to not vote at all. And other things along the same line as that. Make people believe you're part of their group but simultaneously convince them they're powerless.
