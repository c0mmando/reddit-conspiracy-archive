        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>EDIT: Well there was plenty of interest in this post but it stayed between 0 and 1 the whole time. Also my karma from my comments rose while users were coming in and commenting and now all positive comments are slowly being DV&#39;d. Whatever you believe I hope this shows you the tilted table we are playing on.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2: Well it has taken them a while but the votes are finally skewed. All the comments that were positive have been pushed to negative and vice versa. Special kind of scum itt.</strong></p>

<p>This might not be what you think, but I&#39;m really getting sick of the ridicule FEers are receiving. Being overly rude to someone thinking out of the box is distasteful and dishonest really. I say dishonest because many comments seem to think that this FE thing is a Psy-Op designed to make conspiracy theorists look bad. I have a few problems with that premise:</p>

<p>-Conspiracy theorists already look bad lmao The general public automatically dismisses most CTs and they don&#39;t need a Flat Earth psy-op to do it. </p>

<p>-If this is an Op, it is splintered and unorganized. Not the hallmark of a planned thing.</p>

<p>-Flat Earth theory has been around for A LONG time with actual experiments documented. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I do believe shills are in the FE movement. For the life of me I can&#39;t make much sense out of someone like Math Boyland, but then again he got me critically thinking about a lot of things so if he is a Shill in a Psy-Op then that shit backfired. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to sway anyone with this post except to point out that the cacophony of harsh rudeness at anyone entertaining FE is the giveaway here. I&#39;m sure that there are SOME actual people with cog dis that are dropping angry comments, but overall it seems just too many to be natural. </p>

<p>Did anyone see how the Flat Earth sub was smashed to death a few months ago? I cannot believe that was an organic mash up of reddit users that all decided to demonize a group. </p>

<p>Someone out there really doesn&#39;t want anyone to believe Flat Earth at all. This is conspiracy 101 that you ought to take a look into it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s too bad.  I&#39;m really sick of the bullshit posts that discredit conspiracy theorists in general by wrongly imagining that a real conspiracy theorist is stupid enough to fall for the Flat Earth Disinformation Operation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Flat Earthers don&#39;t get credit for thinking outside the box.  They aren&#39;t thinking.  You are following videos that literally contain hypnosis (Eric Dubay&#39;s 200 proofs) and are completely, 100%, wrong.</p>

<p>You are being ridiculed because you are ridiculous.  There&#39;s nothing admirable about being stupid.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to know what &quot;dishonest&quot; means.  Flat Earth Disinformation Operation is a PsyOp that began in November 2014.  You, too, can track down its origin.</p>

<p>The rudeness is not harsh enough.  You still feel like you have an audience here.  The only resolution is for you to take this bullshit to a sub that is appropriate, which is not a conspiracy sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ITT &quot;conspiracy&quot; theorists mad because unscientific ideas repeatedly proven false generate snide remarks.</p>

<p>Flat Earthers receive ridicule because the entire notion of a &#39;flat Earth&#39; is utterly impossible given the facts we have learned from studying our world and solar system. Even the first Google search results provide rudimentary explanations as to why the Earth is round (see: <a href="http://www.smarterthanthat.com/astronomy/top-10-ways-to-know-the-earth-is-not-flat/">Top 10 Ways to Know the Earth is Not Flat</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flat Earth theory has been around for A LONG time with actual experiments documented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Attempting to use logic to support an illogical concept, adorable. Countless ideas have existed for a long time due to the simple timeline of when they were imagined. Conducting experiments on an idea does not lend it any credibility unless those experiments return consistently positive results. When every experiment proves flat Earth &quot;theory&quot; wrong, there is no platform left standing.</p>

<p>All persons who believe in a flat Earth are shills because they consciously ignore the evidence in place of their laughable delusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I had to wonder if you might be an alt yourself but your account age and history suggest otherwise, apologies.<br/>
In answer to your original question every single FE post has the same questions asked and never answered because all the answers would confirm the standard model. People are rightly sick of this and will downvote it on sight now.<br/>
The only consistent explanation given seems to be &#39;but did you watch the video?&#39; I have watched a video or two and am still staunchly unconvinced as I have been for 20 years or more.  </p>

<p>The unanswerable questions I ask are how do you explain The Southern Cross/Polaris, the four seasons and Axial Precession? Feel free to answer these if you like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense taken. I totally get it this is fringe stuff. </p>

<p>To your unanswerable questions...The southern cross could be a perspective/vanishing point issue. </p>

<p>The four seasons, couldn&#39;t a disc sun favor certain parts of a flat plain at different times? As in the sun could float further out/under the equator for those times. To me it makes sense, I wish I could draw it for you. Need I say there are some videos with graphic explanations out there already?</p>

<p>The Axial Precession, this is one I actually difficult to wrap my head around. They say Thuban was a Pole Star a long time ago, and then another one, and now Polaris. I&#39;m digging into the details now but it&#39;s pretty murky. It basically just says they kept changing North Stars but some were very inaccurate. It also doesn&#39;t implicate how they knew any of this. Also I found this bit of doodoo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is another disturbance of the Earth&#39;s rotation called polar motion that can be estimated for only a few months into the future because it is influenced by rapidly and unpredictably varying things such as ocean currents, wind systems, and hypothesised motions in the liquid nickel-iron outer core of the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look I don&#39;t have the answers or the whys for you. And really this wasn&#39;t a post trying to do that. I just want to point out the ridicule, whether real or not is unjustified...at least it should be in this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well top marks for actually giving answering a good go, seriously. That&#39;s a first. I&#39;m certainly not convinced they&#39;re better explanations than the standard model but kudos for going for it. I agree that ridicule is uncalled for but having a good argument and a solid basis to argue from would probably negate this happening as often. Ultimately even conspiracies that are more easily proved or have better evidence available will still attract naysayers from other subs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People say what you&#39;re saying about everything. Before Flat Earth people wanted all holocaust revisionism pulled from this board because it was OBVIOUSLY just a campaign to make us look like Nazis. Then people wanted anything about black on white crime or human biodiversity pulled because OBVIOUSLY it was just a ploy to make us look racist. Now you come along saying obviously flat earth is a ploy to make us look stupid. You&#39;re just advocating for censorship.</p>

<p>Whether you like it or not, the flat Earth model reveals some epistemological limitations and reveals the limited information upon which we construct our cosmology. I don&#39;t necessarily think the world is flat, but I am smarter for having looked into it and putting my own cosmology to the test. The thought experiments involved in considering the flat Earth model are worthwhile. Tycho Brahe thought the Earth was flat and had plenty of empirical evidence for it, it&#39;s not just idiots that have considered this over the years. Unless you want to just trust a branch of the DoD (NASA), in which case you don&#39;t really belong on this sub.</p>

<p>Can you explain what you mean by this? All systems of measurement that can be performed empirically work on either world model. The classical measuring of shadows only proves a round Earth if you assume that you know how far away the sun is.</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually a mistaken claim.  It&#39;s true for two shadows, but it is not true for three or more shadows.</p>

<p>That also is not the only measurement you can perform from ground level.  There are lots.  There are also lots of measurements that disprove the Flat Earth models in which the sun is relatively nearby, and moves above the Flat Earth.</p>
