        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>more info about electromagnetic fields affecting health.</p>

<p>&quot;As humanity continues into the new millennium, technology and communication continue to play an increasingly important role in human life. Today, most people in developed countries are completely connected through cell phones, tablets and computers. Today’s households have an increasing array of electrical devices, from wireless modems to intelligent appliances to smart meters. Where 50 years ago, 1 electrical outlet per room was sufficient, today, homes have at least 1 outlet per wall on every wall of the house. People are always connected, and figuratively, the world is getting smaller each day.</p>

<p>As the Information Age unfolds, so does information about our exposure to artificial electromagnetic fields (EMF) that many believe can be quite harmful to the human body. Even if you don’t believe that heavy usage of devices such as cell phones can cause cancer and brain tumors, one must acknowledge the documented proof that electronic devices can disrupt or alter brain function. “The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies electromagnetic fields (EMFs) <em>as ‘possibly carcinogenic’ to humans</em> that might transform normal cells into cancer cells.</p>

<p>One example of research into the effects of EMF includes a study conducted by Bary W. Wilson et al. With their findings published in the Journal of Pineal Research, Wilson et al. examined the possible effects of 60-Hz electromagnetic-field exposure on pineal gland function in humans. In the study, the researchers measured excretion of urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (6-OHMS), a stable urinary metabolite of the pineal hormone melatonin, in 42 individuals who used conventional and continuous polymer wire (CPW) electric blankets for the duration of 8 weeks. The researchers reported:</p>

<p>Volunteers using conventional electric blankets showed no variations in 6-OHMS excretion as either a group or individuals during the study period. Serving as their own controls, 7 of 28 volunteers using the CPW blankets showed statistically significant changes in their mean nighttime 6-OHMS excretion. The CPW blankets switched on and off approximately twice as often when in service and produced magnetic fields that were 50% stronger than those from the conventional electric blankets. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize that periodic exposure to pulsed DC or extremely low frequency electric or magnetic fields of sufficient intensity and duration can affect pineal gland function in certain individuals. – Wilson et al. (Journal of Pineal Research)</p>

<p>Another study was at the University of Berne in Switzerland on the effects of 16.7 Hz magnetic fields on 6-OHMS excretion. This study was based on comparing 6-OHMS levels of 108 male railway workers between leisure periods and days following the start of service on electrically powered engines or working beneath transmission lines. The findings were similar:</p>

<p>“The results support the hypothesis that 16.7 Hz magnetic fields alter 6-OHMS excretion in humans exposed to magnetic fields.”– Pfluger DH et al. (National Center for Biotechnology Information)</p>

<p>. . . The pineal gland is a small part of the body’s endocrine system and is located between the brain’s two hemispheres.  This particular <em>gland secretes melatonin, which is believed to contribute to our effects of well-being and happiness and regulates our sleep/wake cycle. Melatonin is also believed to fight free radicals that can damage neurons.</em></p>

<p>It is documented that the pineal gland is sensitive to all types of magnetic fields, including geomagnetic fields of the Sun’s solar storms, and also extremely sensitive to tissue calcification, <strong>especially when exposed to Fluoride</strong>, which is also magnetically attracted to the pineal gland, causing a number of mental disorders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calcium and fluoride are not magnetically attracted to the pineal gland.  They do however accumulate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In some parts of the brain and in particular the pineal gland, there are calcium structures, the number of which increases with age, called corpora arenacea (or &quot;acervuli,&quot; or &quot;brain sand&quot;). Chemical analysis shows that they are composed of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium phosphate, and ammonium phosphate.[15] In 2002, deposits of the calcite form of calcium carbonate were described.[16] Calcium and phosphorus[17] deposits in the pineal gland have been linked with aging. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland">wikipedia</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. start turning off your wifi devices (including router) and mobile phone at night. (charging turns on the phone radio, so don&#39;t charge anywhere near your bed)</p>

<p>you&#39;ll notice you&#39;re dreaming more, which means your pineal is working more effectively to create dmt. that also means it&#39;s making more melatonin, which is like a wonder drug for your immune system - including fighting cancer.</p>

<p>give it a try. i was truly shocked at the difference it made. and pissed that it took me over 20 years of insomnia to figure this out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a shield.. why? if it&#39;s off, it&#39;s off. i do wonder if a pocket protector that shields your body but still allows you to carry a mobile phone would be a good idea.</p>

<p>i used to live in an old 1940s construction house that used lath and plaster for the walls. my bedroom was basically a faraday cage with very poor wifi / mobile phone reception. i bitched about it at the time, but maybe it&#39;s time to bring that construction method back.</p>

<p>A pocket protector does not shield the rest of a person&#39;s body. Forensic bags are ineffective. Thick steel box is adequate. Or take Edward Snowden&#39;s advice to store phone inside a refrigerator.</p>

<p>Mitigate mobile phones by keeping them off until you need to use them. Better to use a tablet and wi-fi for VoIP apps. Wi-fi is less harmful than cellular.</p>
