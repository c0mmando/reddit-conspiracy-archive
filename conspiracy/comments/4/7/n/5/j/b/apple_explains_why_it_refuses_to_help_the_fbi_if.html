    <div class="md"><p>Let me put it this way: Apple didn&#39;t become the most profitable company on the planet by giving a shit about its customers. It has literally ripped off ignorant people for decades.</p>

<p>Why should anyone believe for even a moment that they have the public&#39;s interest at heart, when they made their fortunes by defrauding that same public?</p>

<p>It&#39;s theatre, pure and simple. The one thing Apple <em>has</em> been the best at is convincing rubes to buy the bullshit they are selling.</p>

<p>I thought the NSA could (and have) been recording the data that moves between phones but not recording directly from the actual hardware the calls are made from.  </p>

<p>Could someone clarify?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apple will do this: they will invert their company overnight by flying 3 of their board of director members to some neutral country and meet with a government official and their version of a notary public; sign some documents and overnight Apple will become a Swiss company, or a company located in Seychelles.  Denying US gov jurisdiction over them.</p>

<p>Next it will produce all their handsets under the watchful eye of a third party management team that&#39;s sent to China, who are culled from ex-spooks of various agencies.  They are given a bounty on finding double agents, secret code, etc--the whole team is rewarded and the individual is double-awarded, so they are encouraged to work together to find flaws.</p>

<p>Thirdly they will make another team from the best open source developers to make enhanced open source tools that are only designed to run on apple, though because of license it can be ported to linux and bsd and windows  and  android if people put in their own extra effort</p>

<p>Then the US gov won&#39;t have any means to demand anything of Apple putting stuff in their computers.</p>

<p>But they can then embargo Apple products, which will then cause american people to go-- WHAT?  MAH APPLES</p>

<p><strong><em>But then Apple will become more popular than ever, because it&#39;s already an elite brand.  Now it will be even MORE elite because it&#39;s undergroundish; and people will be sneaking illegal handsets into america, going to canada to try to bring them in.</em></strong></p>

<p>Canadian government will be encouraged to allow them to pass, but will put up a phoney effort for the american governments sake to give the appearance of trying to stop them, but Apple will be giving more money to them...so handsets will come in</p>

<p>Eventually the US gov will want a piece of this action, and it will give up trying to stop illegal handsets.  </p>

<p><em>Instead it will wage a fake War On APPLE where they talk about the dangers of having apple handsets but on the other hand, their customs will be mass importing the handset and getting them into the hands of teenagers and young urban adults to move this product around</em>, secretly, until eventually the illegal handsets end up in the hands of schoolchildren (oh my!  the horror!)</p>
