    <div class="md"><p>I have heard the Rothschild family referred to as the pinnacle or penis of the dragon. The dragon is the Draco, or the Draconians. They are supposedly a subspecies of reptilian. They supposedly work for and are aligned with a group of extraterrestrial/extradimensional spiritual parasites. One major agenda is to perpetuate control for the farming of spiritual energy called loosh. It is bled when beings suffer or enter emotional states based on fear; lack, hatred, anxiety, frustration, blame, jealousy, etc. We generate this energy when we enter states of love or joy; gratitude, witnessing beauty, enjoying social interaction, relationships, etc. They don&#39;t feel love and when we emulate their behavior, we don&#39;t really either. Engaging too much in fear based thinking makes one feel drained, empty, frustrated and depressed. When one allows it, fear blocks love. This loosh is the purpose of sacrificial rituals and sadistic behavior. It can produce satisfaction for those who live in fear, sometimes even eliciting laughter. </p>

<p>The Rothschild&#39;s purpose is to control the financial system to keep humanity in servitude, busy and working for money, that the Rothschilds secretly create and control. Money is why we work. It is like spiritual energy itself, causing us to animate ourselves to obtain it. Where money flows much animation of humanity occurs and where it is constricted, much reduction of human activity occurs. This power has been covetted since the introduction of money, the power to animate others to serve oneself.</p>

<p>The hierarchy of darkness uses nested compartmentalized groups to obfuscate the higher levels of the hierarchy. This keeps people from piecing the puzzle together. It also keeps the nested groups from defecting. Each nested group is told it is more special than the underling groups that it controls. It is privy to knowledge that the underling groups are not, which supports this perceived superiority. Yet, the group above it is treated in much the same way. Since many of these groups would recoil and defect from the hierarchy if they knew the agenda of the hierarchy, they are told only what they need to know to serve it and serve themselves better, providing incentive to remain in the hierarchy. Fear of punishment works as the stick to the carrot.</p>

<p>Another part of the agenda is to add humanity to the hierarchy. They want to get us to choose to be just like they are. They want us to choose to see the world in a mental/emotional state of fear/survival rather than in a state of love/joy. That way they can predict and control us better. A being exclusively in fear/survival will seek out perceived gain and avoid perceived loss for the self. Calculating and managing such perceptions allows a being to control another being. However, when one deviates from the self-serving script one becomes less predictable and amenable to control. One might cause oneself suffering or loss in order to help others. This is why they avoid such people in their hierarchy. They could expose secrets even though they know it would cost themselves dearly. A test of witnessing harm to others is often used to see if potential recruits show such altruistic tendencies dangerous to the hierarchy.</p>

<p>This conflict has many angles and is spiritual in nature. It is largely decided by how we choose to see the world and react. Another way to look at it is the choice between serving oneself at the expense of others or serving others even at the expense of the self. It&#39;s been the theme of many religions. It is a choice to be a functional component of the body of God, a eukaryotic cell, doing one&#39;s part to keep the organism healthy, or to be a cancer cell, eroding the functional integrity of the whole for the service of the self. This hierarchy is an ancient cancer in the cosmic body of God. It is said to facilitate an illusion of separation from God, which we all are always a part, even the cancer. Witnessing, experiencing, and feeling evil, or self-serving behavior at the expense of others, is the greatest reason why people deny there is a God. This is the energy that separates us from awareness that we created our own reality. If we allowed our reality to have full integrity without cancer, it would be so functional and beautiful that we couldn&#39;t deny the existence of a mind that created it. It is artfully designed to allow us to deny our own divinity.</p>

<p>It is said that we will awaken to these truths and end this experience of separation from knowledge of our own divinity. As long as we wait for a savior outside, it won&#39;t happen. We have to choose to run our own lives and end the tacit acceptance of corrupt authority running it for us. We have to see each other as equals in value not competitors to subdue. We have to unite rather than remain separate out of fear. The darkness wants us to blame anyone, even itself, rather than take responsibility for our part in this situation and change how we react to it. It wants to fill the role of a father, God for irresponsible children. Then it can maintain control over us. </p>

<p>What role shall we play?/Do we want the illusion to continue? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theory is that above the Rothschilds and the Illuminati are aliens that get them to do their bidding by giving them access to certain knowledge or &quot;magick.&quot; Then there is supposedly the reptilian race that gets those aliens to do what they want by mind control/slavery. And above them is supposed to be the Dracos or something else that&#39;s like the reptilians. It&#39;s quite the rabbit hole if you&#39;re pretty open-minded. Alienaxioms.com does stuff about aliens (duh) and I think a little about the Rothschilds and Illuminati, but I could be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To help your theory along I have some information about the BIS that might be of interest. </p>

<p>The Bank for International Settlements seems to have enough power that they now think they can defy God. </p>

<p>They appear to envision themselves as the new Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>The reason I say this is because of their location, Basel Switzerland, The shape of their building strongly resembling the biblical tower and the fact that they have a large group of people  grouped in a single building that all speak different languages.</p>

<p>Look at their building.</p>

<p>Bank for International Settlements. in Basel Switzerland</p>

<p>Biblical Tower of Babel</p>

<p>The biblical quote attributed to those of the Tower of Babel is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they said, &quot;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tower of babel was reportedly destroyed by God.</p>

<p>In conclusion the BIS seems to believe they  have so much power that they can challenge  God to try to destroy them again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Digital information is easily manipulated. Now that everyone in the so-called civilized world has a smart phone connected to the internet, and all forms of media are being created in a digital format rather than hard copies, it would suggest that &quot;reality&quot; as the 21st century knows it is easily manipulated. Maps, history, music, and every other bit of information can be stripped from the majority at any moment, leaving us in the dark, and essentially setting the first world back hundreds, if not thousands of years. Relying on technology only works when you know how to fix it when it breaks. That&#39;s the greatest &quot;trick&quot; The Powers That Be ever played on us, and it took less than a decade to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t own a smart phone. If I never have one I wont miss it when all others  have &#39;lost their minds&#39;.  I told myself the day I got my first internet connected computer that I had never missed it to that day and I would try to keep it that way. Now I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have anywhere near an easy time doing without it but I expect some day I will have to.</p>
