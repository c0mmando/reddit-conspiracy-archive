        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some people talk about the Rothschilds and the NWO wanting to bring about the Jewish messiah, and they say that&#39;s why the NWO planned so many things to get control of Israel, and why the Rothschilds are now building a temple there.</p>

<p>Other people say the NWO believes the God of the Bible was evil, kept Adam and Eve prisoner in the Garden of Eden, and that the serpent gave them knowledge and set them free. And then you have people like Mark Passio, not sure if he&#39;s credible though, but he says this dark occult brotherhood also wants to tell the world what they&#39;re going to do to them before they do it, because that creates more magical power when the victims know, or something like that.</p>

<p>And you see in popular culture celebrities promoting Baphomet and so forth.</p>

<p>So my question is, to the people who believe this is a Jewish or Zionist headed conspiracy, what would be the connection between Judaism or Zionism, and Baphomet? If the conspiracy is headed by Jews or Zionists, where did they get all the satanic stuff, the Baphomet stuff, the telling people what they&#39;re going to do before they do it for whatever reason stuff? Does Baphomet come from Kabbalah or something or where does it come from? I know a lot of the occult &quot;magick&quot; stuff comes from Hermeticism, so what would be the connection between Judaism or Zionism and Hermeticism? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are all great questions that I would like to know the answer to as well.</p>

<p>Mark Passio has brought me great insight about some things, and I was really into him for a while, BUT: </p>

<p>*He always seems so ANGRY (not that I blame him necessarily). </p>

<p>*He&#39;s always talking about how we need to own a gun for when shit gets real  (not that I blame him necessarily), which dovetails with my personal belief that the object is to get us to CHOOSE to kill each other instead of unifying when shit goes down. </p>

<p>*If he was still a closet Satanist, wouldn&#39;t he be a great outlet for telling us what &quot;they&quot; are going to do before they do it, amplifying the magical power of the perpetrators? </p>

<p>*While he makes some good points about the male/female dynamic, I also catch some misogyny in his persona. </p>

<p>Love to know what&#39;s really up with Mark Passio, because he&#39;s a super smart guy and I appreciate what he&#39;s taught me. I&#39;m just not sure what his true motives are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True that. I&#39;ve been thinking about his call for radical anarchy. He says bring it on and we&#39;ll learn from our mistakes. He says that failure to believe in anarchy means that we lack imagination and courage. Well, maybe I am a coward and maybe I do lack imagination, but I simply can&#39;t figure out how the kind of radical anarchy he argues for is supposed to work. We&#39;re not supposed to have mon-eye, so we&#39;re just going to barter each other for stuff all the time...? I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t have enough faith in my fellow man to believe that things are going to work out okay in the end if we all just start packing heat and taking care of ourselves. I mean, sure if we all live by the golden rule but... I guess I lack imagination to see how everyone is going to start doing that. I&#39;m not saying the present situation is tolerable, but I don&#39;t think his solution would be, either. </p>

<p>That is kind of my reason for wondering what&#39;s up with Passio. I learned a lot from his lectures, but at the end of the day I don&#39;t think he&#39;s got a viable solution.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it&#39;s all his talk about fixing the world through universal consciousness, balancing the yin and yang, male and female, to activate the third eye... this is all Luciferian stuff. If God is consciousness then man is God and when you take that thought far enough, man is justified in doing evil or whatever he wants.</p>

<p>He puts a positive spin on the philosophy, so who knows maybe there is some truth behind this stuff, but there&#39;s no question it&#39;s Kabbalistic, Luciferian stuff. He seems to me like the gateway drug into the very conspiracy he claims to be exposing. He also claims to have learned from some of the more sketchy people in the truth movement who many consider disinfo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you think the idea of balance is some luciferian agenda. He differentiates between the occult and the evil/dark occult, and emphasizes that the bad guys wish to destroy the &quot;female&quot; aspect of the soul/consciousness, Care, which connects to the Bohemian Grove and Cremation of Care idea. The point being that those who are seeking to control humanity through &quot;chaos sorcery&quot;, or whatever you choose to call it, aka TPTB, are not necessarily males or females, rather that they are ruled themselves by the aspects of thought and action, without emotion. That&#39;s why he says 666 is a representation of 2/3. Falling short of the Divine, lacking a complete soul, etc. In my opinion he is trying to explain the philosophy behind all of it, not arguing which side you should choose, or arguing that any of it is real, ie actual magical powers, because nobody can do that, not even the Devil himself. It&#39;s only by corrupting humanity that he can accomplish his goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is TPTB? </p>

<p>And I dont think balance is part of the agenda, but I think the New Age movement is part of whatever the agenda is, and some of his ideas seem to line up with the new age movement, opening up the third eye and so forth. Balancing the male and female powers to open up the third eye sounds just like &quot;the magician needs to find internal balance to create the power to do his spell.&quot; There are just similarities. He also cites some of the more new age type members of the truth movement as his biggest inspirations. </p>

<p>Im going to go back and try to watch it all though. Do you know what part of his presentation specifically deals with the chaos magic and the dark occult, and why they tell everyone what they&#39;re going to do through symbols? And what is chaos magic? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are talking about is Luciferianism, not Satanism</p>

<p>Satanism = worshiping the devil
Luciferianism = Worshiping Lucifer, who Luciferians believe was rewritten as a negative to keep people opressed.</p>

<p>Lucifer means light bringer, which is similar to other gods that bring knowledge to humanity. They believe God (YHWH) wants to keep people in the dark and opressed and that Lucifer attempted to bring us knowledge in the Garden, God got pissed and threw everyone out. They believe there is a mass conspiracy by the traditional Christian groups to use religion to opress, which they claim to have proof that Lucifer was the good guy and God was an oppressive entity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks and yeah I know what the Luciferian belief is. What I&#39;m asking is how did it originate in terms of the modern conspiracy? If there is a Jewish conspiracy going on, how does Judaism = Luciferianism? That is my question. Wouldn&#39;t Luciferians be anti-Judaism, or is there something I don&#39;t know about in the Talmud or Kabbalah that updates Judaism and makes it so Lucifer is the Jewish God now, not the &quot;Lord&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most Jewish conspiracies are related either to Zionism or Baalism, where in appearance, they seem Judaic, but ultimately, they worship Baal, who apparently would give wealth and power for contiguous (blood/flesh) magic and sacrifices. </p>

<p>I have also heard that the current conspiracies claim that its a corruption of the Kabbalah by the following:</p>

<p>Somewhere in the Kabbalah there is a section allows someone to exonerate themselves of any wrong doing, if they let their intentions be known and no one stops them. So through the &quot;Illuminati/NWO/Whatever you want to call them&quot; they use this via symbolism and predictive programming and if we dont stop them, we basically are entering an agreement by lack of action to allow it and remove and responsibility from them.</p>

<p>I dont think Judaism  = Luciferianism, i think its a large misconception without any actual understanding of what their actual beliefs are. I personally know several Luciferians who are also Masons, and the concept of the &quot;knowledge bearer&quot; always seem tied in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in learning more about that Kabbalah aspect. Thanks for responding. Do you know what passage specifically from the Kabbalah they interpret to exonerate wrongdoing if they let their intentions be known? And do you know if the Kabbalah is the origin of this idea in Judaism, or if the Kabbalah borrowed it from the Talmud or something else?</p>

<p>And is it just about being exonerated, or is there also any aspect of gaining more magical power if the victim knows? Or is that a separate thing in like Crowley satanism or something? Of course Crowley&#39;s satanism probably took from Kabbalah so...</p>

<p>What passage or what is the origin of the exoneration part? And where does the magical power part come from? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its about more exoneration and clearing any wrong doing from what i understand. I have heard it reffered to as the Pulsa Dinura (spelling?), but that seems to be more of a curse on someone, so i am not sure of the validity of that. Crowley satanism, is really more hermeticism based, it later morphed into &quot;true&quot; satanism on Anton Lavey, who used the basic premise and moved it more into follow one&#39;s basic instincts, from the law of &quot;do what thou will shall be the whole of the law&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I appreciate your help. I don&#39;t want to put you out but if you can track down where you heard that about Kabbalah, and get the specifics on the exoneration aspect, that&#39;s a big missing link for me in my research so I&#39;m very interested in finding out about that if you think you would be able to find that again. </p>

<p>And yeah I agree Crowley is more Hermeticism based. But I read an article by Miles Mathis describing the power struggle in the 1500s between the bankers and the Vatican, and his theory is that the Zohar and the Corpus Hermeticum were both commissioned by the de Medici&#39;s, because when the latter was &quot;found,&quot; it was delivered to agents of the de Medici&#39;s. So his theory is both of those aren&#39;t as old as some sources claim, and that the Medici&#39;s commissioned the writing of those books to weaken Christianity and the Vatican, just like the occult is being pushed by Hollywood today to weaken Christianity.</p>

<p>In any case it sounds like Hermeticism and Kabbalah are kind of sister books. So maybe that&#39;s a link between satanism and judaism in a sense. But some people say Judaism had satanic aspects before the Kabbalah, the star of Remphan, &quot;your God Molech,&quot; both passages in the New Testament although don&#39;t quote me exactly, so I&#39;m trying to understand that as well.</p>

<p>Those are kind of my two major questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the root of Satanic or Luciferian aspects in segments of Judaism specifically, if they exist assuming that&#39;s not just anti-semitic talk?</p></li>
<li><p>If there is pure satanic evil aspects in segments of Judaism, why do they feel the need to tell people ahead of time? What is it in segments of satanic Judaism specifically, if these segments exist, that teach either exoneration of sin if you tell the victims what you&#39;re planning, or teach greater magical energy in the ritual sacrifice if they know?</p></li>

<li>Satan, as the adversary, isnt really related to Judaism, it came a  later with Christianity. Judaism&#39;s relative concept is the worship of Baal and Molech, which is seen in the Bohemian Grove with the cremation of care, which is a faux human sacrifice to a 40 ft owl, Moloch. The old Canaanite gods that demanded human sacrifice are the anti-thesis of the Judaic god, Satan is more of an accuser is more of a part of the bureaucracy of God, Later during the Gospels Satan is giving a larger role. In Talmudic idealogy, there is a direct link between Satan and Semyaza of the Book of Enoch, both are similar stories and in both, Satan/Semyaza gives explicit knowledge to a woman. Satan to Eve, Semyaza to Ishtar, still though, both characters are portray as a report lesser than god, not his equal, where Satan is elevated as the duality of God in Christianity.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Satan in Christianity is the opposite, or the adversary, not a part of God. It&#39;s actually Kabbalism that says good and evil are part of the same God which encompasses everything or something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The old Canaanite gods that demanded human sacrifice are the anti-thesis of the Judaic god</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s my question. If Satanism, or Saturn/Kronos, or Baal and Molech (are Baal and Molech the same as Saturn and Kronos? I don&#39;t remember), if they are the anti-thesis of the Judaic God, then how does that fit the theory that there are Jewish Satanists? </p>

<p>The whole idea of the Jews being the Chosen People is based on the covenant with God. And the racial supremacist part of the conspiracy, if it&#39;s Jews doing it, comes from that, where in the Talmud they say Jews are a superior race, as different from goyim as goyim are different from animals.</p>

<p>How can people cling to this racial superiority idea, which comes from the Torah and the covenant with God, but also be satan worshippers?</p>

<p><strong>Is there something in Judaism where some people would believe they can worship Satan or Molech without breaking the Jewish covenant with God?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if Solomon&#39;s temple was an occult temple to Babylonian Gods, and they&#39;re trying to rebuild in Israel, which was re-taken with the Zionist movement, maybe that&#39;s the connection. It&#39;s all so complicated. Who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism is more based on initiating the end of the world, because the temple being rebuilt is one of the steps in that process that will initiate the apocalypse. That&#39;s why that piece of land is so heavily contested, its definitely one of the most holy sites for the 3 being monotheistic religions, but its also that its key to initiating the apocalypse in their eyes. Its not about the gods. The temple was initially the holy of holys for the seat of god, but it was later corrupted by Solomon who installed pagan idols for his wifes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure you&#39;re not reading too much New Testament into this? For Zionists they may only be looking at Old Testament, considering New Testament bullshit, so Book of Revelations may hold no meaning to them.</p>

<p>My understanding is that it&#39;s about the Jewish messiah becoming King of the world from Israel, defeating all the Jews enemies, having one world government, and so on. Basically this: <a href="http://www.beingjewish.com/toshuv/real_messiah.html">http://www.beingjewish.com/toshuv/real_messiah.html</a></p>

<p>Can you tell me more about the Baal worship? What makes you think the Jews worship Baal? Or where does that originate from? And since Saturn, Molech, Baal, and so forth all seem to be the same thing, how did Saturn turn into Baal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Baal and Molech are cited as old idols and sacrifice gods that YHWH rebukes them from ever worshiping again. Saturn comes later and some claim that Saturnalia and the story of Saturn (Death, Ressurection, etc) is where the concept for Jesus came from, which was developed by Caesarian and the Flavian Dynasty to unite everything under 1 religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think Luciferianism had to do with the original Illuminati and Knights Templar, as in they discovered the truth and how it was perverted and twisted. Thats 1 of the claims at least, that the KT found something at Solomon&#39;s temple that proved this, they were in turn killed by King Phillip, who owed them massive war debts, and the pope, who didnt like their full on Papal Bull and grew up with Phillip Le Belle. The follow up claim is that this knowledge was rediscovered by the illuminati, who worship illumination via knowledge, and then passed to masons. How much truth there is to this claim, i am not sure, but they always point to the use of similar symbols, stories and ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very complex. All of these religions and occult teachers actually spring from the same garden. Satanism is just another interpretation of &quot;what happened&quot;. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, we were created by a &quot;just&quot; and &quot;all powerful&quot; &quot;God&quot;. In Satanism (or certain affiliations; it&#39;s very diverse) the snake in the garden was our savior; granting us knowledge of our enslavement to this &quot;God&quot;. You can&#39;t just trust any religion or spiritual path; they&#39;re all open to interpretation. We have to connect with nature and ourselves and each other. As far as you questions go, the &quot;Kabbalists&quot; of the &quot;Zionists&quot; are just two heads of a Hydra known as the &quot;mystery schools&quot;. Essentially, ancient peoples (not just Jews, but they all are referred to as Jews in modern times) encoded this information in various forms and layers so that only the smartest of the sheep or &quot;goyim&quot; could learn it. Such a small percentage can understand the information or even THAT the information CAN exist, that it wouldn&#39;t matter to our overlords. They work in secret, they know the truth; that whoever created us, created us as slaves. We have somehow broken out of this to an extent but the strongest and wisest of us decided to leave the rest in the dark. It&#39;s quite disconcerning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m asking is, what are the Rothschilds doing in Israel? If they&#39;re just normal, &quot;Lord&quot; loving Jews, then building a Temple to the Lord in Israel would make sense.</p>

<p>But many seem to believe they&#39;re Luciferians or Satanists. If that&#39;s the case, what is the connection? There is a certain Jewish element involved in the conspiracy, so if the conspiracy is also Satanic, then there must be a connection between some segment of Judaism, and Satanism, right? So what is that connection?</p>

<p>What I am looking for basically is a verse in the Talmud that says &quot;we&#39;ve decided that our God is Lucifer now, not the Lord.&quot; Or some concept in the Kabbalah that says Jews should worship Lucifer, or idol worship, or tell people ahead of time the crimes they will commit to get more magick power from it, or something.</p>

<p>Basically I am looking for the connection between Judaism, and the Church of Satan, or Aleister Crowley. What is the missing link here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There probably isnt one. Rothchilds are typically represented as Kazarian Zionists, basically, they arent Judaic in culture, but co-opted the religion for control. I think there is more of an illuminati connection with them, how much they actually believe that stuff, is really hard to tell, it may just be an association of power. Like <a href="/u/ihopitsound">/u/ihopitsound</a> says, its alot of interpretation of the same concept. That the larger religions are a perversion of the actual truth and most &quot;mystery schools&quot; claim they understand and have a path to the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you have to remember, these groups typically dont have really have a similar believe, they all consort with one other for power&#39;s sake.

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, it&#39;s shrouded in secrecy. They can&#39;t just come out and say this shit, people would revolt. Better to keep the masses believing in their &quot;pie in the sky&quot; and keep working as slaves, rather than question the true nature of reality. I understand your confusion, it&#39;s confusing; I don&#39;t get it myself. However I&#39;ve seen enough to know that all of these things trace back to the same source. Jewish missionaries entered Russia long ago; back then it was called Khazaria. Most of the people known as &quot;Jews&quot; today aren&#39;t Semitic like the original Israelites. They are Caucasian people who long ago adopted a darker, more secretive form of Yahweh worship. The truth is Yahweh and Satan work together to enslave humanity., and on some level are probably he same being(s). They aren&#39;t as powerful as they&#39;d have you believe but they&#39;re master deceivers. </p>

I&#39;m just saying, let&#39;s not start getting into what reality is because as a species we&#39;ve scratched the surface. The point is, whether these beings are just archetypes of personalities we made up, or real flesh and blood beings from somewhere else, or even demonic entities from another dimension; they are real on SOME LEVEL. They (or he) has power over billions of people&#39;s minds. Now that&#39;s real. You gotta keep an open mind. Mainstream science is just as tainted as religion is, we have to use the scientific method ourselves. They are proving the existence of the soul ever so slowly. Soon, all of this information will be easier to access. However, it will simultaneously be harder to share it as the Archonic world government unveils itself and its true power over the physical world. It&#39;s gonna be an interesting ride.

There are parallels that tell the same stories (more honestly) in other ancient culture; Sumer, Babylon, Indus Valley, Pre-historic China, Maya, Celtic, etc. They all come from the same place.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So my question is, to the people who believe this is a Jewish or Zionist headed conspiracy, what would be the connection between Judaism or Zionism, and Baphomet? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Baphomet is a corruption of the word Mohammed. It first appeared as the name of a secret god worshipped by the Christian order of the Knights Templers. The appearance of this god, which probably took the form of a statue, is unknown, not because we have no description, but because we have various descriptions that conflict with one another. The descriptions of this Templar god were extracted under torture. It probably took the form of a bronze head with four faces.</p>

<p>What we know today as Baphomet is a figure drawn by a French occultist, Eliphas Levi, in the middle of the 19th century. This figure has nothing to do with the Baphomet of the Templars. It was concocted by Levi. It is his personal invention. It is somewhat similar to an older image that appears on French Tarot cards, specifically the Tarot trump known as the Devil.</p>

<p>Neither the Templars&#39; Baphomet nor Levi&#39;s Baphomet have anything at all to do with the Jews.</p>
