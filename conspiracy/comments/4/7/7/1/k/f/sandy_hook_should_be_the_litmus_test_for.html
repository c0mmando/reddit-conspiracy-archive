I could get into the fact they hid any hard evidence that may have lent legitimacy to the event, but the moment you saw Robbie Parker on the news, you would have to be the most autistic man on the planet to not see how suspicious he acted. And that&#39;s just the start of the bizarre interviews...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no fucking litmus test.</p>

<p>The litmus test only exist in your mind, it&#39;s a self serving point of view because YOU have beliefs about Sandy hook that YOU wish everyone else shared.</p>

<p>So what does this litmus test do for you?  I&#39;m glad I asked...</p>

<p>The litmus test allows you to ignore all opposing views on the subject and easily discard them as &quot;the product of a shill&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s objectively NO DIFFERENT than simply calling someone retarded or &quot; a nut job wackadoodle&quot;.</p>

<p>The fact that you proposed a litmus test at all should serve as a litmus test for everyone else reading this, that YOU are not a free thinker.  That you don&#39;t want to allow other people to be free thinkers.  YOU want the final say so, and that is the hallmark of a tyrant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK then, so tell me:</p>

<p>Why did you think it was so convincing? I really want to hear this. Thou dost protest too much, methinks.</p>

<p>This is a forum, I presume, where people are allowed to dispute things in the realm of conjecture, because the TPTB make sure there is no hard evidence to incriminate themselves. So why, out of all the numerous conspiracies on this board, is the most transparent one the most controversial to accept? </p>

<p>You can, of course, continue to speak and espouse arguments. I&#39;m not a &quot;tyrant&quot;, since I don&#39;t even run this board. All I&#39;m saying is that if you deny that the event is fishy, it should cast suspicion on you.</p>

<p>Try to spin this in whatever you can, downvote me to oblivion with your friends. That&#39;s all you have left, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m now becoming aware that this place is a controlled blackhole when I see people like you... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you agree that your litmus test exist exclusively so that you can just accuse people of being shills, citation: the litmus test, and move on with your day happily oblivious to your lacking critical thought.</p>

<p>Here is the problem with these litmus test ideas.  What if their are multiple theories about Sandy hook.  And some people believe theory A, some theory B and others theory C.</p>

<p>Which ones do we call the shills and which ones are the true Scotsmen?</p>

<p>And since our rules here at this subreddit forbade the logical pitfall of calling each other shills then how do we apply this litmus test with out excluding the other two groups or labeling them as shills?</p>

<p>Hell you&#39;re basically calling me a shill now for not supporting your litmus test.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an impossible situation!</p>

<p>Now what if, your theory you&#39;ve pegged this litmus test to is actually wrong? Then we have a litmus test that is far more useful to the actual shills than any false theory they can push on us because now we are only allowed to talk about this one theory.  All others coming with the Scarlet letter of SHILL.</p>

<p>Just admit that a litmus test is a dumb idea and move forward still being allowed to talk about your favorite conspiracy theories without restrictions or conditions.  It&#39;s better for everyone that way,  Including you.</p>

<p>Mark Dice, for example, was exposed as a gatekeeper the moment he claimed it was real.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t lack critical thought, but I think you do it if you fail to see why this should be the proof of integrity here in this subreddit.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter anyways, if you want a subreddit with a litmus test you&#39;ll have to go start your own.  This one supports free speech and free thought.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t answer a simple question I give you, and then continue to act evasive, then maybe I was right about you?</p>

<p>In my opinion, you already failed my own personal test the moment you decided to make this post.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going off on a limb here and assuming it&#39;s because a mod&#39;s primary duty on a sub is to enforce the rules, and rule 10 is literally &quot;don&#39;t call people shills.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I noted the motive. I&#39;ve seen it trending lately, a call for gory photos. Thought about it too, but that may or may not solve the case. And what it has the potential of doing is eroding the credibility of these truth seekers by showing how they are heartless monsters who want to see dead children. The appeal to emotion could keep the truth buried forever.</p>

<p>However, there is a certain lack of transparency that isn&#39;t doing anyone any favors. The public is the only group willing to investigate this independently, so any and all hard evidence would be useful.</p>

<p>FWIW I am suspicious of all users, but I&#39;ll start at benefit of the doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOTS of things out-of-whack with the story; but if you look at a lot of recent events - there&#39;s an initial cry of &quot;hoax!&quot; - where does it come from initially? If it doesn&#39;t come from legit theorists, who does it come from and why? Who benefits?</p>

<p>Like the Boston Marathon bombing - to me, looking at it closely, it appears to me to be an FBI op gone pear-shaped. They were supposed to foil a plan which may have even been of their own construction (there&#39;s much precedent for this) and fucked up and the thing went live (my theory is that one if not more foreign nations had a little hand in hoisting the Feds on their own petard there).</p>

<p>So what does the immediate &quot;it was a hoax and never happened&quot; do?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It distracts conspiracy theorists and spins us into following false leads, in fact, following a completely incorrect narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>It causes &quot;regular people&quot; to associate any conspiracy around the event with batshit &quot;SHOW ME THE BODIES<sup>1&quot;</sup> creeps and avoid any questioning into the event.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, it muddies the water, and it muddies it good. Now, I think it gets really muddied because everyone knows you can get YouTube view payola if you&#39;re the first to post the &quot;FALSE FLAG HOAX WTFBBQ!&quot; video after any sketchy event - so the &quot;bad actors&quot; and &quot;disinfo agents&quot; and &quot;PR pukes&quot; now get their work done for them for free.</p>

<p>Fantastic for them, but not so great for real truth-seeking.</p>

<p>(<sup>1</sup> Speaking of this, San Bernadino is one where I might join their cries for crime scene data - why are there like zero details about what happened? The narrative makes no sense, nothing about the event makes sense.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the &quot;hoax&quot; part comes from the fact that Sandy Hook has now &quot;fulfilled the deed&quot;. Previously it was a false flag or crisis drill, speculation was all over the map, until Obama made it about gun control. That&#39;s when it went from drill to hoax I think.</p>

<p>Review the following:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Project_TP-Ajax">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Project_TP-Ajax</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Division">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Division</a></p>

<p>I followed the recent Sandy Hook story as it unfolded on reddit and MemoryHoleBlog. From Amazon removing Fetzer&#39;s book, to the fake Fetzer AMA, to the ousting of James Tracy, to the HONR network (lobbying), to the millions in Facebook donations, to the demolished school, to the gun control orders Obama announced on TV while crying over Sandy Hook. It all smells like fish. If there was a scale to show what side of the fence I&#39;m on, it is leaning heavily towards &quot;big time hoax&quot; side. Maybe not the best word, maybe people did die, maybe false flag event or propagandistic terrorism is a better term. If the U.S. government already does this stuff to other countries how do we know it isn&#39;t taking place here?</p>

<p>When the San Bernardino shooting happened and I kept seeing stories on TV I grew very suspicious and started researching what it could actually be. That is when I learned of Sandy Hook, false flags, crisis actors, etc.</p>

<p>Now look. The FBI is having a hard time making the &quot;hoax fulfill the deed&quot;. Apple isn&#39;t letting them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, nothing happened re:gun control after Sandy Hook. They tried to get a bill passed that would cross-reference mental health history (read:prescription info but politicians can&#39;t say that out loud if they want to keep donations coming and journalists can&#39;t say that out loud if they want to keep ad dollars coming) with gun ownership and it didn&#39;t pass.</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical companies won that round, with help from some probably well-meaning conspiracy theorists and plenty of non-well-meaning disinfo agents. They&#39;ll keep winning, and people will keep dying, until people wake up and <em>really</em> look into these events vs. passively watching crudely-made YouTubes pushed to them by suspect parties with agendas to sell.</p>

<p>Anyhow...</p>

<p>I can agree with you on a lot of things (I actually have you tagged as a friend from a while back), but I&#39;m going to be honest with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is, nothing happened re:gun control after Sandy Hook. They tried to get a bill passed that would cross-reference mental health history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contradiction. They tried to get a bill passed. That counts as something happening. They capitalized on a mass shooting to introduce gun laws (whether or not they passed). I doubt it&#39;s really about one thing though. It&#39;s more about creating opportunity and exploiting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I think it gets really muddied because everyone knows you can get YouTube view payola if you&#39;re the first to post the &quot;FALSE FLAG HOAX WTFBBQ!&quot; video after any sketchy event</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve all seen it. You&#39;re saying people are gullible and fall for Youtube videos. Why yes, that happens. It doesn&#39;t mean Youtube is the wrong place to look. Youtube is not a disinfo agent, nor is it a conspiracy info website, nor is it a government front. It is a video publishing platform for regular people who are nearly free to say what they want. Are you telling me I should get my info from mainstream media instead? Or from anonymous reddit users like yourself?</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the gun control bill passed or not, the event had quite a psychological effect by prancing around victims on TV and Obama shedding tears, making everyone mourn and contemplate gun violence. You don&#39;t see that? How can someone shed tears for an event several years later, for someone they don&#39;t know? Fake. Disingenuous. Fooled by the lead actor in this play. I suspect it, but I hope it&#39;s not true.</p>

<p>...and then you divert into a theory about big pharma, trying to put the focus back on them instead of the government. What&#39;s the intention?</p>

<p>I gave some relevant info about CIA false flag operations. I asked your opinion. You ignored it in your comment and pointed me to something else. Is this not what you criticized someone else of doing?</p>

<p>Honestly, I was surprised by Flytape&#39;s comment. I don&#39;t know him to normally be outspoken, and the OP wasn&#39;t really overstating much. You get these threads all the time. I understand it might break the rules, but let&#39;s understand the rules serve censorship and not free speech.</p>

<p>You might say this thread was an attempt to organize people and thoughts, and you also might say some of the comments here were an attempt to sell the official story and prevent anyone outside of that idealism from organizing. Keep the noise on high volume so nothing ever happens. Keep everyone discussing their pet theories, but never let that culminate into a tipping point that might enact real change.</p>

<p>Help me understand this.</p>

<p>The man shows up one day after the massacre. <strong>ONE DAY</strong>. He smiles, laughs, then walks up to podium.

<p>Then, to make it even worse, he asks over television for donations. His daughter just died, and he&#39;s concerned with a facebook funding page made so soon after the death? Are you an alien, my friend? That&#39;s so suspicious it defies comprehension. </p>

The absence is utterly meaningless, and there&#39;s no reason why standard protocol - which is certainly not releasing such things - should be broken, just to satisfy the demands of a <em>very</em> few. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you seriously suggesting &quot;witnesses&quot; as hard evidence that this event existed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am seriously suggesting witnesses as one piece of the evidence. All of which buttress and support each other, forming to me, a compelling picture of a severely mentally-disturbed kid, with far too easy access to guns. Yes, if it was just &quot;witnesses&quot;, it could be dismissed, in the same way as alien abduction stories. But witnesses, who stories fit in with everything else, can&#39;t be so easily discarded. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, also, I would like you to give your best explanation as to why Robbie Park and Lynn McDonnell were smiling and laughing less than a week after the event. Don&#39;t you think that deserves an explanation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The explanation <strong>I</strong> want is why Sandy Hoaxers are arrogant enough to proclaim themselves final arbiters of how bereaved parents are allowed to behave. I have <strong>absolutely no fucking clue</strong> what I&#39;d do if one of my kids were shot at school. I might rage, I might be catatonic, I might be anywhere in between, or even exhibit the well-recognized [psychological condition of inappropriate laughter](). I don&#39;t know. And I do not presume to dictate to anyone else how they &quot;must&quot; behave. It certainly doesn&#39;t bother me that Robbie Park apparently had a prepared statement that day. I&#39;d certainly not fancy ad-libbing my way in front of the world&#39;s media. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You gave me mountains of useless bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thereby exposing as false your claim, &quot;Where&#39;s the evidence it happened, hmmm? A couple of unconvincing photos which don&#39;t even show the bodies?&quot; There is a <strong>great</strong> deal more than that, despite the efforts of some Hoaxers to mischaracterize it. Your choosing, without offering the slightest grounds, to handwave every single piece of the evidence away as &quot;useless bullshit&quot;, says a great deal more about you. than the events on that December day. </p>
