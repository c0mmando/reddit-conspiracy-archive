       “It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.”

       So this quote (from 1953) makes you think the moon landing was fake because he said it would be impossible. Yet you leave out his quote  (from 1961:
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the
       <em>
        technology
       </em>
       had been invented) to the VP saying that it
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's your point? If you would have told me 15 years ago cars would drive themselves, I would have laughed in your face. However, now that we have the technology, it's very much possible.

       It's a forum. In fact it's the very forum to speculate that the moon landing was a hoax. Which it undoubtedly was.

       It's being a NASA fan boy to point out that you only used one quote from him which sided with your perspective?

       You say this is a forum for which to openly talk, yet when someone points out a hole in your argument, you tell them to leave. Does that make sense? If you can't handle criticism, perhaps I'm not the one that should leave.

       Well it's exceedingly difficult to
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       a non result. Especially when the claim is grandiose, and the party in question is highly motivated to maintain their claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly doesn't help to support their claim when the man who is almost solely responsible for modern advances in rocketry says it's by all practical means, impossible.

       You keep crying about insults! The worst thing I've said is that you aren't very intelligent, which is evident at this point.

       Your lack of intelligence is further supported by the fact that you think this post
       <em>
        claims
       </em>
       the moon landing is a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no such claim. You have inferred it to mean that. It is simply a statement made by an important figure in the aerospace field.

       Okay, this is what von Braun said about the moon and Apollo.

      <p>
       "Don't tell me that man doesn't belong out there. Man belongs wherever he wants to go — and he'll do plenty well when he gets there." (Time magazine 17 February 1958)
      </p>
      <p>
       "If we continue at this leisurely pace, we will have to pass Russian customs when we land on the moon."
      </p>
      <p>
       "What we will have attained when Neil Armstrong steps down upon the moon is a completely new step in the evolution of man."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Everybody knows what the moon is, everybody knows what this decade is, and everybody can tell a live astronaut who returned from the moon from one who didn't."  von Braun
      </p>
      <p>
       "My friends they were dancing here in the streets of Huntsville when our first satellite orbited the Earth. They were dancing again when the first Americans landed on the Moon. I'd like to ask you, don't hang up your dancing slippers."

       Einstein claimed we'd never detect gravity waves. The heads of IBM said that the worldwide market for computers was 2 or 3. Bill Gates claimed that 8mb of storage was more than enough for anyone. People are often wrong.

       Technically they had, the Nazis had designed for a very rudimentary 2-stage V series rocket for attacking the US, but it was never more than a paper design. Staged rockets the size of the Saturn V were certainly nothing but fictional wishes, far from reality at the point this book was written.

       They'd gotten slightly further than the two stage V series paper design, actually.  The book was printed in 1953, I have my personal copy sitting in my lap as I type this.  Shortly before the book was written, Operation Bumper was completed, which achieved a suborbital apogee of 244 miles by launching a WAC Corporal from a V2.

       One should note that the book proposes three 4370 ton lunar landers, 160' tall and 110' wide, two with a crew of 25 each and nine levels of habitable volume!  A third, unmanned ship with similar dimensions is provided just for consumables.  No wonder he suggests such a large launcher!

       Von Braun knew ROCKETS. He came up with the rotating, self correcting nozzles. That was his biggest contribution to Rocketry.

       I'm sure he told us all he knew, but once we had the basics down it was just advancing by leaps and bounds. He cleared a few of the biggest early hurdles, we.took care of the rest

        Hence, if it requires, say, a thousand years to fit for easy flight a bird which started with rudimentary wings, or ten thousand for one which started with no wings at all and had to sprout them ab initio, it might be assumed that the flying machine which will really fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years--provided, of course, we can meanwhile eliminate such little drawbacks and embarrassments as the existing relation between weight and strength in inorganic materials.
