       He says that oreo is killing American jobs by moving production to Mexico:
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-vows-to-stop-eating-oreos-citing-move-to-mexico/">
        http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-vows-to-stop-eating-oreos-citing-move-to-mexico/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But then he does this, moved his clothing line from being manufactured in the US to being manufactured in, you guessed it, Mexico:
       <a href="http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e121/kliljedahl/Internet%20downloads/clothestrump_zps3fuc5yng.jpg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       His solution to stop mexico taking jobs is to build a wall? How would that stop what he already did and other companies are already doing? The problem isn't illegals sneaking across the border, it's companies selling out the American people over and over. Which he would obviously do in a hot second, as this shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone think this guy isn't just lying out his ass to appeal to people's baser instincts? He will not follow through on a single word. He is a liar.

       Yes he conducts business in a way that at times is detrimental to the country.  But that's how business works.  A good businessman has a bottom line of profit, and fuck everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he's lamenting at, is that America USED to be the most attractive option for business, and people choose it not because they had some nationalistic sentiment.  They chose it because it played into their bottom line.  PROFIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a businessman, whose lamenting at the fact that America isn't financially as attractive &amp; prosperous as it once was.  He wants to reform it so that jobs return from overseas. Return not because he instills a sense of nationalism into the corporations, but because he makes it inevitable for their bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't call him a hypocrite for being a successfull businessman.  Business will always choose profit.  Its the country's job to make it attractive for business. And thats what he intends to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's going to bring back tariffs, so that if Oreo wants to sell their cookies in america, they will make more money if they manufacture them HERE than In mexico
      </p>
      <p>
       In a tariff free market, businessman trump would agree that its best for their bottom line to move to mexico.  PRESIDENT trump laments over that fact and desires to change it

       So he's a businessman, so he will sell out the instant he is elected. He cares not about the American people, only his personal bottom line. You proved my point.

       Say youre a dad that owns a company, and you have a floundering son who is in need of a job but he isnt qualified for it.  As a businessman, there's no way youre giving him the job.  As a DAD you want to see your son improve to the point that he can EARN the job.  You cant call the dad a hypocrite for not hiring his deadbeat son.  But you cant call him a bad dad either.  Because he wants to help his son improve so that one day he could hire him, irregardless of the fact that hes his son.  Because he wants to see him succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see how a businessman can ALSO desire to change the country he loves to make it more attractive financially? which would in turn boost the economy
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats trump.  The dad who's sad that his deadbeat country cant earn the business, and thrive the way it once did.

       Do you realize the US is not only a business, but a place where people live? A place where quality of life, not just business success, should be a focus?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this chart:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows that as companies get more income, they don't give it to the employees, it all just goes to the top, the shareholders and CEOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretending like America is a business, like we have been doing for the last 40 years, is just leading us to ruin as average citizens. Corporations have taken over our government, and you want to help that out by trying to be
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       business oriented? Do you realize how little sense this makes? It's doubling down on failure.

       Whether of not you agree with capitalism is a different topic altogether...

       You were inquiring as to how someone could act a certain way towards their country, and say they want to help their country without being a hypocrite.  Thats all i was trying to explain.

       id rather not get into a conversation about the merits/shortcomings of different economic theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will however go off on a related note, and say that you seem to dislike capitalism.  Theres nothing wrong with that, the system is very flawed.  But its not going to change anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if bernie gets elected, and they allow him to implement all the social polices his heart desires,  4 years later theyll remove the ones that Help the middle class while keeping the ones that help big business.  4 years of socialism in this country will morph into a Frankenstein monster of the worst half of capitalism combined with the worst half of socialism 4 years after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats what happens in a two party system.  Each side repeals the bills they dont like while keeping the ones they do.  if you add socialism into that cycle, the Chinese finger strap will get infinitely tighter.

       True, and I was very happy when someone posted that "Sanders is a warmonger" thread because it educated me to a lot of things I wasn't aware of.

       You want to try the fuck again with an actual argument, or do you really think that ad-homs and fallacies make you right?

       Prove me wrong, if I am. Oh, and prove your bullshit “right”, too. That’s an order, seeing as you think you can say whatever you want and get away with it. I’ll wait.

       So you agree he will hurt the middle class then? Since he has no plan but to reinforce the power of business?

       He has said he is going to help the middle class. This is called, being a hypocrite. Explain that.
