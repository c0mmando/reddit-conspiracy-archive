       It seems there is way too much room for conflicts of interest.  Really big ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be interesting to know how many US politicians and policy makers hold dual citizenship and where from.  I think there would be a heavy skew towards one specific benevolent* cuntry.

       It's always been allowed, far back as the revolution, with some limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitation is very specific, I might add.  In short, any politician, excluding the President of the United states, may hold a dual citizenship.  However, holding a dual citizenship automatically makes a person ineligible for the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I forget the specific details, but I think that it even makes them ineligible if they renounce the citizenship they hold outside the US prior to the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole dual citizenship thing really came around in the first days of the nation, since a majority of early lawmakers (right up to around the war of 1812) had been born outside the United States, before there was such a nation.  Thus, they held a dual citizenship, being citizens of the United Kingdom, as well as the United States.

       It really hasn't been much of an issue when it comes to congress or the senate before.  Since no president can hold a dual citizenship, there's typically been something of a check and balance to it.  Meaning that a president would not be beholden to any other nation, and thus even if Congress tried to maneuver around to put the nation into a position that would not benefit the nation as a whole, it still required presidential approval. Meaning that normally, it wouldn't be likely to actually pass.

       If all those people "with brown hair" were from a very cohesive religious group that has as part of its agenda to infiltrate and dominate US and foreign policy on the American peoples' tax dollars for the benefit of Israel, then yes.

       the point of that analogy was that you can't prove all people with brown hair (or dual citizenship) are corrupt, there is no corruption gene, period. if a certain group of people are trying to infiltrate and dominate US, go about proving it and banning that certain group from politics not every one with dual citizenship from politics, that's racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit : downvotes are expected. fuck your illusory borders and citizenship papers, pff...you're flat out asking if we should ban certain races from politics, believe me, US is gonna need all the help it can get. This is not a solution, maybe imprison the corrupt politicians

       One could say he was a puppet of the Crown, all along. I refer you to the Treaty of 1783 (Treaty of Paris). One could say this country has been infiltrated since it's inception... I stand by what I said.

       The Treaty of 1783 has language in it, which contradicts the sovereignty of the US from the Crown of England. So, in essence, we are still a Crown Colony. The King never relinquished the Colonies, only gave them leeway. Which I think, was the whole point. But, I come at this from a Tri-Sovereign States angle (The Vatican, The City of London, and The District of Columbia). I'm a US citizen, mind you. I just fancy history ( we all should!).

       Also, Columbus had Knight's Templar roots, via his uncle. Most early politicians were Free Masons. I think this country was setup for a very specific purpose, and we have been lied to, in every way imaginable.

       There are many other states/countries with much better tax rates and less offensive/dangerous foreign policies.
      </p>

       Note, however, that you would have to establish (and prove) yourself as a tax payer in your new country after you renounce your US citizenship to complete the renouncement process.

       If you renounce your citizenship, you do not have to pay taxes or be a part of the draft. Not sure what you are talking about. That's kind of the point, rather than keeping your citizenship and living abroad (in which you are still required both)....

       Actually you should check the website. IRS and US Selective Service issues aren't nullified when you renounce citizenship. If you renounce, which must be done at a foreign embassy, you become an illegal alien. If you get citizenship elsewhere and get a visa and enter the US legally to work you still have to pay taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't and you reenter illegally they'll probably either deport you to Mexico or throw you in indefinite detention at one of those immigration prisons.

       I'm not sure about the selective service thing, what you said doesn't make sense, in that regards. If I'm a Russian citizen (former US), how am I still required to fight for the US, in the case for a draft? I guess they could kidnap me if I was in the US, but if I was in Russia, how would that work? The taxes on the other hand, does make sense. If you work/reside in the US, you have to pay taxes, because the company pays taxes on you. It's no different than other countries, if the shoe was flipped (I'd imagine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways. I guess the point would be... If you expat you are not looking to live/work in the country you expatted from. I sure as hell wouldn't. Wouldn't make sense...

       The simple point we are making is you have to prove to the US that you have citizenship in another country where you are a tax payer before the US government will not consider you a us tax payer, even if you have renounced your US citizenship.

       There isn't a corruption gene, solution to corruption of politicians isn't taking away their citizenship, it's more along the lines of taking the person away from making laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit : I'm sure taking away some papers is gonna change their decisions :) no. please don't push for this, it's to discourage young dual citizens from studying politics (there's a lot more of them now than there used to be...it poses a threat)

       IMO I don't believe they should as it leads to conflict of interest, but the US Constitution does not forbid such. We need to add an amendment clarifying that such is not allowed.

       first off, I get the point about israel but everything esle, piss off with ur race wars :D
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a young dual citizen and wouldn't mind getting in politics some day to
       <em>
        fix
       </em>
       things, I'd try to help relations and even other countries. I don't want to lose my connection with the country I grew up in....but these are US politicians right?
      </p>
      <p>
       a few things : at this point in the game, does US politicians citizenship really matter?
       <strong>
        If they hold only US citizenship does that mean they aren't prone to corruption?
       </strong>
       If for example a person is half french and half american and another is only american, does only knowing their nationality affect the amount of trust you have towards them? this problem needs another solution than stripping people from their citizenship, I don't know what it is but I know this isn't it.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't forget borders are bs. btw post appeared on top of /hot/ when it's new (I'm aware race stuff ties in to some important stuff too, but a lot of it is to separate us...might be glitch)

        So you have no fucking comprehension of the discussion whatsoever. Explain why foreigners should be allowed in our government and military. Explain why having them there does not foster less trust. Given that every single study ever done in the history of mankind agrees with me, why not stop being an idiot and open your eyes?

       I WOULDN'T HAVE TO explain why having a particular race in a particular position would foster less trust if we didn't have so many borders. get my point? it's all structured this way like an annoying conspiracy cycle

       You just don’t get it. If they’re not tied to the other countries in any way, they’re less prone to corruption thereby.

       No, you don’t understand this at all. You don’t HAVE a point. The borders exist to create trust. Removal of borders destroys trust.

       it is possible to have a dual citizenship and not be a corrupt politician. my brother is a living, breathing example of that, any one with a kind heart working in politics who happens to have parents from 2 different places is an example of that. is that so impossible? just stop. needs another solution.

       possible, and frankly unnecessary since dualies are conflicted internally. End it entirely.

       "Should US politicians and policy makers be allowed to have dual citizenship?" The Founding Fathers didn't think so. They banned dual citizenship.
      </p>
      <p>
       (It wasn't ushered in until 1967 when the Jewish lobby came out in favor of a guy named Beys Afroyim (who voted in a Israeli election). They fought to reverse 150 years of US legal precedent and enact dual citizenship.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So our modern acceptance of dual citizenship is really a historical anomaly--and it's not based on Americanism. It's based on what Stalin used as a code-word for the Jews inside the Soviet Union: rootless cosmopolitans.
      </p>
      <p>
       He referred to Jews with that euphemism because they were seen as internationalists not loyal to any particular country. And in most Western countries, they were at the forefront of legalizing dual citizenship--especially after the creation of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair to our Jewish brothers, one has to try and see things from their side, too. True, the Jewish lobby pushed hard to enact dual citizenship in America (and, yes, according to Marcus Epstein, they were instrumental in the 1965 immigration act, which radically changed the demographics of America), but the motivation was not one of malevolence or evil. Rather, Jews were concerned that many of their family members fleeing the Eastern Bloc might have trouble escaping, so they lobbied to change the laws in the West to facilitate their family members' escape. The good news? Such laws
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       allow millions of Jews to flee West. The bad news? Such laws have had the unfortunate side-effect of fostering divided loyalties, and they've created blatant conflicts of interest in nations where people in sensitive positions have now been caught passing state secrets to foreign nations [see: The case of Jonathan Pollard as one forcefully in point].

       It really hasn't been much of an issue when it comes to congress or the senate before.  Since no president can hold a dual citizenship, there's typically been something of a check and balance to it.  Meaning that a president would not be beholden to any other nation, and thus even if Congress tried to maneuver around to put the nation into a position that would not benefit the nation as a whole, it still required presidential approval. Meaning that normally, it wouldn't be likely to actually pass.
