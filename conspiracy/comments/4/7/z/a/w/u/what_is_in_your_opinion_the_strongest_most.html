    <div class="md"><p>sure -- water always seeks to have a level surface. the surface of still water has no curvature, this brings into question if the earth itself has curvature as it is mostly covered in water. for IF the surface of water was shaped to align with the curve of the sphere earth, with 24000mile circumference, using basic geometry we can surmise the surface of the earth and of water  should curve 8&quot; for one miles. and 8&quot; per mile squared, for any distance greater than one mile. so say the distance across lake michigan is 118 miles, the curvature of the surface of the lake water should be  1.76 miles. which is a freaking lot. and it&#39;s just not doing that, when you look outward toward the other side you do not have an obstruction of 1.76 miles of arcing Lake. this principle that water is not curving to form a sphere  is provable in many many places all over the world looking out over various bodies of water. and it is never disproven. but it&#39;s also provable by the simple scientific rule that water always seeks to be level ,&quot;flat&quot;.  indeed we build the tool &quot;levels&quot; with water. because we trust water to always create a flat line. </p>

<p>it&#39;s not a proof unto itself -- but it is such an intriguing conundrum - -  if water is flat how can the earth, mostly covered in oceans, be a ball -- it is the evidence that moved me to further research flat earth theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gravity comes in two versions -- what goes up must go down -- great - no argument. (of course a boat floating on water makes this a little complicated, and it&#39;s possible the whole what goes up must go down thing can be explained through density and temperature and the &quot;force of gravity&quot; is taking wrongful credit) but either way - yes what goes up must come down, again, no disagreement that this occurs. BUT a spinning ball &quot;pulls&quot; is the goofiest unscientific science I know of. and that part of gravity -- I&#39;m sorry -- but no/ </p>

<p>throw a wet tennis ball spinning into the air, see how much gravity keeps the water from flying off in every direction. in fact the water will fly away much much faster than if you just hold the wet ball stationary, at rest. </p>

<p>why does your washing machine have a SPIN cycle to  get all the water out of your clothes? when the clothes spin around the center the water flies AWAY from the center, and out of the little holes on the outermost walls of the machine. . </p>

<p>hold a kid by the wrists and stand in one place and lift the kid up a bit and spin, keep spinning and keep holding the kids wrists , the kid will feel like he is going to FLY AWAY if yu don&#39;t keep holding on to him. great fun and a great DISPROOF of gravity. spinning makes things want to fly away - not get pulled in. you have to work to pull him in, when &quot;gravity&quot; should be doing it for you, but you can feel the true natural force is actually trying to pull him away from you, the spinning center/ not back towards the center of the spin. </p>

<p>the force of gravity, wherein a sphere will &quot;pull&quot; water -  can not be recreated with any experiment/ ever. in all experiments a spinning sphere resists or even casts off matter, gravity, wherein pull is created by a spinning sphere, is ONLY a theory, that once spheres get big enough - they pull instead of push. but never can we demonstrate this force, never can we recreate this force, we can only teach it and learn it and be told it and tell it. It is a theory, only. It is a theory used to explain a group of conundrums about our physical world, that arise because we are assuming the earth is a ball. the only proof that gravity exists is that those conundrums are occurring and we don&#39;t know how to explain them without gravity -- therefore believe gravity is the explanation and get on with it. </p>

<p>but a whole world of fascinating questions - and some answers opens up if you realize gravity is only a theory, not a certainty, and it is still worth asking questions about what is causing all sort of phenomena we otherwise explain with gravity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI the Earth is concave, not flat, but you&#39;re right that it is stationary. Flat Earth model cannot account for the southern celestial pole (southern cross), flight times in the southern hemisphere (Auckland - Santiago, for example), bloated continents (Australia is not twice as wide as north America!), and has no coherent model. Concave preserves 2d geometry while solving all problems with heliocentricity, once you accept that light does indeed bend to give the appearance of flatness, but it bends up, not down! Look into it and I am sure you will agree.</p>

<p>Also you are correct about dinosaurs and atomic weapons - neither of them ever existed.</p>

<p>You want one that might give you some actual practical benefit? Cancer is a nutritional deficiency, like Scurvy, and easily prevented and cured. See Griffin&#39;s World Without Cancer for more on that.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about any of that, let me know. I&#39;m sure neither of us want to believe wrong ideas!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey!! oh I&#39;d love to discuss alternate earth with somebody who recognize globe is not it - but still disagrees with flat earth. </p>

<p>as for cancer I agree partially but not 100%. there are some conditions that good nutrition can&#39;t solve without stronger medicine too. I actually have a friend I got him to reverse his diet -- get him alkalized 24 /7 he beat stage 4 cancer. it was a freakin amazing experience. BUT. it was by scary skin of his teeth long process and without multiple surgeries and radiation the diet would not be enough. see the additional surgeries and radiation finally worked when they had not before I got him to change diet but the cancer wouldn&#39;t get irradiated just from the diet -- it still progressed even with the diet. it took both treatment and diet to finally stop it. I think cancer is caused by multiple factors and good nutrition is good for prevention but it is not actually a guarantee. and once cancer is underway I think good nutrition alone will not reverse it. or perhaps truly &quot;good nutrition&quot; is just much more complicated than what we have yet figured out. HOWEVER I absolutely agree adjusting diet will give you a huge leg up on cancer prevention, reversal  and cure. and bad diet - is a one way ticket to disease. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked into concave earth and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right. I think the stars are the strongest argument for it, but I think the reasons why gravity makes no sense on a globe also applies to an inverse globe. but tell me about it -- is there a theory on the system that keeps us at the ground in concave earth? do you think you could take a straight shot through space and end up on another continent crazy fast? why is the sky not fully illuminated all the time if the sun is trapped within at the center? what do you think of the moon on concave earth? how do you account for lack of measurable curvature? to me that you can always see southern star doesn&#39;t seem like a problem with flat earth -- because if the sky is a dome you get an advantage of being able to look up at it from where ever you are. like if you are on the ground in a giant stadium with a dome roof -- but tell me what you think stars can&#39;t be how they are on flat ?</p>

<p>I believe there is merit to alkeline-type diets (though if you have any specific references I&#39;d love to see them), and Ketogenic seems effective as well. It seems that once the deficiency has evolved into full-blown cancer, restoring the proper diet and missing nutrients is not always enough to save the cancer victim.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love for you to at least watch Griffin&#39;s video and give me your feedback. I have had a zero percent success rate at getting anyone (who knows how do think, as you obviously do) to watch the damn video and give me their opinion. I find it totally convincing, especially given other truths I have discovered about the medical &quot;industry&quot; (i.e. vaccines, HIV, etc.)</p>

<p>Ok, concave earth time!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve looked into concave earth and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right. I think the stars are the strongest argument for it, but I think the reasons why gravity makes no sense on a globe also applies to an inverse globe. but tell me about it -- is there a theory on the system that keeps us at the ground in concave earth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I see it, and Tesla described something similar, is that there is a &quot;push&quot; or what Tesla called &quot;Universal Compression&quot;. In the concave model, the celestial sphere rotates above us, around which the planets and sun and moon orbit. That sphere, which contains all of the stars, emits an &quot;ether push&quot; that causes objects to accelerate away from the central sphere at 9.8m/s<sup>2.</sup> What is the exact mechanism of this push force? Nobody knows, but gravity doesn&#39;t explain it any better. In the concave model, some theories speculate strong that the electromagnetic field that exists within the concave earth is causing this force - see for example, water being &quot;pushed&quot; away from a statically-charged balloon. This is an experiment you can do yourself at home!</p>

<p>In theory you could go &quot;straight up&quot;, through the celestial sphere, and arrive on the other side of the Earth. That being said, we both know that humans (or robots) haven&#39;t gotten very far at all off the ground. Then you have the glass sky to contend with...</p>

<p>how do you account for lack of measurable curvature? </p>

<p>Light bends in the atmosphere, just as the heliocentrists claim (but likely due to electromagnetism, not atmospheric refraction). Measuring the curvature of the Earth is HARD. There is not really a good/easy way to do it. Teed &amp; Morrow claim to have succeeded in building a mechanical line that proved concavity, but their experiment has yet to be successfully repeated in over a hundred years. Here is a list of some of the evidence:</p>

<p>to me that you can always see southern star doesn&#39;t seem like a problem with flat earth -- because if the sky is a dome you get an advantage of being able to look up at it from where ever you are. like if you are on the ground in a giant stadium with a dome roof -- but tell me what you think stars can&#39;t be how they are on flat ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not that you can see the southern stars, or the north star, it is that they are poles around which the stars rotate in opposite directions. In the North the stars rotate clockwise around the North star and in the South the stars rotate counterclockwise around the Southern Cross. This does not work on a &quot;dome&quot;, only on a sphere:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hii- I&#39;m going to check out all this stuff, &amp; reply but can&#39;t quickly. </p>

<p>but wanted to say quick -- interesting about B17! I had not heard of that. I will research it. I do feel there are ways to get much more specific about effective nutrition that what I had figured out so far, but the alkaline thing is amazing. in very simple terms it&#39;s about the overlap of how stress and diet can do similar harm -- and what they have in common is acidity, stress is literally, in the body  and increase in acidity. and there are foods that increase acidity. overlap. bingo. docs will tell you your body will always regulate your PH so you don&#39;t need to worry about effecting it. docs can be idiots . what you body has to do to regulate the PH is clearly too taxing , when you are too acidic. anyway. disease including cancer literally can not grow in an alkaline environment .however humans can&#39;t be too alkaline or we will go into a coma. (very hard to achieve) but -- constantly consuming more alkaline than acidic keeps disease fro opportunity to grow. it&#39;s why green juices are good for you when made right, not with acidic fruit, they are amazing for you. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.trans4mind.com/nutrition/pH.html">http://www.trans4mind.com/nutrition/pH.html</a></p>

<p>anyway, I&#39;m gonna watch all your videos. also I like your name haha, funny. ttyl</p>

<p>re: Griffin, I watched 5 mins, I&#39;ll have to watch more later, it&#39;s tough. I do not think one vitamin can do it. I&#39;ll give it more of a listen and hear them out - but my first instinct is hi case is a blending of what is true and what is not quite true, I very much agree there is intentional suppression of real much better prevention and treatment, but I thin it coming on a single vitamin is probably not the case. you can literally get cancer from long term friction, if you continually aggressively scratched one spot on your skin for years you would probably get cancer there. cancer can be kind of a line your cells cross from too much aggravation. and this aggravation can come in so many ways, hormonal, chemical, but also likely more ways than we can count. I think when you&#39;ve got so many different ways of getting the disease it&#39;s unlikely one single way can stop it. but that&#39;s ALL before i really hear out the argument. but it didn&#39;t open strong for me, but whatever - so much to know i don&#39;t yet know - i;ll give it a listen, </p>

<p>EDIT: I wasn&#39;t so into the griffith movie because he just doesn&#39;t back up anything with evidence or source material, etc. however -- I was moved enough to do further research on B17 and I talked to my friend about t, we are are going to try specifically adding it to our diet more so. I can see in peoples youtube testimonials on using it that they are sincere eating it got them free of cancer,  -- to me i&#39;ll have to put in more thought and research -- to see how powerful I think this change alone, of adding B17, is-  - but you&#39;ve got me on a path I&#39;m very interested in. thank you!</p>

<p>more thoughts to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response &amp; take your time. As far as the many different ways that cancer presents, the trophoblastic theory of cancer says that the uncontrolled cell division that is the hallmark of cancer is caused by the natural healing process of the body &quot;running amok&quot;. The cyanide contained in vitamin B17 is an essential part of regulating the healing process, and it&#39;s absence can result in cancer anywhere that the healing process is taking place. Hence, if you damage your lungs with smoking, the healing process in the absence of B17 can go &quot;out of control&quot; and the result is lung cancer, and the same applies to any other damage done to the body.</p>

<p>For the record I think it&#39;s amazing that you helped your friend recover from cancer using alternative methods. How wonderful! I have a lot of disdain for the cancer industry, I don&#39;t doubt that cut/poison/burn (surgery/chemo/radiation) can sometimes be effective, but they use those &quot;5-year survival rates&quot; for a reason, namely that survival rates after five years for most mainstream cancer treatments is abysmal - my own father was treated using those barbaric methods when he was 30 and by 50 he was dead of a much more aggressive form of cancer that everyone agreed was almost certainly caused by the original treatment. He spent the intervening 20 years not working and with constant medical problems, lack of energy, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so sorry about your dad. yeah my friend has been cancer free for -- I think two years now. very new. </p>

<p>what you&#39;re saying about why B17 works is very interesting. I can see how you mean that it then would apply to cancer caused by any means, I was reading up on it an I though it was notable some people are saying - it only works if you get enough zinc too - to bond with it - and then enough C and enough several other specific nutrients, I would believe all of that -- that the  total team work of these nutrients is what is needed, but that the B17 might be an essential part. I was reading up on what other foods it&#39;s in and it&#39;s funny I often crave those foods: bamboo, cashews, macadamia nuts,  spinach. ( I know weird cravings, but it&#39;s my taste ;) I can believe this foods have something unique from how I crave them. </p>

<p>as for alkalizing - I actually figured it out to cure skin problems for myself - for vanity I guess, but when I figured out how to do it I wanted to call WHO because I realized this same method should cure cancer, then I got a hold of my friend and demanded he let me expertiment on him, he was supposed to have weeks to live so he was  very like -- it was a dark time. but i just completely rewrite his diet and fed him alkalizing meals all the time, he could barely eat at all at first but what he ate - was the most alkalizing stuff -  - and made sure he did something alkalizing - like drinking herbal tea -- like practically every hour , or when he was able. ( I felt every moment the body is too acidic thats when the cancer grows so we don&#39;t let those moments occur ever, from hour to hour ) -- and here he still is. turns out I didn&#39;t invent it , there are websites where people talk about the alkaline diet and how it can be used for every thing from acne to cancer, so I don&#39;t get to take credit for originality :( (tho I never saw anybody write about the - from hour to hour method ) . BUT it&#39;s real. But maybe B17 is real too. and together = !!!!! </p>

<p>our, they are not that incompetent and they are just corrupted pieces of shit</p>

<p>ergo, since no retard can trick billions of people, they are all corrupted. every single last one of them. because those who aren&#39;t, aren&#39;t there. you won&#39;t hear about them in controlled media like CNN or BBC or whatever. you won&#39;t see them on TV, because why would they show them to you ?</p>

<p>i mean seriously, either everybody is incompetent or corrupted.</p>

<p>how else do you explain this dumb shit?</p>

<p>ban encryption? even though <em>every</em> security engineer in the world is telling them WHAT? the politicans know more than engineers?</p>

<p>TTIP? from corporations for corporations ... even though people are telling them NO THANKS - who will they listen to huh?</p>

<p>hundreds of examples like these .... only a corrupted piece of shit would do this, because there is no other motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book written by General Wesley Clark that told the whole world what the US would do over the next decade.</p>

<p>In 2003, Wesley Clark told us that in 2001 the US government planned to topple the governments of 7 nations, starting with Iraq, but also including Libya, Syria and Iran. We were told this <em>years</em> before the US toppled the Libyan government and started attempting to topple the Syrian government.</p>

<p>The Russians read that book too, and that is why they have been reacting so quickly to the US&#39; actions. They knew what was coming.</p>

<p>Did I mention that Wesley Clark was the man who almost started WWIII in 1999 by ordering NATO troops to attack a Russian occupied airport in Kosovo? When was the last time you heard about NATO troops directly disobeying an order from a superior officer? Well lucky for us, they disobeyed Clark&#39;s order.</p>

<p>I tell you this to demonstrate that Clark is anything but a peace-loving liberal hippy. So when he told us what the US government was planning, those of us who were paying attention knew it was real. We weren&#39;t wrong.</p>
