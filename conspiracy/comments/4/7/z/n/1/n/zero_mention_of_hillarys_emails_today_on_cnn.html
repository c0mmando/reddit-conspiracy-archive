       It's a tough line for Bernie to walk. If he begins to criticize her, the corporate media will focus on Bernie changing his tune, "attacking" and running a negative campaign.

       Forget all the media crap and even his personality. Read his tax plan, and the analysis of it. It's the only one out there that will grow the GDP, jobs, capital stock, etc.

       But it adds $10 trillion to the national debt. I get that lower taxes are nice, but how will he have the resources to round up illegals, or modernize the VA? In the last debate he could not provide an answer with numbers that covered this loss.

       Basically he ripped his entire tax plan from Jeb and added some things that sound nice like no tax for people making less than 25k to sound better. It has tax cuts for the richest Americans and all and It's not feasible if Trump plans on wasting more money on useless infrastructure like a wall on the Mexican border and deportation crews.

       Well the wall will be payed for by Mexico and if you don't understand how, you can read about it on jebbush.com. And deportation will be expensive but it will save money in the long run because the government is spending a lot of money on illegal immigrants currently.

       And what about all the money illegals put in the economy? What about the small businesses they support and properties they rent? There is far less spent maintaining illegal immigrants than hiring federal officers to deport millions of people

       Definitely a bright flashing red light going off over top the "Has the human species completely lost any and all hope?"  countdown ticker that is prominently displayed in the NW0 HQ's main lobby.

       If I had an official NWO Platinum membership card, I would be humbled and feel at least a tad bit bad by just HOW much they have stopped, and slammed the engine into reverse as far as any real advancement as a species that isn't ultimately a double edged sword being perverted and abused by the ones at the apex of power. They hoodwinked the "smartest and most advanced" creature on Earth and in the end, it was relatively easy and laughable what the cost was when weighed against what TPTB gain.

       You know what? Fine, I support Trump and you could call me a racist.  I'm sick of allowing our country (and europe for that matter) to be overrun by third world trash that adds nothing to our society and only detracts from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country (and the modern world in general) was founded by whites of european heritage and we are quickly becoming a minority in the world.

       The problem in your line of reasoning is that you make the assumption that race has
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       relation to
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of the accomplishments of this country. You're seriously arguing that this country is best left to whites and that all other races are a sickness and should be expunged? Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry bud, but that's fucked up. It doesn't fucking matter who founded the fucking country. It doesn't matter which races are and are not a fucking minority. Is your ego so over-inflated that the mere indication that other ethnicities are raising in population quicker than yours makes you feel threatened?

       Botswana.

      <p>
       Advancements in the last 15,000 years? Try things like the wheel, basic stone tools, mathematics, language. You know, useless stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, again. It doesn't matter what race they are. Its not like people born white are naturally better at just doing everything ever. Why do you think a lot of African countries are suffering? Simply because they're plagued with the black disease? Is that the only reason the countries are suffering? Because there are a lot of people with dark pigments? Does the color of one's skin have such a huge impact on the world that it literally makes entire economies crash? Who the fuck thinks like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the world is much more complex than that. There are thousands of years worth of reasons why those countries are suffering. But since I can tell you don't think in a complex manner and therefore probably don't have the patience to read all that explanation, I'll attempt to boil it down to as concise a reason as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the US have (excluding our white supremacy) that most of Africa doesn't have? We have every single natural resource we could ever want in extreme abundance. If this were a game of Civilization or Risk, we'd already have an advantage the moment the game begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets compare that with Somalia. One of the more fucked up nations in Africa. Somalia is such a small country with so few natural resources that the extreme few who actually control the export of those resources are the only ones with any money to speak for whatsoever. Otherwise, everyone else is either an employee of those companies or dirt fucking poor with absolutely no industry to live off of. There is
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       for them there, so they have
       <em>
        nothing.
       </em>
       What does someone do when they have nothing, but still need to provide for a family? They get into a life of crime. And that's why boats get hijacked by bony, starving Africans who spent their life's savings on an AK47. And as long as that cycle continues, as long as the rich get richer and neglect the poor, those countries will continue to be shit. They have been for thousands of years. The few countries with a decent amount of natural resources have turned out to be decent countries. South Africa's GDP is almost as much as the US's GDP. If we go a little farther north, the countries with all the oil are some of the wealthiest countries on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not about race. Its about resources and luck. White people have a geographic advantage. Everywhere that white people originate from, there has been plenty of room for expansion and so we have flourished. That's all. If you think the color of someone's skin affects their likelihood to be inventive or to succeed in general, you're only correct in the context of your own racism. Racism is the only legitimate force in the world that affects someone based on the color of their skin. Otherwise, race is a completely made up term that doesn't apply to any other species on the entire planet.

       Why is he being downvoted for speaking the truth? Everyone here knows why he's saying is correct. You can't deny that whites have created modern civilization and the best cultures in the world. Letting shitty people into western nations is the worst thing we can do. They are literally slowly eating away at our countries and if we keep letting it happen every country on Earth with be a third world nation. Stop being so blind and actually think for once instead of resorting to your programming which demonizes whites and praises brown people no matter the situation. It's fucking disgusting.

       You're worried about all the wrong things but ok lol. Plus if like to point out that if you weren't a moron and your comprehension skills were at least sub par, you would have realized I said he's popular amongst racists. I never said he was racist himself, you did. Dumbass.

       Get over yourself, I'm not a trump supporter by any means, but attacking him like his this rediculous bigot, like the media would have you believe, is extremely short sighted and as ignorant as you're claiming him to be.

       I don't follow anything the media says, I don't even watch American media. All I have to do is hear his comments from him. You're just butt hurt that this moron is beating all these other republican jokes. Every election year these republicans get worse and worse. So much for those retreats a few years back to try and come up with a plan on how to finally win an election. Then trump happens lol. Pretty sad when this idiot is more appealing than any actual republican candidate lol.

       The media can't ignore trump because they'll lose ratings.  The best they could do is spin his words out of context or label him a racist, but in the age of YouTube (where verification is one web search away), it hasn't worked so well for them.

       It's time for Bernie to go on the offensive. He has so many things to attack hilliary on. I get the whole thing about running an issues oriented campaign and I feel like that is the most professional way to go about things.... However. This is a close race. We need something to spark. Something has to happen that makes everyone turn heads. He needs to go on the offensive and attack Hillary by just purley stating facts. He needs to do this to win in my opinion.

       He really shouldn't have to, though.  The woman likely to be running for president in 9 months, who about half the country will be voting for, may very well be charged with a major felony by or around that time.  Anyone who wants a Democrat president should be screaming this from the rooftops right now.

       Why are you so gung ho to take on other world leaders? We have the hugest fucking military on earth, we can fucking chill and stop fighting wars constantly. We also have the biggest market, so that makes international trade relations very easy when you don't have a duplicitous douchebag in charge who's really doling out corporate welfare to the 1%. Are you aware, for example, that we pay 30% more for our sugar than the rest of the world because we have a trade agreement in place that protects the florida everglades sugar manufacturers? We won't even import sugar from canada where it is much cheaper. You know what the sugar "bloodlines" do? Jack the price up and underpay their workers. When workers became a liability, they replaced them with machines. And we pay way more than necessary. Our tax dollars at work to make these fuckers richer. Just one example. If we can do that with sugar, we can do that with any company that threatens to undercut us, move US jobs overseas, etc. It's a big fucking scam. It's not all that complicated, it's just simply that our government is complicit in making sure the 1% get richer and richer so the bottom can fall out and we get that NWO they've been dreaming of.

       "Many of the world's leaders are assholes." This is what every country tells their countrymen. EVERY country. There is no country in the world that will tell it's own people: "hey guys I'm your president, I'm a corrupt bought and paid for politician. I barely ever work while the rest of you slave away to keep us rich. Have a good day!" Every country in the world has its own narrative that it blathers on about, and in every single one of those narritives their own country is righteous and just for doing what they do. Going out and fighting wars over disagreements between world leaders isn't a permanent solution for humanity. It is however what we needed to get us to this point in time. It's time to move forward beyond senseless wars.

       Because it's the only concern you expressed when it really should be the least of your worries. Bernie is tough, he didn't play into the email thing because he was smart enough to see it's the same old divide and conquer strategy. That means he is smart enoigh not to rush into wars unlike all the other candidates.

       Bernie doesn't attack strictly for Hillary's benefit.  It's not because he's a nice guy or because the media will attack him.  It's because if he attacks her, does great damage and still loses the primary, the Democrats will not win the general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie is effectively putting the DNC over what is best for the American people.

       Yeah, the more you examine it, the more Bernie seems like a stalking horse: i.e., someone running to give the illusion that Hillary isn't being anointed by the Party bosses. They seem not to want to waste any of their up-and-coming stars on this cycle [like Elizabeth Warren]. So for a Hillary Opponent, they actually stepped outside the party. Remember: Bernie's not even a Democrat. He's the
       <em>
        Independent
       </em>
       from Vermont.
      </p>
      <p>
       True, he caucuses with the Democrats a lot, but he's not a Democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone [other than me] find that strange, that the media's not making more of that fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the Democratic Party leadership didn't want to openly just
       <em>
        give
       </em>
       the nomination to Hillary, so they dusted off a hobo from a bus station, shoved him up on a stage, and are going to play-act like it's a real contest. Bernie himself is not even taking it seriously. He refuses to ever go on the offense with Hillary. "No one cares about your damned emails!" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's got her back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, he knows he's not going to win. And why should he win the nomination for the Democratic Party--given the fact that he's not even
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       the Party?
      </p>
      <p>
       (This is Soviet Union-level corruption. Kangaroo Court-style play-acting. "No, we're totally not anoininting Hillary. She's running against the guy who's not even in the party, and who won't even say a critical thing against her.")

       Bernie says he never runs negative campaigns, so I'm not sure this is unique to Clinton. He has criticized her in a limited way about her campaign contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the media regularly points out his affiliation, and Clinton has criticized him herself for not "being a real democrat." The media generally hasn't taken him seriously at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do wonder in the back of my mind if he's not a plant of some sort, like if the PTB are trying to get people stirred up only to yank him away in an attempt to create division and unrest. Who knows though, it's a vague notion ¯\

       You bring up an interesting point. Will Bernie endorse Hilary if he loses the primary? It would be a real test to his integrity to see whether he simply supports Hilary because the Republican alternative is worse, or if he does a complete 180 and praises Clinton's every attribute?

       An interesting perspective, but consider that the main problem a Democratic party would have with using Hillary as the candidate is sufficient rallying of the base. There's a substantial number of people who would go out to vote for Bernie that wouldn't show up if Clinton was the candidate, and this problem isn't solved by having Bernie campaign hard.

       That's the thing, right? As a progressive college student, most of my friends are ardent Bernie supporters, so anything I say against him gets scorned immediately. But really, he's idealistic and relying on idealistic, unseasoned rookie voters to get him the nomination. He has no experience. He has great ideas, but I've read books too. I have ideas. That doesn't mean I know how to implement them. Bernie is no less involved in the politics of this election than anyone else.

       I wouldn't say he is relying on unseasoned rookie voters at all. At his rally today in Minnesota i would say it was an even crowd if not older. Yes there is quite a few younger people, and those tend to be the ones campaigning and what not. But the actual voters are people of all ages.

       I used to like Berie until I saw that he got an F for his voting record. Basically, the only things he showed up to vote for were the naming of Post Offices.
      </p>
      <p>
       He couldn't be bothered to cast votes for some of the most important legislation of the day. He just showed up for his pay checks and left.
      </p>
      <p>
       That kind of lack of involvement [and welfare attitude of accepting a government check for no work] made me deeply suspicious of Mr. Sanders. Basically, he never held a job until he was 40 years-old. Then he got on the government teat--and his solution to America's problems is that we all do the same.

         You can't make this up: Bernie's campaign contacted the president of the NAACP’s Charleston, South Carolina branch asking for her support. She declined. There was a pause. Then the person from Bernie's campaign said, ‘You know, Senator Sanders is for welfare.’ This did not go over well.

       Forgive me, but I believe I'm missing the point? Listen to them about what? IMO, he says truth, they claim he's being an asshole. Clinton hates running against people... she's only ran one other competitive campaign so she whines a lot when people challenge her.

       Sanders can't win.  The Dems were going to run Hillary from day one.  Bernie was just there for the illusion of choice.  No way they would let him bash Hillary like that when in a month he'll be endorsing her campaign.

       He can't even call out his political opponent what do you think he is going to do in the white house? I really don't understand why people love him so much, it is amazing how much people will give away for things they think are going to be free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason I dislike Bernie Sanders is he literally has no real world experience. He started out in politics and stayed there his entire life he has no idea how wall street or main street is run. I would bet big dollars that he will go hard after big banks and end up fucking over small businesses harder with regulation than the institutions he is trying to curb.

       Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail. “He was a shitty carpenter,” a friend told Politico Magazine. “His carpentry was not going to support him, and didn’t.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about “masturbation and rape” and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was “always poor” and his “electricity was turned off a lot.” They described him as a slob who kept a messy apartment — and this is what his
       <em>
        friends
       </em>
       had to say about him.

       I think there are 2 conspiracies in play here. There's the obvious Team Clinton one in play with the press skipping over the Hillary email BS, but then again, there are a LOT of rich Republicans (Koch Bros for starters) who COULD be winding up Fox News to slam Clinto in the primaries, but they're oddly silent, no? And so that is the 2nd conspiracy: The republicans are holding back all the Juicy email stories until Clinton becomes the Democratic candidate and THEN alllllllll of the email stories will come out and the democrats are left with a lame duck nominee, ensuring whoever the Republican nominee is cruises in to the White House.

       I don't get it. "Trump can easily defeat sanders". How? Why? one is a career politician who 'it appears' has lobbied for the 'smaller man' the downtrodden and the forgotten for decades. The other is a billionaire you inhereited his fortune (which was scammed from the US coffers by his dad in a pay-to-build housing scheme for the poor and the Navy ), lost it through bankrupcy and piss poor decision making, then convinced a group of 70 or so bankers to not take the money he had left or foreclose on his assets, instead he re-mortgaged everything he owned, (twice for extra magic money)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump eventually found himself in serious financial trouble. In 1990, due to excessive leveraging, The Trump Organization revealed that it was $5 billion in debt ($8.8 billion by some estimates), with $1 billion personally guaranteed by Trump himself. The survival of the company was made possible only by a bailout pact agreed upon in August of that same year by some 70 banks, allowing Trump to defer on nearly $1 billion in debt, as well as to take out second and third mortgages on almost all of his properties. If it were not for the collective effort of all banks and parties involved in that 1990 deal, Trump’s business would have gone bankrupt and failed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you've got a balding man who's lying about this hair, who's money was handed down by his father which was stolen from the poor, who himself managed to 'lose it all' and only got it back because he has friends in the business who were willing to 'write it off', and this is the man 'some' Americans want to lead them? His big thing is being rich, that fat balding cunt can't even take care of his inherited free money, yet 'some' people want to give him the keys to fort Knox, because he's bought and paid for the media coverage.

       Sanders programs of free handouts is unrealistic in every sense. There are no economists that agree with him. Even Paul Krugman, who is a keynesian doesn't even agree with Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that Trump has to ask is "how are you going to pay for this?" followed by "who are you going to get to vote for it in Congress?". Sanders can only pull the wool over young college students, but anyone that pays taxes is not going to fall for the free stuff pandering, because they know they will be the ones paying for it.

       Exactly and Trump is part of that .001%. So here is how their debate is going to go:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Sanders: We're going to tax the 0.001%
       </li>
       <li>
        Trump: Wait, I'm part of the 0.001%
       </li>
       <li>
        Sanders: Yes, we're going to tax you to pay for everyones college
       </li>
       <li>
        Trump: I can promise you right now that I won't be paying that money
       </li>
       <li>

      <p>
       Every politician says this, even Trump. What politician would come out to say they support the rich fat cat bankers? None say that.

      <p>
       Followed by the socialist lie that the rich will pay for everything. If the rich could have been made to pay for everything, don't you think that a politician before Sanders would have tried?
      </p>
      <p>
       What Sanders and his supporters don't fully grasp is that the political system is controlled by the rich. Yes, they might occasionally say this, but they don't really understand how it works. This is why only young people support him, because you have to be naive to believe. Every tax proposal is always said to be against the rich and yet the income gap is continuously widening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this, do you think Obama ran on a platform of widening the income gap? For raising taxes on the poor?

       The way I understand it, it doesn't matter what the President proposes, if congress doesn't approve it, it doesn't get done.

       ...and stop trying to marginalise me,and fiit me into a nice neat 'college student and therefore ignorant/niave' box, because I don't think that Trump is the second coming of Jeebus. The whole tone of, press-reslease copy pasta 'don't waste your vote on Sanders, he's for the ignorant, idealistic and niave' is unsettling. Government is controlled by the rich, who manipulate the 'systems in place', to maintain and increase their own personal wealth.

       Besides raising the taxes on the super rich, he also plans on getting rid of the loopholes that let our nation's biggest corporations get by with paying little to no taxes at all.  He has also stated his main priorities are breaking up the big banks and setting term limits for congress.

       I guess I don't really understand the question you're asking me, but I do not deny people were fooled by Obama.  The main difference is Obama kind of just popped up out of nowhere, and if anyone had paid attention, had a lot of similar donors as Hillary and I wanna say Romney, where Sanders is funded by the people, and has been fighting for the same things for the last 50+ years.

       I think a lot of things about Obamacare are pretty sketchy.  I don't have any real solid evidence I could present but I feel like it's pretty obvious that the way Obamacare is structured is not to benefit the lower class.  The fact that you actually get fined for not having health insurance is evidence of that if you ask me.

       I can agree with that. So if Sanders was to propose fining people for non-compliance on his programs, would you agree that Sanders is equally as bad as Obama?

       Yeah I would be more inclined to lean that way definitely.  I could be wrong but as far as I've interpreted, I think the key difference between Obamacare and what Sanders has proposed is that Obamacare comes in the form of a product that you have to go out of your way to obtain but are forced to have, while Sanders plan would be more like Social Security or Income taxes where it's a small percentage of your check and you just have it.  That being said, he would have to be the most convincing debater in the history of the universe to be able to convince anyone who even slightly leans right to back that idea.

       I agree this is their hope/tactic especially because Democrats are more divided on Hillary. Hillary supporters will stand by sanders as the nomination, the opposite isn't as likely.

       When Trump attacks Jeb like they're children on the playground its petty. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is a fucking liar who needs to be exposed in the debates. At this point, most people are aware about the things she's done but not enough people actually care. I want someone to attack her on that issue.

       Okay but most of them, if not all, had been lying most of their career, Sanders has been fighting for everything he's fighting for now since at least the 60's.  I don't deny that politicians lie, like you said just look at history, but I have seen nothing that points to Sanders being the same.  The only thing I've been able to find that's even the least bit incriminating is that (I think in the 90s?) his stance on gay marriage was supporting civil unions instead of full marriage rights.

       lots of politicians have a consistent theme throughout their career, which is what you're really saying about Sanders. Obama for example has a very consistent message throughout his career, so would you say he's self-serving and a liar?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about voters and their local representative is that they always see their guy as honest and the problem lies with someone elses guy. So if we judging the honesty and consistency of a politician by how the people he represents him think, then everyone still in office is liked by the majority of people and they think he's a good selection. My point here being, you can't agree with me that most politicians are liars and then ignore the fact that so many people support a politician (e.g. Obama).
      </p>
      <p>
       The real difference is what their message is. People hate the other guys politician because they hate his agenda. Democrats hate republicans, not necessarily because they were inconsistent, but because of their agenda. Take for example Ron Paul. If you were to examine the voting record and consistency of Ron Paul, then you would without question see someone better than Sanders. There is really no way around this. The reason Sanders supporters don't like Ron Paul though is because he represented a different agenda than they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point here is that the reason Sanders is self-serving and a liar is because of his agenda, not because of his voting record. Everyone in the world today recognizes that nothing is free in life. So when Sanders promises free college for people, he's lying and pandering to the crowd. He without a doubt knows that the US is in a huge amount of debt, so for him to propose more handouts from the government is self-serving.

       That's fair enough, Sanders is definitely playing on peoples tendencies to get caught up on buzz words.  He has outlined a plan to pay for everything though, but I guess you can probably only trust that info as much as you trust him.  I would like to think the average person realizes that it's not actually
       <em>
        free
       </em>
       college, but shown the amount of people recently who seem oblivious to anything negative about Hillary maybe I'm wrong and I'm giving everybody too much credit.  All this being said, I do believe that these plans could be realized, the money is there it's just being terribly allocated.  I also wish he would run harder on the fact that he wants to break up the big banks and put a term limit on congressmen but people just aren't interested in that.  And to be fair I actually really like Ron Paul, I supported him when he ran and I might have even been swayed to support him over Sanders if he ran this time but there was too many things I didn't agree with from Rand.  I do wish he would have been a bigger threat on the right though, I would have preferred him second to all, now I feel like if anyone other than Sanders might actually try and mess with the establishment is Trump and that's all I really want to happen with this election.  I think policies come second to that at this point because if they aren't anti-establishment their policies don't really matter.  I am skeptical of Sanders just so you know though.  I want to believe he does have the interest of the middle and lower class at heart, but Obama was able to fool us all before so while I would be very upset if Sanders turned out the same I wouldn't be surprised.  As a side note, a large criticism of Sanders plans is that it is a "Robin-Hood" plan and that your taking money from hardworkers to support lazy people, but a lot of the really wealthy people probably paid the same amount or less in taxes as you and I while most of the companies on the Forbes 500 have been paying 0 taxes for years.  A lot of his plans just involve closing loopholes in tax laws.

       When Ron Paul and Sanders came up with a plan to Audit the Fed, it was Sanders that folded and capitulated with the banks. Ron Paul ran on the platform that todays monetary system is a fraud and that the US is in massive debt. Apparently Sanders agrees that debt for college students is bad, but doesn't ever seem to address the massive debt the government is in. Even the Keynesian economists (e.g. Paul Krugman) won't get behind Sanders economic plans.

       That's interesting, and something I was not aware of I'm definitely going to look into this more.  I definitely agree with Rons views on the fraudulence of our monetary system as it appears to be set up as a "forever debt" plan which is only able to sustain itself on the basis of everyone submitting to the standard of petrodollars, which seems to be changing whether they want it too or not.  Another side not I just thought about while typing this comment out, a lot of Sanders proposals are meant to be presented not as welfare, but as investments in infrastructure, which historically have proven to be successful methods in helping the economy.  People want an immediate fix to our debt and that's just not possible, I know it's hard to justify more government spending but a lot of it is just reallocating funds that are already being spent and collecting taxes on those who haven't been paying.  The fact that Obama was such a heart breaker makes anything Sanders wants to do very easy to hate though.

       According to a few of the State Dept emails, Clinton apparently helped get Tom Nides a job as Vice-Chairman at Morgan Stanley, where he's doing so well that he decided to stay instead of leaving to join Clinton's campaign. He did pledge to help her in other "informal" ways, like raising money.

       No mention because the wealthy people who own everything, to include the "news", want either Clinton or Trump in the White House - either of which are easily bought and paid for and will keep their mouths shut.

       They're not sure how Sanders will react, if elected, when they read him the riot act on what he's going to accomplish to destroy the middle class, put more money in their pockets, increase their reach...
      </p>
      <p>
       (they remind those guys that "you can be on easy street, more money than you can imagine, and a lasting legacy (true or not) - or - you will be killed or disgraced beyond measure (remember the Kennedys?), your family disgraced (remember Carter - he quit rather than deal with their shit) or worse - we'll kill your family whenever we want to (again - remember the Kennedys? not many of them left for some reason).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a tactic I don't want to see used on Sanders because he's an honest advocate of the citizens of this country and I'm sure he'd make the wrong choice and tell the American people what kind of shit is REALLY going on.

       The $10 trillion is including market growth. And I will admit that employment rates are predicted to go up under his tax plans, but it still worries me to add to the national debt. Additionally the market growth rate doesn't seem substantial enough to make up for the services that would have to be cut when trying to balance the national budget. Especially if it dips into social programs. Or to spend money on things like the army.

       Stop being low information. Mexico will not pay for our police, marshalls, and border patrol to round up illegals. Technically once illegals enter the country Mexico has no jurisdiction over them. Mexico certainly doesn't have the money to fund this either.

       Regardless of serious you feel this offense was, there is no question whether or not she violated the most basic OPSEC standards and put lives at risk/diplomats at a disadvantage.

       This is beyond basic OPSEC... and she is was the Secretary Of State.

       The issue is that Trump is known by everyone and no one knows Bernie. He is getting more air time but when he does its basically blowing his policies as 'impossible' or other nonsense.

       It's time for Bernie to go on the offensive. He has so many things to attack hilliary on. I get the whole thing about running an issues oriented campaign and I feel like that is the most professional way to go about things.... However. This is a close race. We need something to spark. Something has to happen that makes everyone turn heads. He needs to go on the offensive and attack Hillary by just purley stating facts. He needs to do this to win in my opinion.

       Well the wall will be payed for by Mexico and if you don't understand how, you can read about it on jebbush.com. And deportation will be expensive but it will save money in the long run because the government is spending a lot of money on illegal immigrants currently.
