        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">139</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-02-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think we should take seriously for a moment the idea that this TV show is used by intelligence agencies to muddy the waters of conversation. They pair 1 part truth with 1 part aliens, and make the whole thing look like sci-fi. Then when the real thing happens, people don&#39;t want to jump to the conclusions presented on the show, because they pair it with the outlandish alien stuff, so they think the actual conspiracy is fake too. The baby gets thrown out with the bathwater. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt the X-Files is owned by the MSM and the intelligence agencies. It&#39;s <em>about</em> the FBI, so you know they&#39;re going to be involved. It was advertised constantly during the super bowl, so you know the MSM is on board with the show, which means that the intelligence agencies are on board as well. </p>

<p>Consider the following quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media.&quot; - former CIA Director William Colby</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s really five companies that control 90 percent of what we read, see and hear.&quot; - Ted Turner founder of CNN</p>

<p>&quot;A cynical, mercenary, demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself.&quot; - Joseph Pulitzer</p>

<p>So, if I were an evil super-powerful guy who was going to cause a world stock market crash on a Friday to ensure economic legislation like TPP and TIPP gets passed worldwide, I would probably talk about it on a show like the X-files right beforehand, making sure to pair it with conspiracy wackjob nonsense (as they did in the episode) and then when it actually happens, everyone will be afraid to touch the &quot;X-Files explanation&quot; even if it is correct. It would muddy the water, making real discussion more difficult, and making thinking clearly about the issue more difficult. Especially considering the entire country watched it. &quot;You believe the world stock market crash was orchestrated? Do you believe aliens did it too?&quot; will be the MSM refrain after it happens. This will give more buffer room for the powerful to get away with their crimes unquestioned, and keep the masses trapped in confusion instead of figuring out what&#39;s going on. Controlled-opposition predictive programming, to put it in other words. </p>

<p>So, I just wanted to post this in the event that a few months from now the stock market crashes worldwide, I want to be able to say I saw this pattern in this show and that shows like the X-Files are probably disinfo of a sort that trains us away from thinking clearly about real issues, individually and as a culture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sarcasm? I really do hope so and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this comment disappears. Start with Morgellons, and learning about nano particles. Read about aluminum oxide and Beryllium salt and the dead red blood cells who are airborne in a delivery system not understood by what we believe is known science. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the cruel twist in all this. While some of the finale of the X-files was prime time tv show typical brainwashing garbage, there was quite a bit more than a grain of truth in its overall idea of what was being presented to the viewer as the apex of world power, and what they may/may not have conspired about in secret. One falsity is that alien or extraterrestrial life was all government propaganda to keep people away from the real truth. I make no claims other than to say more than enough proof exists to at least entertain the idea of extra-dimensional beings. I chose my wording carefully. </p>

<p>Geo-engineering, which even many so called &quot;awakened&quot; people deny, is too hard for many to wrap their mind around this whole idea that yes, this scale of epic insanity, deception, but most of all, how poorly hidden it really is could stay hidden or not exposed. You have to have attained a well rounded understanding of the closest thing you and me can ever pin down as &quot;reality&quot;.  Otherwise, if your lucky enough to accept the possibility this is real: and go even deeper, then most will stop at the point that the vide for points towards climate modification being nothing more than just a COVERAGE for the real conspiracy...</p>

<p>I see people starting to buy this narrative that TPTB are slowly disclosing the whole idea of weather modification, and the grand plan is to try and make us all think this entire subject is initial discussion stages. It&#39;s sad to see people settle for that and think now they know something others don&#39;t. </p>

<p>The absolute truth of what I am hinting at here, is
In reality the mother of all conspiracies just like the show but in a much, much, much, more evil and sinister manner. I&#39;ve met very few people who grasped the enormity, but most importantly, the final and permanent effects it will have on the human race. You&#39;ve opened your world view to get this far, don&#39;t stop halfway. </p>

<p>UFOs have been govt propaganda coupled with public gullibility and cold war paranoia since forever.</p>

<p>back in the thirties it was US vs USSR high altitude balloon race, plus maybe japanese ones... that and German rockets, then add to the mix the Spanish civil war and Gurnica and simialr, cities razed to the ground by aeroplane bombers.</p>

<p>then think back to WW1 and Zepplin bombers.</p>

<p>before that there was a budding Edwardian sci-fi scene of early flight stories, one French story concerns ethereal things living in the sky and bothering the early fliers in their string planes.</p>

<p>UFOs are a cultural thing, both spontaneous and govt inspired and watched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but I don&#39;t see how they are going to be able to successfully market TPP as a fix. People can read it now. Most places are saying it&#39;s not good for anyone but corporations. So far their strategy has been to try to keep it out of the discussion as much as possible with a MSM blackout on the story.</p>

<p>I HAVE however already seen them doing a little propaganda to suggest the cure is to go cashless, and start up negative interest rates though. They want to get rid of the 100 dollar bill. Another step towards cashless which they will almost have to do to get away with taxing people on their savings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not even close to what I said. You stated this &quot;coincidence? the original x files stopped filming BECAUSE they submitted a 9/11 episode and the gov leaned on fox to cut it, so the writers and producers said, nope not conpromising our content.&quot;</p>

<p>What 9/11 episode? I can&#39;t find anything about that, and the only thing I see is some infowars video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in that article does it say that the government &quot;leaned&quot; on them to get it cancelled. She is talking about the way the country was after 9/11 and how it changed what people wanted to see on television and the absurd amount of patriotism going on. It also doesn&#39;t help that everyone hated the show now and the ratings were down. But go ahead and see whatever you want there I guess. It&#39;s a free country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it couldn&#39;t. It had been on TV for 9 seasons already, it had lost one of it&#39;s stars, it was critically panned and they attributed part of the problem to people not wanting shows about government conspiracies after 9/11. That&#39;s what Gillian Anderson and Carter talk about in several interviews. Down ratings, lost a main character, critics didn&#39;t like it, show was old and probably expensive. There&#39;s no proof of a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, wut? Who <em>wants</em> WWIII here? Prophesying is a whole other animal. Doesn&#39;t require a big stretch of the imagination either. 30 years? It&#39;s only been a 100 since WWI started, and that&#39;s a tiny fraction of even recorded history (5000 years) much less all of human history (1 million), so the historical momentum for another WW is certainly with us, even more so given: 1) increasing overpopulation and 2) concurrent competition for ever scarcer resources, and 3) growing inter-connectivity of international markets subject to simultaneous catastrophic failure, and 4) accelerating clash of cultures and values and viruses 5) and the fact that we&#39;re still fighting a Cold War because of huge political issues left over from WWII, 6) while ever improving the technical capability of projecting military force, including nuclear, chemical and biological weapons anywhere in the world at the flick of a switch.</p>

<p>Yea, I&#39;d say WWIII in our lifetimes is a pretty easy call after all. If Trump is selected President, then a sure bet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because then when one part of that menagerie of shit comes true, when people try to discuss <em>why</em>, it&#39;s very easy for MSM to derail with talking points about &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and mislead the public. They benefit from people being confused about what is real and what is not, so they can do evil things and then go &quot;that&#39;s not real&quot; when they are called out, and people are so confused about what is real and what isn&#39;t that the public gives them a pass and any organized dissent can be boxed-in as &quot;conspiracy nonsense&quot; and therefore ignored by the MSM and general public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m quite paranoid with a lot US TV products these days if I can see some subtext. Some products are directly produced for propaganda purposes like &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; from 2014. Just timed with Ukraine and the (propaganda) war against Russia. It was so painful obvious.</p>

<p>Then there are products where you think they throw ideas at the wall to preprogram people&#39;s subconscious for some social changes. Hunger Games, Wayward Pines and a few other products come to mind. Obviously it&#39;s not clear if it&#39;s just some &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; feedback or if there&#39;s something deeper there.</p>

<p>Then some shows like &quot;Rubicon&quot; slip through and get canceled quickly. Till this day they did not release this show as a Bluray/DVD which is telling as it gives a picture which might get uncomfortable close. IMHO an absolute must see for people here and if you haven&#39;t seen it yet, do so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389371/?ref_=nv_sr_1">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389371/?ref_=nv_sr_1</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve only seen the first 3 new X-Files episodes and it felt surreal to me as if the actors were not really emotionally involved in the show itself. There seems to be some &quot;ridiculing&quot; &quot;persiflage&quot; vibe from the start which directly hurts the meta of the show itself. Highlighted with the &quot;comedy&quot; episode 3. You don&#39;t do such campy things so early in a show which needs to re-establish itself first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you have it backwards.  The first epsisode was a partial disclosure as a confession / calling card / mockery; then subsequent episodes were a goof with a completely different tone of the first episode--their purpose is to use a shotgun approach to discredit ALL conspiracy theories by currying them together, which is itself an attempt to quell the burgeoning &#39;awakening movement&#39; where opinion has swayed in favor of reinvestigating 9/11 but also auditing the FED, ending the drug war and a bunch of other things the abusive banking/war/drug profiteers (engineers of the Spectacle / cabal / illuminati) does not want to happen.</p>

Oh wow only one TV show in the 90s along with the x Files. So this member of the elite, whose been given the prestige of including the foretelling of the future in his show hasn&#39;t been good enough for them to work on anything else? How does that work? They trust him enough to tell him the future, but not enough to let him work on any of their other propaganda (because as I&#39;ve learned from your post all media is controlled by the government)?

<p>2016: February will bring confusion and the feeling to individuals of a looming crisis of mass proportions. Primaries will bring upsets. (2015 showed us that trend already).</p>

<p>Spring: public will begin to become very optimistic about future forgetting about feeling of looming crisis.</p>

<p>Summer: still optimistic but feeling of looming crisis/ something is not right with geopolitics. Caution seems to permeate the consensus. </p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It shows Joel McHale&#39;s conspiracy theorist character Tad O&#39;Malley laying out his ideas for what the conspirators will do, <strong>that doesn&#39;t happen and is actually NOT the real conspiracy</strong>, as revealed in the final episode.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O&#39;Malley: It&#39;ll probably start on a Friday. The banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend.</p>

<p>Mulder: Digital money will disappear....followed by the detonation of strategic EMP bombs to knock out major grids.</p>

<p>O&#39;Malley: It&#39;ll seem like an attack on America by terrorists or Russia</p>

<p>the thing about the great depression is that govt workers and surviving corporate/essential jobs thrived, 25% of the workforce barely noticed the depression, the other 75% either literally starved or struggled bitterly, obviously a sliding scale from destitute &#39;Hooverville&#39; existence to cutting back and no pay rises and living paycheck-to-paycheck.</p>

<p>the bad thing about the thirties is obviously no magic printing of monies on todays scale, much less social services and social safety nets, people literally starved or died from exposure back then due to poverty.</p>

<p>thats not what is claimed. google and use your brain.</p>

<p>for the record, the prop designer/manager for the Batman movie lived and died in Newtown, went to hospital from a pickup car crash (he was in the pickup) then magically died.</p>

<p>theres two map references to Auroa and Sandy Hook in that Batman movie, just oddities that two infamous shootings happen in named movie places.</p>

<p>now for a obviously resurrected fake school (prob a Fairfield Hills hospital building) you need props, they used a Boston prop company for the Yogonda house (one of the named witnesses in the street has a direct connection to the Boston prop company), they used old Rose St. Lima props for SHES (the forensic photos of the SHES corridors has named Rose St Lima stuff on the walls).</p>

<p>thye used five year old crap from another school to make SHES, likely SHES either was just a storage facility in 2010 or so, going by the 2010 renovations of the grounds (bulldozer visible on google earth aerials), and that the grounds are not school like in the slightest (one single adult sized baseball diamond), likely just an old hospital training facility. nurses training etc, the round windows on the doors should be a giveaway, that and the armored reception admin room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no pattern with the x Files though. That &quot;prediction&quot; wasn&#39;t in the x Files it was on a spin off show called the lone gunmen. So your link would be the writers of that show. The only person who wrote for both the new series and the pilot of the lone gunmen is Chris Carter. Let&#39;s look at what else he&#39;s written. Oh wow only one TV show in the 90s along with the x Files. So this member of the elite, whose been given the prestige of including the foretelling of the future in his show hasn&#39;t been good enough for them to work on anything else? How does that work? They trust him enough to tell him the future, but not enough to let him work on any of their other propaganda (because as I&#39;ve learned from your post all media is controlled by the government)?  Doesn&#39;t add up to me at all, doesn&#39;t make sense. What does make sense is you&#39;re just pulling shit out of your ass and claiming it&#39;s gold. And yes I would imagine that the most powerful political entity in the world is acting in ways that aren&#39;t extremely obvious to stoner conspiracy theoriests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in that article does it say that the government &quot;leaned&quot; on them to get it cancelled. She is talking about the way the country was after 9/11 and how it changed what people wanted to see on television and the absurd amount of patriotism going on. It also doesn&#39;t help that everyone hated the show now and the ratings were down. But go ahead and see whatever you want there I guess. It&#39;s a free country. </p>
