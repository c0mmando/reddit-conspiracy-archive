       I think we should take seriously for a moment the idea that this TV show is used by intelligence agencies to muddy the waters of conversation. They pair 1 part truth with 1 part aliens, and make the whole thing look like sci-fi. Then when the real thing happens, people don't want to jump to the conclusions presented on the show, because they pair it with the outlandish alien stuff, so they think the actual conspiracy is fake too. The baby gets thrown out with the bathwater.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no doubt the X-Files is owned by the MSM and the intelligence agencies. It's
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       the FBI, so you know they're going to be involved. It was advertised constantly during the super bowl, so you know the MSM is on board with the show, which means that the intelligence agencies are on board as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the following quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media." - former CIA Director William Colby
      </p>
      <p>
       "There's really five companies that control 90 percent of what we read, see and hear." - Ted Turner founder of CNN
      </p>
      <p>
       "A cynical, mercenary, demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself." - Joseph Pulitzer
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if I were an evil super-powerful guy who was going to cause a world stock market crash on a Friday to ensure economic legislation like TPP and TIPP gets passed worldwide, I would probably talk about it on a show like the X-files right beforehand, making sure to pair it with conspiracy wackjob nonsense (as they did in the episode) and then when it actually happens, everyone will be afraid to touch the "X-Files explanation" even if it is correct. It would muddy the water, making real discussion more difficult, and making thinking clearly about the issue more difficult. Especially considering the entire country watched it. "You believe the world stock market crash was orchestrated? Do you believe aliens did it too?" will be the MSM refrain after it happens. This will give more buffer room for the powerful to get away with their crimes unquestioned, and keep the masses trapped in confusion instead of figuring out what's going on. Controlled-opposition predictive programming, to put it in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I just wanted to post this in the event that a few months from now the stock market crashes worldwide, I want to be able to say I saw this pattern in this show and that shows like the X-Files are probably disinfo of a sort that trains us away from thinking clearly about real issues, individually and as a culture.

       Sarcasm? I really do hope so and wouldn't be surprised if this comment disappears. Start with Morgellons, and learning about nano particles. Read about aluminum oxide and Beryllium salt and the dead red blood cells who are airborne in a delivery system not understood by what we believe is known science.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the cruel twist in all this. While some of the finale of the X-files was prime time tv show typical brainwashing garbage, there was quite a bit more than a grain of truth in its overall idea of what was being presented to the viewer as the apex of world power, and what they may/may not have conspired about in secret. One falsity is that alien or extraterrestrial life was all government propaganda to keep people away from the real truth. I make no claims other than to say more than enough proof exists to at least entertain the idea of extra-dimensional beings. I chose my wording carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geo-engineering, which even many so called "awakened" people deny, is too hard for many to wrap their mind around this whole idea that yes, this scale of epic insanity, deception, but most of all, how poorly hidden it really is could stay hidden or not exposed. You have to have attained a well rounded understanding of the closest thing you and me can ever pin down as "reality".  Otherwise, if your lucky enough to accept the possibility this is real: and go even deeper, then most will stop at the point that the vide for points towards climate modification being nothing more than just a COVERAGE for the real conspiracy...
      </p>
      <p>
       I see people starting to buy this narrative that TPTB are slowly disclosing the whole idea of weather modification, and the grand plan is to try and make us all think this entire subject is initial discussion stages. It's sad to see people settle for that and think now they know something others don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absolute truth of what I am hinting at here, is
In reality the mother of all conspiracies just like the show but in a much, much, much, more evil and sinister manner. I've met very few people who grasped the enormity, but most importantly, the final and permanent effects it will have on the human race. You've opened your world view to get this far, don't stop halfway.

       back in the thirties it was US vs USSR high altitude balloon race, plus maybe japanese ones... that and German rockets, then add to the mix the Spanish civil war and Gurnica and simialr, cities razed to the ground by aeroplane bombers.

       Well with the current state of the global economy it's not even an unlikely prediction. China already had to shut down it's market several times, and devalue currency to keep it from getting out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does it tie into the TPP stuff though? Are you suggesting the TPP would somehow be sold as a fix to an economic collapse? Cause it seems like most people realize it will only make things worse for the working class.

       Ok but I don't see how they are going to be able to successfully market TPP as a fix. People can read it now. Most places are saying it's not good for anyone but corporations. So far their strategy has been to try to keep it out of the discussion as much as possible with a MSM blackout on the story.

       I HAVE however already seen them doing a little propaganda to suggest the cure is to go cashless, and start up negative interest rates though. They want to get rid of the 100 dollar bill. Another step towards cashless which they will almost have to do to get away with taxing people on their savings.

       youre career as a shill will be short lived. William Cooper named Osama bin laden as the gov scapegoat 6 months before 9/11 and while the long gunmen isnt techinically the x files, but a spin off, contextual inference is within your average redditers skillset, your "one minor point is incorrect, therefore your argument is invalid" tactic is literally straight out of the shills playbook. You fail professionally and as a human

       coincidence? the original x files stopped filming BECAUSE they submitted a 9/11 episode and the gov leaned on fox to cut it, so the writers and producers said, nope not conpromising our content.So Op was correct if not for the wrong reason, which is semantic but just as valid as the preposterous "debunk" you're supporting.

       Nowhere in that article does it say that the government "leaned" on them to get it cancelled. She is talking about the way the country was after 9/11 and how it changed what people wanted to see on television and the absurd amount of patriotism going on. It also doesn't help that everyone hated the show now and the ratings were down. But go ahead and see whatever you want there I guess. It's a free country.

       The last episodes prior to the dramatic return of mulder, dipped on avg 2 points (not that nielsen rating are even passingly accurate) You think they didnt know dogget and annabeth gish couldnt carry the show?? of course they did, X files made fox enough in its previous seasons that the last 8 episodes could be down a few points and get renewed

       No, it couldn't. It had been on TV for 9 seasons already, it had lost one of it's stars, it was critically panned and they attributed part of the problem to people not wanting shows about government conspiracies after 9/11. That's what Gillian Anderson and Carter talk about in several interviews. Down ratings, lost a main character, critics didn't like it, show was old and probably expensive. There's no proof of a conspiracy.

       I fear you misread my posts, it wasnt because they had a differing opinion but because they employ known disinformational tactics and dispute points than refuse to address rebuttals instead engaging in ad homiem(Which SHOULD be a bannable offense) and repeating the same 3-4 talking points over and over again.

       Lol, wut? Who
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       WWIII here? Prophesying is a whole other animal. Doesn't require a big stretch of the imagination either. 30 years? It's only been a 100 since WWI started, and that's a tiny fraction of even recorded history (5000 years) much less all of human history (1 million), so the historical momentum for another WW is certainly with us, even more so given: 1) increasing overpopulation and 2) concurrent competition for ever scarcer resources, and 3) growing inter-connectivity of international markets subject to simultaneous catastrophic failure, and 4) accelerating clash of cultures and values and viruses 5) and the fact that we're still fighting a Cold War because of huge political issues left over from WWII, 6) while ever improving the technical capability of projecting military force, including nuclear, chemical and biological weapons anywhere in the world at the flick of a switch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea, I'd say WWIII in our lifetimes is a pretty easy call after all. If Trump is selected President, then a sure bet.

       Because then when one part of that menagerie of shit comes true, when people try to discuss
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       , it's very easy for MSM to derail with talking points about "conspiracy theories" and mislead the public. They benefit from people being confused about what is real and what is not, so they can do evil things and then go "that's not real" when they are called out, and people are so confused about what is real and what isn't that the public gives them a pass and any organized dissent can be boxed-in as "conspiracy nonsense" and therefore ignored by the MSM and general public.

       But why would they reveal actual conspiracies instead of just making them all up?  It makes no sense at all. Ive never ever once in my life heard anyone say "oh man this was on xfiles i wonder if its a real conspiracy or not?"  That seriously makes zero sense.

       It's because they know this thing is going to happen, and they want there to be maximum confusion surrounding it when it does happen. They are programming people's reactions to that true event, that's why they must include it.

       What part doesn't make sense? They want to derail actual discussion of a real event so they mix reality in with a bunch of nonsense, leading you to think the truth is just a nonsense theory like the rest of them. It's really not that complicated.

       I'm quite paranoid with a lot US TV products these days if I can see some subtext. Some products are directly produced for propaganda purposes like "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" from 2014. Just timed with Ukraine and the (propaganda) war against Russia. It was so painful obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are products where you think they throw ideas at the wall to preprogram people's subconscious for some social changes. Hunger Games, Wayward Pines and a few other products come to mind. Obviously it's not clear if it's just some "Zeitgeist" feedback or if there's something deeper there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then some shows like "Rubicon" slip through and get canceled quickly. Till this day they did not release this show as a Bluray/DVD which is telling as it gives a picture which might get uncomfortable close. IMHO an absolute must see for people here and if you haven't seen it yet, do so.

       I've only seen the first 3 new X-Files episodes and it felt surreal to me as if the actors were not really emotionally involved in the show itself. There seems to be some "ridiculing" "persiflage" vibe from the start which directly hurts the meta of the show itself. Highlighted with the "comedy" episode 3. You don't do such campy things so early in a show which needs to re-establish itself first.

       Lol, so silly. I think you are wrong. The creator of the show just does research on conspiracies to put in his fictional show about conspiracies. They just aired an episode about a lizard man. Not saying all conspiracies are fiction, They do hit the truth once in a while. Btw it was a spinoff of the xfiles called the loan gunman that predicted 9/11.

       Actually you have it backwards.  The first epsisode was a partial disclosure as a confession / calling card / mockery; then subsequent episodes were a goof with a completely different tone of the first episode--their purpose is to use a shotgun approach to discredit ALL conspiracy theories by currying them together, which is itself an attempt to quell the burgeoning 'awakening movement' where opinion has swayed in favor of reinvestigating 9/11 but also auditing the FED, ending the drug war and a bunch of other things the abusive banking/war/drug profiteers (engineers of the Spectacle / cabal / illuminati) does not want to happen.

       Exactly, they want to take the momentum from any awakening movements and drive it in to nonsense theories like CERN opening wormholes or the Mandala Effect or Flat Earth or what have you. If the energy of thousands of awakening masses can be re-focused on these pointless fringe theories, then mastermind criminals can continue to get away with rigging wars without many people focusing on exposing them.

       The "rabbit hole", as it were, has many false paths and dead ends that are intentionally created as such. Distractor truths, designed to lead you away from the real truths.

       No I mean what happens with you? Because things have been prophesied by the conspiracy community hundreds of times before and it never comes true. So what happens with you when this doesn't come true? Do you realize how silly and paranoid most of this is, or does is somehow miraculously reinforce your beliefs even further?

       I guess I'd look a bit foolish and stop making as many posts like this, out of guilt and shame. I care about the truth more than my feelings. If I'm wrong, that's an opportunity to learn.

       It's interesting you claim to care about the truth, but then go spread things that aren't the truth. Opportunity to learn what? That while some conspiracies might hold portions of merit that looking for the boogeyman in everything is counter productive?

       I'm not exactly just making stuff up here, I'm pointing out the continuation of a pattern that there is already evidence for, and making a prediction or hypothesis based on that. If I'm wrong, I learn that these powerful people aren't acting in the ways I thought they were and perhaps I am looking too deeply in to things. It's just a theory here and everyone knows that, I haven't stated anything factually untrue. It's just a thought experiment, if  you don't agree with my ideas then that's fine.

       Maybe to prevent people from getting mad, put "THEORY: .... " in the title of your post.  I assumed you were putting forward a theory, but others might see your title as the confident statement of a "fact".

       I thought about doing that before I posted, but ended up deciding against it because I thought I would be able to write it in a way that was clear what is fact and what is implication or speculation, but I guess I didn't do so well. Sorry for the confusion

       There is no pattern with the x Files though. That "prediction" wasn't in the x Files it was on a spin off show called the lone gunmen. So your link would be the writers of that show. The only person who wrote for both the new series and the pilot of the lone gunmen is Chris Carter. Let's look at what else he's written. Oh wow only one TV show in the 90s along with the x Files. So this member of the elite, whose been given the prestige of including the foretelling of the future in his show hasn't been good enough for them to work on anything else? How does that work? They trust him enough to tell him the future, but not enough to let him work on any of their other propaganda (because as I've learned from your post all media is controlled by the government)?  Doesn't add up to me at all, doesn't make sense. What does make sense is you're just pulling shit out of your ass and claiming it's gold. And yes I would imagine that the most powerful political entity in the world is acting in ways that aren't extremely obvious to stoner conspiracy theoriests.

       The only connection is not merely the writer, it's also the fact that intelligence agencies would have control over the script, as they do with many shows. That's the part that matters.

       Oh okay so it's not the elite anymore it's intelligence agencies. Let me ask you this, why does the ex Cia directors word mean anything to you? If he came out and said "no we don't control anything, we stay out of the people's lives" you would just discredit it. But he says something you agree with and now suddenly he of course is telling the truth. Why would intelligence agencies even know about it in the first place? Why wouldn't it be the people with the money who own the intelligence agencies. Nothing about your "theory" makes sense at all, you're trying to connect dots that aren't there.

       I'm just asking questions here since you left article doesn't support your "theory" at all. No where in it do they suggest that three letter agencies are using it to tell you the future, it says they're using it as a recruitment tool and to paint themselves in a good light. I think you're the one who needs to work on reading comprehension.

       Some people just want to believe in made up theories while they refuse to accept anything else as truth. I have seen every episode of xfiles, the movies and there spinoff, long gunmen, and I'm a huge conspiracy theorist. The xfiles is just a good conspiracy show. I don't think of it as news like op does.

       What many of the skeptics don't realize is that hiding things in plain sight and symbolism is part of their "religion" or "belief system".

      <p>
       That is why they put predictive programming in their television shows and films.

       However, they also like to fear monger. So it's really impossible to say if this exact episode will predict something 6 months in advance.

       2016: February will bring confusion and the feeling to individuals of a looming crisis of mass proportions. Primaries will bring upsets. (2015 showed us that trend already).
      </p>
      <p>
       Spring: public will begin to become very optimistic about future forgetting about feeling of looming crisis.

       Summer: still optimistic but feeling of looming crisis/ something is not right with geopolitics. Caution seems to permeate the consensus.

      <p>
       I enjoyed the old ones, but after realizing how this shows tries to play with the mind of the people, I was done with it.  Never thought about XFiles as a show that "predicts" an event in the near future.

        The first episode of the new series shows a world stock market crash happening on a Friday

      <p>
       No, it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows Joel McHale's conspiracy theorist character Tad O'Malley laying out his ideas for what the conspirators will do,
       <strong>
        that doesn't happen and is actually NOT the real conspiracy
       </strong>
       , as revealed in the final episode.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        O'Malley: It'll probably start on a Friday. The banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mulder: Digital money will disappear....followed by the detonation of strategic EMP bombs to knock out major grids.
       </p>
       <p>
        O'Malley: It'll seem like an attack on America by terrorists or Russia
       </p>
       <p>
        Mulder: Or a simulated alien invasion
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No mention of a stock market crash and one is certainly not shown.

       A friend just got laid off last night. He's not even in oil and gas. Some economic indicators are seriously out of whack right now, like the price of oil, the price of homes, the price of stocks, the price of food, especially when compared to wages. The crash from 2008 never really ended, except for the financial economy. It's finally coming home to roost again. Who knows what will be the breaking point though, it's impossible to tell.

       oil per barrel is aprox $32 and still on a downward trend, yet the gas companies somehow have talked up the market price of gasoline from $1.35 to $1.75, purely using MSM and pundits. all in a couple of weeks.

       'Only Yesterday' and 'Since Yesterday' by Frederick Lewis Allen (journalist and author), books on events in the 1920s and 1930s, covers both decades books in 1931 and 1939. very interesting from a lost news journalistic viewpoint.

       the thing about the great depression is that govt workers and surviving corporate/essential jobs thrived, 25% of the workforce barely noticed the depression, the other 75% either literally starved or struggled bitterly, obviously a sliding scale from destitute 'Hooverville' existence to cutting back and no pay rises and living paycheck-to-paycheck.
      </p>
      <p>
       the bad thing about the thirties is obviously no magic printing of monies on todays scale, much less social services and social safety nets, people literally starved or died from exposure back then due to poverty.

       They said they would bring down an airliner in NYC to start a war to profit the military-industrial complex, which is exactly what happened 6 months after this aired. If that doesn't raise a red flag or two in your mind, then I don't know what to tell you.

       It literally just sounds like a plot to a shitty B-Movie, and is a seemingly common corrupt government story. The fact that this does raise red flags for you is concerning. That's like claiming Batman planned the Sandy Hook shootings with all the "crisis actors" (also another thing people actually believe.)

       Alright then, that's fine. I somewhat agree with your perspective as well, I'm not totally sold on this idea, I'm just pointing out possibilities based on patterns I've seen. If we see different patterns then that's fine, I don't know everything. I just find some of these things a little too coincidental for random chance. Time will tell, I guess.

       thats not what is claimed. google and use your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       for the record, the prop designer/manager for the Batman movie lived and died in Newtown, went to hospital from a pickup car crash (he was in the pickup) then magically died.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres two map references to Auroa and Sandy Hook in that Batman movie, just oddities that two infamous shootings happen in named movie places.
      </p>
      <p>
       now for a obviously resurrected fake school (prob a Fairfield Hills hospital building) you need props, they used a Boston prop company for the Yogonda house (one of the named witnesses in the street has a direct connection to the Boston prop company), they used old Rose St. Lima props for SHES (the forensic photos of the SHES corridors has named Rose St Lima stuff on the walls).
      </p>
      <p>
       thye used five year old crap from another school to make SHES, likely SHES either was just a storage facility in 2010 or so, going by the 2010 renovations of the grounds (bulldozer visible on google earth aerials), and that the grounds are not school like in the slightest (one single adult sized baseball diamond), likely just an old hospital training facility. nurses training etc, the round windows on the doors should be a giveaway, that and the armored reception admin room.

       Since OP's flimsy prediction relies on the inaccurate claims that the X Files predicted 9/11 and that the first episode of the tenth series "
       <strong>
        showed
       </strong>
       a world stock crash
       <em>
        happening
       </em>
       on a Friday", it is a worthless prediction in a worthless thread that should not be on the front page of this sub.

       The show was The Lone Gunmen, an X-Files offshoot based on characters in The X-Files, and involving the same ideas, themes, and production crew.   That show did have an episode involving remote controlled airliners being flown into the WTC as a pretext for war.

       Yeah. "The Lone Gunmen" is the collective name of three X Files characters named Melvin Frohike, John Fritz-something Byers and Richard Langly. It is also the name of the magazine those three characters write/publish in the X Files and it is
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       the name of the spin off show based around those three characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lone Gunmen TV show actually only had one episode and it was the one that featured the attack on the WTC.

       If OP had known any of this it probably wouldn't have even changed anything. Different dots would have been connected but the same conclusion reached because the conclusion came first. It was all worked backwards from there.

       No I mean what happens with you? Because things have been prophesied by the conspiracy community hundreds of times before and it never comes true. So what happens with you when this doesn't come true? Do you realize how silly and paranoid most of this is, or does is somehow miraculously reinforce your beliefs even further?

       Maybe to prevent people from getting mad, put "THEORY: .... " in the title of your post.  I assumed you were putting forward a theory, but others might see your title as the confident statement of a "fact".

       There is no pattern with the x Files though. That "prediction" wasn't in the x Files it was on a spin off show called the lone gunmen. So your link would be the writers of that show. The only person who wrote for both the new series and the pilot of the lone gunmen is Chris Carter. Let's look at what else he's written. Oh wow only one TV show in the 90s along with the x Files. So this member of the elite, whose been given the prestige of including the foretelling of the future in his show hasn't been good enough for them to work on anything else? How does that work? They trust him enough to tell him the future, but not enough to let him work on any of their other propaganda (because as I've learned from your post all media is controlled by the government)?  Doesn't add up to me at all, doesn't make sense. What does make sense is you're just pulling shit out of your ass and claiming it's gold. And yes I would imagine that the most powerful political entity in the world is acting in ways that aren't extremely obvious to stoner conspiracy theoriests.

       Nowhere in that article does it say that the government "leaned" on them to get it cancelled. She is talking about the way the country was after 9/11 and how it changed what people wanted to see on television and the absurd amount of patriotism going on. It also doesn't help that everyone hated the show now and the ratings were down. But go ahead and see whatever you want there I guess. It's a free country.
