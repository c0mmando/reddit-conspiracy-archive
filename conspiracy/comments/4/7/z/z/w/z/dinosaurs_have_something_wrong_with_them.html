    <div class="md"><p>Lots of lies and hidden things in our history, but for dinosaurs - instead of comparing to elephants, compare to a big bird. And really take a look at the size and weight of the vertebrae in the tail to help offset.</p>

<p>Note that they&#39;re still finding strange things and revising - like dinosaurs that didn&#39;t exist, they just mixed the bones of two different dinosaurs (i.e., the Brontosaurus), and I think recently there were feathers found with a dino (my theory since forever, it was cool to see some tiny piece of evidence).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The estimated weights of dinosaurs are based on what they would weigh if they existed on Earth <strong>today</strong>, but is the Earth&#39;s gravity the same as it was 60 million years&#39; ago? </p>

<p>If you take Argentinasaurus - the largest known dinosaur - its huge size gives it an estimated weight of up to 100 tonnes.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Largestdinosaursbysuborder_scale.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Largestdinosaursbysuborder_scale.png</a></p>

<p>Would the bones in its legs really have been able to deal with the enormous mass of its body if it were on Earth now? And look at the neck - can you imagine the gravitational stresses on a neck extended horizontally like that? Just try holding your arms out in front of you for 5 minutes to see what I mean. </p>

<p>Of course, if Argentinasaurus was a part aquatic animal, then like the whales of today, its body weight and neck weight would have been &quot;supported&quot; by water.</p>

<p>Finally, the Pterosaurs (flying lizards) are particularly interesting, because it is at best inconclusive that these huge creatures (up to 250kg) would be aerodynamically viable today. Was the atmosphere in the mesozoic much denser, more oxygen-rich than it is now, and/or was there less gravity? If not, how did these huge creatures generate enough lift to get off the ground?</p>

<p>yes.</p>

<p>that&#39;s the great thing about biomechanics. </p>

<p>Our arms have not evolved to be held out in front of us for long periods of time.</p>

<p>The same way most large soaring birds do.</p>
