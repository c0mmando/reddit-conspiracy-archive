<p>Also to add, and some of you will probably disagree here, but the DoD does a <em>huge</em> disservice to people who enlist or become soldiers in the military. </p>

<p>Think about it. What type of emotions do those commercials appeal to that demonstrate what happens when you serve? You are the hero. You&#39;re on the front line, defending democracy. You&#39;re there for your brothers and sisters, your family, your country. You are brave. You are the protagonist. This is the calling. It dupes some of the most courageous and bighearted Americans into fighting fraudulent wars. Of course there are assholes in the military. Everyone is an individual. Anecdotally, a lot of my family has served/is currently serving and I know people I went to high school with who are currently in and they are some of the most generous down to earth people. Believing they are doing something good.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we need to abolish the military. Every society needs a warrior class to survive. But there is no real enemy. Just bogeymen. </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the problem, if the government were to overtly use the military upon the populace... what soldier would really go along with it? All that pride, all that valor, all for the people you love and care for. It doesn&#39;t really compute for me. Maybe this is why they want to militarize police. Maybe that&#39;s jumping to conclusions. </p>

<p>They seem to want 13 out of every 14 living people dead according to the Georgia Guidestones, leaving about one half billion to serve their needs. They are using a myriad of slow kill methods so no one will be able to prove what is actually killing so many. 
 Here is a quick list of examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The use of hard power type totalitarian control has been tried, and there are still on-going experiments (such as North Korea), but I think the strategies have been adapted through trial and error.</p>

<p>The ruling class realized it was much better to obfuscate through politics and corporate ownership who actually owned everything while using soft power techniques to control instead.  The slaves don&#39;t rebel when they don&#39;t realize they are slaves.  The slaves don&#39;t know who to rebel against when they don&#39;t even know the names of their masters.</p>

<p>One of the most important topics to research is the history of information manipulation.  Learning about the specific techniques that are used to create public opinion is necessary in order to navigate the information we are presented with.  The mainstream media lies, but they are just the first level.  Controlling both sides is standard operating procedure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Resources. Not enough resources in place yet. A full clampdown would need the same kind of massive resources in place like what was needed in the USSR during the Stalin era.</p>

<p>Chances are they don&#39;t have the resources in place. At this point anyways. But as you see, the police are in the process of militarizing themselves equipment-wise more and more. Non-police agencies are arming themselves now more and more. </p>

<p>Once they have the resources in place, you never know. If they find themselves being challenged enough, they might have to crack down with both jackboots.</p>

<p>The trigger could be loss of control of Congress and/or the Senate or failure to get their guy in the White House. Or more likely, if they fail to get their guy in the White House and the President starts going against the Fed with overwhelming popular support.</p>

<p>So, the short answer is likely because they haven&#39;t had to and they don&#39;t have the resources in place. But if they have to, and they have the resources in place, we&#39;re toast.</p>

<p>Another aspect is that the populace is armed. Disarming the populace will be necessary at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is that a lot of the operators of those smart bombs, drones, and helicopters, not to mention tanks and boots on the ground, are unwitting pawns in this whole scheme, and would revolt at the idea that they were advancing the cause of global governance and the wholesale destruction of the sovereignty of their respective nations, especially in America. Research the Fabian Society. They figured out long ago that an insidious and gradual transition to collectivism was far more beneficial, and much less dangerous to them personally, than sudden and overt change.

<p>That sounds a lot like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bunch of sand packers with AK47s left over from the cold war is no match for smart bombs, drones, and helicopters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remind me again how quickly we completely vanquished the &#39;insurgents&#39; and &#39;terrorists&#39; and &#39;militants&#39; in the middle east... What&#39;s that? We haven&#39;t? Well, why is that? Oh, right. Because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare">asymmetric warfare</a> is highly effective against large, modern fighting forces.</p>

<p>Do you know what the difference between a hunter and a sniper is? A government backing him. <a href="http://gunwiki.net/Gunwiki/FactorsOfEffectiveRange">&quot;Maximum effective range&quot;</a> is actually kind of a bullshit guesstimate, but anyone who trains to kill living targets will train to within certain ranges depending on their rifle, choice of ammo, and choice of target. Let&#39;s call the average for that about 300 yards.</p>

<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of people with high-powered rifles out there. There are also <em>a lot</em> of people who would fight back against a government doing just that sort of overt evilness. They are very much outnumbered. Considering they&#39;d be fighting American citizens blending into crowds of other Americans, how effective do you think they&#39;d be at stopping every single assassination attempt? Remember, it only takes <em>one</em> lucky shot to take someone out.</p>

<p>Aside from that, that isn&#39;t even taking into account the fact that the American military would break apart if ordered to deploy against its citizens. You have to realize something about the makeup of the armed forces: an astonishingly large number of them are people who joined because it was the only option for them and come from the sort of background where, if you forced them to choose between their family and their government, they&#39;re going to choose their family every time.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be F16s and Apaches against a few rednecks with blunderbusses. It would be more than half the armed forces with all the resources and materials they could take <em>including</em> F16s, Apaches, Abrams, and so on, plus a bunch of &#39;rednecks&#39; with hunting rifles of equal or superior quality to military sniper rifles (yeah, there isn&#39;t much difference between the two. In fact, the military is forced to use NATO-approved FMJ rounds as opposed to hollow points designed to kill and maim, whereas those &#39;rednecks&#39; aren&#39;t going to be using 762 and 556 NATO).</p>

<p>So, you tell me, do you think it&#39;d be a better idea for the government to suddenly jar the citizens into action or go for the long, slow kill option?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree with many the points raised. The first counter off the top of my head would be that the police have seemingly been persuaded that they are at war with the civilian population in the US. They love to dress up and kill people over drugs and things that aren&#39;t worthy of a death sentence. Many cops are ex-military. So, it&#39;s really just opinion that the military would stick up for civilians. </p>
