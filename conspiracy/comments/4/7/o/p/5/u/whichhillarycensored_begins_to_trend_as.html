       You don't have to be brainwashed by 140 characters it's just another artificial metric to measure public opinion.  Then CNN, NBC, ABC and all those guys get to report about what's trending on the 24 hour news cycle.

       It might be more accurate to say that "they" use social media to brainwash the masses; this isn't to say that "they" are the same people who created the social media platform in the first place. Part of the "they" might be corporations; they certainly use the news media to brainwash the masses.

       It's comprehensive social engineering on the behalf of the collective top 1% of the population. You need more than one finger to make a fist. Combine this effort with news media, sports, and really just about all of the corporately owned media and you have a machine that keeps people content.

       Well,  I'd give you more information,  but all of my posts on it were deleted and I cant remember the entrance to the rabbit hole.   Basically,  one of the reddit founders holds a domain that fronts a cryptic (no listed info or contact information,  just a static sign like site) company that does something along the lines of an opinion  management.  The company name is linked to the CIA through documents leaked on wikileaks. (as I recall).  If you do look around and find anything,  let me know the name of the company.

       Newhouse Family owns reddit by the way. They own Advance Publications, which owns Conde Nast, which owns reddit. Something like that, but people like to try and obscure the relationship by saying the original admins maintain full control of reddit.

       They aren't idiots.  It's not backfiring.  This whole Hilary witch hunt is obviously fabricated.  Bernie is their man.  When he wins people will believe in the system for a while longer because they defeated big bad establishment Hilary.

       I see a lot of conspiracy theorists go by a guilty-until-proven-innocent approach when not enough data is present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would such large amounts of money be wasted on Hillary's campaign if Bernie was "their man"?  (Lots of use of "they" by the way)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people will agree that many Corporations (some tied to twitter) have a large stake in Hillary for her future support.  Support that they won't have if Bernie is elected.

      <p>
       The majority of Americans are seeing the propaganda that is displayed on major news networks that constantly show Hillary in a positive light.

       Perhaps because you are a Redditor and have an immediate bias towards trusting anything related to government, even this situation appears to be a false flag.

       the lesson then wouldn't be for you to troll on this forum it'd be to state facts here about Hillary and Bernie both. But you are kneejerk going nuts here cuz you do support Hillary. So you're actually the one pushing partisan politics here.

       I've read the complicated explanation of how Twitter s algorithm works. This was definitely censorship. They've been doing it more over the last month, silencing both conservatives and anti-Hillary tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be practical, why wouldn't they? It's hard to prove, and they have every incentive to do it. Twitter's a public company and their largest stake holder is Morgan Stanley, a major Clinton donor -
       <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/05/hillary-clinton-morgan-stanley-and-tpp-a-free-trade-triumvirate/">
        http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/05/hillary-clinton-morgan-stanley-and-tpp-a-free-trade-triumvirate/
       </a>
       On top of that, Twitter's top exec, Omid Kordestani held a fundraiser on Sunday. He's active in a Pro-Iranian organization, and he'd like to have someone in office who is on his side.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are not conspiracy theories. They're easy to verify and connecting the dots makes the motivation to censor clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, are we ok with companies controlling both the main stream media, and social media? If not, we should be pouring more money into Bernie's campaign and other progressive congressional candidates.
There's a Democratic Convention in San Jose on Sunday. We can go and tell them to stop censoring our voices. Rather than allowing them to defeat us, we should be channeling our frustration and anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell Intercept, Democracy Now and other independent outlets that they need to shine a light on this.

       Twitter did get $800 million from Russian Digital Sky.  Who knows, maybe that is connected to the fabulous deal she did as SoS for the Russians, getting them uranium mining rights. The Clintons are connected and moneyed up.

       Just noticed a pro-Hilary story pop up in my Facebook feed, thought one of my friends was the source but no, it was her official FB page. Now, I hardly ever subscribe to public figures and as a non-US based Bernie sympathiser wouldn't even think of following her. But checked the page just in case and PRESTO - I am a follower. Now, this is not just sneaky marketing, this is blatant manipulation for political gain. I think if this starts occurring more often, people are going to get mad. Asshole move, Zuckerberg...

       I'm not sure why anyone would treat those corporation in charge of media as a free speech platform. Twitter, Facebook, CNN, it's all the same. You don't have a right to access the platform, you are merely allowed. Until you say something that irritates the true customers, that is.

       It might be more accurate to say that "they" use social media to brainwash the masses; this isn't to say that "they" are the same people who created the social media platform in the first place. Part of the "they" might be corporations; they certainly use the news media to brainwash the masses.

       You don't have to be brainwashed by 140 characters it's just another artificial metric to measure public opinion.  Then CNN, NBC, ABC and all those guys get to report about what's trending on the 24 hour news cycle.

       They aren't idiots.  It's not backfiring.  This whole Hilary witch hunt is obviously fabricated.  Bernie is their man.  When he wins people will believe in the system for a while longer because they defeated big bad establishment Hilary.

       Also people like you will keep thinking the voice of the people is stronger than their propaganda attempts.  They're very very good at what they do.
