       . . . Most consumers are oblivious to the fact that Aspartame was invented as a drug but upon discovery of its’ sweet taste was magically transformed from a drug to a food additive. HFA wants to warn our readers to beware of a wolf dressed up in sheep’s clothing or in this case Aspartame dressed up as Aminosweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . Changing aspartame’s name to something that is “appealing and memorable”, in Ajinomoto’s own words, may hoodwink some but hopefully most will reject this clever marketing tactic as nothing more than a desperate attempt to preserve the company’s multi-billion dollar cash cow. Do not be deceived.

       Natural Society have been warning us to the dangers of Aspartame for some time. Aspartame is a very dangerous artificial sweetener found in many foods like soft drinks, chewing gum, breakfast cereals and jams. Now, Aspartame is being re-branded as AminoSweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aspartame is often a substitute to sugar and marketed as Nutrasweet or Equal. It is an excitotoxin that has harmful effects to the brain and body. Its use is controversial since the 1980s, when
       <strong>
        Donald Rumsfeld, CEO of Searle, pushed for its approval on the market.
       </strong>
       With the name being changed now, the FDA wants to fool many people to buy this product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Rumsfeld, from the White House to  G. D. Searle &amp; Company
Re-branding cannot make Aspartame (or AminoSweet) safe. The substance is produced using genetically modified bacteria in the USA, but
       <strong>
        according to a Monsanto source, the UK market doesn’t have to eat GMO bacteria excrement
       </strong>
       . Foods marketed as “low calorie” often contain GMO Aspartame even overseas. Aspartame is very dangerous and may cause blindness, cancer and brain tumors. If you need further proof of who is pushing this GMO excrement on the American people, Mr. Rumsfeld went on to become George W. Bush’s Secretary of Defense, and his agenda-pusher. So why does the FDA simply re-brand and not ban such a dangerous substance, or better yet, why doesn’t it rename it into “Sickeningly Sweet”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Saccharin before had to be made with a label mandated by Congress which said: “Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals”.
       <strong>
        Dr. Adrian Gross, the FDA’s toxicologist, told the Congress that Aspartame definitely causes brain tumors and brain cancer and that it violated the Delaney Amendment. Besides cancer, aspartame has been linked with the following diseases:

       Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle &amp; Company. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate.[19] He accidentally discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper.

        Formaldehyde Exposure
       </strong>
       .
       <em>
        The formaldehyde exposure from aspartame is significant. Aspartame breaks down into methanol, amino acids and several other chemicals. The methanol is quickly absorbed and converted into formaldehyde. The methanol found in foods and alcoholic beverages is also absorbed, but there are "protective chemicals" in these traditionally-ingested foods and beverages that prevent the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "It was a very interesting paper, that demonstrates that
formaldehyde formation from aspartame ingestion is very
common and does indeed accumulate within the cell,
reacting with cellular proteins (mostly enzymes) and
DNA (both mitochondrial and nuclear). The fact that it
accumulates with each dose, indicates grave consequences
among those who consume diet drinks and foodstuffs on a
daily basis."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Some of the many aspartame toxicity symptoms reported include seizures, headaches, memory loss, tremors, convulsions, vision loss, nausea, dizziness, conufsion, depression, irritability, anxiety attacks, personality changes, heart palpitationns, chest pains, skin diseases, loss of blood sugar control, arthritic symptoms, weight gain (in some cases), fluid retention, excessive thirst or urination. Clearly, regular exposure to a toxic substance such as formaldehyde may worsen, or in some cases contribute to the development of chronic diseases.

       Whether aspartame is bad for you or not, it really hurts your argument when you use words like (while technically correct) "GMO excrement". If you want to inform people, you want to avoid using strong words like this, you could turn off anyone reading this who doesn't have the same stance on GMO's while he/she could actually be interested in the aspartame subject. Just stay with the facts, don't try to be " witty" with stuff like this. It's already hard enough to find reliable information :)

       Why Are Americans Becoming Wary of Aspartame?
      </p>
      <p>
       As more research links aspartame to health risks, increasing numbers of people are looking to avoid it in their diets. That's why Pepsi was proactive in removing it from their diet soda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved aspartame for use in dry foods in 1981 and as a general artificial sweetener in 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike other artificial sweeteners that move through the body without being digested, aspartame can be metabolized by your body and exerts a number of concerning effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, aspartame has been found to increase hunger ratings compared to glucose or water and is associated with heightened motivation to eat (even more so than other artificial sweeteners like saccharin or acesulfame potassium).4
      </p>
      <p>
       For a substance often used in "diet" products, the fact that aspartame may actually increase weight gain is incredibly misleading. Aspartame also exerts changes on the microbial composition in your gut, the consequences of which are unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, emerging evidence suggests gut microbes play a role in metabolic diseases that aspartame is known to increase, pointing to alteration of gut microbial composition as one of its mechanisms of harm. According to research published in PLOS One:5
      </p>
      <p>
       "Regular consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks is associated with disorders of the metabolic syndrome, including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and/or impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia and high blood pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, daily diet soda consumption (primarily sweetened with N-a-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, aspartame, APM), is reported to increase the relative risk of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome by 67 percent and 36 percent respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given this data, and the presence of APM in over 6000 food products, there is a need to understand the potential role of APM sweetened products in the development and maintenance of metabolic disease."
