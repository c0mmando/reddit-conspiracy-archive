       It seems the media is the one pushing all of the conspiracy innuendos.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, we see the info about the pillow.  Was it above his head, over his head, or over his face?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, we have the story about Scalia spending his last hours with a secret society that is an offshoot of Bohemian Grove and that thinks they can tell the local Sherrif where he has jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we have a story about Dow paying out nearly a billion dollars because the death of Scalia changes their case prospects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing about it all is that r/conspiracy doesn't seem to be biting!  No one has really even attempted to forge a theory in such ripe and fertile details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that weird?

       When Scalia died, there was one website that immediately called it a hit by the Bush family, by Skull and Bones. Abreu Report dug into this, and the media is extremely afraid because that news site is run by a Yale graduate who is connected to Skull and Bones. I think we're looking at a civil war between secret societies.

       Alex Jones has been leading every show this week with the Scalia death story. Joe Biggs brought back pictures of Satanic statues from the ranch and that forced WaPo to admit it was connected to "secret societies". Here's the article from yesterday:

       The media always mentions "John Poindexter, owner of the ranch".
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, these stories never mention that John Poindexter is a retired DoD official, National Security Advisor under Reagan, convicted of multiple felonies as a result of his action in the Iran Contra affair, and head of DARPA Information Awareness Office during the Bush Jr. administration.

       Question #1: Did a death occur?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see multiple theories about the death of a person bandied about in the mainstream it is very likely to be a technique to convince you that the person died.  It doesn't matter that the theories conflict, as long as they all begin with the presumption that a death occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what evidence is there that he is actually dead and didn't just decide to retire with this as the cover story?

       He could just like....retire the normal way, without all the death-faking...he doesn't seem like the type to attempt insurance fraud, so why fake it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think that an old guy died and that sometimes, there isn't a conspiracy, stuff just happens.

       age 79, either died of natural causes or murdered due to election year and a tied SCOTUS being preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
       the no matter what thing is that 11% of the third branch of govt just died, an autopsy should happen no matter how benign his/her death appears to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       an automatic autopsy for top official by credible MEs would discourage people knocking off the SCOTUS or similar high ranking govt officials.

       The possible motivations for faking a death are varied.  Insurance fraud is only one.  If his death was faked it may not have been his own choice.  It is very difficult to speculate here since the world of a supreme court judge is not something familiar to most people.  We have no idea how he viewed his own position and what influences were exerted on him.  Also, a lack of understanding of motivation is not evidence against an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just saying that it is a mistake to take as a given that he is dead.  It is very suspicious when you have multiple controlled media sources giving various possible theories on his death.  It quickly moves focus beyond the question of the death occurring at all because it creates the appearance of a spectrum of opinions.  You are encouraged to pick one and cheer along.

       Rubio is eligible due to his Florida birth, Cruz is Canadian born therefore the two top jobs are not for him.

       I agree, the Washington Post has a LENGTHY article about Scalia was with a "secret society" called the International Order of St. Hubertus, right before he died. I know several members and there is nothing secret about them other than, they probably have too much money and time, are typically trust fund ranchers and real estate kings here stateside and they hate their families enough to create an "order" to have an excuse to get away from them and drink and shoot rifles and fish as much as possible, lol

       True, it's like European countries going to war, where the monarchy never get touched. But if monarchs themselves started killing each other, then it'd be full blown game of thrones.
