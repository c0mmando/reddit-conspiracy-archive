        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems the media is the one pushing all of the conspiracy innuendos.  </p>

<p>First, we see the info about the pillow.  Was it above his head, over his head, or over his face? </p>

<p>Then, we have the story about Scalia spending his last hours with a secret society that is an offshoot of Bohemian Grove and that thinks they can tell the local Sherrif where he has jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a story about Dow paying out nearly a billion dollars because the death of Scalia changes their case prospects.</p>

<p>The funny thing about it all is that r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t seem to be biting!  No one has really even attempted to forge a theory in such ripe and fertile details.  </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that weird? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question #1: Did a death occur?</p>

<p>When you see multiple theories about the death of a person bandied about in the mainstream it is very likely to be a technique to convince you that the person died.  It doesn&#39;t matter that the theories conflict, as long as they all begin with the presumption that a death occurred.</p>

<p>So, what evidence is there that he is actually dead and didn&#39;t just decide to retire with this as the cover story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The possible motivations for faking a death are varied.  Insurance fraud is only one.  If his death was faked it may not have been his own choice.  It is very difficult to speculate here since the world of a supreme court judge is not something familiar to most people.  We have no idea how he viewed his own position and what influences were exerted on him.  Also, a lack of understanding of motivation is not evidence against an idea.</p>

<p>I am just saying that it is a mistake to take as a given that he is dead.  It is very suspicious when you have multiple controlled media sources giving various possible theories on his death.  It quickly moves focus beyond the question of the death occurring at all because it creates the appearance of a spectrum of opinions.  You are encouraged to pick one and cheer along.  </p>
