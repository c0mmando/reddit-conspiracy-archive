<p>I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I&#39;m scared shitless.
I&#39;m sure you all went through the same process as I did - I learned about one theory, it sparked my interest in others, annd here I am years later believing I know the insides and outs of the CIA and the NWO and all the connections and history in between.
We watch these videos and read all these articles, and the theories all make sense - until you tell your friends of family and they tell you you&#39;re an idiot or out of your mind.
now that things are getting more tense and slightly coming out - what if people don&#39;t believe the accusations? the CIA came up with a 30 page report that the freaking director dismissed the next day... does that not raise any flags? are we that sucked in and brainwashed by our society? we used to be the envy of the world and now I&#39;m convinced that us being assholes is gonna start a nuclear war within the next decade.</p>

<p>i just want to open a discussion on what all of your thoughts are.. how you&#39;re planning on handling whats coming orrrr if you don&#39;t even think that we as civilians are in danger</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Transcendental knowledge is knowledge pertaining to the &quot;self&quot; or the &quot;seer&quot; which is transcendent to worldly phenomena (the &quot;seen&quot;)</p>

<p>It fosters detachment from one&#39;s current position and offers self-satisfaction in any condition at its perfection.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example from one such book on transcendental knowledge (Bhavagad-Gita): </p>

<p>&quot;The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change. O son of KuntÄ«, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed. Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have concluded by studying the nature of both.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From that chapter:</p>

<p>&quot;Not by merely abstaining from action can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection. All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment. One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender. Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction. A man cannot even maintain his physical body without work. Therefore, O Arjuna, <strong>fight</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, this text takes place on a battlefield. The main character would be burned alive if he did nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what the passages mean:</p>

<p>defend that which you are borne out of--your mother, your father, your family, and the home which you make for yourself, but do not be afraid when blood must be shed, because sometimes it must be in order for order to be maintained.</p>

<p>order in this sense means peace within each respective community (like the warring tribes of india).</p>

<p>when gautama sat below the tree, he faced demons of fear, lust, and pride (i believe). when he was confronted, all he did was meditate and ignore the god who provoked him. then a snake goddess (a symbol of earth, medicine, rebirth, creative energy, death, life, continuity) came to scare the offending god away.</p>

<p>so imagine you are buddha, sitting under the tree. a whole army of bureaucratic voices are buzzing away at TV sets all around you. what do you do?</p>

<p>you turn them off. you make sure that you are able to defend and feed yourself, if circumstances become heavy. then you enjoy everything you love to enjoy, and live however you&#39;d like to live. have faith in the courage of others, because humans become superheroes in times of dire stress and confusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the nice clarification and interpretation. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to lend some specifics as well. The power that currently holds this world and its people is a power of fear, greed, anger, and vanity. By actively removing these things from your life, you weaken that power&#39;s hold over the world and your fellow man.</p>

<p>The last thing that power wants is for you to express love and contentment in your life, so try to do just that. Enjoy what you have, love those you are with, and strive to make life beautiful in the ways you know how. If you try this, you will eventually transform the world around you into something you did not expect. If many people try this, the entire Earth will eventually be transformed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I have come to believe that this will all end the same way it always has throughout history. That is, with a lot of bloodshed and violence. We will reach that point when the situation becomes insufferable for the general populace and enough people have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>What will set off this chain of events? Nobody can say for sure. It may be a gradual escalation or there may be one big game-changing event.</p>

<p>It would be nice to think that peaceful change through people holding hands and singing &quot;kumbayah&quot; is possible, but true, lasting, meaningful change from something like that is unlikely. The main reason being that the government is more than willing to escalate violence in all situations to get its way. It is willing to have a literal fight to the death for the preservation of its power, so even though the average person does not want that, those in power will force their hands.</p>

<p>There is a caveat to this though.  In about 10 years <strong>all</strong> blue collar jobs will be taken over by robots.  Farming, trucking, driving, assembly line stuff, construction jobs, retail jobs, and fast food.  The entire lower class will be displaced with no skills.  People will say, &quot;those people will just be turned into the people who fix the robots..&quot;  Nope.  There will be robots that fix the robots too.</p>

<p>The really scary part is AI (artificial intelligence) will getting to a point where Engineering jobs will also be replaced with robots.  There goes the middle class.</p>

<p>Robots are great from a business owner&#39;s perspective.  They don&#39;t require bathroom breaks, health insurance, sleep, food, and salary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to say.  I would have thought they would have just killed off the masses for depopulation, but instead it looks like they are just going to make the lower and middle classes obsolete.  They would have to implement a living wage, but that is super silly talk.  All these robots would essentially be working only for the upper class.  Damn, <a href="http://qz.com/520907/stephen-hawking-robots-arent-just-taking-our-jobs-theyre-making-society-more-unequal/">Steven Hawking</a> was right.</p>

<p><em>Have you thought of âtechnological unemployment,â where machines take all our jobs?</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.&quot;</em></p>

<p>A future where wealth is equally distributed is the same as a fairy tale.  It will never happen.  Not unless there is some civil war between the classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next step in the rabbit hole is the evolution of our consciousness. The whole goal of these experiences is to learn to live without fear, so we can break free from this matrix and take our rightful place as creators in the universe.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? It is two-fold, first respond to shit hitting the fan in the way you think is most appropriate (non-violence is really the only qualification I think is necessary, beyond that, you do you) and do it BOLDLY.</p>

<p>I&#39;m preparing myself right now. I&#39;ve written a book that is gaining traction, <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil">released for free,</a> and I plan on standing up to each and every event, publicly to show people that it is possible. </p>

<p>A faith in God is important. Physicists such as Nassim Haramein are revealing the structure of the universe to be tied to sacred geometry, with the densest energy packing being <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/38/ee/6538eecc1f0e3b018666d262b6108202.jpg">the flower of life structure</a>. Each circle has inherent to its being, infinity, through pi. There is infinite information stored in the smallest possible existence. Infinity demands the existence of God, and by extension, the structure of the universe must be composed of God himself if there is infinite energy (information) in each dot. </p>

<p>It is easy to be fearless when you understand that God composes the universe, we are a stanza in a grand divine poem, a movement in a divine symphony, and though there are white and black keys on the keyboard, when played together it produces beautiful music. There is nothing to fear because every moment is a divine experience.</p>

<p>Once we grasp this and internalize it, our experiences begin to change, and our consciousness begins to expand. I work with autistic people, and some of them have a fourth dimensional consciousness. I&#39;m not yet able to describe exactly what this means, it is related to depth, motion and divisions of consciousness, and I am teaching them to overcome their own fear and to let these beautiful, profound experiences they are having flow freely.</p>

<p>When the shift happens, and shit hits the fan, a grand injection of energy will take place in this matrix, allowing us to accomplish miracles and have profound experiences that will make us realize how truly ASLEEP we have been, and push us forward towards the next step in the evolution of consciousness, beyond the physical. </p>

<p>My personal life has transformed tremendously, I am experiencing powerful synchronicity and beautiful experiences every day, as well as having all the financial safety I need from outside the control system, since internalizing this.</p>

<p>Obviously not the response most skeptical people are looking for :) But I think this will all become clear quite soon for those who are awake to the possibility.</p>

The way you talk about your process of &quot;waking up&quot; leading you to a more and more conspiratorial worldview gives me the feeling you might appreciate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2939ap/its_been_more_than_a_year_since_edward_snowden/cih651z?context=3">this series of posts</a> (there are hyperlinks at the end of the first post that lead to more posts)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difficulty is sorting out what is larger conspiracy (something planned) and things which happen &#39;naturally&#39; because of how people are (greedy, selfish, and so on).</p>

<p>We know, for example, that companies hire lobbyists to promote their own self interest over the common good. And that people are not upset about that and doing more is telling. In fact, some people cheer this on because they see profit as the single goal of companies - often ignoring that we the people pay for the roads, defense, etc of said companies and would like a return on our investment as well.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable, at all, to believe that there are some people with a lot of money and power who operate on the idea of doing what is in their best interest. From rigging elections, creating laws, paying off judges, helping to create conflict, and so on.</p>

<p>Proving it and getting something done about it almost never happens - so some folks just refuse to believe it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think sometimes it is just willful ignorance and the old &quot;Well, nothing we can do about it.&quot;</p>

<p>You see legislation come down the pike that you know will benefit a large company and unduly burden their competition and no one seems to care. But if someone was pushing legislation to change tv ratings or adjust food stamps and suddenly people get involved.</p>

<p>If it doesn&#39;t directly affect them in an identifiable and easy to understand way they don&#39;t care. When you can show how a conspiracy directly impacts them in a way they understand they will pay more attention. 9/11 stuff people don&#39;t seem to care about because it happened a long time ago and &#39;nothing you can about it now&#39;.</p>

<p>PS if I am slow to reply it is because some folks downvoted me in this sub to -5, which means I now I have a timer set (5 min between posts). Seems rather silly.</p>

<p>Make peace with yourself. Then others in your life. Live each day like it&#39;s your last. When GLOBAL CIVILIZATION collapses, go out the way you want to, and avoid all the choas. Anyone prepping will probably be targeted first. </p>

<p>Be it nuclear war, generated &quot;natural&quot; disasters, weaponized satellites or viruses or the actual religious End of Days, just go out however your soul says is its surrender of this physical plain. Me and the dog are heading to the woods. My dysfunctional family knows my heart. My religious leaders know my faults. My government knows my &quot;secrets&quot;. My close friends know I will go my own way and will try to emphasize <em>don&#39;t panic</em>, if we get the chance to see each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NationalLibertyAlliance.org has been organizing an effort to restore our common law courts nationwide, and may be the biggest liberty group in the country.  They&#39;re nearly ready to make the push to get the kind of courts we were always supposed to have back in our courthouses, they&#39;re asking people in their areas to meet with their Sheriffs to show them the law and gain their support, and they could certainly use your assistance.  Listening to their Weekly Call will give you a sense of what they&#39;re like and how they operate.</p>

<p>With the common law courts of, by, and for the People restored, we&#39;ll again be able to hold legislators, law enforcement, corporations and anyone else accountable to law and we&#39;ll be able to uphold our rights.</p>

<p>There is also the lawful militia effort, but I don&#39;t have the contact details for that.  Oath Keepers probably would.</p>

<p>NLA will need four common law jury administrators in each county for the forming of jury pools, has most of those already, trains people for them for free via their site, and claims to have money sources to make these paid positions once they&#39;re back in the courthouses.  Good information to have for freedom-minded individuals who are seeking regular work pulling the country back together.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve also recently started forming Committees of Safety - which have a historical precedent - to keep things functional in the kind of difficult scenarios the OP had referenced.</p>

<p>There&#39;s talk of a big dollar collapse. The general tips are (1) move out of the city into the countryside, (2) stock up on the provisions (food, guns, ammo etc.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting out if I can manage it in time.  You&#39;re better off in Gaul than Rome when the Vandals arrive.  Many of the wealthy are realizing the same.  Things will be get pretty dark here, if things do collapse.  I&#39;m not totally convinced things are beyond repair, that a true revolutionary moment is an impossibility.  However remote that possibility things might change for the better, or more or less stay the same with the larger arc bending in the &quot;right&quot; way, and in that case I&#39;m okay with going along with things as long as I feel like things are bending a bit in the right direction.  Otherwise, I&#39;m out.  If things do down quick, then I&#39;ll probably do what we&#39;ll all do, try to stay alive as long as possible, and hopefully find like minded people to band together with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a civilian, the best thing you can do is prepare, and assume that whatever is coming you will have to rely on yourself alone for a while. The big 4 are food, water, lead and meds.</p>

<p>One of the other ways I take action is by keeping my money away from the banks -- gold, silver, bitcoin, et al comprise my savings account instead of a traditional 401k, C.D., etc. This gives the institution less control over my financial affairs during the next GFC.</p>

<p>Godspeed to you in the coming storm. And welcome to the group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know im going to be downvoted, but you&#39;ve ultimately realized nothing. People have been saying this same exact shit for decades now. End of times preachers have been saying it for thousands of years. You dont know something the majority of people dont.  Just because youve read some articles by people completely unqualified in any way doesnt mean you &quot;get it&quot;. </p>

<p>This is not a meaningful epiphany. Those videos you watch are just as hollow and meaningless as the dozens of conspiracy magazines from the 70s and 80s that hardly anyone remembers and basically have little to no record of anywhere. This aint a new thing by any means. </p>

<p>Do you think the end of the world is coming because some preachers said it was going to?</p>
