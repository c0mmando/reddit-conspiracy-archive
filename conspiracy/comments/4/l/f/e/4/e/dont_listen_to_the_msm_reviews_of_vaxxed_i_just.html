    <div class="md"><p>The diagnosis for everything has increased because we now know how to diagnose stuff way better than we did in the 30&#39;s. You also have to look into what the mother has put into her body when she was pregnant with the child. There are a lot of factors for a child to develop autism. But it is something that they are born with. It is not contracted out of the womb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The definition of what is autism has also changed in the psychological manuals in that time, leading to much of the increase in diagnosis.  The same correlation has been seen in dozens of other diagnoses.  I&#39;ll be excited when I see more than a handful of reports bought and paid for by the big money Hollywood anti-vaxx crew. They are just as corrupt as the government shills they are fighting against and they reinterpret data just as poorly.  Follow the money and you find new age gurus advocating for their patented line of herbal remedies in place of MMR and other vaccinations, lawyers paying for data interpretation to lend credibility to frivolous lawsuits, and Hollywood movie stars linking their pockets from their hastily created &quot;charities&quot; devoted to &quot;the children&quot;.  Oh won&#39;t you just think of the children?!  It&#39;s a sham from both ends, government and guru alike.</p>

<p>Conversely, one could always explain an increase in disease rates by saying detection has improved. However, this is not a good go-to explanation since it is second guessing a positive observation without having reasonable evidence to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend next to cried half the movie. What people don&#39;t understand is, this is not an anti-vaccine movie, it&#39;s an anti-corporate corruption movie. And seeing the corruption is heart-breaking.</p>

<p>There&#39;s this one scene where the mother is insisting to a nurse on the phone that the vaccine hurt her child (Went from normal to autistic overnight)...and the nurse kept saying &quot;No, no, she&#39;s fine.&quot; And after insisting more, the nurse says &quot;Maybe you&#39;re not fit to take care of your child.&quot; Threatened to call child protection services. Scary...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>trump is the conspiracy candidate sold by wall street as an outsider, funding disinfo and endorsing it is an easy way to occupy most &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as a lot of them buy this sort of stuff. don&#39;t know if he&#39;s done it yet or not but I&#39;ll bet he&#39;ll soon say saudi arabia did 9/11 and we should nuke them or some shit on that level.</p>

<p>don&#39;t know why they think this is a viable strategy to get someone elected. then again there are a lot of idiots in the US, for all I know it could work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be that as it may.</p>

<p>A year ago I made a comment that Trump was being cast as the villain until the real Republican candidate comes forward. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>You are wrong about several things, and we can argue about that for several comments. Or, who else? If there is no one better, and someone is going to be president, then perhaps you should be quiet.</p>

<p>Not about Trump, you can hate him all you want, but about mentioning him in this thread and trying to discredit both him and the filmmakers and whistleblower and the researchers in one go.</p>
