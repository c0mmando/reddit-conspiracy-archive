    <div class="md"><p>Threads like this just go to prove how well Conspiracy Theory works. People have been talking about this stuff since before Bill was molesting interns with cigars, and yet it seems most of those talking about it now are finding out about it for the first time. Bury the story until people forget and make what they remember look silly.</p>

<p>It is odd that stuff like this doesn&#39;t have more prominence in this sub. It gets attention, of course, but I would have thought there&#39;d be much more considering it&#39;s a well-established topic with obvious relevance to today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about what kind of message it would send to people inside the organization if the Clintons and bodyguards were CIA.</p>

<p>That the organization can&#39;t control its political assets and that its agents are killed in droves and regarded as completely disposable to keep this boat floating and that they can&#39;t stop some legal issues cleaner?</p>

<p>Does this make any sense to you?</p>

<p>P.S. All under the assumption that this list is to a large degree valid.</p>
