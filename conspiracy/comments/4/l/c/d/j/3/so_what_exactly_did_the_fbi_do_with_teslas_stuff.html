       Im just curious. the guy interests me, but I doubt a lot of the things people say about him (even though he was brilliant, I feel that we have more than exceeded his knowledge by this time period)
      </p>
      <p>
       still the fact that the fbi confiscated his things upon death irks/scares me a bit. I mean what the fuck was really there?
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, his most important stuff was committed to memory only, but something of value or importance to someone must have been in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       they would only take it if something could be used by themselves, enemies, or be hidden/exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       but by this point it cant be that bad where they'd still hide it if anyone bitched too loudly about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       unless he really had created free energy or some shit.
but I doubt thats possible, without at least what we have today or even greater technology. the precision to make such complex machines would be insane, and require a lot of things (probably like nanotech) to even be plausable, even by a genius of his level. the materials he had to work with wouldve been severely lacking compared to labs today.
      </p>
      <p>
       but something, something HAD to be in there. even if it wasnt the death ray, or something. I feel like wahtever it was is probably important.

       One popular theory is that he invented a way to make it so that the output of his Wardenclyffe tower was greater than the input, and also could be transmitted wirelessly. So essentially if you put in 1000kw through the tower, you could transmit 1000kw to New York, and ALSO 1000kw to Hong Kong. The implications of this are vast. No more fossil fuels, cars that run wirelessly on electricity requiring no charge. Carefully placed "nodes" around major cities and along roadways could ensure abundant energy wherever you go, no charging, no cords. Imagine the industries of control that would collapse if this technology was released.

       if this is true, there really are psychotic greed and torture worshipping demons ruling the earth craving nothing but hedonism.
      </p>
      <p>
       why prevent the worlds problems from being solved for your own wealth... it would mean more happiness, and hedonism for everyone in  general.

      <p>
       the motivation to have such greed is beyond me. I understand wanting something. but there would be no need for greed if there was no need for want or scarcity.

       You have a good heart, but the people in charge don't see it this way.  Greed doesn't mean just having abundance. It means having

       It's not Greed it's about Control. A technology like that loose in the wild would unleash the general populace. They much rather want them plugged into a grid that can be shut off at any time.

       I think Tesla's problem was he was born in a time where money is/was more important that human progress.  Edison wanted to put a meter on the technology and charge people for it. Tesla went straight to free wireless energy.  Made sense to him, but not for the economics of his time. That's the problem with capitalism.  You have to milk a technology in long drawn out stages over time to maximize your profits.  They wouldn't go from an iPhone 1 to an iPhone 6 in next version.

       Shit, I remember being in Paris back in 1999.  They had those

        cards with chips

        The waiter would even walk up to the table with a little hand held card reader/receipt printer.

       You would just slide your card in and enter your pin. Bam!  Done.  WTF isn't this in restaurants in the USA 16 years later?  Makes me wonder if we could really have flying cars by now.

       Then why do the criminal psychopaths tend to do so well in this system? Serious question, not trying to start a pissing match. The first answer that comes to my mind is the collusion of government and corporate power, known by another name as "fascism".
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the reason the criminal psychopaths tend to do so well is that we live, not in a capitalist system, but in a fascist system, and an increasingly global one at that. I would even go so far to say that you can't have a truly free market so long as government exists.

       J.P Morgan was funding all Tesla's research, they came in and took it all. What I find interesting is Tesla invented an earthquake machine that uses frequency to cause the earthquake. Do we know of any type of antenna array that is similar? Oh yes we do, HARRP!! I believe that Tesla's earthquake machine is the one and only HARRP, which uses frequency to change the weather...
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Tesla's free energy does exist! He did invent it and it was all taken away because J.P. Morgan is a fossil fuel man!

       Well if we didn't believe the word of inventors nothing would ever get created. J.P. Morgan came in and took all his research in the middle of the night, and Tesla die of a mysterious blood clot...Question everything my friend. Also look into Rudolf Diesel's mysterious death as well....

       So let me get this straight--your interpretation of "question everything" is to believe Tesla's physically impossible claims on his word alone and without evidence?

       I haven't. I take it you have, or have at least looked at wikipedia for that amount of time, yet you still haven't provided me with any positive verification of these claims. Where is the evidence that Tesla was able to create earthquakes and create free energy?

       I believe that a lot of his work would still be quite relevant for today, even if it was a "primitive" design , they could update the technology like they have with the car, or whatever. We still use things that were invented in the past, we just update the way we apply them.

       I believe it was confiscated under the national security act, or maybe its WWII predecessor, under the pretext that his next-of-kin was a Soviet Marxist, which he apparently really was. You cannot get at it during the current national-security/COG state regime.

       After watching a doco that was linked here a few days ago, but has since been removed from YouTube, I am inclined to say that the classic 1950s flying saucer may be a Tesla invention and that modern triangular UFOs are an evolution of same. I'm not sure the doco even mentioned Tesla, but it made the case that the those particular UFOs are electric anti-gravity vehicles, flown by the USAF, that produce a kind of Alcubierre effect and are of a very Earthly origin. The timeline fits perfectly: within a decade of confiscating his research people were reporting UFOs on a regular basis, just as they had been reporting them on an irregular basis ever since the turn of the century when he apparently patented a flying saucer.

       Sadly you're rather misinformed.
Which i guess is my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very simple concept and it's truth can be easily buried through misinformation.

       There is no reason to believe that any useful information can't be easily made useless, through a disinformation campaign.
