       We're both the treads on the track of the economic machine helping to move it ever-forward;  and we are also the investors that help grow said machine by the convenient mechanisms of  financial instruments (such as stocks/bonds) that create a plausible deniability for people to
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       know the wrongful ethical impact of and the financial incentivization to do evil created by their investments.

       Translation:  "I just bought vanguard mutual fund because it's a good investement".  You don't think about how Monsanto, General Motors, BP Oil and such are part of this portfolio and you would never, ever invest in those because of their misdeeds.  But you don't have time, so you just had Charlie use dividends from apple to buy more Vanguard.  You dont' care.  You don't investigate.  You don' t want to know or investigate.  You don't have time.....

       You treat financials like an appliance or an experience--a black box.  You just want an admission ticket to more money.

       I see the gov as a subsidiary of all other corps. Why do politicians do what they do? Bribes. Who pays them bribes? Corupt corps. Why do the corrupt corps have all the moeny to bribe with? We the people of the USA spend 11 TRILLION dollars per year on consumer goods. (70% GDP)
      </p>
      <p>
       If we stop giving the corps all the money/power, they might not be able to bribe as much.

       General boycott hits them where it hurts, their bottom lines. Simultaniously all your extra time/money/power that you are now not spending on keeping up with the Jonses' can be used to improve your life directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think back to GoDaddy supporting SOPA. Reddit got a boycott going and in 48 hours GoDaddy changed their lieing tune. Money talks, bullshit walks.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple example of this would be installing a garden and orchard today for a few dollars and some labor. In the future you can access dollar-free food while simultaniously starving the beast that is Big Ag.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great thing about boycotts are that they do not threaten they boycotter. For example in a strike, you put your livelyhood on the line. In a boycott you can not lose. If there is soe kind of mandated spending (ala healthcare) it will work to show people the true nature of the ponzi.
      </p>
      <p>
       By general boycott I mean keep paying your taxes and mortgage, it is no good going to jail, but cut out all the middle-class stuff that literally finance the whole shit show. Use all those dollars as efficiently as possible to improve your life in some way directly. Find something you spend money on regularly and try to solve it once and for all.

       You got it.  Freemasons working with lots of local mafias like ny italian families the southern dixie mafia, the west coast gangs; people within masonry and other related organizations like jesuitical knights of malta (supermasons) embedded in intelligence and police orgs that facilitate the movement of drugs, guns, humans (trafficking), other contraband.   People like Ted Gundersen retired FBI chief exposed this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We find these pedo rings and who does it turn out to be?  The foxes guarding the henhouses--the FBI and police...  Every fucking time.  Well, sometimes clergy, coaches, fashion/film people.  Clergy are often spooks--as a nice cover, it gets them easy access to countries and other foreign national politicos with less hassle than anyone.  This clergy-spook connection was exposed by peter levenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesuit's job is specifically to be a clergyspook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call the whole ball of wax the 'in-network'  because certainly you and I ...to quote carlin, it's a big club and you (and I) ain't in it.  Be thankful.
