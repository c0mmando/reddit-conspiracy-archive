       Jean Monnet, like many of the founding fathers of the European superstate, did not hide his federalist ambitions.

       Today, politicians and the media are much less open about the real purpose of the European Union. Instead, we are bombarded with constant fear propaganda about the "uncertainty" of independence, and millions of Britons are being manipulated to vote "Remain" on June 23, without understanding that they are voting to perpetuate their own enslavement to an undemocratic European superstate.

       Since OP conveniently omitted posting a source on this quote Let me bring some clarity here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Jean Monnet, founding father of the ECSC, has often wrongly had the following apocryphal lines attributed to him:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Europe’s nations should be guided towards the super-state without their people understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In fact, these weren’t Monnet’s words at all – but those of the Conservative politician and author, Adrian Hilton, in The Principality and Power of Europe, published in 1997. Yet this is almost by the by. That so many have ascribed the quote to Monnet is because so many have been so shocked at what the European project has since become.

       Federation would be good,  they aren't even suggesting that, what their suggesting is Soviet Union style , no borders between states ,every state would be the same multicultural shithole and with a leader "chosen by god knows who". This is literally the 2nd try for communism(UBI) in Europe and we need to fucking leave it immediately.

       All those tens of thousands rioting in France for the last few only have to go and snatch up about a 100 key people and they would get it all resolved.

       Instead they're burning up their own cars, neighborhoods, and fighting with pawn cops which is pointless because the 1% will keep circumventing everything to get what they want

       yeah i know, that's what I meant; the french citizens really only need to grab about 100 people via direct house visits and round em up in a prison camp, while taking over the Gov via a coup, and they'd get what they want over night.

       Then why did many leading communists and intellectuals of the day praise Stalin's Russia and Mao's China? Other than Trotskyists no one seriously suggested they weren't. Only when the scope and depth of their crimes was revealed did people start going "oh, they weren't
       <strong>
        really
       </strong>
       communist or socialist".
      </p>

       is unabashedly pro Stalin/Mao/Kim, which is kind of ironic considering their SJW stance and the fact these guys ruthlessly opposed it denouncing it as western decadence. Stalin was the one that re-criminalized homosexuality after all.

       Because most of those crimes are western propaganda. Stalin's kill count they always claim is innocent civilians was the count of Nazi's/soldiers/and criminals put to death. Maos? It was a farming plague. But regardless, both those regimes could not achieve full socialism due to capitalist pressure and wartime economy practices. Both started out okay, Russia and China were feudal shit countries before, and transformed to a major industrialized world power in a ridiculously short span after turning towards socialism.

       Neither of those assertions support the claim that the USSR was a successful communist country.

       Communist countries have never actually existed because the concept of a communist state is an oxymoron. Calling your country communist does not make your country communist, don't let names like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fool you.

       Of every country claiming to be communist, none of them have ever achieved a stateless classless society, an impossible requirement for communism.

       So how does Capitalism work?

       What was 1882, 1893 1929? 2008? I could list a 50 more examples of when Capitalism failed, and required heavy governmental intervention.

       Telling someone to educate themselves, then links to a blog from a person that can't even be bother to cite the work is fucking hilarious.

       I should point that that Keynesian policies were never instituted until AFTER the Great Depression. So yah Captialism has failed multiple times before Keynes was even fucking alive. You keep believing what you want though.

       Was it 'true communism' when the Soviet Union turned on their anarchist and socialist brethren during the Spanish civil war? Was it 'true communism' when he murdered thousands of otherwise loyal communists because they could potentially oppose him? Was 'true communism' when he invaded Poland

       is beyond me. Almost every European state was founded the exact same way. The same as in Switzerland

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderbund_War

       will happen in Europe, all over again. Because they can't get enough, they absolutely
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to make a world state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only hope there is would be that exactly as the same in Switzerland will happen and the EU dissolves into a direct democratic, highly federated state...

       I don't know why anyone thinks it's possible to avoid federation or increased interlinking with surrounding populations. Eventually that will make the real struggle (between crazy rich sociopaths running everything into the ground and the common people of humanity) more apparent and people won't be able to think "oh well at least we're not britain" or "oh well at least we aren't the french" or "oh well at least we're not americans".

       I used to believe that one big eu was a good thing, we needed to unite since we're sitting in between USA and Russia. Now I think that the best thing is splitting USA and Russia up into small countries like the EU used to be and still in in most ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a country is small you know where your leaders live and they know that you know so they tend to be less corrupt.

       It is utterly amazing to me that people do not understand this.

       And many here should take note - first you bring an economic union into the
       <em>
        conversation
       </em>
       , and you can then slowly, over generations, get to where you need to be.

       The instructions are laid out pretty easy to see.

       Europe is kind of like the US 200 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US got stronger and stronger as a federation as it implemented more institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU bureaucracy has no desire for the clear and easy to see lesson of US history, and instead wants to run Europe from Frankfurt, and Brussels with absolutely no democratic input from the people, or common sense economic policy.

       It's amazing to me.

       Then they'll get their Federation of a United Europe - and we'll inch closer and closer.

       That's not communism then. It's a fascist state. McCarthy just led a misinformation campaign to get everyone afraid of a system that would actually defeat those at the top.
