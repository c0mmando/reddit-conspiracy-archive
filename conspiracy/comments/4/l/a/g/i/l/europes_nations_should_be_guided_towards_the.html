<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Monnet</a></p>

<p>Today, politicians and the media are much less open about the real purpose of the European Union. Instead, we are bombarded with constant fear propaganda about the &quot;uncertainty&quot; of independence, and millions of Britons are being manipulated to vote &quot;Remain&quot; on June 23, without understanding that they are voting to perpetuate their own enslavement to an undemocratic European superstate.</p>

<p>Edit: A link has been provided by <a href="/u/pear22">/u/pear22</a> which disputes the attribution of this quote to Jean Monnet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a good article, but I&#39;d be interested to see if there are any other sources regarding the origin of this quote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since OP conveniently omitted posting a source on this quote Let me bring some clarity here:</p>

<p>Jean Monnet, founding father of the ECSC, has often wrongly had the following apocryphal lines attributed to him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Europe’s nations should be guided towards the super-state without their people understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, these weren’t Monnet’s words at all – but those of the Conservative politician and author, Adrian Hilton, in The Principality and Power of Europe, published in 1997. Yet this is almost by the by. That so many have ascribed the quote to Monnet is because so many have been so shocked at what the European project has since become.  </p>

<p>Then why did many leading communists and intellectuals of the day praise Stalin&#39;s Russia and Mao&#39;s China? Other than Trotskyists no one seriously suggested they weren&#39;t. Only when the scope and depth of their crimes was revealed did people start going &quot;oh, they weren&#39;t <strong>really</strong> communist or socialist&quot;.</p>

<p>To this day you&#39;ll find Soviet and Maoist nostalgia pieces on <a href="/r/socliasm">/r/socliasm</a> -- until outsiders show up and then it&#39;s back to denying it. <a href="/r/communism">/r/communism</a> is unabashedly pro Stalin/Mao/Kim, which is kind of ironic considering their SJW stance and the fact these guys ruthlessly opposed it denouncing it as western decadence. Stalin was the one that re-criminalized homosexuality after all.</p>

Stalin&#39;s kill count they always claim is innocent civilians was the count of Nazi&#39;s/soldiers/and criminals put to death. Maos? It was a farming plague.

Both started out okay, Russia and China were feudal shit countries before, and transformed to a major industrialized world power in a ridiculously short span after turning towards socialism. </p>

<p>The failings with &quot;capitalism&quot; aren&#39;t capitalistic. We don&#39;t have a capitalist system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should point that that Keynesian policies were never instituted until AFTER the Great Depression. So yah Captialism has failed multiple times before Keynes was even fucking alive. You keep believing what you want though. </p>

<p>How can one refute ignorant opinion, like I said you didn&#39;t even give a article that has citation, it&#39;s a literal opinion piece. My opinion will be just as in depth, that article is a fucking joke, without shred of intellectual weight. </p>

<p>I see what you are doing there, let me do the same. that was never really communism that failed then, there never has been communism.</p>

<p>So you still don&#39;t comprehend what words mean.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s wrong, you can provide evidence against it. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your point is what? Is the content false? If so, you can prove it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s a literal opinion piece.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather, it&#39;s a fact piece that hurts your feelings, so you can do fuck all about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see what you are doing there, let me do the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, no. You don&#39;t understand it at all. In no way am I saying that capitalism has not been tried. You, however, are shitposting about communism not being tried.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there never has been communism.</p>

<p>Every communist nation on Earth has enacted all of the tenants of communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was it &#39;true communism&#39; when the Soviet Union turned on their anarchist and socialist brethren during the Spanish civil war? Was it &#39;true communism&#39; when he murdered thousands of otherwise loyal communists because they could potentially oppose him? Was &#39;true communism&#39; when he invaded Poland <strong>WITH</strong> Nazi Germany? Was the mass rape of Polish, German -- and even Russian -- women when the Red Army advanced west &#39;true communism&#39;?

<p>The only hope there is would be that exactly as the same in Switzerland will happen and the EU dissolves into a direct democratic, highly federated state...</p>

<p>When a country is small you know where your leaders live and they know that you know so they tend to be less corrupt.</p>

<p>The US got stronger and stronger as a federation as it implemented more institutions. </p>

<p>The EU bureaucracy has no desire for the clear and easy to see lesson of US history, and instead wants to run Europe from Frankfurt, and Brussels with absolutely no democratic input from the people, or common sense economic policy. </p>
