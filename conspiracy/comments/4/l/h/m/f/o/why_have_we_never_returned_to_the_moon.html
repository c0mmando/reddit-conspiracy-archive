       It's been 40+ years since we went to the moon, i just saw the movie
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772240/">
        appolo 18
       </a>
       and i would like an answer to a really simple question: "Why have we never returned to the moon"
      </p>
      <p>
       It can't be money, that would be an lame answer and it simply can't be true. What is on the moon? why aren't we going back?

       Once 100 years pass and still no one has been there it will be hard to wag this story still. Too bad Dave McGowans wagging the moon doggie isn't online any more it was a great read on this matter.

      <p>
       Lame or not, it is most likely the correct answer. Assuming the US actually did land men on the moon, it was a very expensive and dangerous task that had no real value other than the propaganda value of regaining the "lead" in the "space race".
      </p>
      <p>
       The US did it (or claimed to do it) in 1969 as a propaganda coup against the Soviet Union - that was the "prize".
      </p>
      <p>
       But once you've done it once, there is no real prize for doing it again. Being second on the moon, or going to the moon again 20 years later, is just not worth the massive investment and risk that it entails.
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       worth the risk is being the first to land on another planet - Mars - and that's where the focus lies. That's even more expensive and difficult so it may be quite some time before anyone can do it.

       The missions were cancelled before the war ended, a war which was hardly a motivator in the first place.

       Apologies if I'm being obscure, but the answer can be summed up as: it's politics. Much of the desire to go to the moon was tied to the space race, and when it became clear that the Soviets weren't catching up, the incentive was somewhat lost. In addition, budget concerns and other events ultimately resulted in the missions being cancelled.

       He doesn't say that.  He says the Orion may potentially have difficulties getting through due to its state-of-the-art, delicate electronic systems.  He goez on to say that it is heavily shielded so there's really nothing to worry about.

       At what time stamp location? If he does that doesn't have anything to do with whether the early missions had such shielding capable of shielding the earliest and weakest, least robust, computer tech and human beings.

       How did they not have shielding back then?  It's still just a faraday cage and a wall of metal to dissipate the electromagnetic flux.  It's the most simple problem to solve in the entire field of physics.

       LEM claimed to be six tonnes in weight. thirty feet in diameter with legs extended, the numbers are documented and official.
      </p>
      <p>
       the LEM is basically a metal pallet/platform (with legs) with a rocket engine in the middle and the astronauts stand on it as it descends to the Moons surface. the walls are to hold the equipment and stop things falling off.
      </p>

       now either the Apollo astronauts had proverbials the size of beachballs, or the whole LEM concept is total BS.

       There is no way the Apollo craft could carry that kind of equipment, a  Faraday cage and a wall of metal along with the wherewithall to propel its human cargo and all of its other equipment to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is nonsense because it requires a wall of metal and a Faraday cage for which you have provided no evidence.  and which would be far beyond the payload capability of the craft in question.

      <p>
       A lot of people make the same mistake you are - thinking that lower tech obviously means less capable. The fact is, the technology used during the Apollo mission was robust and less likely to suffer catastrophic damage from small power surges.
      </p>

       Modern microchips are not so robust and can be killed by the static electricity from a touch.

       You're fantasy is that this tinfoil and cardboard crap could withstand being blasted off of the face of the earth, fly through radiation belts that cannot currently be flown through and land on the moon.

       First of all, it's spelled "your".
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly it is not
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       fantasy. I'm not saying the US went to the moon. If you read my comments you'd realise that. Personally I think the same reason they aren't going "back" is a good reason to believe they never went in the first place - the expense and risk is too great, for too little return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that it was not possible - but that if the US had tried and something really went badly wrong, they would have lost the only value they hoped to get out of it - "propaganda".
      </p>
      <p>
       The radiation in the Van Allen Belts is not so great that a human could not survive for extended periods of time, even without shielding. Added to that is the fact that they are
       <em>
        belts
       </em>
       , not spheres, and the trajectory of the Apollo missions was such that they bypassed the inner belt completely, and only spent a relatively short time in the outer belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put simply, even unshielded, the worst that would happen is an astronauts chance of developing cancer would be greatly increased. They would not drop dead on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dosage received by the survivors of Hiroshima was far greater than an astronaut would receive in the half hour it took to transit the outer Van Allen belt. And they were called "survivors" for a reason.

       You do understand that EMP and charged particles have the same effect as static, don't you? They induce currents to flow in circuits. If the current is too high, the circuit blows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Old tech can withstand much higher current than new tech, simply because of its size. A thicker wire withstands more current than a thin wire. That's how fuses work.

       With official tech they had back it would make it very hard to make pass Van Allen radiation belt unharmed (they could use this as an excuse of not going back) but have in mind that they (Human governments) had very advanced secret technology by 1960s let alone the the tech they have now in 2016, everything seems suppressed from our human history to technology... it is heartbreaking and wrong :[

         Humans went to the moon (Luna) only to find that it was occupied and were warned the 1st time... they did not listen so they went back again and were forced to leave and have been forbidden to come again or else.

         I imagine by now things are quite complicated when it comes missions to Luna since most have the tech (secret tech!) that can go beyond Luna yet the the warning still stands of Luna being off limits, no exceptions.

         Next goal is Mars... or who is to say they aren't already there already there and if so why hide it ?

       The Truth will come out sooner or later... or maybe it has (in bits and pieces perhaps) but the majority just fail or refuse to see it.

       It would be pathetic if they spend that crazy budget faking space, that's sad. NASA goons must launder that money to their masters.

       You want decent pictures of the earth? Try actually doing some research of your own for a change and looking at Himiwara-8. If you go

       you can see hourly photos of the globe from the last four weeks. No composite photography, just a constant stream of photos from geosynchronous orbit.

       It is about money, just not what you think.  There is nothing of value on the moon to be brought back.  If there's no profit to be had, then there's no incentive to return.

       American aerospace technology has been in slow regression since 1970. The things we could do in the 1950s and 1960s, we don't have the engineers who are capable of doing it in 2016. Sure, there have been advances -- slow refinements in existing tech -- but where are the leaps forward? Where are the balls to try something new? We should have had civilian supersonic passenger planes for the past six decades -- Concord was designed in the 1950s and built in the 1960s -- but we don't. That alone should be enough to indicate to you that aerospace is stagnant. I will go further than that and say aerospace is in slow decline. NASA is now building the same kind of rockets they used for the Apollo program, after having built and operated the space shuttle for decades. The space  shuttle was greatly in advance of these little rockets NASA is planing on using for the
       <em>
        future
       </em>
       , which means NASA is slipping back into the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short answer: we haven't returned to the moon because we can't. Aerospace technology is in decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, a slight clarification:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's been 40+ years since we went to the moon
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, it's been almost forty years since
       <em>
        white Christian men
       </em>
       went to the moon. NASA was staffed almost exclusively by
       <em>
        white Christian men
       </em>
       during the 1960s, with a few Jewish scientists thrown in for good measure. No other nation except America had been able to land men on the Moon and return them to the Earth.

       Well really, Jewish contributions were much more important than Christians ones, due to the Jew's superior grasp of mathematics, capacity for abstraction and intellectual abilities in general.
