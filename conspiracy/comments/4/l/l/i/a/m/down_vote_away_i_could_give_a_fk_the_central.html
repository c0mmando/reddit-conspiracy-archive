        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">40</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-05-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/yardley7.html">yardley7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Central/Bankers Globalists privately create the entire Federal Reserve Note Currency Supply out of debt with interest to themselves, so they get all the Currency back and use it to buy everything of real value like land and precious metals, and they intentionally crash the markets so they can force We The People to sell Our real assets, and the Central/Bankers Globalists can buy it all up cheap and keep it, they stole 500 Trillion in wealth from We The People this way. </p>

<p>Then since they own all the resources, they intentionally start to try to destroy the country  raising the prices up on land and rent so that businesses start looking to move to other countries for cheaper land and space costs, this destroys the high paying blue collar manufacturing jobs that many people who dropped out of school used to get. It also destroys the ability of the government to get revenue from these jobs, thus forcing the government to take more loans from the Central Bankers/Globalists, to enslave the government further. Since, the government can borrow from Central Bankers/Globalists without limit, it makes the politicians lazy and not work on developing sectors like manufacturing to get tax revenue.</p>

<p>Now all these dropouts are mad because they have no jobs, and stupidly they believe the propaganda that the reason is “racism” or the “white man”. The fact is that no, it is the Central/Bankers Globalists and the fact that they privately “own” the Currency Supply, that destroyed your jobs. Never mind that nearly ALL the Globalists are Jews, who follow the satanic verses in their holy book, the Talmud, which is their Policy written into a book.</p>

<p>Following the Talmud, the Central Bankers/Globalists, are depopulating We The People right now with GeoEngineering/“chemtrails”, which destroys the Biosphere, and sprays We The People with Aluminum, and are putting Nagalase into the vaccines, and saturating GMO food with Glyphosate, and doing all these things intentionally to cause Infertility, Alzheimer’s, Cancer, Autism, so that We The People are not only depopulated but also stupid, sick, weak, dependent on government. They also created and control ISIS, which NEVER attacks Israel by the way. They also are keeping the borders down so that illegals and Islamic extremist terrorist can come into countries to do damage. They also do extreme spying on We The People, and want to chip Us, for simple proof Google: “aaron russo rockefeller interview” The Rockefellers are totally controlled by the Central Bankers/Globalist Jews.</p>

<p>We The People MUST create a Sovereign American Currency Supply and NEVER borrow from the Central/Bankers Globalists, this the ONLY way We Will have good jobs again, and create a small government that We The People control, which We will use only to protect the Free Market and the Freedoms and Rights of the Individual.</p>

<p>Suck on this one: <a href="https://youtu.be/t-jc08SfSMI">https://youtu.be/t-jc08SfSMI</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like a lot of prop/shill posts there is a nugget of truth. People were getting pissed off at the 1% an uprising looked likely. So tbtb decided it&#39;s a race thing so the anger and hate is directed at each other  (divide and conquer ) instead of organizing against the 1% which mathematically is a guaranteed loss. The rest of his shit is shit. Trump is going to steal the sElection because the media seems to be sitting on some scandals, once the show starts and it&#39;s too late Hilary will be disqualified and the election date is fixed so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree wholeheartedly and would like to attempt to offer a solution to the organize versus divide problem.</p>

<p>If we can agree that our politicans are bribed and not working as intended, the next question should be who is doing the bribing. The oligarchy/corrupting corporations. How do these oligachs do the corrupting? Step 1 is probably a bag of loot and some playboy lifestyle access. After that it would rachet up - threats, pedos, etc. The second part we the people have no real say in, monsters gonna be monsters. The first part though, we DO have a say in. How do the oligarchs get all the money to do the bribing? Corrupt behavior for sure, but in the end it is we the people that finance the shit show via consumer spending. We the people of the USA spend over 11TRILLION dollars ever year on consumer goods. This 70% of GDP goes right into the pockets of those who are literally buying our representatives.</p>

<p>If we now think back to GoDaddy sponsering SOPA a few years back. Reddit organized a boycott against them and within 48 hours they changed thier lieing tune. Money talks, bullshit walks.</p>

<p>If we want to strike at the root of the problem, directly, I submit that we shoudlindividual engage in a general boycott. No need for lists of what is ok or not ok to purchase, simply restrict unneccessary expenses. You need a roof and food, but what about the middle-class keep up with the jonses&#39; stuff? The going out, the cars, vacations, hell even &#39;little&#39; stuff like netflix generates billions in cash-flow for the oligarchs.</p>

<p>Now imagine Occupy + Tea Party with an eCONomy so far in shambles the MSM can&#39;t spin it away. This would be hard times. Massive unemployment, maybe some disruption in services, etc. The good news is that there is TONS of WORK to be done. Forget about jobs. Our infrastructure is shit, are farmland is wrecked... look around problems that need workers solving them everywhere. We need to braek out of the job mentality. Much easier said than done, but a eCONomic &#39;collapse&#39; might be the flood we need to break out pavlovian programming.</p>

<p>Not everyone needs to be on board with. With a general strike you need everyone together or scabs will break it up. People will lose their livelyhoods and nothing changes. Too much for the individual to risk. Boycott OTOH has no such counter. You can&#39;t get fired for not buying stuff. And the more healthcare like mandated spending, the worse the eCONomy will get!</p>

<p>Even better, every dollar you don&#39;t spend on consumer goods can be focused into your life personally. The simple example I always give is a garden. A few dollars and labor today and dollar-free food in the future. Find anything you are constantly spending on and try to solve it once and for all. Learn how to repair your car, get in shape, etc. Anything that imprives YOU directly. </p>

<p>The eCONomy is already falling down. Look how many empty stores. Look how many unemployed. We the people should at least have the wits enough to force the failure, on our terms, and then pick the pieces up afterwards, which is or course, the real hard part.</p>

<p>If there must be violence, please let THEM (whoever they are) start it. We the people must take personal responsibility and try to avoid war. If war comes to us, let us have taken the high road until that point.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">3</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TAway3061980.html">TAway3061980</a> 2016-05-29</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Get rid of the entire concept of money
Communalism is an understanding that all jobs are necessary &amp; as such all workers should be treated the same. (Why should a person who keeps a highly trafficked washroom clean enough to eat in, starve, when a Lazy manager who passes all of his work to others gets a new car?) Everyone works whatever job makes them happy, &amp; is best suited for their talents. Everyone works, everyone can go to the store to pick up what they need. The cleaner of an office building, is just as important as the CEO because, if no one cleans up &amp; no one cleans the washrooms the staff will not want to work there &amp; certainly customers won&#39;t want to do business in a &#39;pig pen.&#39; 
Pride will replace money as the measure of &#39;success. (&amp; don&#39;t worry you super rich people you&#39;ll still own everything anyway, so you&#39;ll still have the power.) 
This will work, because not everyone likes fancy stuff, &amp; Greed is taught. If you don&#39;t believe greed is taught, spend a little time around a baby. Eventually they will offer you the soggy cookie they have been gnawing on. Also since the focus is on pride of a job well done instead of profit, this will mean higher quality goods &amp; less waste on disposable items. 
Stores will still exist, different brands will still exist. In fact the only thing that will change is, no one will ask you for money for the goods. You will still, wait in line &amp; have your items accounted for, so stock levels &amp; brand preferences are monitored. (brand purchases are monitored to determine the years top brand.not for invading privacy) there is to be no limits on quality of items only quantity, hoarding is a crime. Refusal to work is a crime. (Note: one can refuse a job, but cannot refuse to work at all.) </p>

<p>The crime rate WILL go down, as very few drug dealers will continue business if all the risk is still there but non of the reward. there will no longer be theft. Why stick a gun in someone&#39;s face if you can just walk into a shop &amp; take what you need. </p>

<p>There is no class system in the traditional sense, but there are categories for Workpool use: </p>

<p>-Generalist: This group makes up the majority of the public, &amp; includes Cleaners, store attendants, &amp; anything job that is not in the Specialist category. These jobs are assigned based on workers talents &amp; desires. Work is assigned through the Department of Labour &amp; is similar to Temp agencies, that sometimes give permanent assignments. Don&#39;t like your job? give two weeks notice, Job pool will help sort out a replacement. All trades are under generalist category until worker has at least 1 yr of trade experience, then he/she is considered a specialist. </p>

<p>-Specialist: This group is any job that requires formal education, or any specialised training including, Military, Doctors, Educators, Legal, etc. 
Everyone will start full time work (36hrs max/week) as soon as they are completed their schooling, until age 55 then they can retire. one can voluntarily remain in Workpool until age 65, but then they MUST retire. Students can work part time (max 15 hrs/wk) if they want to gain experience. </p>

<p>School is mandatory from age 2 until 1st year university is completed. (&amp; like everything is 100% free) After 1st year Students can either enter Workpool full time or finish their degree. There is no limits on education, one can spend their entire life a student as long as they contribute to society through it. 
&#39;Dropping out&#39; is only an option if the person isn&#39;t mentally fit to advance to such a level. 
Health care is available to EVERYONE regardless of any circumstances. </p>

<p>Parental leave: once a child is born ONE of the parents will stay home to raise the child &amp; accompany the child to school from 2yrs until 4. (classes also teach parents about nutrition &amp; development techniques) 
it doesn&#39;t matter if it is the father or mother, but ONE of them must commit the time to raise their own child &amp; pass along their morals. </p>

<p>To promote worker confidence &amp; pride an Annual awards event showcasing all the top workers in their field. Top Workers will be honoured &amp; allowed extra time off, Elite items( super cars, rolex, 1%er goodies), or some other special treatment. ALL categories will be covered. </p>

<p>The transition will be a little rough at first, but it is up to all of us to teach the next generation the dangers of greed. there will be people who will stop working at first, &amp; this will affect the gears of society, but eventually everyone will get back to work either out of boredom, shame, or they were legally compelled to. </p>

<p>This does not solve all the worlds problems, but it does fix a lot of the big ones.</p>
