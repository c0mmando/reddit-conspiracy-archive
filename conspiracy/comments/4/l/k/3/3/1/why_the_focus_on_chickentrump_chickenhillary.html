       Trump was never challenged. He just fired off his mouth and said "No! ME ME ME!" and Bernie was like "fine." and than Trump was like "Never mind, I'll actually have to think before I talk and I'm not very good at that". Clinton was just a chicken shit the whole time and no one likes her anyway.

       Interesting!  Do you have a link for that?  (Not doubting, just curious...)

       Even if there's a rule, in practice, I think the party would find it hard to prohibit - the optics of saying, "No, you can't debate our opponent," would be too dismal for either R or D.

       If candidates debate in an unsacationed event then they are barred from future debates under party rules. So had he took the debate against Bernie there would have been a chance that he wouldn't get to debate Hillary if she gets the nomination.

       Sorry about the delay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an article that gets into the debates needing to be sanctioned and how participants in unsanctioned debates will not be allowed to participate in future presidential debates if they win the nomination
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sorry-bernie-sanders-no-inter-party-primary-debate-for-you/article/2565521">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Quote from the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Republican National Committee did not mince words, telling the Washington Examiner there would be no such debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       'The RNC has made clear that if any Republican candidate participates in an unsanctioned debate they will not be allowed to take part in any of the other RNC sanctioned primary debates,' RNC spokesman James Hewitt said."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some more info on the Commission on Presidential Debates (sorry for wiki)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is an article on why this very commission is being sued and being accused of blocking 3rd parties from being able to participate in the sanctioned debates
      </p>

       Here is an article from a few months ago when Cruz tried to get Trump into a 1 v 1 unsanctioned debate

       " Proposed Amendment to Rule 10

      <p>
       Insert the following as section (h):
There shall be a Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates, which shall be composed of thirteen (13) members of the Republican National Committee, five (5) of whom shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and each of the four (4) regions shall elect two (2) members, one man and one woman, at its regional caucus at the RNC Summer Meeting in each even-numbered year in which no Presidential election is held. The chairman of the Republican National Committee shall appoint the chairman of the Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates from among the members thereof. The Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates shall have the authority to sanction debates on behalf of the Republican National Committee based on input from presidential campaigns and criteria which may include but are not limited to considerations of timing, frequency, format, media outlet, and the best interests of the Republican Party. Each debate sanctioned by the Standing Committee on Presidential Primary Debates shall be known as a "Sanctioned Debate." Any presidential candidate who participates in any debate that is not a Sanctioned Debate shall not be eligible to participate in any further Sanctioned Debates. "

       I mean to be fair he claimed he would only do it if the networks paid the charities The way he wanted and they weren't going to. his whole campaign has been about walking away from bad deals. so he did.

       Yeah, that's bullshit.  Pretty well instantaneously two other sources offered 8 figure sums to keep the debate on and Trump ignored them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I think he's scared.  I think actually Trump is pathologically unconcerned about the consequences of his actions.  No, I think he just doesn't care.

       im starting to think you dont know what the word "prove" or "proved" means.  you throw that word around a lot, but never actually do any real proving.  im beginning to think that to you, proving something means calling someone a name or otherwise insulting them.

       Marxism runs contrary to the American principles of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, and most prominently, the right to liberty is wholly revoked under marxist teachings. The state dictates a slice of what is acceptable; all other things are banned. Republicanism operates in the exact opposite way. The only things that are banned are the items and behaviors whose execution revoke the rights of others under the same system.

       The intellectual loafers know very well that Karl Marx manipulated Hegel’s “metaphysical dialectic” in order to elaborate that deceptive “dialectical materialism.” Evidently, Karl Marx took from Hegel’s work all the metaphysical principles that Hegel gave to his work, and with the leftovers Karl Marx elaborated his deceptive dish. Thus, it is not irrelevant to repeat in this lecture that Marx, as the author of such a lie, of such a farce, of such Communistic dialectic, never believed in it, and therefore he did not have any inconvenience in confessing his feelings in the heat of the assembly when saying,
       <strong>
        “Gentlemen, I am not Marxist.”

       The quote is actually from 1891 in regards of the opportunist distorting what he was teaching and at the time he identified more as a socialist democrat. Him and Engels both were hurt by the aftermath of this statement.

If you care so much about socialism why aren't you out there protesting against the mega corporations who receive billions of tax payer dollars and exemptions every fucking year????  What?

       He isn't wrong though. Bernie's platform is lot's of free stuff. That's Socialism in a nut shell. Great until the economy goes to crap from the low productivity then you get Venezuela. Only thing I like about Bernie is that he calls out the banks.

       Because trump goes around acting like he's some big tough guy (laughable) who isn't afraid of anyone.  He spent the days leading up to this saying he would love to debate Bernie any time.  Then Bernie agrees, so trump says only if they raise $10 million for Women's charity.  They called his bluff so he backed out knowing he was going to get stomped in front of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a fool though, and he didn't realize until later that he was entering a lose/lose with Sanders.  He needs to pull Sanders supporters for the general, but if he plays nice his own supporter base will call him weak for not yelling down "the commie".

       From what I understand it's actually against the rules for Trump to debate a Democrat unless the Republican/Democrat parties come to an agreement on it. Trump being new to politics may not have known this, and shot his mouth off on TV before realizing it was never gonna happen.

       so Trump speaks of it, and gets called countless names, attacked all the time. I'm not telling you to vote Trump or anything but damn, admit when I have a point. Bernie even backed off Hillary's emails... I like what Bernie represents but if he wanted the nomination he should have attacked Clinton sooner. Trump has been the presumptive nominee for what, 3 weeks? he's already unloaded on Clinton 10 times what Bernie has...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even calling Bernie chicken. I'm not 10 years old. my point is, hold both him and Trump to the same standards. if Bernie did talk about auditing the fed like Trump has, you would be praising him (and rightly so IMO). but for you to bend your reasoning to support Bernie no matter what he does, that's a problem.

       also, you're saying that if few people have an understanding of an issue, a candidate shouldn't even bring it up in his campaigning? cmon, don't be so naive. every issue they stand for is important and should be broadcast. I don't want my president wanting to do x y &amp; z and only letting on about x and y during the campaign.

       He isn't wrong though. Bernie's platform is lot's of free stuff. That's Socialism in a nut shell. Great until the economy goes to crap from the low productivity then you get Venezuela. Only thing I like about Bernie is that he calls out the banks.

       Yes, if you think that free shit can ever exist, you are part of the problem. Thankfully your marxist bullshit will never take hold in the US.
