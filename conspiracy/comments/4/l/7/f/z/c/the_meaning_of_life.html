    <div class="md"><p>I got randomly enlightened and I can tell you without a doubt that if you always try to improve yourself you&#39;ll eventually get to a point where you learn things other people can&#39;t even imagine. I didn&#39;t follow any religion, buddhism, christianity or even believe in God. But after my enlightenment it&#39;s so obvious that God does in fact exist.</p>

<p>Edit: To add to that, Buddhism, Christianity and any other religion are in fact following the right path. But you must feel it, reading the religion and following those religions is not enough. You have to experience it. Do not follow one religion follow every religion. Be whoever you want to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got enlightened by breaking every barrier I could think of. Exploring every possibility I could until I eventually started to piece things together logically. After I started piecing them together I really had no idea what I was getting into. Then eventually I realized what was really going on in this world and my spot in it. Your soul exists. The way you reach enlightenment in my opinion is by always being as kind as you can be. Always keeping a positive mentality. Accept things other people will not accept. It started with me by realizing human civilization has been around for much longer than 6000 years. What has happened to make us follow this path? I did my research. I listened to people others deem crazy to understand what they were trying to tell me. I basically left no stone unturned. Even if I thought what I was doing was idiotic I would still roll with it to understand why people did such things. Basically enlightenment is realizing the master key to the world. It can&#39;t be described but I&#39;ll tell you the thinking sort of.</p>

<p>Bad things will happen no matter what, accept it, learn from it. People are literally moronic so do not do what the general population does. I did not meditate but I did do fasting. I did fasting because I learned it was actually good for you. I try to treat people as good as possible, but at the same time people live inside bubbles so it is not actually possible to please everyone without acting dumb. You must mold to the people you talk to. I realized that and I asked why? Why is because everyone creates their own reality of what they believe and what they do not believe. The key I believe is that in western society everyone does bad things. Even you do bad things, for example I treat eating unhealthily as doing something bad. That does not mean I am going around telling everyone to eat healthy, that means I accept that it is not the smartest thing. Enlightenment is realizing what the smartest thing truly is. Instead of fighting over things, accept people are idiots. Instead of trying to change the government, do not waste your time. I did a lot of research about what our governments do so that I could fully understand what was going on. </p>

<p>The way I see it, there are a few aspects to really focus on.</p>

<p>1) Eating healthy, fasting, working on your physical body.</p>

<p>2) Spirit, work on your spirit, become as happy even when you should not be happy. Treat others well, even if they do not treat you well.</p>

<p>3) Knowledge. Learn everything, do not focus on anything because the second you focus on one thing they are trapping you in their circles of thinking. Really try to piece together things from an array of sources. Instead of looking at reasons we are created vs our evolution, look at what our genetics tell us. Instead of looking at which medicines are good and which medicines are bad look at why we need the medicine in the first place. Instead of always attempting to change yourself accept you are perfect how you are and it is simply which challenges you accept. </p>

<p>For example if you are telling someone how to live a happy life and they are completely determined to live an unhappy life just don&#39;t force anything. Listen to others because I will tell you for sure our society shapes everyone. Ignore society figure out exactly what your heart is telling you. If you follow your heart the whole way you&#39;ll learn things other people using their minds would never be able to figure out.</p>

<p>After my enlightenment I also realized everything I learned in school is a bunch of bullshit. </p>

<p>edit: Once you become enlightened the feeling you get is that you are loved. It does not matter if I accomplish nothing with this life I will still be happy. Although I will try to do the things I love most, it is mostly a shit show so it&#39;s evident times will start changing. Hopefully one day I will have people who will come listen to me so I can attempt to enlighten them as well. The internet has answers to every question you can ask, use it to your advantage before they censor it all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How to what?</p>

<p>If you want answers about life and spirituality, then I urge you to study quantum physics, biology and bioinformatics and then read the paper by Penrose on Orchestrated Objective Reduction.  That will give you the scientific angle ...</p>

<p>The exploration of good and evil is self evident in this reality. That duality is everywhere;  light vs darkness, stars vs black holes, order vs chaos, hard work and the generation of value vs raping and pillaging and consuming, service to others vs service to self....  This duality is ubiquitous...  To feed or be fed...</p>

<p>Study math and science...  Theology flows from there.  </p>

Studying these highly technical fields may be useful for understanding reality to an extent, but the Vedas are much more direct and easier to assimilate. Eh, just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>As a &quot;conspiracy nut&quot;, the reality of life can be simplified to the ancient battle of good vs. evil. Evil, obviously being the &quot;winning team&quot; so far. </p>

<p>Thinking of life in that way, the meaning of life is to learn and live in love. </p>

<p>We can describe this adventure,  put it up,  put it down,  but at its core,   it is incomprehensible in the traditional sense of understanding.

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately for us it&#39;s too late - years ago we were taken prisoner by a more intelligent species. Perhaps back in ancient Egypt, with the pyramids acting as some sort of communication device. And they made us build them. </p>

<p>They left Earth, some probably stayed, but not before gaining control of any person with mass influence (Pharoahs, Presidents, etc.) as a way to literally shape history. And they wrote the history books as a way to keep a fog around the true events of the past. </p>

<p>Fast forward until a few centuries ago, when a mass population from their home in space (or time) either needed to or wanted to come to Earth. Oh, how easily they can blend in. Now our &quot;government&quot; (which obviously does not exist..but fear creates control) and the media is crawling with them. How, with the last century, did we become so damn fucked up, lazy, unintelligent, addicted, impulsive? There is no free thought, we are their slaves, and soon the rich and the remaining spacemen will be leaving as we all go down together.</p>

<p>So many people, so easy to manipulate, but even their own hyper-intelligence couldn&#39;t predict how quickly they&#39;d fuck us up. I believe, in a sense, that their ultimate downfall will be from inserting technology into our human evolution. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all right there for us to see. Because with knowledge we are beginning to learn and get a small understand of the way things are changing. No one votes, people don&#39;t just take shit from the cops anymore, and now religion is only a shameful representation of how gullible and worthless we were as a species. We fucked up, we know it now, and in a few years we will know it&#39;s the end. Oh, how ironic that it&#39;s Election Year! </p>

<p><strong>TL:DR We&#39;ve lost our chance as a species. A more advanced collaboration of purposeful entities invaded and manipulated our evolution, took our resources, and are shortly leaving with the last batch and the super rich after the election.</strong></p>
