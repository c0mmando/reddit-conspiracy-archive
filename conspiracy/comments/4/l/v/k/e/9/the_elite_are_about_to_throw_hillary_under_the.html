       Why is the FBI investigation taking so long? It's not political pressure, it is because the scope of the investigation has grown well beyond her emails as Secretary of State, and into the fraud that is the Clinton Foundation, bribery, money laundering, and possibly even into drug running and murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Elite will try to contain the reveal of the corruption to
       <em>
        individuals
       </em>
       instead of
       <em>
        the system
       </em>
       . The goal is to foster unrest, but keep it localized. The mainstream media will not report on the depth of the scandal, creating a divide between those who are waking up and those totally engrossed by the control system.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will be laughing their asses off while the country divides itself between Trump and Sanders, before they off them with a false flag radical leftist assassination and CIA heart attack gun, respectively. Another division in the population. Divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the golden candidate will be revealed, pledging to heal and protect us from the very chaos they are responsible for.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. did I mention all the false flag terrorism they are about to unleash?

       I don't really follow American politics, I am not even American, but in my opinion it would be truly extraordinary if Hillary was indicted at all because of an FBI investigation, it seems implausible in the corrupt American system where those in power never are held responsible for anything.

       Having a teachable mindset kept me sane through the last six years of higher education, and I find that it applies in any situation. 'If you're the smartest man in the room, you're in the wrong room' is a good quote to live by!

       I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you're the type of person who shits all over everything and bitches that the system is rigged but then does nothing to change the rigged system but bitch and moan on the internet about the Jews. So far that's what it looks like. Let me know if I'm wrong.

       Has anyone ever told you that you suck at talking to other people, because you're pretty shit at it. Also, a loaded question is a loaded question regardless of one's opinion about how truthful the question is or is not.

       IIRC Most of those governments that broke the treaties were state governments and not federal at the time. Especially with what happened to the Cherokee in Georgia. The Cherokee had their own constitution drafted and everything, was recognized federally but the State gov wouldn't recognize their newly formed constitution which lead to the POTUS at the time to send in the federal military to disrupt the state military. I don't remember what president it was but I do know that the POTUS at the time bitched out to the state gov.

       True. I actually went to see my family week before last and stayed with my grandparent who watch Fox News for 90% of the day. I got into it with my grandpa that the MSM is just filling his head with BS the government wants him to hear. His response "Fox News is fair and balanced" He said this as he was drinking out of a Fox News coffee cup. Some people will never wake up.

       Might be prudent to look into who owns most of the land/resources there, or if owned by USG, which old-time family gifted it to them in the late 1800's/early 1900's. Also, which insurance companies are involved in disaster insurance in that region.

       And look into who owns many of the insurance companies. You'll have to sift through a lot of shadow holding companies, but you usually can trace them back to old-time U.S. families who have succeeded in hiding their true fortune extending windfalls from the public.Very complex, and I don't have all the details for certain, but what a picture it all paints.

       I believe one of the first insurance company's are connected to mother Bush's family. I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere. Anyway as someone who live along the San Andreas fault it is true that our emergency alert tests have increased over the past few years as have these commercials that can only be described as disturbing as all hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example a gymnasium filled with a terrified populace and what seem to be guards all around and a woman sobbing to the point of hysteria about her son, which cuts to a young family clinging to one another as they witness the scene, the tag line is something like does your family know where to go during an emergency? Every time I see that commercial I get a sick feeling i cannot logically explain but it doesn't inspire hope that's for certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also noticed convoys of military vehicles through my area, like lots of them and the camouflage is not of the desert sand ones our troops sport.  I could just be overreacting but.... guess only time will tell.

       Larry didn't even buy the Twin Towers, he merely signed a long term lease. He was a NY slumlord who didn't have the kind of money necessary to buy something that grand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus he ONLY bought terrorism insurance and none of the typical policies associated with business leases. The complex of 9 buildings in total was only 30% leased, which meant LS was losing money from day one.
      </p>
      <p>
       LS was not paid for 2 separate occurrences, the Judge in the case was one of LS golfing buddies who denied his chutzpah claim.

       "October Surprise" is one of those phrases which once made reference to a specific event, iirc the rumored Reagan Campaign's off the books negotiation with the Iranians during the hostage crisis. Now it is commonly used to refer to any sort real or hypothetical "false-flag" or "convenient" incident in the build up to an election which causes a shift of support to the establishment's preferred candidate.

       You're going to be massively disappointed and downright shocked by the limitless hypocrisy, apathy, amnesia, stupidity and cowardice of the plebeian hordes, OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If - and I say IF - it comes to large demonstrations by the ordinary center-right wing Americans, then all it'll take, is some firecrackers and a little mace to disperse hundreds of thousands if need be. These folks don't have a shred of resistance towards the authorities left in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leftist hordes might put up a little more resistance, but they're way too disorganized and use too much senseless violence (destruction of property, looting, attacking regular people etc.) to be succesful and convincing either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment is just going to shove it down our throats with a little trauma bonding like they always do. They'll make us feel powerless by not even trying to hide it (corruption, abuse of power, fraud ... ) anymore and then pat us on the head like the good little domesticated animals we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They already got away with every outrageously ridiculous or heinous act conceivable, from stealing presidential elections with ballot fraud (Dubya via brother Governor Jeb in Florida), over attacking 2 sovereign foreign nations while getting a Nobel peace prize to faking Osama Bin Laden's death (Obama).

       Here in Texas it's already started. Memorial day weekend shooter in Houston was a veteran and here comes all the gun control bull shit from the media. Funny thing is this story hasn't even made it outside of Texas for the most part yet. The "evidence" they found A DAY LATER on the crime scene pinpointed the "culprit". If you guys want a link let me know. Would really like some input from you guys on what you think is happening here.

       From the day she announced her candidacy, I wondered how, with all of her skeletons and he baggage, she could POSSIBLY be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing things continually heat up against Hillary, I would not be surprised to see her withdraw from the election - citing some bullshit excuse (she will never be convicted, let alone punished).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would expect the void to be quickly filled by either (A) Michael Bloomberg, or (B) Joe Biden - neither of which would be much of an improvement over Hillary.

       Huh, wonder if that is why the police in my area have been getting their guns stolen out of their vehicles lately? In response to these happenings the news reported that this is a pretty routine event happening in police stations all over the area and then proceeded to go through a list of what firearms have been stolen and from where. I could hardly believe what I was listening to and still don't quite get why they would want that reported, doesn't make sense, but maybe I'm weird.

       I don't think so. That could possibly pop off serious country wide riots or worse that I don't think they want right now. Maybe but I don't think so. Instead here is what I see coming:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary gets protected from the scandal since Lynch is in power. Maybe offers Sanders VP, and if he takes it we will know he was never serious about stopping corruption of banks or anything. Either way though. The plan will be to flood the field with candidates. They wont want anyone to reach the delegates needed to actually win. Then they can push in who ever they want. The only way this fails is if Trump wins by a landslide.

       Coming back with some more thoughts, the reason that Hillary will be indicted is because there are tensions developing between different factions of the deep state. Usually they all collude together and that is largely why they are so successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The financial elite want Hillary but she has made too many enemies in the FBI and a Clinton presidency would be the death of the current power hierarchy, because she would use her executive powers to turn over as much of the agency as she could. So, obviously when faced with being dismantled, the FBI is delving as deep as possible into her criminal acts in an attempt to reveal her true psychopathy to the public.

       No, they aren't going to assassinate either. That would create instant unrest. Bernie will be side-lined, a Biden/Warren ticket will be introduced,  the media will constantly show neck-and-neck polls between them and Trump, then they will manipulate the vote to give it to Biden/Warren. Exactly as what just happened in Austria.

       Bernie is just going to lose the nomination. Hillary is going to stay in until after the convention before either dropping out (Bill health issue) or getting indicted, so the dems can install who they want, which is not Bernie Sanders.

       I dunno, that may happen, but it's not like the POTUS is much other than a puppet and distraction for the masses. Obama promised many things and delivered on few, and then only partially.

       The convention is likely do pick Bernie simply because he has a better chance at defeating Trump. If they don't we are likely to end up with Trump for president, although that's assuming a lack of vote manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason Hilary hasn't already been indicted, is to keep up a distraction while the TPP bill passes.

       Who knows if Clinton even stops running if shes indicted, who knows what that woman is capable of.

       All i do know is that Sanders most likely wont turn out to be the nominee regardless of Hillary, someone like Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren more than likely will take(steal) the nod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gary johnson may do well but is not a contender. So pretty much Trump will take the cake in a landslide, regardless of the contender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump had the election even before he announced his candidacy. He was a solid would-be candidate in 2012, and is the perfect candidate for 2016 and the Trump Train has no brakes.

       They won't let Trump win.  He's an inside-outsider.  They'd rather have Sanders as a dark horse contestant if they absolutely cannot get the prophesized Hillary, who is essentially the apocalypse character in xmen.

        It's not political pressure, it is because the scope of the investigation has grown well beyond her emails as Secretary of State, and into the fraud that is the Clinton Foundation, bribery, money laundering, and possibly even into drug running and murder.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       uh, No. The only people generally saying such things are the ones who have been claiming stuff about her since 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sure as hell don't see her as perfect (and wouldn't vote for her but prefer her over trump) and think she is just a carpet bagging power hungry person (but anyone running for president could be seen as power hungry).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see though is people who hate her and have just made up so much shit over the years that they have convinced some people stuff is true just by volume. But never with any real proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say the fbi comes back and says "Well, technically she did violate an email law and we recommend indictment - that still is not proof of guilt and still does not mean that there will even be a prosecution. Prosecutors don't always see the value in pursuing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many millions do you want to spend on a minor crime and do you want others to now insist you prosecute others for similar things?
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is complex. Hillary has been in the public eye a long time and some people hate her. When you let pure bias taint your view you will believe just about anything and not stop to look at things logically - which means you are probably being manipulated somewhere along the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be skeptical of everything in the search for truth.

       162 page report, tell me specifically what she is 'guilty' of and where this shows it? One thing I saw was that she just used the same email she had used before becoming secretary. I'm not seeing what is criminal here and what has conservatives touching themselves with joy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an accusation, so there is an investigation. If she broke laws she can get indicted. If that then she can get a trial by a jury and be found either innocent or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that some people want to skip all that, but I think that is being a bit irresponsible - but then the press is pushing this because they know it gets clicks and people want to hear she is guilty, when there is no proof and no jury which has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that she did anything.
