    <div class="md"><p>Reddit to me, is primarily a cesspool of atheistic, authoritarian Communism.  It is Stalinism rebranded, with a smartphone and red rimmed hipster glasses, and minority advocacy to provide the necessary sense of moral self-righteousness.</p>

<p>This site successfully taught me to hate collectivism in general for a long time; the only thing that has changed that, has been literally the last few weeks where I&#39;ve been getting off the Internet and sharing evening meals and good conversation with some genuinely worthwhile people, offline.</p>

<p>The main type of people this site consists of, however, are bullying, chronically brainwashed, Leftist Millennials who simply want to punish anyone who does not think the same way they do, and who are prepared to use downvotes or whatever other means they have at their disposal, for accomplishing said aim.  Said people do not think critically, and they are almost completely incapable of emotional self-control.  All they experience is rage and the desire to smash things and silence anyone who disagrees with them.</p>

<p>As a result of said cowardice and censorship, however, as well as the unquestioning worship of MLK etc, and the constant tendency to re-frame defeat as victory, I also learned to detest Occupy Wall Street, and social activism more or less in general.  Again, recent positive experiences offline are causing me to re-evaluate that attitude, and ask myself who it benefits.  Where I live offline, we are currently facing ongoing waves of socially destructive gentrification, with developers completely out of control.  If they experience any resistance to what they want, they can simply use bulldozers, and they will more often get away with it than not.</p>

<p>I still consider <a href="/r/Socialism">/r/Socialism</a> and their online ilk to be a waste of time, but at this point I just wish that I had some sort of viable alternative to them.  The Left sicken me for the most part, but if we want to get anything done, it is continually implied that a combination of uncritical, fanatical Marxism, and ovine drooling in front of photos of Gandhi, somehow constitute our only option.</p>

<p>I want to stop the bankers and developers.  I do not want to join a vindictive, purely emotive, tyrannical <strong><em>cult</em></strong> which I do not consider to have any real answers; and every time I try and suggest ways that said cult modify its&#39; approach, the only response is attempts to attack me, and more rage.</p>

<p>Who is stirring shit by posting this kind of covertly accusatory question?</p>

<p>Also, why are you posting this here in conspiracy as opposed to <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a>?</p>

<p>I think you should post this on <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> and see if you can confirm your own bias by their answers instead of antagonizing us here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  we are the very last sub where you will find the truth so I&#39;m very suspicious of users like yourself who come here and take a big fucking shit on us with questions like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say anonymity actually does explain a large part of the anger and antagonism.  Anonymity and the feeling that nobody&#39;ll find out who you <em>really</em> are often allows you to just go off and be as much of an asshat as you can possibly be.  In that manner, whatever antagonism or hostility you might otherwise have that in a face to face confrontation might cause you to <em>not</em> be aggressive, in an anonymous conversation might cause you to just absolutely fly off the handle.</p>

<p>What might otherwise appear as a bit of frustration in person, in the anonymous net might come across as (or actually be) bonafide raging lunacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a serious issue of &#39;hive-mind&#39; here. Many people whore for karma, so they repeat certain things that they&#39;ve seen got other people karma. Popular retorts about certain arguments are therefore repeated, reinforced, and if you try and dispute them you are often vilified. An example is the herd immunity argument for forced vaccinations.</p>
