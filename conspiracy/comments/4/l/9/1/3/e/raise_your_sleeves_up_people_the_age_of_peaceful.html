        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Men, women, children, blacks, whites, Arabs, Latinos, Asians, Europeans, American Indians, gays, lesbians, transgender, rich, poor, middle class, legal immigrants, illegal immigrants, natives, short, tall, heavy set, thin, bald, hairy, every single person in this country needs to get themselves organized for protesting. No leadership needed. Everyone has connections. Use your connections and get this going before the elite suck this planet dry. They already sucked half of it down and America is a very delicious plate of power that they desperately want. </p>

<p>Protest about everything. No to propoganda, no to corruption, no to corporate slavery,ect...</p>

<p>Rock this country back on course with protest power. The protests don&#39;t stop until every wrong has made right. </p>

<p>But please, only peaceful protests because in the long run they are more effective than violence. Simple reason of efficiency. </p>

<p>In truth, this whole planet can be put together in 60 days. Many elite know this. Don&#39;t let anyone fool you into thinking change takes time. Keep those pickets up until true, fair justice for all is restored. Right now, most all the resources and wealth are hoarded in secrecy. If that was to be released back into the economic pipeline, the average middle class would be at just about $98,000 a year roughly in my calculations. Once the virtuous cycle of the economy is restored, that number can go up especially as we become more and more efficient. </p>

<p>Anyhow, sitting back and letting people screw us without putting our foot down hasn&#39;t worked so we gotta get off our couches and into the streets. However, if sanders makes it to the White House, this whole process will run on hyper speed and we can all live with the inner peace of mind we all are meant to have. </p>

<p>I see it coming. Time is ticking and this elite abuse of our country has hit an all time low. We need to participate in politics the best ways we can and protesting works if it is sustained for long periods of time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is, is that they&#39;ve already made peaceful protests worthless. Whether it&#39;s &quot;free speech zones&quot;, or beating peaceful protesters. They don&#39;t care, peaceful protesting doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s like pissing into the wind. I do not, and never condone violence, but we are at a point were we must decide as a nation. We can protest all we want, and they allow it because nothing will actually happen other than people hitting the &quot;like/share&quot; button. If voting actually mattered, we wouldn&#39;t be allowed to do it. I&#39;ve been to plenty of &quot;protests&quot;, only to go back to the hotel room and see they vote against the public&#39;s will, hence the quote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, keep in mind. There are many ways to do things. Screaming into microphones with a list of demands would pack the same punch. </p>

<p>Some people will naturally get violent but that&#39;s just the pepper of a peaceful protest. They will make it look like the people are violent to demonize us but we shall prevail. Keep it marching. Strikes and many other forms of activism will start popping up all over the country. </p>

<p>The secret is to sustain the protest. People need to go back and forth from work to protesting while others go back to work. Being arrested is a badge of honor if you are peaceful and it motivates the people to push harder. </p>

<p>They use arrests to dismantle protests. These July protests might start a big domino effect but this is our opportunity to jump ahead and just roll with it. </p>

<p>These assholes took away our peace of mind. It&#39;s time to get it back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your overall sentiment, but I think it&#39;s going to get very ugly.  We only need to look at the militarization of the police over only about the last decade for evidence.  The overall problem, I feel, is that its been abundantly clear for a long, long time that our government does not work for us.  It works for Wall street and corporate interests.  Congress has laughed in the face of the citizens they &quot;serve&quot; for so long, with at times only about an 8% approval rating.  The corruption is so thick, peaceful protests probably won&#39;t cut it.  TPTB will simply do what they always do, wait for calm, talk a lot of bullshit to quell righteous anger, and then become even more authoritarian.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying action isn&#39;t necessary and that inaction is our only option. What I am asking is what, realistically, does protesting accomplish? </p>

<p>They know we know. They also know that real revolution can&#39;t be sustained without wide popular support. And they know that we are fractured as all fuck, because modern society was designed that way. And if a protest does start to look threatening, the cops are dressed and trained as soldiers if a couple agent provocateurs can&#39;t do what needs to be done. </p>

<p>My point is that we need to leap about 5 steps down the process that peaceful protests are a part of. Peaceful protests in themselves haven&#39;t achieved anything noteworthy in this country for decades, so why not skip to the juicy bits? Incrementalism is for old clueless liberals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the answer but hard to put into words. </p>

<p>Imagine trying to get a chainsaw going. You gotta keep on pulling on the rope so the engine starts revving. With enough pulls, the chainsaw will become functional. </p>

<p>The tug of war between the elite will go on until the people start tugging hard to get the chainsaw revving. </p>

<p>The idea is to raise awareness about our own government screwing us, maintain that awareness at the forefront of the minds of the world, and to motivate others for the cause. </p>

<p>Later on we can install transperency systems so we cns observe everything our government is doing. We can expand the democracy with a digital voting system that can be used by the people to pass laws. We can get a progressive tax system. Tons of stuff. This world is meant to be a paradise but we are experiencing a nightmare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. You hit it the hammer on the head of the nail with this:</p>

<p>The problem is our entire way of life. </p>

<ul>
<li>Thats ok too because every so often, mankind makes an evolutionary leap to restore functionality in society. I&#39;m 99% sure this is one of those times. We need to clean up shop. Every system in America needs to be re-looked at and examine. Does this system serve us? How can we improve it? Is it obsolete? </li>
</ul>

<p>The whole protesting and stuff is actually supposed to guide us into that. I believe the first step is raising awareness as raising awareness is a powerful tool. It pushes people to action. We&#39;ve been all talk and no action for many years as a people. What I&#39;m trying to tell everyone is that we need to be all talk and all action for something to happen because talking alone doesn&#39;t do it. </p>

<p>There are many brains in America. Each one has something to offer. Once we organize as a movement, people will be thinking and acting on their thoughts every passing moment which in turn can restore functionality to America.</p>

<p>Right now, we are being looted by the elite and its been going on for about 45 years. This is why it sucks so bad. They looted us for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is, is that they&#39;ve already made peaceful protests worthless. Whether it&#39;s &quot;free speech zones&quot;, or beating peaceful protesters. They don&#39;t care, peaceful protesting doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s like pissing into the wind. I do not, and never condone violence, but we are at a point were we must decide as a nation. We can protest all we want, and they allow it because nothing will actually happen other than people hitting the &quot;like/share&quot; button. If voting actually mattered, we wouldn&#39;t be allowed to do it. I&#39;ve been to plenty of &quot;protests&quot;, only to go back to the hotel room and see they vote against the public&#39;s will, hence the quote. </p>
