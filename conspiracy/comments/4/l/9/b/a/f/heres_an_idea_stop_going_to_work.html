       So you're a mediocre remixer of music that's used to make ambient noise to cover up the awful situation that is women make more paper by being exploited and exposing themselves to disgusting people like you instead of doing something they like because all other jobs aren't hiring or don't pay enough to make an enjoyable living? You're filth and we have plenty of better DJs you fucking unoriginal twat. Congratulations champ, you're part of the problem and on top of that you make shit money.

       Ok, let's say that everyone comes to this conclusion, and every single person quits their job and starts bumming for change. Then what, genius? Who grows, prepares, and ships our food? Who creates the technology you're using to complain on Reddit? If everyone is bumming, where does the money come from? You have an extremely narrow and selfish viewpoint.

       The way OP was talking, it came across to me that he seemed a little arrogant. I was tired and probably got more annoyed at it than I should have. I still don't think having people just stop working will fix anything, but at this point I've stopped caring. I don't know why you would consider having a job slavery, but I'm not going to change your mind on it. We're on the internet after all. So sure, bum as much as you want.

       the reason it is slavery is because you make a disproportionate amount less than the person with nothing more than leverage over you via corporate/small business law.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason it is slavery is because every hammer you bang for someone else could have been banged for yourself.

       So let's say that you have the skills/resources necessary to provide for yourself without participating in the monetary system. This would still require you to have land on which to live. How do you propose people get out of paying property taxes?

       Easier said then done, and it's a process (trust me). People need weening, much like getting off opiates. You cannot just quit cold turkey for the most part. I agree with your OP, but it's not completely rational (for the masses). If people just quit work, then there would be chaos within a few days. It's an educational and spiritual process. May not see it in my lifetime, but planting the seeds is important. We must not forget the vacuum which is caused by chaos (example: our meddling in the ME).

       I don't have a "job" or a 9-5, so that is not the issue. My issue is within your OP, in regards to the masses. Sure, people could do what you are saying, but most live day-to-day. I guess if you have a sick day or vacation time you could do this, but many don't have that....

       They'll figure out how to get by, you will too. Not doing something because the others won't join you is cowardice. Be brave and do something, or don't and complain about the broken system you work for.

       I like it. How much better off would we be if we could stop selling ourselves for 40+ hours a week, and instead spending that time with our family and land. Learning to fix our own machines, grow our own food, and loving our neighbors. If we stopped working, our communities would actually mean something. No longer would we have that "weird fella" next door. He then becomes entertainment, or a helping hand when your fence is down. I see it as a step in living a more civilized and loving lifestyle.

       Very truth. Now money is still necessary for things like medications and such, for those who take them. It also helps to purchase motor oil and certain goods to help keep the homestead alive. It seems important for some jobs to remain, but I believe living by craft and trade should be a more acceptable way to live. Imagine how much food could grow on the the space McDonald's takes up. I could probably talk about this for hours. But what do I know anyway.

       That's another thing. Humans have survived hundreds of years without this modern day medicine. We could probably go back to our routes and be able to cure tons of things. Many people are against herbal medicines but I for one would choose herbs over modern day medicine. The thing with herbs is you can't just eat a bunch of herbs and expect it to fix it without fully changing your diet. You need to stop eating the garbage food that made you sick in the first place is the key!

       Yes! Food is medicine, and more people die from medications than from herbal medicines all the time. This could be because more people use prescription drugs but I dunno. It's an unfortunate world we live in, I'm looking forward to the archaic revival.

       Yeah I honestly believe things interfere purposely with the herbal remedies to make them not work. They could also claim some herbs cure things that it doesn't really cure and then use them as examples. It's really evident if you eat certain herbs it really cleans you out, you can feel it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples you can all relate to is
      </p>
      <p>
       Spicy food makes your mucus runny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another is if you smoke weed you'll probably notice the same sort of thing happens. As long as you don't smoke tobacco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain herbs make worms leave your body, although I've never tried it a simple google search proves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr Sebi claims mucus is what really kills us, I believe it. Imagine a perfectly clean body with no mucus. I remember as a kid I would never be stuffed up but now that I've aged I notice it. People will tell you you're stupid for thinking like that but I would say if you use your imagination it's a conclusion that could very well be true.

       I never thought of that but I can't disagree with the idea. Much of the world it toxic, and unfortunately I don't think it is something that can be escaped overnight. Our food has been too modified, seeds from apples are not true, and I wouldn't imagine it would be easy to find non modified ingredients. I'm truly uncertain as to how the modification would be resolved.

       Indeed. Also uses less money on my part, as well as less waste when it comes to shipping and such. I always wonder why people don't turn their lawns into gardens. Maybe it's just too much work, as they have their 40+ hour week jobs. Boom. Brought it back.
