    <div class="md"><p>Well, I hate to say it but Sandy Hook is one of the more blatant conspiracies out there. They didn&#39;t even act well; not one tear was shed for 26 children murdered? I mean, this sounds callous, sure, but when you see a legitimate bombing in the middle east, you see the mothers crying for their children. You see the legitimate emotion, the tears, the people actively computing that their own children just died. In these Newtown folks we see quite the opposite, we see laughs, we see pictures, we hear parents reciting stories word by word on different news programs as if reading from a script, we see a supposed school that looks like it hasn&#39;t had real children in it for about a decade, with water damage and mold rotting the halls, and we don&#39;t see one dead child. Nothing to imply a mass murder nonetheless. </p>

<p>Is teaching at the U. S. Marine Corps War College and lecturing before the U. S. Department of Defense’s Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy a prerequisite for Dr. Eowyn (AKA Dr. Maria Hsia Chang) being an expert Sandy Hook Hoaxer?</p>

<p>Who Is “Dr. Eowyn”?</p>

<p>So,... Dr. Chang (AKA Dr. Eowyn) is an EXPERT about a psychiatric condition that Dr. James Fetzer and Dr. James Tracy suffer from (narcissistic personality disorder or NPD) and they are ALL Expert Sandy Hook Hoaxers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to mention my personal theory about SH because it seems to make the most sense without invoking hugely dystopic conspiracy theories. Not saying I&#39;m right, but just keep it in mind while you look at stuff...</p>

<p>Basically, Sandy Hook was a witness protection town, and that school was for high-value target families. That&#39;s why they had security doors and regular evac drill for the kids.</p>

<p>Some &quot;bad guys&quot; found the town and made a hit, targeting the kids  for &quot;payback&quot;. Afterwards the Feds of course had to cover it all up to maintain operational security, protect the surviving familes, and also save face.</p>

<p>This also explains why the &quot;hoax&quot; seemed rushed and a little thin at places. They were scrambling for damage control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were in witness protection then why would they parade themselves all over the news and the Super Bowl? That would be antithetical to the whole idea of witness protection.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a bad hypothesis, especially compared to some others regarding SH, but I don&#39;t think it holds water. Although that would probably explain how all those houses were listed as being sold for $0, so who knows... </p>

<p>But based on the news all over the web which showed where in the house Adam&#39;s bedroom was (like an architect&#39;s drawing), there was no way the photos that were shown on tv could have been his room.</p>

<p>I think they razed the house since then, so now no one can prove this.</p>

<p>Anyway, I second what someone said above: Sandy Hook is one of the more egregious and carelessly staged events....one which necessarily included the involvement of the federal government, at minimum. It&#39;s far more likely that it was the brainchild of the federal government as it allows more restrictions on citizens and more latitude by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on your replies in this thread, it seems this request and your intent are serious. The first thing you&#39;ve got to realize is that many, many people you will interact with and see on-line are paid to spread misinformation or shut down people&#39;s curiosity on this and many other issues. It sounds nuts but it&#39;s true. One of the most common refrains is &quot;it makes more sense to me that there are just bad people who do bad things.&quot; I agree. It makes more sense to me, too. But you shouldn&#39;t let that guide your inquiry. Or at least, don&#39;t let that turn you away from investigating the truth. </p>

<p>Here is an analogy I like to use. Imagine you find a dead body in the middle of a field. You find a gunshot wound to the back of the head and the corpse has its hands tied behind its back. But the corpse was not just anyone, he was the town saint, a wonderful man beloved by all. You wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Ah what possible motive could somebody have to kill this man. It must have been a suicide.&quot; No, you do a forensic investigation to determine cause of death. Then you can try to figure out who and why. The same applies here. Don&#39;t dismiss the evidence because you don&#39;t know what the motive is or because the motive that everyone seems to be telling you seems a ridiculous. Hell you might never really be able to figure it out. First look at the evidence. What does it tell you? From that you can try to figure out who and why. </p>

<p>Actually, that is one of the reasons I completely dismissed the possibility of the Sandy Hook hoax, hearing that it was Obama who wanted to ram through gun control. So I never even bothered to look at it. But once I finally did, and finally got deep enough down the rabbit hole, I realized that not only was it hoaxed, but it was almost certainly not hoaxed for the reasons we are told. I admit that gun control might be one of the things on the agenda, but if so Sandy Hook played a small role in that agenda, which will take longer to implement (if ever). What I find more plausible is the theory that one of the things Sandy Hook did was to give an enormous boost to guns sales. And guess who owns all the weapons manufacturers? It&#39;s the billionaire and trillionaire families that own the rest of the world and are profiting handsomely. Handgun sales have never been higher. To quote from <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">this paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neither side is ever telling you the truth, because they are both trying to make a buck off of you. The gun control people are trying to get more taxes for “Homeland Security,” while the gun advocates are hoping to sell you a gun. Just imagine the total market for domestic arms sales in the past five years. It boggles the mind. </p>

<p>Which means the government is probably playing both sides, as usual. I would be willing to bet that most of the money spent on guns in the US since Obama took office has gone into the pockets of the same billionaires who are profiting from Homeland Security. It is doubtful that most folks have ever thought of that. </p>

<p>Those who haven&#39;t should study the recent history of Smith&amp;Wesson. Did you know that Smith&amp;Wesson was bought out in a hostile takeover in 2001, and that the government was involved?
Remember, 2001 was also year one of DHS. Coincidence? Did you know that the $200 million company was bought for $15 million, and that this rock-bottom price was due to fire-arm regulation by President Clinton? Did you know that after an initial plunge due to the Clinton regulation, their sales have since skyrocketed?  </p>

<p>Just a coincidence, right? Did you know that the buyer of Smith&amp;Wesson was a start-up company named Saf-T-Hammer? We are told it was a maker of gun locks, but it wasn&#39;t. It was a start-up
company with no history of making anything. “Saf-T-Hammer never manufactured that lock independently before buying out S&amp;W, and does not now manufacture it separately from the guns.”</p>

<p>This brings up the question of who does own Saf-T-Hammer. Well the company changed names to Smith and Wesson Holding Group, which now has 83% Institutional Ownership. What does that mean? It means the company is owned by institutions, mainly investment firms and banks. The two biggest owners are the Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments, but other owners include the Royal Bank of Canada, ING, and Barclays. So my suspicion is proved true once again. The billionaire investors are making money off you both ways: they tax you for Homeland Security, which scares you into buying guns, and the money you spend on guns also goes to them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is more interesting stuff at the link. It&#39;s actually an important paper to read for anyone getting into conspiracy theories, because it points out the fact that even the most out-there conspiracy theorists are virtually all controlled opposition, and the more well known they are, the more likely that is true. </p>

<p>Now, as for Sandy Hook, one thing to keep in mind is that some of the evidence you&#39;ll come across for a hoax has been debunked. But usually debunkers think if they&#39;ve debunked one or two of the points, that&#39;s all they need to do to discredit the rest. But that&#39;s not how it works. They&#39;ve got to debunk everything, and if they can&#39;t then the hoax argument carries the day (assuming the remaining arguments and evidence are strong enough to support the hoax hypothesis). Such are the rules of debate. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s impossible to know what the real motives and agenda behind the hoax are. I suspect it was meant to work at many levels and achieve many different ends, but that is something we can only really speculate about out. Still, the fact that we don&#39;t know what the motive is or that it just doesn&#39;t seem possible, shouldn&#39;t stop us from examining the evidence. </p>

<p>Somebody already linked to the Fetzer book, so I won&#39;t do that here (BTW Fetzer is part of the controlled opposition, too. But you see disinfo agents always have to give you some truth to get you hooked before they divert you). But here are some videos that I have found very convincing:</p>

<p>This video shows that not only was David Wheeler (one of the alleged fathers of a child allegedly killed at Sandy Hook) dressed up as an FBI SWAT member the day of the event (although he his not in proper uniform), but he also doesn&#39;t know how to hold a weapon properly, as any sniper would:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPdFoEE4_A0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPdFoEE4_A0</a></p>

<p>And here is Gene Rosen rehearsing his lines for the camera (though it didn&#39;t seem to help since his recounting of events seemed to change with each new interview):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igfczc6m5M4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igfczc6m5M4</a></p>

<p>Those two are short but for me are kind of like smoking gun evidence. </p>

<p>Here are two longer ones that compile a lot of other information:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0z275nQnM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD0z275nQnM</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMdynxBDVQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yMdynxBDVQ</a></p>

<p>And this one on Robbie Parker&#39;s speech after his daugher&#39;s funeral:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SkJg1SzC6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SkJg1SzC6I</a></p>

<p>There are just too many anomalies that simply cannot be explained away. The mainstream Sandy Hook narrative is simply impossible to reconcile with all this evidence. And as Sherlock Holmes said, &quot;when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot; And I agree the hoax alternative is a HUGE pill to swallow as it comes with so many implications of how the world actually works these days. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you do come to the conclusion (as have many others) that Sandy Hook was a hoax, then you might be interested in learning about some other recent hoaxes. See the links in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4hkwy4/school_shootings_planned_and_carried_out_with/d2sokjc">this comment of mine</a> for more on Boston, San Bernardino, Paris and Brussels. And that is just the tip of the iceberg of hoaxes and manufactured events stretching way back.... welcome to the Matrix!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve read this a few times now watching the videos and rereading your post. I never gave much thought about how it could all be cycling back into the big corps pockets. I haven&#39;t looked it up but i am curious to know the sales in pharmaceuticals after this happened. When you mentioned the gun control and sales it makes me think of the split it has caused in the nation of pro and anti gun control. Could that be another agenda with pharmaceuticals? I for one think kids are being pumped with to many meds and there are people im sure who think that we need these meds to prevent this kind of stuff from happening. 
The thought of the government and big corps being on both sides all so they can benefit in the end with money makes me think of the drug market in this country and how they could be the ones filtering in the drugs and busting the drug users to keep private jails packed. Then again that is a whole other topic that i won&#39;t get into ha! 
Thank you so much for these videos and making me think  little harder on  what you have presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know nothing about Sandy hook so I&#39;m not trying to convince you, but it seems to me that events like these all could contribute to a &quot;strategy of tension&quot; that has a few benefits for those in power. People are scared, ask for more security, meanwhile you&#39;re fueling the anti gun movement, maybe a few new measures here and there. 
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always as easy as event A leads to government goal Y, it could be a way to keep the pressure up so that after a while people can point back and use the number of attacks as an argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man. I&#39;m on this subreddit because I do believe in some conspiracy theories, but this one &amp; the boston marathon bombing are too insane. Actors? Really? You&#39;re going to do something that creates potential liabilities (coz what if one of them grows a conscience father down the line?) and just let them walk around? That&#39;s sloppy. Professionals aren&#39;t sloppy, and following the logic, those events must have been orchestrated by professionals. Also: why? To take our guns? Pretty sure everyone has guns still, so why go through all that trouble and risk just to...what? Create a dialogue? At least with 9/11 they actually ended up invading Iraq.</p>

<p>I think the basis of these theories is an inability to accept the fact that the universe is random, the idea that terrible things don&#39;t happen to good people for no reason. They do. People don&#39;t want to live in a world where a psychopath can just go out and kill innocent people or children, where they can&#39;t do anything to prevent it. But that&#39;s the real world. That&#39;s life. They rationalize: if it was all part of a larger scheme, all orchestrated, then at least it&#39;s not completely senseless. Even though the implication that our government would fake an atrocity like this is even more disturbing than the fact there&#39;s just psychotic individuals out there and there&#39;s nothing we can do to completely safe-guard ourselves against death, it&#39;s easier to swallow than accepting we don&#39;t have as much control over our lives as we lead ourselves to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think all that many people are against gun ownership in general, but are against the wrong people having them and don&#39;t like them taking them some places (though obama did expand gun rights as to where you can take them).</p>

<p>The government has the means to do a lot, even without congress, and they still haven&#39;t done much (although the right swore to high heaven obama would ban all the guns when he won and gun shops/companies made a fortune off people believing that - they seem to profit more than most).</p>

<p>Heck, maybe the nra trains some people to do shit to stir the pot, then there is talk of gun control on tv and their membership goes up and ammo/gun companies make a ton of money off the fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, here is my problem though.</p>

<p>People get labeled &quot;Anti-Gun&quot; when they say or try to discuss anything about guns.</p>

<p>I am pro-2nd like I am with other amendments. Have owned a gun. Most my family has conceal carry permits.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t want kids to be allowed to carry guns in schools and I don&#39;t want people carrying them on planes. That, to some, would make be anti-gun.</p>

<p>Of course you will get a rush of people who will say &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t want that either&quot; but then you have to ask them &quot;Where do you draw lines and which ones do you draw?&quot;</p>

<p>Trying to even have that discussion, not even proposing laws but asking about things and looking for solutions, means to some folks you hate guns and want them all banned.</p>

<p>Some people do go to extremes and want them banned, and they show up more on the news when shit happens. But I think most would like some sort of real world solution.</p>

<p>AND I find it funny that conservatives here freak out when it comes to guns and such suggestions but then want to ban all muslims coming here for &#39;safety reasons&#39; - so they think banning things will make america safer. When it&#39;s not guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be very ignorant or a shill, because anyone posting here is certainly old enough to remember December 2012 and the months after.  How many state laws were rammed through?  I remember a recall of gun-banning politicians in Colorado and massive non-compliance of a magazine ban in New York State.  How many Executive Orders were issued?   Instructing agencies like the VA, IRS and Social Security Admin how to deal with citizens who own guns.  Basically it&#39;s a bunch of new ways to take them away.  California has a special police force that only does one thing - takes away citizens&#39; gun rights - literally going and taking the guns.  </p>

<p>But I have really skipped the main reason for Sandy Hook - <strong>the attempt to ram through a total ban on citizen ownership of firearms.</strong>  Horrific school shootings have been used to push through total bans in England and Australia.  4 years ago Venezuela banned citizen ownership of guns.  Now there is a total collapse with the citizens at the mercy of the police and military.  In England they are now banning knives and glass beer mugs.  It never stops.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t work with Sandy Hook because America is different.  Many already don&#39;t trust the media or the government.   And guns are too much a way of life.  More and more citizens are owning and carrying guns, especially women and minorities.  Even if the next Sandy Hook is real, it still won&#39;t work.  It&#39;ll just sell more guns.  And it will be closely examined for evidence of fakery.  The Sandy Hook operation was really sloppy.  The evidence was everywhere you cared to look.   Maybe that was the point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I see. Someone who doesn&#39;t agree with you is a shill or ignorant.</p>

<p>Yet here you are implying it was done in an effort to ban guns. Not I said &quot;It was done&quot; as though you think the government killed a bunch of kids to get gun legislation passed - when, you know, they could have rigged elections for such a thing.</p>

<p>And, oh yeah, Obama had a dem congress at first. And what did he focus on? Guns? Or health care issues?</p>

<p>Anyway - you just said americans were different, as though only you knew that and the government secret societies didn&#39;t. So they just figured, hey, we will either really kill some kids or fake it and suddenly people will want to ban guns.</p>

<p>You see how silly it is all sounding?</p>

<p>here is a better view on it: We have a lot of guns in this country and by sheer numbers alone you will have some crazy ass fuckers who will use what they have access to in order to do stupid shit. </p>

<p>Everyday you can find stories of kids being shot, kids shooting others, people randomly using guns in rape, robberies, etc.</p>

<p>But you, you think because one of these episodes was really bad that obama/et al must be the real culprits.</p>

<p>Not some white, generally christian, american with access to guns who snapped.</p>

<p>No...I am the idiot and shill to you. Because you don&#39;t want to imagine an america where some gun owner doesn&#39;t use it for target practice or hunting.</p>

<p>Face it, some people suck. And some of them have guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you know what, it is worse now.</p>

<p>Look at trump. He is scaring people into voting for him &quot;them illegals is gonna rape you! Isis hasn&#39;t had one bullet fired at em by obummer, they is coming here to kill you! Our military is so weak we can&#39;t even fly enough planes to kill everyone. America sucks but we can make it strong again!&quot;</p>

<p>You know who the terror shit works on? Conservatives. Every day they live in fear of brown people, non-christian people, and they are 100% absolutely certain that if Obama is elected he will take your guns (more fear).</p>

<p>Heck, you could make the case 9/11 was planned and needed bush in power. If it were a dem we would have real investigations (like with benghazi). But instead we got salutes, patriotism, homeland security, patriot act - and unlike with benghazi where 4 died and people blamed obama/hillary we had folks telling you that you hated america if you questioned the president.</p>

<p>You need a conservative base/president for these things to work.</p>
