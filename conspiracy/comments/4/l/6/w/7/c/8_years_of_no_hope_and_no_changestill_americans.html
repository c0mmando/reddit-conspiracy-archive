<p>Trumpmacho is has been lobbying the government his whole adult life. If Capital Hill lobbyists could dream of their own stooge president, it would be Trump. In fact, he has donated multiple times to Hillary Clinton. He is not even big money, he can be easily bought out by trillionaires. </p>

<p>I agree that there is no candidate better than him campaigning now , but he will definitely oversee the Corporate takeover of a long dead Republic. After all his campaign manager Steven Mnuchin is a Goldman Sachs veteran and a George Soros favourite. Trump is a a whole psyop on the people but no different than the others.</p>

<p>Trump win for presidency will just collapse the US quicker than Americans imagined. For predictive programming of Trump presidency, see the Simpsons episode 17, season 11...15 years ago before Trump imagined himself presidential.</p>

If things start getting shitty with him, I&#39;m pretty sure that people won&#39;t just stare and do nothing like usual. In the end it&#39;s not about Trump, it&#39;s about changing a system based on lies and delusions of democracy. If Trump wins, people might start realizing the power that they have.

<p>Both Trump &amp; Clinton are corporate stooges. I&#39;m not sure about Sanders. Maybe he is, maybe he isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Up here in Soviet Canuckistan we have socialized health care and it&#39;s fucking awesome. Watching how Americans are subjected to straight up fear mongering just pisses me off.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of ideological terms like capitalism or socialism or any kind of ism except for maybe humanism because it makes people vote using emotion rather than reason.</p>

<p>Fact: the US pharma industry is a bunch of legalized dope dealers using loaded studies and advertising to sell overpriced drugs that should be much more affordable.</p>

<p>The US medical industry is for profit which blows because it turns people&#39;s misery and suffering into dollar signs for overpaid doctors, executives, and insurance companies.</p>

<p>Nuts to that.</p>

<p>The whole line &#39;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#39; can be argued in favour of universal health care and the government responsibility to not just protect it&#39;s citizens but enable them to have a quality of life that lets them excel without all the burdens that comes with being poor as fuck or stuck working shit jobs because it has health benefits.</p>

<p>Liberalism in the US got taken over like 2 decades ago by the upper class. The media got taken over by them too. Same with the fucking schools.</p>

<p>Nowadays, liberal kids just learn bullshit identity politics and don&#39;t know shit about finances.</p>

<p>On the other side, the right is just a bunch of contrarians responding to the retarded bullshit coming from &#39;liberal&#39; corporate media or schools run by the Ivy League elite.</p>

<p>Look at student loan debt. The debt is nearing 2 trillion dollars selling kids classes about garbage. Look at the prison industry. Taxpayers pick up the tab for an industry that exploits poverty, frames poor people as criminals, and profits rich assholes. Seniors are in no better shape.</p>

<p>Every generation, every demographic group is being played against each other so the system keeps grinding every last nickel from decent people and it&#39;s not right.</p>

Trump has been the only public figure who has called out Obama on his birth certificate fiasco, he has been around for so long and has always been the same person. He is rough around the edges the as he doesn&#39;t have a filter, he&#39;s never needed one, he&#39;s been an alpha his whole life thanks to his family&#39;s money. </p>

<p>Read up on Orly Taitz.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck about Obama. To me, he&#39;s no different than Hillary Clinton but that birther bullshit was just Israel exerting their dominance over Obama by pointing out that they could decimate him in the press if he didn&#39;t tow the line.</p>

<p>Watch this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZGxvchtQwrQ">https://youtu.be/ZGxvchtQwrQ</a></p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Uo-UXZ-1ups">https://youtu.be/Uo-UXZ-1ups</a></p>

<p>Obama took a fairly neutral position to the middle east conflict which pissed off his benefactors. Biden being Obama&#39;s VP was all up Israel&#39;s ass so if Obama got thrown out over the debacle, they&#39;d still have a guy on the inside.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just a rich douchebag that panders to the Conservative demographic. He&#39;s not an &#39;alpha&#39;, he&#39;s just rich. I don&#39;t really understand American&#39;s insane loyalty towards rich people when the upper class is the ones that have been fucking everyone over for decades.</p>

<p>According to stats, Trumps supporters are on average upper middle class. We&#39;re talking mid level manager salary range. Most of his base tends to be happy with the status quo despite the fact that the middle class has been shrinking for decades and the cost of living has gone up extremely while quality of life standards have gone down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over 50% of millennials prefer socialism to capitalism now, so the government-corporate shilling for socialism through Michael Moore, university, media, student loan corruption is going great. The government has no problem changing a system from charging consumers privately where the gov has less control, to charging the public overall through forced taxation for a health care system the gov manages itself. In the US the health care system isn&#39;t bad due to it being private but the lack of competition that lets insurance companies not have a bottom line risk if they decide to be shitty and overcharge; the lack of competition is owed to state boundaries that only permit a few insurance companies to exist per states and some have monopolies on states, so it&#39;s basically totalitarian. That&#39;s where the corruption and high prices stem from. And the big pharma-government partnership is an enormous part of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is beating the politicians at their own games: namely lying.  He has spent his life doing everything he says he is against.  He buys politicians for favorable dealings, he hires foreign workers for his hotels, he has his crappy products made in Bangladesh and China, and he sells people a dream based on lies aka Trump University.   He was born rich, went to the best schools, borrowed daddy&#39;s money, inherited more of daddy&#39;s money, and still went bankrupt 4 times.  He lies constantly oh he is a Christian and loves the evangelicals too hahaha.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are not. They want us to be distracted by this divisive dog and pony show that is the presidential race. The president is picked for us and our votes don&#39;t matter. Trump is only here to make sure The Dark Queen wins and Bernie is just here to give the illusion of hope and give the sjw&#39;s more migro-aggressions to waste their energy on. Unless we all start ignoring this pander pageant and get as passionate with who we put in local office as who we do in the oval one, then nothing will change. Personally, I don&#39;t think people are all of a sudden going to stop voting against their own self interest and just start educating themselves using the right avenues. We need to get out into the streets and I&#39;m not talking about this Occupy bullshit where people just sing kumbaya and make people late for work. In order to make real change anger must replace apathy and convenience. I&#39;m not very optimistic but I have a lot of popcorn and people in my bubble. Time to sit back, relax and watch the show. But make no mistake, in the rare instance that we actually do get fed up enough to take our country back then you&#39;ll be able to find me on the front lines. Change starts from the ground up not the top down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s even more than that. What is required is a change in lifestyle. This can&#39;t be voted away. The powers that be stay the powers that be because we patronize them. Stop it immediately. Take everything back starting at the local level. Don&#39;t shop or eat at a chain/franchise. Buy your food locally. Scrimp and save and don&#39;t accumulate revolving debt. You also don&#39;t need to buy/lease a new car every few years. The system survives because of consumption. If you stop consuming the system can&#39;t survive. No matter how poor you are it is more than possible to do this. It may not be fun, but it&#39;s doable and it will bring everything crashing to a halt.</p>

<p>On top of that, take back everything. I don&#39;t mean like marxism sieze the means of production, but more basically, buy the stores and own them locally. Get your city/town to take control of waste management locally. WM and BFI aren&#39;t the only game in town.</p>

<p>As far as banks go, only do business with your local credit union. It makes vacations a pain in the ass, but plan ahead. </p>

<p>Stop buying junk. You don&#39;t need to upgrade your smart phone every 20 months. Google and Apple are souless cunts. Stop giving them your money. Internet is a bitch (especially since Obama sold us down the river to the kings of the internet) but right now there&#39;s no way out of it. Dump cable. Listen to sports on the radio or go out to watch the game. </p>

<p>Basically, their power stem from the fact that they have something you want (or think you need). You don&#39;t need any of it. If you have to pay more for local food you won&#39;t starve (satiation vs. necessity). If you don&#39;t have the newest entertainment you&#39;ll still figure out how to amuse yourself. They can&#39;t force you to buy it.</p>

<p>Also, as mentioned above, vote in your fucking local elections and your state elections. Don&#39;t vote for people who emphasize their party membership. Get concrete plans and hold their feet to the fire. Even if you like your senator or rep, you should give them an angry phone call at least once a year. Same goes for your local legislature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and without needlessly going on and on, I&#39;ll just say that I do all of that and more. However, it still isn&#39;t enough. We can&#39;t get enough numbers to do anything.  As long as people continue to be a slave to technology and apathetic instead of angry it will continue. As long as the under qualified, trigger happy, militarized police force have their boots to our necks, most people aren&#39;t willing to risk getting their ass beat, losing their jobs, going to jail, etc for a war they think isn&#39;t winnable. Enough people don&#39;t realize their will to fight is being snuffed out by social media and technology. I mean, how bad does it have to get until people put down their laptops and pick up their &quot;pitchforks&quot;? Unfortunately, I believe we are going to find out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Simpsons episodes were probably referencing how Trump had presidential aspirations earlier in life. Like the failed Reform party in the 90&#39;s. A lot of Trump&#39;s platform now is the same stuff that Ross Perot was on about way back then. Unfortunately for us we got Bill Clinton instead. Who got rid of Glass-Steagall, and gave us NAFTA. And were living the results of that.</p>

<p>My opinion is Trump is just reviving that reform party platform using what he has learned in reality TV about how to be popular with the people. And as we have seen it has been remarkably successful. Some say Trump is just a part of the plan, and it&#39;s just a big show. If that&#39;s the case though you have to wonder why would the elite even risk it? Other world leaders are already sweating over it not knowing where things stand if suddenly the USA actually elects a Nationalist leader instead of the Globalist one&#39;s they are used to. Will anything change? And if Trump&#39;s a fake why even give us that hope? Isn&#39;t that playing with fire?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that what you got from that?  I suppose I believe in the system to the extent that it exists, but thats as far as it goes. My whole schitck on these subs is that I want reform.  If cleaning house means tearing it down and building a new one so be it.  Thats my ideal solution.</p>

<p>But, what I think are possible outcomes are based mainly on whats gone before.  Traditional American style reform is to take something thats broken and mismanaged, and start running it more efficiently and better, without fixing the basic problems.  The net result is that things do get better, but nothing is really solved.  Its how the country was founded.  Right now when America takes something over it breaks it then moves on to the next target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Badon, I actually liked your post. You focus is on how he is helping Hillary. My post is about how absurd it is hoping a seasoned lobbyist who has given money to Hillary  saving America from capital Hill lobbyists. Like expecting the  Fox to guard the hen house.
Regardless, I enjoyed your post for its own merit and focus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. He couldn&#39;t have imagined getting this far. But the constant media attention and his candid social media accounts have propelled him to this level.</p>

<p>But now that he is in this massive position of power, what&#39;s stopping him from selling out to the highest bidder?</p>

<p>There are all ready reports of Adelson donating large sums of money. For all the talk of anti-establishment politicians, he has now embraced them and has his place at the table with the party.</p>

<p>People will defend him by saying that he needs to do these things to be president. He is doing a 180 on his campaign. What&#39;s from stopping him from doing a 180 on his views or policies? Why would this man that has profited off of shady business practices not maximize his time at the White House and exploit the country?</p>

<p>This is people willing to let the wolf in the hen house. Crazy times.</p>

<p>Concerning Adelson, I strongly suspect arm twisting. Do you think only bad guys are capable of extortion? From my understanding of the state of things, it was the smart play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please...save it. The guy bought off politicians so that his business could succeed. If you go back the last 30 yrs, Donald has had the same stance on EVERYTHING. Now, he&#39;s at a point where he can do something about it. You think if he was apart of the club, he would&#39;ve been one of the first people to bring up Obama&#39;s birth certificate??? No. Trump is the real deal. Now get on the train, or get run over. </p>

<p>According to his own words on that day and since then, he KNEW the towers were going to collapse before the first one fell.</p>

<p>NOPE!</p>

<p>He saved his own ass.</p>

One of Trumps campaign managers is the man who facilitated Lucky Larry&#39;s deal to get the WTC lease. BTW... Larry was not the highest bidder.</p>
