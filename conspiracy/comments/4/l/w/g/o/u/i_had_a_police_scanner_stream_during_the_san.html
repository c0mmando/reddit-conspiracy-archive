        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Corrected for the city name. The live feed was on reddit at the time of the shooting, then this, and then the feed got cut. Of particular note: Only 3 minutes pass between a SWAT team being intercepted enroute to the overpass, and the overpass being declared as clear. </p>

<p><strong>If I disappear tomorrow, plz feed my dogs thanks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part 1: report of suspects stripping clothes on bridge 12:50pm</strong>
<a href="https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h13m25s">https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h13m25s</a>
first mention is: 1h12m25s
&quot;two unknown males removing black clothing and throwing it over the bridge&quot; this was the same time that 1 male in black mask was in the black Suburban fleeing the seen. Now, the dispatcher is repeating this information for the guy heading the SWAT team to that location, which the dispatcher said something to the effect of a citizen reported it, and someone already went there and declared UTL (unable to locate), but, obviously whoever declared UTL the first time was not police, since the police where heading there for the very first time.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: SWAT team dispatched to bridge 12:52pm</strong>
Here they go with a SWAT team to check out the two men at the Hunts Lane overpass: <a href="https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h15m44s">https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h15m44s</a></p>

<p><strong>Part 3: Someone at base intercepts SWAT and tells them to come back. SWAT never goes to bridge.</strong> Caller says SWAT will be &quot;replaced&quot; with &quot;uh...other bodies&quot; but does not specify who. This implies that there were other teams on the ground already, that the caller was not allowed to identify to dispatch. Or, he wasn&#39;t sure who was going to the overpass but didn&#39;t want to sent SWAT resources there. This also makes sense.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h16m46s">https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h16m46s</a></p>

<p><strong>Part 4: ONLY 1 minute LATER someone calls into dispatch and declares 12:53pm &quot;clear UTL on Hunts Lane overpass area&quot; (UTL=unable to locate).</strong> Caller doesn&#39;t identify himself or explain how or what team got to the overpass and searched it all in <strong>under one minute</strong>, including travel time.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h19m37s">https://youtu.be/UUCYgq6QzIk?t=1h19m37s</a></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>

<p>3 white males in black clothing reported at shooting.</p>

<p>1 white male in black driving Suburban getaway vehicle</p>

<p>2 white males in black clothing stripping off black clothing nearby overpass</p>

<p>SWAT dispatched to overpass. SWAT intercepted and told to return</p>

<p>2 minutes and 32 seconds later, unknown caller declares the entire area UTL (unable to locate). Apparently caller was able to replace SWAT team, make it to overpass, and search the area in under 3 minutes. Mentions nothing of the men, the clothes, nothing. Whoever those two men were, they escaped. Or never existed.</p>

<p>1+2=3</p>

<p>now, it is possible they had the overpass already under surveillance, or, maybe a drone in the area. Or the &quot;uh, other bodies&quot; the caller refers to, were there already. Doesn&#39;t explain why SWAT was called off, or who replaced SWAT. The quote &quot;uh...other bodies&quot; is a bit disconcerting. The caller is going to replace the SWAT team with a team that he cannot name to dispatch. That&#39;s odd. And again, only three minutes passed from the time SWAT was called off, until the time the area was declared clear.</p>

<p>It is also possible that this is nothing at all, as only one citizen caller reported it, and law enforcement was unable to verify it. Also, by &quot;other bodies&quot;, the caller might mean he wasn&#39;t sure who, but it was a waste of SWAT resources. But I like a good conspiracy.</p>

<p>EDIT: not sure if/when he identified himself as FBI. I was operating off memory, I haven&#39;t relisted to all the recording before the parts posted. He probably identifies himself, the other officers do. Whoever he was, he had the authority to call off a SWAT team, so he was <em>somebody</em>, we can be sure of that.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: dispatch was forwarding reports of TWO men (no race provided) on the bridge, and ONE male in black mask in suburban. The caller from inside the building is the one who stated all three men were white.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: FRONT PAGE WE DID IT REDDIT something something</p>

<p>Most honest journalists were fired, sent to RT, or went freelance. 
What you have now are political lobbyists and consultants posing as panelists, and relatives on political figures or ex political figures as your new &quot;Anchors&quot;</p>

<p>I can see it happening.  First reports by &quot;eye witnesses&quot; are notoriously flawed.  People see what <em>they expect to see</em>, most of the time.  In a panicky situation, all bets are off.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in NC and when the story broke, I can&#39;t remember if I got an alert on my phone or what, but we were suddenly all in front of the tv in the living room and the NEWS reported 3 white men. the next day they had turned into a Muslim husband and wife. I was genuinely confused and remember saying to my dad and boyfriend.. wait, eyewitnesses said 3 white men, what happened to them? </p>

<p>that&#39;s when I stopped believing anything else reported on this. before this event I would have never been on r/conspiracy and I made fun of my boyfriend for being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.. suddenly he didn&#39;t seem so out there with his beliefs... after this... I&#39;m so fucking suspicious of anything the gov&#39;t claims and have gone back to review other incidents... the french bombings just before this even have some strange eye witness reports that were never followed up or pursued.</p>

<p>anyway, I just wanted to point out that the news media reported 3 white men from eye witness accounts the day this happened. </p>

With all my conspiracy buddies that I bullshit with no matter how much we disagree on we always have common ground in making fun of the flat earthers. I thought they were all trolls but believe it or not there are some real Mccoys. They think the earth is flat and all the &quot;globular&quot; earth and space  is an elaborate conspiracy. They think the north pole is in the middle and that Antarctica is an ice ring that goes all the way  around the flat earth. It&#39;s the best shit ever.

    <div class="md"><p>To play devils advocate here: during the time of a mass shooting, reports come in from literally every direction. Nearly every person in the country, let alone city, is on the look out for suspicious shit, and they will call 911 at the smallest sighting of something &quot;off.&quot;</p>

<p>If you remember, which looking through this thread people don&#39;t, there was a report of a propane explosion as well. Now, all 3 major media outlets reported BOTH the &quot;dark figures throwing clothes over the bridge&quot; as well as the explosion and were attributing both to the terrorist shooting. What is the conspiracy here if even the already-controlled media airs both of these for all to see?</p>

<p>Talk to a first responder during a crisis incident. Information comes in like this every single time, and every single time people think it&#39;s related. Not saying that this couldn&#39;t be a conspiracy in the end, but people please, have some common sense and think things through from every angle/position thoroughly.</p>

An annomous source posted on Instagram on the Wednesday that the charade involving two young males was set to occur Friday morning. So of course I set my tuner to Boston and was not disappointed. I wish I recorded it because it was so sketchy. There was a bomb on a bridge that they were going to defuse and a few other real weird things going on. Of course someone came on to the channel and told all officers to change their frequencies. </p>

<p>There was over 83 000 people listening to it when they shut it down. If anyone believes any of these holywood propaganda events then they have their heads in the sand. Anyone with half a brain can see through this bull shit. Manufactured terrorism or false flags.

    <div class="md"><p>Channel changes are common, and the more heavily used a channel the more likely there will be a change. Police use unencrypted channels not because they have to, but they choose to for transparency. However if they have sensitive information they need to broadcast or become concerned their own radio traffic is being used as Intel against their operation they can secure a channel or switch to a secure system. </p>

<p>And honestly the &quot;good stuff&quot; and details aren&#39;t given out over the air. Every unit involved and logged into their dispatch system will be getting messages and updates on their vehicle computers. </p>

<p>Listening to a scanner feed also is questionable due to how the broadcast is organized. Since there are so many channels being used, you have to know which channel or set of channels you&#39;re listening to and who is using it for what reason. For example the police radios will have a physical switch to be on main dispatch channel to receive calls and a separate selector for a variety of working operations or tactical channels. So you might have x units on tac 1, y units on ops 2, and z units switching back and forth. Then you might have a supervisor cutting in and being the big boss man. </p>

<p>But in a scanner feed the owner may have just programmed the entire list of talk groups and is scanning them. So you could be hearing whatever traffic occurs on ops, tac, and dispatch randomly while missing parts of one or another while only 1 is being broadcast to you at a time.</p>

<p>So unless you know exactly what you&#39;re listening to, you&#39;re still likely getting only a tiny piece of the story. </p>

He said the guy calling off SWAT was probably a watch commander of some sort, and that the way he said &quot;other bodies&quot; (as you detected) was dismissive, as in, &quot;anybody but SWAT, but idk who and dgaf&quot;. It was amazing to hear all the shit he pointed out that I missed completely.</p>

This seems to me like it could very easily be a fog of war situation.

Is it possible the FBI was just better informed, better trained, better equipped to sort out the madness that was taking place? That adds up to me give the way these fucking Keystone Cops fucked up everything else, like letting the journalists ransack the apartment.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I see is possible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nothing to it. Overpass already cleared, suspects already known, waste of resources to go there. Tragic mass shooting by a radicalized couple of muslims. Common in the middle east, uncommon here, nonetheless, a completely plausible thing to have happened.</p></li>
<li><p>False Flag. The attack was a drill by unknown group on behalf of unknown government entity, possibly foreign, possibly domestic. I don&#39;t see motive though, but could be missing something.</p></li>
<li><p>They shot and killed the wrong people, and a coverup has ensued since then. Perhaps the real shooters got away (3 white men), and the government is staging a coverup to avoid admitting that they shot and killed a couple muslims that had nothing to do with it. This does not require false flag to have been planned, could be a fuck up.</p></li>
<li><p>It was an attack by a foreign government, and like 9/11 (stay with me), pinned on someone else afterwards. We know Saudi nationals attacked the Trade Center, but we went after Iraqis instead. Perhaps Saudis did this, and the gov&#39;t is coming up with some sort of dual loan-wolf story to avoid even more public outlash against the House of Saud. The motive here would be financial, as the Saudi&#39;s could really fuck up the wallets of a lot of well connected people.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps nothing happened at all, it was fake. The grand finale shootout of the Suburban was a very bizzare, well televised event that made no sense. Strange formations for approaching an actual dangerous scene, a TV helicopter that apparently couldn&#39;t move a few feet to the left so show the body in the street, etc, etc.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The why? To further an agenda. Gun control? War on terror? Segregation? Control.</p>

<p>You can pretty much take your pick. There will always be plenty of reasons for people to do twisted shit. </p>

<p>Once you realize that the people who strive for control at the highest levels aren&#39;t wired similarly to the rest of society things start making more sense. Take a look at the psychological profiles of people who aspire to be president or ceo (not referring to children) and you get a very clear picture. </p>

<p>What I always find jaw-dropping is how many people find it difficult to connect the dots and how many just truly want to believe in their government or the media. There has never been a government in the history of the world that was immune to corruption but somehow people have convinced themselves that we have the first or closest. It&#39;s fictional and faith based. </p>

<p>I&#39;m always surprised by those who think that conspiracy theories are far fetched. Like a government agency or politician being corrupt and doing what corrupt governments and politicians have always done is more far fetched than a completely honest and altruistic government agency or politician. Give me a break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, here is the quote, from the eyewitness, word for word: </p>

<p>&quot;three men, dressed in all black, military attire with vests on holding assault rifles and one of them opened up the door to building three… and he… opens up the door to building three and … he… starts to spray, shoot all over into the room… I couldn’t see a face, he had a black hat on (mask) and uh, from my view all I could see was a black hat (mask) and long sleeve shirt… black cargo pants with zippers on the sides, big puffy pockets, he had a huge assault rifle and extra ammo… I just saw three dressed exactly the same…. their <strong>skin tone looked white</strong>. They looked like they were athletic build. They appeared to be tall” Sally Abdelmageed</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t add anything, see? Also, take your random &quot;guy&quot; shit back to the 60&#39;s, where anyone who is outside of the kitchen having opinions must be male.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my thoughts, but what if, just maybe, <em>they</em> DO want anti-Muslim sentiments because 1) reaction against them will be even stronger, as people want them away more and more there will be more and more people thinking they&#39;re doing the &quot;right thing&quot; standing up for the &quot;poor little Muslims&quot; or 2) because they&#39;re just <em>THAT</em> good at manipulation that they&#39;re using reverse psychology to people who want to think against the grain to think in their favor?</p>
