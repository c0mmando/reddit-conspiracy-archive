    <div class="md"><p>&quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus&quot; 
Galatians 3:28</p>

<p>&quot;On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you&quot;</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s exactly what bible says. We are an appendage of the Original source of creation in some dream state where we create our material existence. We are all just manifestation of the source&#39;s  externalization. Nothing is gained. Nothing is lost. Hence the creator is us, we are the creator.</p>

<p>So in this sense God may not be just an omnipotent overseer sitting on his throne. But rather God is within all creation himself.</p>

<p>Oh, please. If someone believes in a malevolent God, or a disinterested God, they at least have an argument. But if there is a God, and he allows as much needless suffering as goes on in the world, he cannot be described as a &quot;loving&quot; God. Get a hold of your senses, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality is not a complex video game, per se, but I do think our DNA was created elsewhere in the universe and that there&#39;s something deliberate going on here and that there&#39;s a battle between non-human forces over the fate of the planet and our species. </p>

<p>Smoke some DMT sometime. Also, check out the book &quot;Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind,&quot; by Graham Hancock.</p>

<p>Anyway, so our goal as the &quot;good guys&quot; is to help humanity evolve into a cooperate, loving, non-warring species that&#39;s connected to the cosmos. I think psychedelic drugs are key to this. The goal of the psychopaths is to keep us addicted to negative drugs, spiritually oblivious, and separated from each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never did drugs or nor was I raised religiously, so I had no prior knowledge of spiritual things before I actively questioned reality and truth. Then I started to get insights, I later found enlightened people also had and described as well. Beside experiencing oneness, knowing everything there is to know and bathing in pure love, I had one realisation to be the only thing like that. The only all powerful, existing thing beside nothing. There might have been an instant extinction of other like me because of one simple careless act I might have done or I have always been alone from the get go, I don&#39;t know.  The utter despair of being totally alone, the loneliness I felt was unbearable. So out of this I created a dream and made myself forget who I really am. Thus the universe and the experience of OTHERS to exist and get in contact with. Your comment just reminded me of that terrifying feeling and I have never heard someone else say that, so I had put that insight aside. Can you relate to what I say?</p>

The big surprise then is to come to the realization that oneself is the creator of this creation one believes to be inside of. And it really is nothing more than to awake from a dream.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What do you think happens after it&#39;s reached maximum fragmentation ? Perspective on what ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a loaded question.  In short (since I&#39;m at work), if it were a game, the players in the game would ultimately win and discover their true nature, or perish.  Ultimately each player would reach their end whichever it may be, and the game would start over.  The creator of the game (in this case the infinite mind) would have painstakingly discovered it&#39;s own identity through the eyes of countless fragments, and ultimately the infinite mind would have a greater understanding of what it is.  </p>

<p>I prefer not to think that the infinite mind is bored or that it created this world we live in out of vanity, but again I don&#39;t claim to really know the answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;d share it with the right people of course. It&#39;s funny how the conspiracy theorists focus on the negative ones, you have to remember the positive ones are in control and you&#39;ll never hear their voice or see their faces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you, like you I might share with those that I care about.  But this creates a dilemma.</p>

<p>If I were to share the cheat with every other player, then the cheat would just become the new rules and it would eliminate the usefulness of the cheat code.  It could effectively break the game.  Therefore I would only share the cheat with those that I deemed worthy, which would create an elite class of &quot;enlightened ones&quot; who have access to the cheat.  </p>

<p>Even if my intentions were pure, sharing the cheat would create a rift between the common players and the players with access to the cheat, and it would ultimately create a hierarchy where those who had the cheat made the rules.  </p>

<p>I am happy to elaborate more if I am not making sense, I am having to rush my response.</p>

<p>I do want to note though that if we really are in a game or something like it, and there is such thing as winners and cheat codes.  Then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_body">these guys are the ones who found it.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we make it to the endgame, vs <em>an</em> endgame which is more likely we will be virtually alien to our own current selves. To simplify, the game is &quot;impulse control&quot; over &quot;indulgence&quot;. The main actor is the self-as-creator. If this emergent self indulges his ever increasing power to create and goes ahead and creates creatures/chimera, monsters, and they are granted the same creative independent mind, the &quot;indulgence&quot; results in a sudden spasm of uncontrolled imagineering, these THINGS decide to do war against each other and those who exhibit restraint, those who remain knowledgeable that we shouldn&#39;t be given &quot;creative control&quot; before we have advanced by having the tools to limit our impulses. This fight crisscrosses the 10 dimensions, it is the apocalypse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets try another one. For me games need to be challenging, the challenge seems to be the whole point of a game, it is not a game if it is not a challenge. When I have mastered a game I have mastered the challenge, the game will vanish because I will never play the challenge again. If life is a game I need to master the challenge of life, when that is done this dimension will vanish and I will find myself at the next level. This brings another question, what is the challenge of life? Changing life to a game in theory does not make the question easier, you are asking what is the meaning  of life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I have heard anyone say that directly, that is my view on games. Games can not be fun if they are not challenging, the &quot;fun feeling&quot; is a feeling of mastering something. Of course this is all from my point of view, I know some people like games that is more of an interactive story where the fun does not come from the challenge but the interaction and drama from the character in the game, they are fun in the same sense that a movie is fun to watch. &quot;Game&quot; has become a very broad term, I think we need to define it before any real discussion can take place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how the Upanishads answers the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a person acts, so becomes his life. Those who do good become good; those who do harm become bad. Good deeds make one pure; bad deeds make one impure. You are what your deep, driving desire is. As your desire is, so is your will. As your will is, so is your deed. As your deed is, so is your destiny.</p>

<p>We live in accordance with our deep, driving desire. It is this desire at the time of death that determines what our next life will be. We will come back to earth to work out the satisfaction of that desire.</p>

<p>But not those who are free from desire; they are free because all their desires have found fulfillment in the Self. They do not die like the others; but realizing Brahman, they merge in Brahman.
The Chandogya Upanishad
Those who depart from this world without knowing who they are or what they truly desire have no freedom here or hereafter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goal is to merge with Brahman. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/religion-miscellaneous/difference-between-omniscient-and-omnipotent/">http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/religion-miscellaneous/difference-between-omniscient-and-omnipotent/</a></p>

<p>this article helps flesh out the lines of definition. </p>

<p>in the scenario i posed, a being could be powerful enough to create the simulated universe ie think of it as the software architect from the matrix. </p>

<p>just because you are powerful enough to construct this simulation it doesn&#39;t mean you are intelligent enough to understand all the ramifications from it. again from the software architect perspective, there are always weird things that happen with the software they write that is unintended. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never did drugs or nor was I raised religiously, so I had no prior knowledge of spiritual things before I actively questioned reality and truth. Then I started to get insights, I later found enlightened people also had and described as well. Beside experiencing oneness, knowing everything there is to know and bathing in pure love, I had one realisation to be the only thing like that. The only all powerful, existing thing beside nothing. There might have been an instant extinction of other like me because of one simple careless act I might have done or I have always been alone from the get go, I don&#39;t know.  The utter despair of being totally alone, the loneliness I felt was unbearable. So out of this I created a dream and made myself forget who I really am. Thus the universe and the experience of OTHERS to exist and get in contact with. Your comment just reminded me of that terrifying feeling and I have never heard someone else say that, so I had put that insight aside. Can you relate to what I say?</p>
