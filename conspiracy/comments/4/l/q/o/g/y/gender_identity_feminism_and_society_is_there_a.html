        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On my daily browsing of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I saw a post about a man who identifies as a dog. </p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/pittsburgh-man-thinks-dog-boomer/story?id=20801512">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/pittsburgh-man-thinks-dog-boomer/story?id=20801512</a></p>

<p>It was not the man who bothered me, it was the reaction to the post. Everybody (mostly) agreed that the man should live as he wants, he’s not harming anybody, and we should be open to these new identities in society, though they have ‘always’ probably existed.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of flawed thinking in these arguments, and I wanted to create a discussion that explores this conspiracy. If you believe that as a society the constant promotion and acceptance is just because we are more ‘equal’ now, then I do not think you have looked deep enough. For one, why is the spin on these topics almost always positive? It is nearly impossible to find negative bias against these topics. Why? Clearly, our media is to blame, but we must always ask ourselves, what are they trying to push and why?</p>

<p><strong>But, gender is just a social construct!</strong></p>

<p>The first argument I hear constantly, especially on Reddit, is that gender is a social construct. If that is so, what the hell is going on with our society? This argument is flawed on many levels. </p>

<p>Check out this article about David: </p>

<p><a href="https://columbiasciencereview.com/2015/03/20/gender-a-biological-or-social-construct/">https://columbiasciencereview.com/2015/03/20/gender-a-biological-or-social-construct/</a> </p>

<p>It explains, “David’s story reminds us that although there are some cultural aspects to what we perceive as gender constructs, the biological aspects of gender cannot be ignored. Contemplating this case, a psychologist named Dr. Milton Diamond observes that, “If all these combined medical, surgical, and social efforts could not succeed in making the child accept a female gender identity, then maybe we really have to think that there is something important in the individual’s biological makeup… we come to this world with some degree of maleness and femaleness which will transcend whatever the society wants to put into it.”</p>

<p>To completely ignore any biological aspects related to gender is ridiculous, and also dismissive of a lot of science. </p>

<p>Now, I am aware that are still social constructs involved with gender identity, but we have to remember there is a complex mix of society and environment when looking at nearly any issue.
Even if gender is entirely a social construct (which it is not), then we need to look deeper at our society and figure out what is going on with people identifying as babies and dogs.</p>

<p><strong>Let people live as they please, as long as they aren’t harming anybody!</strong></p>

<p>This is often a go to argument when any topic of sexual identity comes up on nearly any forum. Let me just start with I see truth in this, and I really, really do not care what people identify with on most levels, as long as they are not harming anybody. But there are still some flaws in this argument.</p>

<p>First of all, maybe they aren’t harming anybody directly, but are they harming themselves? When we give a 5-year-old permission to choose their gender, perhaps they really aren’t harming the people around them (I still think they are), but how will this impact his/her life? </p>

<p>There are countless stories about people regretting sex changes, and if gender is so fluid, should we be more careful about allowing people to make often permanent and irreversible changes in their lives?</p>

<p>The problem is not that I don’t believe that people might actually identify as dragons or dogs. The problem is that we have seemed to stop looking at any other types of treatment other than just ‘accepting’ people for who they are. This is ridiculous. If for some reason, I felt that I wanted to become a man (I’m a woman), I would want to explore every single option available to me before identifying as a man. </p>

<p>I know, I know – I hear all the stories about how many people lived their entire lives and felt trapped in their bodies. The problem is, you almost never hear about treatment, therapy, medication, or anything related to these situations.</p>

<p>So, let’s look at this article about a transgender kid:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/transgender-kids/jacobs-journey-life-transgender-5-year-old-n345131">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/transgender-kids/jacobs-journey-life-transgender-5-year-old-n345131</a></p>

<p>Nowhere in the article did I see any alternative treatments/therapy/anything mentioned. The kid suffered gender dysphoria, and the family went along with it. Great, they accepted him/her, but will there be other repercussions in many years? Notice the positive spin on this article, and the lack or any counter arguments to eliminate bias. </p>

<p>What I am asking is why have we given up on looking at gender dysphoria as a problem/mental illness? One could argue that traditional treatments for gender dysphoria have not worked, but as we know, science and technology are constantly changing. Why is the new treatment just acceptance? </p>

<p>I want to make clear that I never wish any suffering for any person, and I am definitely a compassionate individual. However, I do not feel we have figured out all options for those suffering with gender dysphoria. I do understand the complexities of gender dysphoria, and I also understand it is not as simple as ‘talking it out.’. I am just asking, what else can we do, and what have we not considered?</p>

<p><strong>It’s not the individual I’m concerned with – it’s society</strong></p>

<p>Let’s go back to the argument that people should be allowed to do what they want, as long as it makes them happy and it isn’t harming anybody. Ok, fine, have that argument if you want, but this is where the conspiracy comes into play.</p>

<p>Media is taking an extremely, extremely minute percent of the population, and they are making it a big deal. So, you, as a citizen, should ask yourself, why?</p>

<p>There are many conspiracies related to this. The simplest one is the breakdown of the family unit. When you eliminate gender roles, you are also, in many ways, breaking down family structures. They have been doing this for decades, but I feel like we are finally at a point where the traditional family will become obsolete. Well, you may think that is great, but I just want to tell you how harmful it is from a teacher’s perspective.</p>

<p>I work in an area that is generally poor, and while poverty have much to do with the problems where I work, time and time again, the children who have a solid family support, and both a mom and dad, seem to thrive, despite any circumstances against them, even poverty!</p>

<p>I used to lean toward the SJW feminism side, but now that I am older, I cannot believe the importance of a strong mother and father in a family structure. This is, of course, anecdotal, and you probably do not want to take my word for it.</p>

<p>This research article explains the importance of family stability and structure:</p>

<p><a href="http://crcw.princeton.edu/workingpapers/WP10-14-FF.pdf">http://crcw.princeton.edu/workingpapers/WP10-14-FF.pdf</a></p>

<p>By the way, I’m aware of studies that children raised with two female or male parents often fair as well as more traditional structures. </p>

<p>However, that is not as much of a concern because the problem is we are not seeing solid structured families in general. I’m sure there are some solid, amazing non-traditional families. The problem is we are not looking at this from all perspectives.</p>

<p>I have had several children with lesbian parents, and they are not the picture perfect families you see in the media. All of the children suffered greatly because it is much more complex than just ‘acceptance’. While the media is telling us “everything will be great if we just accept and treat others as equals”, the children suffered because, unfortunately, it is not that easy when you take these non-traditional families and throw in poverty and other factors into the mix.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that I’m singling out the structure of families, when I should just be looking at poverty itself. I think that is a fair argument, but what I am asking is why do we only see these non-traditional families painted in a positive light? Always.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that eventually there will be little to no family structure and stability, and then what are the implications of that for our society?</p>

<p><strong>Feminism and Vilifying men</strong></p>

<p>I was shocked the other day, when my male friend messaged me #killallmen, and he was not joking. More and more men are feeling obsolete in a society that makes them feel as they should punish themselves for being born men.</p>

<p>We hear about SJWs a lot, so I’m not going to go into this issue very much, but why are we at a point in our society where all people are equal, but some people are more equal than others? 
This can go beyond feminism and into race relations, but I’m asking you to look at the larger issue here.</p>

<p>By the way, I’m not against any definition of feminism that really is about equality for men and women. Do you know, however, who largely promoted feminism in our society in the first place. Just do a simple search on the CIA, Gloria Steinem, and feminism. This was my first result:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general21/hw.htm">http://www.rense.com/general21/hw.htm</a></p>

<p>The man is still important. Why are we allowing men to feel obsolete? Why are we seeing more and more movements like MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mgtow.com/">https://www.mgtow.com/</a></p>

<p>Why are we not questioning the impact of the lack of fathers/male role models for the children of today’s society? In the end, traditional families are no longer the norm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/traditional-families-pew-report_n_6377136.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/traditional-families-pew-report_n_6377136.html</a></p>

<p><strong>What am I trying to say? What’s the connection?</strong></p>

<p>We have some different agendas going on in our current society that are constantly forced on us in the media. Gender identity, modern feminism, and ‘equality’ all seem to be interconnected. While I feel they all probably have separate purposes, I really believe that the first goal is to break down family units, which has been going on for a while. I believe the second goal is to get us more comfortable with blurring gender lines and non-human qualities to get us more used to a less humanistic and robotic society, perhaps in a more transhumanist movement, which is a real thing by the way. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/a-new-generation-of-trans_b_4921319.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/a-new-generation-of-trans_b_4921319.html</a></p>

<p>Finally, while there are probably many goals to third wave feminism, I definitely think there is a conspiracy that involves the feminization of men. </p>

<p>Every time I write a post about this, somebody brings up the chemicals in our environment that are feminizing men already. That is a very valid point and a conspiracy itself! Chemicals in our water, for example, make male turtles develop more like females:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/chemical-found-in-plastics-and-now-in-our-water-makes/article_8696e983-bc2c-5b6b-a9e4-b3f4f194d1a0.html">http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/chemical-found-in-plastics-and-now-in-our-water-makes/article_8696e983-bc2c-5b6b-a9e4-b3f4f194d1a0.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I see this site loaded with politics, but if you think about this, it really is a political issue. As we continue to blur gender lines, we have to look at the implications for our society. In a unit I did on the positive and negative effects of technology for my students, we watched a video on Sophia the robot:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/could-you-fall-in-love-with-this-robot.html">http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/16/could-you-fall-in-love-with-this-robot.html</a></p>

<p>I told my students these things are important because we should always be looking into the future. For example, can they imagine a world where robots are petitioning for equal rights? Should robots have equal rights to humans? My students said absolutely not! You may think that my question is far-fetched and ridiculous, but I do not think it is science fiction anymore.</p>

<p>As always, I’d like to note that my writing is never put out there to ‘offend’ anybody, and I am ultimately a person who believes we should treat every individual with compassion and kindness. Unfortunately, I feel that I am just waking up to something large going on. As a teen, I really, really bought into modern third wave feminism, and this post is an exploration of myself and my own thoughts, in a way.</p>

<p>I have posted on this topic before, and it is usually heavily downvoted. I took a long time to write this, so I&#39;m asking that you at least discuss before you downvote.</p>

<p>Thank you if you read all this!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two sexes. Male and female. There are two genders. Masculine and feminine. The former with the former, the latter with the latter. There are no other options, there is no switching. It is not a social construct. Any attempt to do so is mental illness.</p>

<p>You are not an animal. Those who &quot;identify&quot; as animals are mentally ill and need to be remanded to psychiatric care. The only alternative would be to treat them fully as animals. You want to live like a dog? Then you&#39;ll be put down like a dog.</p>

<p>Feminism is the concept of treating women like men and purposely making them miserable. In doing so, it also makes men miserable. Feminism is a social cancer. Males and females were clearly meant to coexist and live together, enjoying the variety made from our inherent differences. Feminism incites conflict by forcing androgyny–the idea that the genders are identical–under the guise of equality. This causes natural conflict as it implies that men and women should have the exact same standards and expectations, despite it being completely illogical to apply identical concepts to two fundamentally different beings. We were meant to complement, not copy each other.</p>

<p>Feminism is championed by the same mental defectives that push tranny and gay nonsense as if it was all intrinsically connected. The modern woman, raised on the notion that she is a divine figure purely because of her sex–an uncontrollable birthright–and not her virtues–a conscious application of personal morality–is a selfish, spoiled, borderline retarded brat that blames men for all her woes and plods through life in the most irresponsible fashion possible.</p>

<p>Do you remember growing up on traditional films, convinced that wholesome women–beautiful not only of face but also of heart–were who you would meet when you became a man? Do you remember dreaming of the joy of married life? I do. But it’s only a memory.</p>

<p>Gender roles, while often thought of as societal constructs, are biological pre-dispositions. The majority of men (approximately 15% deviance) have a natural interest in object-oriented tasks. The majority of women (again, approximately 15% deviance) have a natural interest in people-oriented tasks. Society didn’t create gender roles–society merely grew accustomed to them. That’s what society does–it grows accustomed to the way things are and holds it in place. Biological predisposition is what set the trend, and society grew accustomed to those predispositions. Society is not active, it is passive.</p>

<p>Like shoving a stick through a bucket of molasses, it doesn’t actually push back or move the stick around itself–it simply holds onto wherever the stick is, or has been moved to. Individuals cause change, society keeps it there and keeps change as a slow progression.</p>

<p>Ask yourself why, in Norway, for example, 85% of Nurses are female, and 85% of engineers are male, regardless of how hard the education system has tried to reverse the roles. The answer is quite innocent. It comes in the form of the most common response from school children, “That sounds boring.”</p>

<p>Most men don’t want to be nurses, because it would bore them. Most women don’t want to be engineers, because it would bore them.</p>

<p>Out of free will–a free choice to decide what we want for ourselves–we reenforce gender roles. To create a perfect 50/50 split in all fields of study would require the elimination of free choice, to force women into engineering, and men into nursing, because the quota demands it. And as for feminists… which fields are they studying? Sociology, Women&#39;s Studies, etc. And what are those? People-oriented tasks.</p>

<p>Yep, you read that right. Out of free will, feminists have chosen gender roles.</p>

<p>Feminism is about equality of the sexes, lawfully at least. It&#39;s also about equal representation. It is not about forcing anyone to do anything.</p>

<p>Even a cursory google search would suffice for you to see where you are mistaken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that was the case, you would have done it and proven me wrong.</p>

<p>A genetic male yet fully functioning female exists in such a small minority that it is a medical <strong>anomaly</strong>. 99% of XY women never reach puberty and can never reproduce. People with 46,XY DSD require HRT to go through normal puberty. Their anatomy is also <strong>abnormal</strong> (they tend to be taller than average women). Fertile XX men do not exist at all.</p>

<p>If someone is mentally &quot;female&quot; and physically male, this is due to an endocrine <strong>disorder,</strong> again, not a justification for classing them as a sex on their own.</p>

<p>Take the brain that occurs the most and you will intuitively see that almost the entirety of the human species can be divided into a female brain and a male brain, almost all humans with a male brain possess XY chromosomes, while almost all of the female brains possess XX chromosomes. The point is that during embryonic development, male infants receive a gigantic surge of testosterone. If one or several receptors are <strong>not working properly,</strong> then certain brain parts remain in the default (female) status that they were in, rather than developing into male parts.</p>

<p>Biological factors–including genes, prenatal hormones, and brain structure–are well studied in determining a human sexual orientation. Gender roles and sexual identity are not 100% explained by culture. Sexual orientation is also susceptible to environmental factors: males who have alleles that lead to poor expression of testosterone or are poisoned with chemicals like BPA are far more likely to adopt homosexual/bisexual lifestyles. Soy is high in antiandrogens, and bisphenol A, phthalates, pesticides and herbicides, triclosan and triclocarban, and the added estrogen burden of the water from birth control and HRT also contribute.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/m6HJhyV.png">The picture</a> shows the typical brain differences between men and women (regardless of sexual preference). This supports the theory that gender is not a social construct at all, but rather a biological one, determined at (more precisely, before) birth. This merely acknowledges well studied, biological, genetic effects in prenatal development, whatever part such factors play. They have an influence in the development of a person.</p>

<p>‘Cisgender’ is a term feminists are now throwing around. Gender is fixed by biological constraints, as well. The fact that there happens to be some people who have psychological issues that make them feel otherwise doesn’t change this fact. I may feel like I am a dolphin–it doesn’t mean that species is a fluid concept. I may feel that I am identical to Barack Obama. That doesn’t make me President of the United States.</p>

<p>Issues like these, when not overwhelmingly caused by <strong>mental illness</strong>, are rarely caused by enzyme deficiencies in utero leading to improper hormone levels which cause <strong>deformities</strong>. Those people are still biologically male or female by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. Their congenital <strong>abnormalities</strong> don’t change the definitions of the words. A baby born with renal agenesis doesn’t cause the presence of kidneys to be a “social construct.”</p>

<p>Anything other than XX or XY is an <strong>aberration</strong> and should be treated as such. Healthy cells are diploid for every chromosome (one X can be replaced for a Y in men). If this is not the case, then cell division will <strong>malfunction</strong> and genes can be either over- or underexpressed, with a severe impact on the individual’s health. At most, you can argue two genital expressions are enough to satisfy breeding requirements for evolutionarily consistent breeding habits.</p>

<p>There is a reason that XX and XY are the only consistent genotypes. The rest result in infertile and unhealthy individuals. Again, reason to classify these deviations as a <strong>disease</strong>, rather than a sex.</p>

<p>Personal beliefs and feelings which lack evidence are of no use. There is no sociology required here. Facts are not “discriminatory” or “sexist.” Altering facts so they do not offend people should be of no importance. Implementing flawed, personal beliefs into education cannot be considered progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The existentialism-derived postmodern feminist big lie, that we are born a blank slate until society programs us with some artificially constructed gender role, doesn&#39;t square with biological reality. Likewise, put any woman who could have been naturally a decent wife and raise her to be an employee-consumer in this technocratic nightmare and she will end up depressed and morbidly obese, a rotten slut, or even both. Logic may not tell you, strictly speaking, that you are obligated to feed a dog meat instead of chocolate-covered kale chips, but it sure as fuck does if you care about it and want to keep it alive. A society that not only disregards the nature of women, but encourages the most pathological behavior possible from them isn&#39;t going to be pleasant for anyone involved. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to dismiss patriarchal traditions because you can&#39;t rationally see the role of it with the information you have right now. Consider that they arose from an evolutionary process, and not conscious planning. A scientist can spend his entire career studying a single gene, and would be a fool to conclude at any point that he knows everything there is to know about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, see I agree they are more backwards.</p>

<p>Christians, some, in the US have become more progressive/liberal. Something muslims need to do more of. Oddly though, here in the US, some people still fight progression and want to stay regressive.</p>

<p>I hope we keep on the right track because you and I both agree that becoming more progressive is a plus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not only distraction/division, though there&#39;s plenty of that behind synthetic minority politics. Feminism is substantially hurting men. I don&#39;t mean vile blue-haired witches with problem glasses, though those are plenty annoying. I mean the way that women are living a de facto feminist lifestyle and slutting around if they&#39;re skinny, internalizing their pathology twisting it into a point of pride (sin) if obese. Divorce rates over 50% where if a woman gets bored with you and decides to fuck around, her reward is getting to take half your shit. If an HR witch finds out you said something verboten outside of work, you get burned, while she won&#39;t if she brags about snuffing her children in the womb (even spiders don&#39;t pull shit like this). On and on, with the system&#39;s support.</p>

<p>By focusing on womens issues, and not focusing on giving everyone the same equal rights, they continue creating situations where people are distracted from what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>Perfect example, people are arguing about that bullshit percentage, that women are only paid 70% or whatever it is, of what men are paid. It&#39;s a lie, its bullshit. It&#39;s a statistical magic show, but it worked. It distracted people from the important events that were going on at that time, allowing restrictive laws and anti-privacy laws to be passed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I studied feminism from an economic perspective and it was all about equal opportunity - just as you wanted. Equality doesn&#39;t mean anything because of people are fundamentally different from one another. There&#39;s a great short story by Kurt Vonnegutset in a world where people with special talents, for example strength or musical ability, were forced to wear garments that would eliminate the comparative advantage - heavy chains for the strong and earmuffs for the musically talented. Making every one equal doesn&#39;t make sense. Equal opportunity and social mobility should be what we&#39;re aiming for and I think that&#39;s what other academics are looking for too. </p>

<p>The tumblr feminism is perverted and inconsistent. I think it&#39;s the job of the philosophers to set the record straight. For every loud mouth on the TV we need a philosopher who has actually thought about the topic.</p>

<p>Let me explain. My dad raised me to make sure I&#39;m ultra competitive because I would eventually have to have a career. I did not learn many &quot;womanly&quot; things like how to raise a household. Now I&#39;m learning as an adult, but it&#39;s harder. However I don&#39;t blame my dad. I have a career at least.

<p>Also, I think they want left wing politics associated with weirdos like these otherkins so the working class can&#39;t relate to them. </p>

<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> Comedian completely destroys every claim by the gender studies institute with proof from actual scientists, biologists, psychologists etc. to the point where the state shuts it  down</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>[<strong>Summary:</strong>] The Nordic Council of Ministers (a regional inter-governmental co-operation consisting of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland) has decided to close down the NIKK Nordic Gender Institute. The NIKK had been the flagship of “Gender Theory”, providing the “scientific” basis for social and educational policies that, from the 1970s onward, had transformed the Nordic countries to become the most “gender sensitive” societies in the world.
The decision was made after the Norwegian State Television had broadcasted a television documentary called “Hjernevask” (the Norwegian word for “brainwash”) in which comedian Harald Eia exposed the hopelessly unscientific character of the NIKK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, is that actually you polkadotgirl? </p>

<p>Hahah, long time no see. Welcome back to reddit. Thought provoking post, funny, I was also recently talking about the decline of the black community in the U.S with one of the primary reasons being the breakdown of the black family unit and liberal welfare policies. </p>

<p>I think we can all agree that women (even transgender) should vote and have the same rights and equal opportunities as men, I agree with that completely. But to completely ignore that men and women have different gender roles is complete lunacy. I honestly believe a mothers relationship is way more important for the kids than the fathers. A mothers role is primary whereas the fathers role is secondary. </p>

<p>Consider the human body. The foot plays a different role than the eye. Both carry out different but equally essential functions. Without the foot, the eye cannot go anywhere. And without the eye, the foot cannot see where it is going. Both foot and eye are unequal in function, but both equally necessary to the body. Their value is not determined by comparison. Their value is determined by how well each fulfils its individual function. Since both functions are vital, the foot and eye will always be equal in worth. </p>

The eye sees father than the foot can walk (google image search). The mother or the father isn&#39;t any more special then the other, it&#39;s definitely case by case.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna speak from a specific perspective because it is the perspective I know best. I&#39;m black and we have many conspiracies concerning the new ways the government tries to fuck us up. Homosexuality is believed to be one of those new ways. I&#39;ll start with the prison system. The war on crime and the war on drugs incarcerated more black men than anyone. It is well known that the sagging of pants is prison lingo for &quot;I take dick&quot;. It some how became a fad in the black, hip hop culture following both the &quot;war on drugs and the tough on crime&quot; agenda. Also following those things, was a large boom in lesbianism and bisexualism in the black community. The men were no longer around or had such a bad image constructed of them, that women became weary and disinterested. Not saying this is the only reason, but it is a big one.  </p>

<p>Now the media/music industry. Recently, wearing dresses and female clothing is being pushed by main stream hip hop/rap artists such as Bird Man and Young Thug. Young Thug kisses his male friends and such. We must keep in mind that someone specifically selected this individual in order to make him popular. With the amount of rappers in New York and Philadelphia alone, one has to wonder why they chose someone who wears dresses, kisses his friends and can not rap well. Why him?  I just saw a vine comp the other day on a website directed at a specific audience. It consisted of men catching dildos in their mouths, black high school boys just standing around wearing dresses (claiming not to be gay) etc. It was <em>supposed</em> to be a funny vine comp, turned out to be a bunch of subliminal messages and media programming. </p>

<p>My POV in general is this: All things on earth are created to instinctively perpetuate the survival of it&#39;s species. It must be a flaw somewhere, for a human to take actions that do not perpetuate the continued existence of it&#39;s species. I.E. If everyone in the world is &quot;born&quot; a homosexual, OUR SPECIES WOULD NOT SURVIVE. There is a very obvious issue there. Why people are saying there is nothing wrong and such, sure beats me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! You brought up things I was too afraid to say.</p>

<p>I notice Will Smith&#39;s son has a clothing line of dresses, and I he and his father are always kissing. I&#39;m not against them kissing, but it is done in such a weird way.</p>

<p>I definitely agree, and I also see rap music has changed a lot. What once was often about not buying into a certain lifestyle...now rap music is always about sex and drugs. I&#39;m generalizing of course.</p>

<p>Thanks for your perspective as a black male. I definitely see what you are saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am also referring to things such as clothing, color or interests. If a guy wears a dress who cares why give him more or less attention. He is still a man. A dress does not mean you have a vagina its just a style of dress. Men in other societies wear kilts, capris, blouses.    </p>

<p>I am referring more to people like Bruce Jenner who thinks acting like one of his daughters makes him a woman. It doesn&#39;t it makes you a guy who likes wearing wearing dresses and there is nothing wrong with that. Grow a pair and have confidence in yourself.</p>

<p>TLDR: if they can get you to have loose boundaries about gender, then what about race (white girl claims she&#39;s black.  elizabeth warren claims she&#39;s native american)?  What about age (pedo)?  what about species (guy caught buggering a camel claims he&#39;s a camel-arabian)?  What about machine (mr robot; cyborgism)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see that race, sex and gender boundary busting is a bad thing.  I also am a supporter of morphic freedom: which to my mind means you can hack your own genetics, which is way better than getting some kind of ancient caveman butchering, you can change your gender on a biochemical level to have for example the cinnamon complexion of a thai person but with bright green eyes.  I want this technology yesterday. </p>

<p>And no I don&#39;t think that will naturally lead to raping children or donkeys or robots; things that can&#39;t give consent.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m just pointing out that I believe this is how they are going to try to do it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like that documentary &#39;conspiracy of silence&#39; about the pedos.  They get an underage boy in the car and then say, &quot;so do you like know what a blowjob is?&quot;  As the thirsd party observer...and an adult person of the world, you will know immediately what&#39;s happening.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s very interesting if one follows it back far enough. Homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness. Which considering it only effected a relatively small percentage of the population like most forms of mental illness was very plausible. Great effort went into forcing homosexuality to be considered, and mass promoted as normal. To the point where Gay Marriage is now federal law. No sooner had that victory been achieved that they immediately set out to start promoting transgenderism. Another condition that had been widely considered mental illness an only normally effects a small percentage of population but that they are now promoting.</p>

People argued that if the government will do this, eventually businesses will as well. Basically slippery slope. Lo and behold now in America business can test any employee at any time for drugs. Sometimes slippery slope is silly, like playing D&amp;D will make you a Satanist, but other cases can be quite the slippery slope. So I don&#39;t think its wise to dismiss something because of slippery slope, when there are plenty of real life examples that show its an actual thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this great post. I used to be liberal too, and maybe even a decade ago I would have even told you I believed in the feminist cause. What a delusion! I think you&#39;ve made some amazing points, especially about equality vs equal rights. Equality suggests an inherent oneness, that we are mirror entities, but this simply does not reflect reality. Men and Women are not equal, we have equal rights under the law. That is what equality used to mean! Now equality is some very strange term that has undergone a feminist metamorphosis, and appears to mean that we should all have the exact same opportunities. It appears to mean that if your response to a pretty woman is different from a fat man, that makes you a sexist and a misogynist. But this is the natural flow of life. What type of programmed robot really responds the same way to men than to women? Who responds the same to someone whether sexually attractive or not? These things change human behavior; and I don&#39;t see it to be something to be ashamed of. Same goes with racism, as well! It makes sense, biologically and evolutionary alike, that people feel more comfortable around those that are more like themselves. I do not think it racist that people tend to group with others of the same race, but for some reason in white people this is considered racist? Not other races, only white people. I also have seen this &quot;killallmen&quot; thing, and it reminds me of the hatred for white people. I will tell you what it stems from; a conspiracy to pit race against race, to keep the real elite atop from getting the actual attention they deserve. If you can pit the lower class against the middle class, the real elites get to skate by unharmed. That&#39;s what it&#39;s about. Also about breaking down the family unit, as you so eloquently explained. </p>

<p>Great post, thanks! </p>

<p>I would do my best to ignore SJWs like Igypowpow down there. I don&#39;t really understand why they are so against a traditional family structure. </p>

<p>I really think it&#39;s purposefully done to destroy the future generation of America, I read about these feminist SJW ideaologies but they are always pushed by 20+ college students who are miserable, 30k in the hole and have no prospects for their future, which really shows how effective it is. </p>

<p>Or maybe these people are broken so they attach to broken ideas, chicken and egg, I don&#39;t know which came first.</p>

<p>Also ignore the people saying you&#39;re pooping on LGBT relations, you&#39;re not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ve already entered the start of the Robot era, people just haven&#39;t picked up on it yet. Good catch on your part imo</p>

<p>Part of the reason I say we are entering the start of the era is listed in the links below</p>

<p>Robot that makes fast food sandwiches (EST cost is 35k iirc, if min wage jumps to 15$ an hour it will be cheaper to buy two of these machines than pay human workers)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-burger-robot-2014-8">http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-burger-robot-2014-8</a></p>

<p>On top of those Robots for fast food Wendy&#39;s is going with the self checkout kiosks</p>

<p><a href="http://fusion.net/story/302781/wendys-self-service-kiosks-fast-food-automation/">http://fusion.net/story/302781/wendys-self-service-kiosks-fast-food-automation/</a></p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t get into Foxcon laying 60,000 people in China at their iPhone Factories and replacing them with Robots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/business/foxconn-robot-workers-60000-employees/">http://www.digitaltrends.com/business/foxconn-robot-workers-60000-employees/</a></p>

<p>It is quickly becoming cheaper to replace human labor with robot labor. Once this becomes more common in factories like Foxconn or fastfood chains like Wendy&#39;s we&#39;ll start seeing even higher levels of unemployment than we are now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not fond of the special snow flak culture we&#39;ve cultivated either. </p>

<p>All people have different strengths and weaknesses. We need to remember this instead of being so focused on feelings or the concept of exclusion. </p>

<p>I remember being in sports leagues and tournaments that were winner take all and second just got a &quot;good job, good effort&quot;. Those experiences taught me a lot, made me acknowledge my strengths and weaknesses which is severely lacking in today&#39;s society. It taught me that 99% of the time, regardless of how good you are at something, there is always going to be someone better or who can best you at any given time. These experiences teach humility and promote humbleness with-in a person. </p>

<p>I also have a fair share of friends that are &quot;too good&quot; for a job. The McD&#39;s around here pays 10$ an hour a friend of my mine looking for a part time job said they wouldn&#39;t be caught in there flipping burgers for 10$ even though they need the money. Too me this exposed the cognitive dissonance of my friend. I tried explaining to him since he was just looking for PT work to supplement his bad spending habits that working 15-20 hours a week at Mcd&#39;s for 10$ an hour was better than nothing or trying to drive Uber when they live 15 miles away from a populated area.</p>

<p>The college scam makes me angry. </p>

<p>From adding nonsensical fields of study, the student loan business, not properly explaining the difference between Acredited Uni&#39;s and Non-Acredited Uni&#39;s to people. </p>

<p>These things all add up, combined with your point entry level low skill work requiring college degrees, makes it seem like it was transitioned to this so they can steal money from people trying to improve themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries and no need to apologize though I appreciate the courtesy. Work myself so I know how it feels to want to have conversations but not be able to reply as quickly as you like.</p>

<p>I think the lack of experience with failure is a big problem. Failing usually creates a mind state of self-reflection.  Delaying this until adult as we&#39;ve done to the millennial generation and those that are following it is a big reason some of the reactions have gone as far as they have. They&#39;ve never had to have a moment of honest self-reflection imo the earlier a person learns how to do this the better adjusting they are as an adult imo.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked my fair share of terrible jobs, don&#39;t have a degree but have a career. Saw the way college was going in the mid 2000&#39;s and didn&#39;t want to take on the debt to finish tbh. Was always decent with tech which led me to another field. I was able to do that because I understood my strengths and weaknesses due to self-reflection.</p>

<p>I do smoke, like your friends who complain, but you have to take responsibility for your own choices. I think the lack of responsibility for one actions comes from a sense of entitlement. I think entitlement is sentiment that is being driven by the system with it&#39;s glamorization of victim culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, identity politics was absolutely intended to keep us from focusing on more important things; and it has worked spectacularly, for the most part.  </p>

<p>There are generally three reasons why anyone cares about civil rights.</p>

<p>a}  They need activism to provide them with a reason to exist, because they wouldn&#39;t have one otherwise.  Millennials talk about solidarity, unity, and various other forms of emotive, idealistic bullshit which immediately falls apart when subjected to critical scrutiny; but I&#39;ve never heard of an activist yet who had a life, or who was not an outcast for some reason or other.  </p>

<p>Occasionally you will find someone whose head is sufficiently full of Marxist mind control or Gandhi/MLK worship, that when they talk about international solidarity, they actually mean it to an extent.  I am not one of said people, however; unity and solidarity are two of the worst swearwords in my vocabulary.</p>

<p><strong><em>The only thing that unity or solidarity ever means, is that SOMEONE ELSE ends up in control of YOUR life.</em></strong></p>

<p>b}  They have been horrifically psychologically and/or sexually abused, to the point of being a complete psychological writeoff.  In the case of feminism, this usually means that the abuse in question was committed either by the father or a prior boyfriend.  I also haven&#39;t seen a case of either homosexuality or transgenderism yet, where the individual in question was not abused as a child.</p>

<p>Activism just isn&#39;t an activity which normal, mentally healthy people engage in, for the most part.  You can very easily verify this by looking at the perpetual emotional instability and rage which radiates from subs like <a href="/r/Socialism">/r/Socialism</a>, and especially by looking at how savagely they always respond to anyone who even minutely disagrees with them.  Activists are almost always broken toys, and usually severely.</p>

<p>Again, sometimes feminists or other strains of the disease will claim that they care about something which is happening overseas, because of &quot;solidarity;&quot; but aside from the Marxist cultists mentioned above, this is <strong><em>always</em></strong> bullshit.  Nobody becomes an activist unless they have some kind of direct, individual, personal interest in the issue at hand.  The only form of activism I am likely to have anything to do with, is environmental activism, because that is the only form about which I have a personal reason to care.</p>

<p>c}  As a continuation of the third point, you occasionally get people who become minority activists because they have children, partners, or someone else who they directly care about, who is a member of said minority.  This is the only group mentioned here who I think have an honest, legitimate reason for said activism.  The rest of them are a scourge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, someone else who calls things &#39;strawman&#39;.</p>

<p>Look up value judgments, which is what I go with at times. Someone says &quot;I think killing others is wrong&quot; sets up a value system. You then apply that value to something else to see if they are consistent. </p>

<p>Like, &quot;I think murder is wrong, but I want nuke mecca and kill everyone&quot;. They start with one value they claim to hold, then abandon it elsewhere. Did they really hold that value to begin with or were they just using it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you only read the good parts of any book you can take away a meaningful message that is worthwhile and applicable to modern living.  If you only read the good parts of the Quran you will find a lot of inspiration.  The issue comes when you try to say any given text is divinely inspired.  Then you are forced to explain why there is so much immoral garbage in the book (along with a lot of stuff that is just incorrect or omitted - for example, why was God worried about people eating shell fish under punishment of stoning but he didn&#39;t bother to tell people not to shit in the water source that you drink from... why didn&#39;t he tell people about germs causing diseases and mental illness instead of letting people think witches are making people sick and exorcisms are a proper treatment for something like schizophrenia, etc.).  The Sermon on the Mount is beautiful.  There is no wisdom in it, however, that was exclusive to the Christian Bible.  </p>

<p>Also if god is all powerful why are there gay people / why do bad things happen</p>

<p>Because people went against God&#39;s plan in the beginning of the bible.  That&#39;s called original sin and the fall of man.  We thought we knew better so he let us have our way.  We ate from the tree of forbidden knowledge, the knowledge of good and evil.  God stepped back and let us reap the rotten harvest of our actions and the personal responsibility to act in accordance to God&#39;s will.  We inherited the responsibility for our own actions.  At least that&#39;s what it says in the bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for another female perspective. I agree. I want equal opportunities, but I feel that being forced to act like a man in the professional world has hurt me a lot.</p>

<p>Let me explain. My dad raised me to make sure I&#39;m ultra competitive because I would eventually have to have a career. I did not learn many &quot;womanly&quot; things like how to raise a household. Now I&#39;m learning as an adult, but it&#39;s harder. However I don&#39;t blame my dad. I have a career at least. He was just preparing me for what the world is.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you write a counter argument for each point I made?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t so you decide to pretend I&#39;m some close minded individual stuck in the dark ages. If you read through my post history I&#39;m generally open minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I studied feminism from an economic perspective and it was all about equal opportunity - just as you wanted. Equality doesn&#39;t mean anything because of people are fundamentally different from one another. There&#39;s a great short story by Kurt Vonnegutset in a world where people with special talents, for example strength or musical ability, were forced to wear garments that would eliminate the comparative advantage - heavy chains for the strong and earmuffs for the musically talented. Making every one equal doesn&#39;t make sense. Equal opportunity and social mobility should be what we&#39;re aiming for and I think that&#39;s what other academics are looking for too. </p>

<p>The tumblr feminism is perverted and inconsistent. I think it&#39;s the job of the philosophers to set the record straight. For every loud mouth on the TV we need a philosopher who has actually thought about the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed the same apathetic responses to the coming era of robotics.</p>

<p>Most people I&#39;ve discussed it with seem to think that eliminating the no to low skill jobs is progress. I disagree with this, eliminating the no to low skill jobs just puts millions of millions of people out of jobs and lowers the standard of living for all in that society.</p>

<p>A society needs those no to low skill jobs to function properly imo for a multitude of reasons.</p>
