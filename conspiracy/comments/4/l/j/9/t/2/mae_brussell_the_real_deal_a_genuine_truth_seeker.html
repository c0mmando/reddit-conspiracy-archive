       I'm not sure where or when I first heard about Mae, but I recently purchased her radio broadcast's collection and I am simply blown away by her intelligence, wisdom, tenacity, intuition, and dedication. She is the epitome of a true researcher. She knew EXACTLY what was going on in 1971. I shudder to thing of what she would have done with the Internet at her fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is tons of her stuff on YouTube. So avail yourself to what a REAL Truth seeker is about. Here is a link to get you started;

       Mae Brussel was waaaay ahead of her time. Just about all of her radio broadcasts are available. So thank you for submitting her work.

       It's called critical thinking, and everyone, or just about everyone was capable of applying themselves.  The next 3 generations have been systematically dumbed down, to the point that we think she's a genius and ahead of her time; when in fact, they have just killed the noisiest activists and kept hte media grip on the official story.

       The CIA also had a hand in every JFK movie ever made, except a couple of the ones that mention the mob on you tube.  The latter likley hold more truth.

       Critical thinking skills, pass them along.

       I agree with your comment, but not it's tone. And there is much more to Mae than her Critical Thinking skills, which are 'critical' to pulling yourself out of the morass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her heart, her attitude, her motives. This is what in particular I find refreshing. Especially compared to many within the Alt/Truth community who seem more concerned about their popularity and making money, than actually changing the world.
