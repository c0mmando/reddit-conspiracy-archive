       I just can't wrap my head around it. I hate them, but I also find them so fascinating. How do they do it? Why? They must be-- bred? Trained? I don't understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's insane to me that there is this undercurrent in life that other people were brought up in. The aesthetic of their lives is just so alluring and weird and taboo and we're all fascinated by it otherwise we wouldn't be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how much complicity the elites really have in the grand design or if even they are controlled by a greater power like Lucifer, an alien race, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your theories? Are they human? How do people like Hilary Clinton and Mark Zuckerberg and Henry Kissinger or (insert name here) exist? What kind of dark family secrets do these people hide that make them so different from you or I or the typical citizen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want peace and freedom. I don't understand how anyone could want anything else.

       Interesting topic.  I hope it gets some traction here.

       I don't think that's my feeling.  I don't envy them per se, I envy the
       <em>
        choices
       </em>
       and freedoms they have though, not the castles or yachts.  What I do find myself pondering though, is what they instruct their children or speak about among themselves.  Somewhere, there's a (probably unwritten) "guide to be an oligarch".  I think I can guess the kinds of things that it would contain.  One thing is for certain, these people
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they are better than everyone else.  I would love to see the moment when they find out that they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling their golden age has a time limit, and the clock is ticking.  Either that, or they are going to have to get real busy with genocide.  Some of the reading I've done recently appears to show a shift toward more paranoia.  Notice there is no "Lifestyles of the rich and famous" program any longer, or at least not one that I am aware of.  Conspicuous uber wealth seems to be "out" as of late.  I was laughing with my SO recently at a photo of Jacob Rothschild.  It was some financial magazine like Forbes reporting, wish I could remember what it was, and he was seated in a chair in what appeared to be a hallway.  In the photo, it seemed obvious that he instructed the photographer to take his picture in what appeared to be in a hallway, of the maids chamber or something.  It simply wouldn't do to have the photo next to all of his rare art work, etc. I looked completely set up, as if he lived in suburbia.  It must have been tough to find a spot in his home for that.  Nice curtains though, Lord Jacob. ;)

       This too. The idea that they have offspring and "teach" them these things-- so interesting. Whenever I see a Rothschild in a picture I just can't help but laugh-- it's so surreal.

       Not admiring.  A shit ton of money on this planet is something I imagine almost anyone would want.  I'd like to be able to not have to worry about paying fucking rent, and I don't think they worry about that too much, so I kind of wish I was like them in
       <em>
        that

       respect at least.  That's for sure.

       I find it fascinating that people are so inculcated to the society of the spectacle that they haven't figured it all out, and then they make fun of us if we do.  That's bodysnatched.  Or I should say 'mindsnatched'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mindsnatching process to me is fascinating only to the extent I'm trying to decode it, detourne it and turn it back on them.

       By elite I mean that they are gnostic globalists building a technocracy; capitalist fascist international pirates with loyalties to their secret in-network.  That they are ultimately trying to get you to the robot... with their various social agendas that dissolve boundaries  (gender fluidity; porn merging with music videos and pop culture, etc)

       Thought I might be the only one...I always think how insane it is that these individuals, although usually starting with a huge or not so huge advantage, use their agency as humans to manipulate and deceive and just ruthlessly advance their own self interest. Sure they are pure evil, but someone like Dick Cheney, how does it feel knowing you and your "friends" orchestrated a war for personal profit? Do they have real casual conversation with eachother? How deep does the facade go? I despise them but the psychology behind elites is fascinating.

       I wonder this too. What do they talk about? How do they organize these events that change the course of human history? Is there any time they let down the defenses and are "real" people to each other or is there nothing real about their personality at all? It's just spooky.

       Yup, like all those pics of him on 9/11, seeing his master plan culminate, its kind of chilling to think of what was going through his mind at that point. Or how it must feel to be successful in arranging such a fragile, compartmentalized plot. He and all the other neocons are humans just like us.

       Yeah constantly. They have their shit together, which is vexing when you compare it to the piles of amphibian shit that most people are. I'd try to join if they weren't fucking Satanists and therefore the exact opposite of everything I am.

       I hope peace at least (I don't know about freedom) will come after the One World/Global government. I would love the idea of no borders, unified money system and no stupid embargos to poor countries. I still don't get it how is it that Major leading countries print money and make economies spin but leave out those dying. Print some cash for them too you miserable motherfuckers.

       It's really quite simple. They are sociopaths, all of them. They are a class of inbred sociopaths, just like the aristocracy of Europe before them.

       not admiration. i can't imagine living a life to have anything you want, no matter the cost/at any cost.

       i don't admire them; for what they have or how they live. i think "it must be nice". /s

       their view of the world they want is terrifying &amp; mean. how can anyone  think that killing people is a good thing? seems like they enjoy causing pain &amp; suffering. it's enough proof to me that they lack empathy, so maybe they're not 100% human.

       I asked the question constantly to people- "If asked, would you join the elite (insert group) if invited" 99% of people say yes. I would say yes. I think most people have a weird fascination power and wealth

       Wow. I've been asked, or at least got "tapped." I said no.

      <p>
       You want to eat a turd? Get fucked in the ass? Jerk off while others watch? Maybe kill somebody? Abuse a child? Pick your poison, it's the only way in. People who say "yes" don't know what they're getting themselves into.
