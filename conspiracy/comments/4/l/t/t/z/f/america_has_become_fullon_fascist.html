    <div class="md"><p>You are preaching to the choir.  Prescott, Dulles brothers, Hoover, Johnson, in the century before Cecil Rhodes; and later George W Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and PNAC people like Dan Quayle...these types are the cryptofascist elitists who pushed for hypercolonialism (globalism if you think about it).  They are the ones responsible for the agenda that has spread through their ranks.  The common denominator is their membership in various mafias which we call &#39;secret societies&#39;, all of which are coordinated by the scottish and york rites of freemasonry; and beyond that it is widely believed they are controlled by the Jesuit order, which is now in control of the vatican. Pope francis recently reversed the Catholic church&#39;s opinion on catholic membership in freemasonry from banned to &#39;go ahead&#39;.  So now you know that the Catholic church is not what it seems and that the Jesuit coup is complete as of 3/13/13.  </p>

<p>Trump went to a jesuit school, is likely a high level mason, and his grandfather immigrated to america from a very specific area in germany (palatine) that was the unique epicenter of the rosicrucian order and centuries later the thule society--pre nazi ss occultism--these are facts.  His gf came over and was a barber for a few years, then ran a restaurant for a few more years (can a person in america be a barber and accumulate enough money to suddenly buy a restaurant?  the answer is hell no)  and then owned a vast hotel chain years later.  That kind of success requires not just talent but lots of injections of money at every point, indicating Trumps&#39; GF was very well connected.  Bankers have never given extremely risky loans many orders of magnitude beyond the value of collateral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the USA is actually promoting dysgenics.  People with low IQ are encouraged to have more children, while highly intelligence family can barely make it, due to debt, mortgages. ...etc.  pop culture promoting degeneration, drugs and hyper sexuality.  Thats actually the opposite of fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they are <em>promoting it</em> as a form of control--as you claim--then it <em>is</em> fascism.  Fascism is about the state becoming an ultimate infallible authority</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism: an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opposite of fascism is anarchy and/or agorism.  Where there is no authority and/or people govern themselves through voluntary groupings with their own rules (examples: agorism, anarcho syndicalism, populism, true direct democracy)</p>

<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s possible we&#39;ve created a system in which dysgenics is <em>emergent</em> by allowing not only self-interested corporatism (corporations controlling the gov) without any citizen or governmental oversight as to the consequences of production.  So you end up with &#39;fashion&#39;, pop culture, degradation; sex sells so that&#39;s why you have hypersexuality.... a corp that is mindful of the effects on society might <em>choose</em> to sell something other than sex...but we don&#39;t see that because there&#39;s no finanical compensation for ethics and therein lies the hidden evil / problem with capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  There&#39;s also this other thing at work.  It&#39;s that the baby boomer generation is actually terrible.  Seriously: they are the worst and I&#39;m going to tell you exactly why.</p>

<p>They will read about how awful Dick Cheney is (even today, another article on how he poisoned Vets).  They will still have stock in Halliburton.  </p>

<p>Get that?</p>

<p>They either have no principles, or they are so greedy that their greed trumps their principles, or they are so cognitively dissonant that they don&#39;t see a problem with investing and making money with a company that goes against their values.</p>

<p>It would be like me running an organic farm and then holding stock in Monsanto.  And then saying how well it&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>It would be like me saying I&#39;m against war and I support Bernie Sanders, and yet my Raytheon, Boeng and Northrup stocks aren&#39;t doing as well as I&#39;d like.</p>

<p>The hypocrisy of it.  It&#39;s ASTOUNDING</p>
