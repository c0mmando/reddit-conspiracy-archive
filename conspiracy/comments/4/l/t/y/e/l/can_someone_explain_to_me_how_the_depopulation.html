       What history are you reading? The black death was the gold mine for the Catholic church (Holy Roman Empire). Depopulation == less people to rise up. Pretty simple concept, mate. Not sure why you are struggling with why the elite would want less people.....

       actually no, the catholic church was weakened. People in europe felt they had been good catholics, and that they were either being unjustly punished by god, or that the jews made the disease (jews overall had more cleanly habits then the average european, so they were less effected by the disease, which caused suspicion) Also after the plague, serfdom was practically abolished in western europe (though it did rise in place such as austria and eastern europe)

       Methinks you should actually research history. Because everything you are saying is debatable and unfounded. Also, why are you bringing Jews into this? Jews didn't eat pigs, but Euros also didn't chop the ends of their children's dicks off (which led to death and disease).

       The great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. Feudalism never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.[24] As population growth resumed however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a significant impact on religion, as many believed the plague was God's punishment for sinful ways.[40] The Church lands and buildings were unaffected, but there were too few priests left to maintain the old schedule of services. Over half the parish priests, who gave the final sacraments to the dying, themselves died. The Church moved to recruit replacements, but the process took time. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.[41] The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for lay women to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.[42]

       It was a culling, not denying that. But the Catholic church benefited. The Medici's would like a word with you. This is where the Black Nobility comes from. People think it ends with Rockefellers or Rothschilds. lol........ That is my point. The Holy Roman Empire prospered during this time, it's not hidden, but you need to research history to find it....

       There are no problems with culling the population and they have all the benefits as they dont have to share the worlds resources with ordinary folks. The remaining people will be just like drone slaves.
