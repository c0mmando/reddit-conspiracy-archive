       I think based on how much money Israel has pumped into manipulating public opinion on Israel online, and the fact that they are probably scratching their heads at what to do as Israelis start speaking out about Israel and will probably have to go into full damage control they will start to get sloppier. This will make the narrative pretty obvious and people will seek out other avenues of information.

       <strong>
        Well, well, well. Seems like Clinton's own website has been exposed as a huge lie with respect to this issue once and for all:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/07/13/email-facts/">
        Updated: The Facts About Hillary Clinton’s Emails
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Her usage was widely known to the over 100 State Department and U.S. government colleagues she emailed,
        <strong>
         consistent with the practice of prior Secretaries of State and permitted at the time.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Was it allowed?
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes. The laws, regulations,
        <strong>
         and State Department policy in place during her tenure permitted her to use a non-government email for work.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Completely false, as per the IG's report (source: NYT):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/state-department-hillary-clinton-emails.html?_r=0">
         The State Department’s inspector general sharply criticized Hillary Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server while she was secretary of state,
         <strong>
          saying she had not sought permission to use it and would not have received it if she had.
         </strong>
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As reported by Bloomberg:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/clinton-e-mail-use-violated-rules-state-department-audit-finds">
         Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail system while she was secretary of state violated State Department rules, the agency’s inspector general concluded in a report that will hand Republicans an additional line of attack as the general election campaign gets underway.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also blatantly false is Clinton's claim that she and her aides are willingly cooperating with all public servants on this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We understand that members of her State Department staff were recently asked to assist the Department in its record-keeping by providing any work-related emails they may have on personal accounts. They have received requests from Rep. Gowdy as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clinton is proud of the work of all the dedicated public servants that were part of her team at the State Department. She was proud of her aides then and is proud of them now,
        <strong>
         as they have committed -
         <em>
          as she has
         </em>
         - to being as helpful as possible in responding to requests.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also as per Bloomberg (as well as the hundred other sources reporting this):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-25/clinton-e-mail-use-violated-rules-state-department-audit-finds">
         <strong>
          Clinton declined to speak with investigators, according to the report, as did at least three key aides:
         </strong>
         former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, former Director of Policy Planning Jake Sullivan, who is now a top aide on the campaign, and former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, who now serves as the campaign vice chairwoman.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Relevant section of the IG report:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Finally, OIG interviewed Secretary Kerry and former Secretaries Albright, Powell, and Rice. Through her
counsel,
        <strong>
         Secretary Clinton declined OIG’s request for an interview.
        </strong>
        <sup>
         7
        </sup>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         <sup>
          7
         </sup>
         In addition to Secretary Clinton, eight former Department employees declined OIG requests for interviews:
        </strong>
        (1) the
Chief of Staff to Secretary Powell (2002-05); (2) the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary Clinton (2009-13); (3) the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy to Secretary Clinton (2009-11) and the Director of Policy Planning (2011-13); (4) the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations to Secretary Clinton (2009-13); (5) the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic
Communication (2009-13); (6) the Director of the S/ES Office of Information Resources Management (2008-13); (7) a
Special Advisor to the Deputy Chief Information Officer (2009-13) who provided technical support for Secretary
Clinton’s personal email system; and (8) a Senior Advisor to the Department, who supervised responses to
Congressional inquiries (2014-15). Two additional individuals did not respond to OIG interview requests: the Deputy
Secretary of State for Management and Resources (2011-13) and an individual based in New York who provided
technical support for Secretary Clinton’s personal email system but who was never employed by the Department.

      <p>
       <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/07/13/email-facts/">
        This directly conflicts with Clinton and her team explicitly stating that the server was never hacked:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was the server ever hacked?
       </p>
       <p>
        No, there is no evidence there was ever a breach.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is very bad. It proves that Clinton
       <em>
        knew

       about the risks of her server and did not report them, as well as proves they knew full well they were actively being attacked.

        So, we are supposed to believe he hacked Clinton's emails, but decided against leaking any of them? Yeah, right.

       Edit: Not saying this is hard proof the server was hacked, just that Clinton and her camp are newly exposed here as being disingenuous to another level with their lawyer-talk. "No evidence there was ever a breach" is entirely accurate but at the same time incredibly misleading in context. Same goes with trying to sidestep this and pretend it's all about personal email use when the bigger picture is the server as well as the fact that Clinton used private email
       <em>
        exclusively
       </em>
       while her predecessors used to infrequently. Finally, saying it was allowed and that nothing out of the ordinary was done is a straight up lie no matter how you slice it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who seeks to excuse this level of dishonesty (and yes, being this misleading
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       dishonest) needs to give their head a shake.

       The mods at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       are also using the nuclear option. Any article that as much as mentions the report is being taken down, no matter how many hundreds of comments it has, no matter if it is a unique analysis. Censorship is out of control on this here. I messaged admins, but given the extent of this across the site, I'm not sure I expect any response. The mindset seems to be, "It will fade with tomorrow's news," but that mindset can only take root when the users complacently accept it.

       I really think a journalist should write an article on this, specifically as it pertains to this news item.

       They have some sort of unwritten rule where if something is allowed on politics, it isn't allowed on news. It's rather broad. I was told the same thing when my post about Mississippi approving the firing squad was removed from there.

       Whether that has anything to do with the Clinton scandal, I have no idea.

       Scrolling through /news is flat out laughable. It's like a parade of SJW news, not real news. I suspect its traffic will fall over time.

       I recently joined Reddit thinking it was a place for free thinkers, YouTube has more freedom of speech I feel. But that's also getting taken over by government as posts and comments do disappear and big news story's only get low watched numbers, but I may be wrong.

       I've slowly been unsubbing from all the default subs.  Heavy-handed moderation like what's present in the default subs is pretty much the antithesis of what I think Reddit was designed to be-- a place where the most in-demand content rises to the top based on user preference through voting.  Pretty amusing to see the contortions mods/admins make to keep the default subs "on message" when the proles don't upvote the right messages.

       I think based on how much money Israel has pumped into manipulating public opinion on Israel online, and the fact that they are probably scratching their heads at what to do as Israelis start speaking out about Israel and will probably have to go into full damage control they will start to get sloppier. This will make the narrative pretty obvious and people will seek out other avenues of information.
