       Hello to all :) I was thinking of UN-NATURAL food (and we call it in our country GMO lol :D) why we (all around the world, the most in western countries) have that much of them? We all know these arent good for our health (i can only hope that everyone knows) but whats the essence of their point/plan - by 'people from the top'?
Yeah, also we know their plan is to make 'us' more stupid and make 'us' easier to manipate, control...but...they also want a LESS people on the Earth...== smaller number of people =&gt; easier to 'do what they want to do'...but isnt this also their plan..maybe? (i was thinking about it ~2 weeks ago):
      </p>
      <p>
       To change our 'hetero hormones' to 'homo hormones' (because difference between gays and 'normal' are harmones) so by changing it - World will have more gay, so it means less preductivity of new lifes/new children...so like i said (we all know) reduce the number of people = easier for controlling
      </p>
      <p>
       *Maybe GMO isnt changing our hormones, but Yep, food is totally unnatural now and it does something with hormones, have too much additives and ect...to be honest, dont know much about that 'wrong' food (cuz im trying to avoid it) but its easy to figure out that these food dont contain anything logic to eat...:D i hope you understood what i wanted to say, so im hoping for some rational replies, thanks in advance :)

       Everything causes cancer. The sun causes cancer. Well toasted bread causes cancer. What you're referring to is a study in which they fed and injected rats with toxic doses of the active chemical every day until they got cancer.

       This is just one of those things that just "sounds scary", sort of like "reclaimed water". The truth is that it's harmless to humans. I'm sure if you drank a jar of roundup you'd feel nauseous but the fact of the matter is that our bodies are of a different size and chemical makeup than the insects targeted by roundup, and it's not harmful to us. There are infinite things that are harmful to one species and not another, and everything is toxic in a large enough dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there have been extensive studies conducted on the safety of this stuff, well outside of the corrupt FDA. In regards to Roundup and GMO's in general the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it's safe, so you'd have to double down and say the scientific community is in on the grand conspiracy, in which case most of what we "know" about anything goes out the window. GUESS IT'S A FLAT EARTH AFTER ALL GUYS!

       If you're suggesting a conspiracy to feed people genetically modified food which somehow made them sterile then I can tell you right now that there are FAR more cost effective ways of accomplishing that and it's an absurd to use that as an argument against GMO's.

       To add to this:
Look at the environmental effects of pesticides used, not just the use on the actual plants but also the production of these chemicals produces runoff.  Also many pesticides lead to soil degradation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that pesticides and GMOs can be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       They increase yields, in a system that
       <a href="http://harvestpublicmedia.org/content/tossed-out">
        has a huge problem with waste
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe we should focus on fixing food waste issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       Small, local, poly-culture farms would be the ideal fix. Reduction of shipping, reduction of food waste, increased job opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>

        Use nature
       </a>
       to deal with pests/disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easier/faster/more productive to spray weeds with pesticides, or you could just pull them out of the ground with a shovel, or get a couple of goats which will graze on weeds. But that's not quick enough for today's fast paced world, so continue to put on a hazmat suit and spray toxins?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://ucanr.edu/repositoryfiles/ca3607p14-61827.pdf">
        here's a study showing the benefits of poly-culture and how leaving some weeds help keep away pests/disease
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliminating one part of the natural cycle of things has never worked out well. Nature is a self regulating system.  We find something that destroys one (or more) pest/weed, and some system is disrupted, or it becomes resistant and even stronger than before.

       Except that making a seed GMO is the only way to patent pre- existing seed in the food supply. So it is the act of modifying seed genes for corporate profit that causes all these problems of pesticide pollution, food insecurity, ecosystem destruction, and corporate monopoly on food control. Monsanto is not the only one who engages in this practice, they all do. Anyone who dearly cares about the environment and poverty  and supports gmo seeds is a fucking ignorant idiot or a hypocrite predator asshole of the Bill Gates Kind. In which case, his position makes sense considering he wants to wipe out a good portion of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you didnt know..Monsanto also controls the largest non gmo seed producer companies. They have strangle hold on seed production.

       Any clever person would just treat these poisons what they are: poison served by greedy and opportunistic companies. You wanna support Gmo, go and buy it and consume it. Don't fucking shove it down our throats. But no...they fucking prevent us by legislation from avoiding it. I haven't  even touched corn or soy products in years... now add salmon to that list.

       You're worried about it being unhealthy for you. Why? So what if you put a banana gene in a strawberry? Are bananas toxic? Do you think there's going to be some sort of unanticipated chemical reaction that renders the strawberry toxic? If so, then you don't understand enough about what genetic modification is to have ANY opinion on it.

       Yes, we are a long ways from mapping a whole genome. But each gene has a specific purpose, like a piece of furniture in a house. There's a gene for eye color. We know that's what it does, and that's all it does.

       Imagine you're walking through a mansion. You don't know what lies on the other end of the mansion, but you can recognize a chair or a painting as you walk by it. And if you move the chair or change the upholstery you know it won't affect the fixtures in the kitchen.

       I don't think so. The reason genetic code is so extensive is because of how specific each gene is in purpose. The gene for eye color truly is just a gene for eye color and I'm fairly certain we know that just as well as we can know anything in science.

       In a perfect world, yes. But few people get to enjoy the privilege of being able to not pursue profit. Sadly, the most progress in science occurs when there's potential profit involved and I suspect that's what it will take with genetics. Especially with the paranoia surrounding it... The general people don't support GMO's.

       Genes don't do just one thing. Exon splicing, epigenetics, for example, can cause one dna sequence to have different effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Separately, perhaps a gene normally produces small amounts of a protein. The protein is fine in small amounts, but poison at higher dose. If that gene is genetically transferred, or a promoter gene for it is genetically transferred, that protein could be produced in large amounts, which could make eating the genetically engineered food poisonous.

      <p>
       Our bodies are run the best off fasting and alkaline foods that are filled with electricity. Our bodies are not only physical but also electric.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plants and nuts are the only ways to get alkaline food today. All GMO foods have had their acidity cranked up so that eating an alkaline diet is nearly impossible. Even people who think they are eating an alkaline diet normally aren't. They do not expect the tomatoes, apples, bananas, and the majority of other foods they eat to actually be acidic. In reality they are, they take out electricity from the foods and make it almost impossible to reach an alkaline state.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an alkaline state our bodies are filled with more energy, the Chinese call it Chi energy. Humans are actually magical believe it or not and they have worked in conspiracy to make us lose our abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       All GMO food eaten is worse for you, less nutrient dense and also more acidic.

To take this further:
      </p>
      <p>
       Every action that happens in the body, whether it be a muscle movement or something you don't consciously do like make a blood cell, it takes energy derived from food.

       Also, what atoms are made up of?
      </p>
      <p>
       protons, neutrons, and electrons
      </p>
      <p>
       We are made entirely of atoms, each atom is stored energy.

       So are you saying because the exchange is through much larger ions it is not an electric process? Is there no energy being used?

        What are nerve impulses?
A nerve impulse is an electrical signal that travels along an axon. There is an electrical difference between the inside of the axon and its surroundings, like a tiny battery. When the nerve is activated, there is a sudden change in the voltage across the wall of the axon, caused by the movement of ions in and out of the neuron. This triggers a wave of electrical activity that passes from the cell body along the length of the axon to the synapse. A nerve impulse is a wave of electrical activity that passes from one end of a neuron to the other.

        In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms. The "ability of a system to perform work" is a common description, but it is misleading because energy is not necessarily available to do work.

       You're mixing electrical potential and ion propogation with energy. You clearly have no idea what you're saying. Just stop, please.

       Or at least answer my questions in my previous comment. I want to know how electricity supplants all of the things I mentioned. I can come up with other questions too.

       I understand physics and the human body. I also understand the importance of thinking outside the box.  Science is great but has only come so far, we've learned a lot, but still plenty more to learn.

       You see, I'm a real scientist getting a real PhD at a real university in the exact area you're talking about. You're not thinking outside the box, you're just making shit up. What you're saying is so demonstrably wrong and your understanding of "science" is so backwards that I'm not sure where to start. I'll go through your "response."

      <p>
       Right. So, I'm an engineer. Electricity is not energy. Please stop equating them. Energy is Voltage x Current x Time. Your inability to even articulate that shows you have a tenuous grasp on what electricity even is.

      <p>
       Uh, no? I did my undergrad research on bioelectricity and biological circuits. Electrical energy isn't just a "lightbulb" (which is thermal energy anyway, but I'm sure you knew that), but there's also inductors, memsistors, capacitors, batteries, the list goes on of different ways to store electrical energy. You aren't some special snowflake.

       God, where do I even start. Yes, by definition a calorie is a unit of energy but
       <em>
        generally
       </em>
       scientists use the term Joule. You, of course, knew that. 
Your lack of ability to articulate the difference between atoms and molecules when describing this also says a lot. While it is true atoms have a lot of energy in the form of weak force interactions (NOT ELECTROMAGNETIC), most biological energy results from the formation of entropy-driven molecular bond forming as a results of respiration. You, of course, knew this.

       Yes, the classic example every pseudoscientist quotes when they want to sound much more informed than what they actually are. Everything can be viewed as having an associated wave function, however electrons are the only particles that have wave functions that are practically useful. Anything bigger and you get wavelengths smaller than the size of a hydrogen atom (i.e. their wave function collapses under all observations). This right here is the biggest load of bullshit you're peddling. Waves and frequencies are not forms of energy, that is false. By definition they are not energy. Frequency scales with energy, sure, but it is not the equivalent of energy. Saying waves are energy is semantic word salad- you have no idea what you're saying, you're just throwing out words.

      <p>
       Lol. Okay. Get back to me on all of my points and we can come back to this. The world isn't some pandora's box of mysticism. Electromagnetism (lol, you keep saying electricity and totally ignoring the magnetic aspect) is actually one of the most well-defined forces in our universe. It is incredibly detailed and studied, just because you don't know it doesn't make it so. As an engineer, reading your statements about electricity makes me cringe so badly because you clearly DO NOT understand what you're saying. It's all word salad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pepperoni pizzas make good breathing apparatuses for fish. That's logically equivalent to what you've been peddling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real scientists think outside the box, we design our own experiments and we push the boundaries of knowledge and try to get a better understanding of the world. Sure, "there's plenty more to learn," but you're not impressing anyone with 8-11 letter words that are basically mumbo jumbo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get back to me though, I'd love to hear you prove me wrong in detail. ALSO, you still never responded to me about how biomass transport and ATP were going to be created in your system. As far as is understood, you require ATP for virtually all cell transactions. You cannot make ATP from electricity. That's not how it works. If you want to propose a non-canonical pathway for this, by all means do so. Otherwise, you're not impressing anyone and at worst you're hurting society by spreading lies and bad science.

       Good for you on getting a real PhD!
      </p>
      <p>
       Took you long enough to give actual explanations. You say that people do a disservice to science by bringing up the points I made, though the way in which you argue is not helping science.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, you didn't have any explanations in your initial handful of comments, just vague scientific terms (with no explanation) and ad hominems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the tone of your writing is demeaning and outright indignant (don't worry my feelings aren't hurt, but if your trying to convince people of anything, it doesn't help your argument to come off as a pretentious know-it-all douche).
      </p>
      <p>
       In all your comments you make it sound as if I think I know everything and that I am a genius.  At what point did I say this?  We're having an argument in a conspiracy forum and I'm pointing out ideas that are not normally accepted, big surprise!
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there's different types of energy and electromagnetic forces play a role.  Did you save that for this comment to make me look dumb?  Your first comments are vague and insulting and now you bring all these other factors into play to downplay me?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       When did I say anything about molecules?  When I compare calories to atoms I know that food and calories are complex molecules, my point is that the building blocks are atoms (my point being that its all made of atoms).

       So everything does have a wave function/signature. Wave functions collapse so they are disregarded? Yeah because we have it all figured out right? We know what dark matter is and exactly what goes on inside a black hole?  Just because we are unable to observe something does not mean it ceases to exist, if you're studying science I hope you know this.

      <p>
       When ATP is used for cell transactions is that not a form of energy?
Again, I never once stated that you can make ATP from electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You continue to try to make this argument more and more complex and convoluted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the ATP question brings me back to my original answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy is the "ability of a system to perform work"
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah a nerve impulse is energy by the above idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to take a deep breath before you have an brain aneurysm pal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're hurting science by thinking everything is either black or white, by thinking that science has it all figured out, by not being able to accept anything other than what is taught to you.

A nerve impulse (or ATP action) is a system that performs work.

       You either need some mental help or you have a hard time with concepts outside of classrooms or textbooks (even though the way I explained it could be understood by a child).  Either that or you just cant admit what the fundamental meaning of energy is.

       that process can be considered an energetic process by definition.

       Dude, you can't design experiments to demonstrate the flat out bat shit insane word salad you keep pushing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am well aware of what the definition of energy is, I have an actual accredited degree with scholastic backing to demonstrate it. You just keep saying the Wikipedia definition over and over again, I'm not even sure you can define what
       <em>
        Work
       </em>
       is. You have literally said nothing that makes sense or is of importance aside from what you've googled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, you've completely refused to address the points I've made and keep veering off into tangents rather than offering salient details. The only conclusion is you don't know what you're saying and your limited understanding of basic science obviates any actual discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically like trying to talk a child that hasn't learned biology, math, or physics. You still keep equating energy with all of this other jargon that is completely wrong. I'd be hard pressed to think you even know what voltage means.
      </p>
      <p>
       So dude, please stop. I'm worried I'm going to go to jail because talking to you and trying to extract concise details instead of vague magicks feels like I'm just beating the shit out of a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'd be less hostile if you actually addressed ANY of the questions I've asked instead of just brushing them off and saying I don't understand. Shit, just answer any of the questions and I'll be happy. I want concise details, not your hand waiving magic where you propose some absurd mechanism and then quote the definition of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to argue with someone that knows what they're talking about, right? Can't just say vapid conspiratard bullshit and have them believe it.

       "Each atom has an action potential"
      </p>
      <p>
       No... Am action potential is a state that a neural cell can reach once the electric potential across its phospholipid bilateral is sufficiently depolarized. None of that has anything to do with the acidity or alkalinity of the food we eat (especially foods that are naturally very acidic like tomatoes). You seem to obliquely understand that electricity is important to our body without actually having any understanding of why or how

       You're right, that was a mistake in my wording.  Action potential is the term used for nerves.

       I should've put: each atom contains stored energy

       A GMO is an organism that's been genetically modified. As in, it's DNA got changed. In no way does this change the acidity of an organism unless that's what you specifically decided to do. You can GM a lemon to make it

       You are not thinking on my plane. I am not talking about how sour or the taste of the vegetable or fruit. When you consume a lemon it is actually alkaline. I am saying the conversion that happens in your body does not happen as nature intended and it does not alkalize your body as well as a non-GMO fruit or vegetable. All fruits or vegetables whether they are sweet or sour actually turns alkaline in your body. Your logic is like saying just eat a bunch of bland foods and your body turns alkaline. No. GMO foods are less nutrient dense and do not alkalize in your body like Non-GMO foods. On top of that you are sitting here defending the system. The system deserves to go down in every aspect. The entire system has Satan written on it if you do your research.

       Things don't magically become healthier when you've deemed it natural. The instant you so much as cook a food it's become unnatural.

      <p>
       The only difference between a GMO lemon and another lemon is the altered gene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a person got genetically modified to have blue eyes when they normally would have had brown eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not more acidic, they are not less energetic, there is literally nothing different except the color of their eyes, because that was the only gene that was altered. It was as if they had inherited the gene, but they didn't.

      <p>
       This isn't based in any sort of fact. Whether a GMO food is more or less nutrient dense depends solely on how they decided to design it. If all they're altering is the color of a peach then the density of nutrients will be exactly the same. Genetics is simpler than you think.

       No, I'm defending science and scientific fact. Science doesn't care about what the establishment is doing or how people feel, it's about the logical study of all that which is observable. If a fact is inconvenient or unsettling then so be it.

       I think Satan is a laughably absurd concept and Christians can't even agree on what he's supposed to be. Is he just some fallen angel who does as much as the Bible says he does, or is he actually author of a bunch of grand pranks on humanity? I say neither because it's silly. The concept of Satan only exists to enforce fear among the irrational, and fear is a detriment to reason.

       This is about food in general, not GMO foods, and it doesn't say that the food actually alters our genetic makeup. DNA is an actual physical substance and the study talks about how it can make it to our bloodstream. That doesn't mean it influences OUR genetic makeup anymore than it would to stick your finger in a cup of DNA. It doesn't do anything on contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, GMO foods don't have some magical new effect on your body as opposed to a regular food. It's just a food with different DNA. That's IT. Whether it's a selectively bred apple or a genetically modified apple has no difference of consequence on your health and this would be an obvious fact if you bothered to learn more about genetics. Please, look into the subject, if not to learn more about GMO's than just because it's an incredibly interesting and important field in general.

       Look, man. I'm sorry for being rude. Just understand that this is one of the only matters I get offended over... When I feel that science is being misinterpreted or misrepresented in a way that could impede progress. If there's anything I fear it's the phenomenon of misinformation. Surely we can both agree that that's a terrifying thing.

       I expected as much but I was genuinely curious and have yet to get a definitive proof that they are bad that hasn't been already disproved. IMO, there are other things to worry about than modified food that has so far been helping people. I think the worry comes from not understanding it and essentially people playing god with food

       They are bad, science just ignores the area's that they affect. Basically everything we consume is bad. That's why everyone is getting sicker and sicker. Live a happy stress free life eating healthy non-GMO foods and you'll quickly find you are filled with energy and do not get sick anymore.

       Ok but how are they bad? Give me examples that haven't been disproven. People say that organic unaltered food is better but for the most part it's not. Our bodies have become accustomed to the new healthy world we live in and if you eat food that is unchecked, you could get very sick

       It causes tumors, probably causes cancer. Every food causes something different because it is not what we are supposed to eat.

      <p>
       Our unhealthy lifestyles make our bodies very stiff which in turn means our muscles are constantly activated. We also live a stressful life, stress gets stuck in our bodies and causes illness. We sit all day and they have somehow tricked us into thinking that fasting is bad. They also tell us fat is not good for us and carbs are. Sugar is carbs. Sugar is the worst. They have basically funneled all fat people into ignoring fat and consuming more carbs, which in turn makes them eat more sugar.

       I don't think GMO's are making people as sick as you believe. There are a ton of different factors at play to our daily lives. For starters, it might be because how fucking clean the 1st world is today. Parents today make their kids too clean. This one kid in my class a while ago had parents who were obsessed with being clean and controlled his food and what he ate. Needless to say that we was always sick with somthing and he had a bunch of food allergies. That might be an extreme case but it shows that being too clean is bad but that doesn't mean we should be dirty because that could also have negative effects. As far as obesity in the world, I blame that all on the sugar industry with all shit they put in the food. Natural sugars are good but obviously you shouldn't eat it all day, every day. So while people may think that playing god with food may sound scary, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. If it makes the food bigger, last longer, and fights off nasty bugs that will get you sick, why wouldn't we do it? Is it because it's unethical to play god?

       No it's because the same people who have modified those foods are the same people who have tricked everyone into thinking fats are bad for you. The same people who feed us sugar on a grand scale. Are the same people who sell heroin to everyone for dirt cheap prices. Are the same people who stress everyone out. Are the same people who spray terrible pesticides all over fruits and veggies that we after eat. It's a chain event. Evil is written all over them. There are tons of sources of what GMO foods do to animals. Tumors mainly but you either stay in ignorance or really look at this world for what it is.

       Again I think this Comes back to education and being concerned for what we cannot really understand. GMO's are done behind closed doors so natrually there is rise for theories. Most modern pesticides are harmful to animals who consume it on a large scale. By the time we consume those Foods there is only traces amounts of pesticide which our Body can handle and flush out of our System. Now, is there concern with all of this? Of course. Should we Panic? No but simply Keep a Close eye

       There actually aren't any definitive studies either way, assuming we discount the industry-funded ones as bullshit just like the old industry-funded tobacco studies that showed it was just fine and the industry-funded leaded fuel additive studies that showed it was just fine.

       Create a seed that is pest and drought resistant but that doesn't produce any seeds. Sell that seed to farmers. They theoretically produce more crops and earn more money. But because the crops don't seed with anything that will actually grow, they need to buy seed from you next year, and the next year, and so on...

       Education + birth control. Both are a hell of a lot cheaper than some inane conspiracy to turn people gay, if that were even possible.

       They do produce seeds. Legally not allowed to use. Farmers dont tend to save seed anyway as its not economic. The repurchasing of seeds is seen throughout organic farming.

       They are bad, science just ignores the area's that they affect. Basically everything we consume is bad. That's why everyone is getting sicker and sicker. Live a happy stress free life eating healthy non-GMO foods and you'll quickly find you are filled with energy and do not get sick anymore.
