       I don't really have any data to back this... just my personal view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time I go to a supermarket, I have a short moment where I look around and realize how much food is stored within these places. Then I think about how many supermarkets are within each city... and then how much of this food is simply wasted because these supermarkets must make their profit and do not consider helping the problem of hunger.
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes for every major life supporting industry. We seem to have more than enough of everything (food, clothing, medicine, homes, cars, phones) and the owners at the top will never share or give any amount to those in need.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have so much abundance and have for decades...

       That's just a glorified transformer with really bad performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Input and output are switched.  Notice the 119v 1a "output", voltage and current are nearly in phase.  The 50v 1a "input" is almost 90° out of phase, and the voltage is clipped into a square wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of his power calculations are wrong anyway, that's not how it works. He used "mean" power (which is zero for AC), and he didn't take phase into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       That combined with the fact that the device itself is producing significant amounts of heat.  Any heat produced is wasted energy, meaning less than 100% efficient.

       What I'm getting at is you would still need material even with free energy, but you won't be using the oil as energy anymore, only as source for pharmceuticals and plastics so it will expand the time-to-peak-oil by centuries maybe.  Giving us enough time to figure out nanofabricating.

       Oil renews itself over millions of years. What, do you think it just seeps up from the center of the earth? We know it comes from decaying organisms and know how long it takes. It's really not that hard to understand.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of
        <strong>
         expending labour power without producing
        </strong>
        anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to
        <strong>
         eat up any surplus
        </strong>
        that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. Warfare is also useful in keying up the morale to the necessary pitch.
       </p>
       <p>
        The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects.

       This is spot on,along with creating new boogie men to protect us from.Truly we have had the technological means for a while now to do away with the material needs of humanity but because of the power structure have negated this fact.Hasn't this been the lie of the 20th century that because of technology we would work significantly less and be filled with well being.It's very obvious that a small group of people have stolen our progress and used it to benefit only themselves.There was a window of time where Americans could gtf away from the system and with hard work build
       <br/>
       a life that felt free.As the country became filled in,the same ''city fathers'' expanded their reach and closed the loop holes. I started to believe in the concept of evil because even with all the power/wealth these people are not content and seem to want to keep humanity enslaved in poverty,toil,if not even outright death.I mean the world is run by some real psychopaths.

       I'm gratified by all the interest this has garnered. I love 1984, and these book excerpts on
       <strong>
        Oligarchic Collectivism
       </strong>
       were the meat of the book for me (yes, the book within the book
       <a href="http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/go-goldstein.html">
        http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/go-goldstein.html
       </a>
       ). The edition of 1984 I had, had a fore and afterword by a tremendous intellect named
       <strong>
        Erich Fromm
       </strong>
       . Like you, his mind boggled at the wealth of the wealthy, and that they were unsatisfied yet. He sought to explain by what malaise the postmodern order had sleepwalked to this precarious perch. @ u/memnactor you may recall the 'I know the how, but not the why' refrain, ultimately O'Brien reverals that power-the how-is also the why. Think of a car designed solely around the engine-Formula 1! Would you buy milk in that? Drop the kids off at school? It's obviously unbalanced-what is it in the zeitgeist that allows for this? is it reversible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another huge influence was
       <strong>
        Frederic Bastiat
       </strong>
       , who along with
       <strong>
        Frederick Soddy
       </strong>
       were stalwarts of thermodynamics, the dangers of the  exponential function ( Anyway, the Philosopher's Scone seemed like a great career opportunity to the evil Lord Valumart, who considered compound interest the only power greater than himself), and the broken-window-fallacious policy directives of Keynesian economics.

       I read Fromm's The art of loving when i was a teen and really related to it so maybe i should go back and check out some of his other writings.I'll also look into F.Bastiat and F. Soddy as well.Some how i thought with the advent of global media that we would counter all the propaganda with first hand accounts of the effects of war,akin to what happen with viet nam.Sadly no major media outlet will touch anything like that.As much as i dislike them,Vice is the only one.Al Jazeera might have survived if they had half a brain and changed the name to something more palatable to a western viewer.

       Planned obsolescence is evidence of this. Things are made to break, which wastes plastic and metal and so on, so you have to buy them again, which wastes your money! Everything is so designed around catering to the businesses, that regular people are getting taken advantage of constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you can't easily buy a car that will last you 50 years,
       <em>
        like you could do just 60 years ago
       </em>
       , is evidence that proper resources are being kept from us, just out of reach, for financial gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is about the guys who have it all, making tons of selling to the rest who are desperate, thus giving them power. Story as old as humanity itself.

       Now you get it.  Except for one thing: peak oil (which is also peak plastic, peak pharmceuticals, peak chemical), and the fact that this postscarcity condition only exists for the west.
      </p>
      <p>
       Innovations in satellite petro geosurveying have helped us discover much more oil, pushing peak oil from 2030 ish or so to 2080+, and also we've "innovated" in shale oil production.  I put "innovated" in quotes because the technology is stupid, dangerous and honestly anyone could come up with it--which means that the reason we're doing it is that they lobbied our political system to allow us to legally do the most stupid and most dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pump high pressure soaps into the earth and lots of water, and then they suck it out.  Think about the three plus problems with doing that.  Of course it's creating earthquakes.  Of course it's interrupting the structural support of the earth in affected areas, of course their chemicals are getting into the water table, of course those fissures are going to cause other unforeseen problems like forming hydrohalites (salt accumulations under the earth).  Fracking is stupid and irresponsible, but apparently it's here to stay because corporations greed trumps common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So these things will allow us to continue to ruin the planet while stifling true innovations that emerge out of necessity now that that necessity is removed.  Climate will be further disturbed, but as all the 2nd world countries like russia and china become first world countries we might just move the peak oil line back to 2030 since their consumption will outpace any surpluses we got from fracking and satellite scans.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are hoping that by that time we'll have figured out nanotechnology to the extent that fabrication becomes very simple and so by that time the only costs involved in it are managing digital rights to the material items that are fabricated from those licenses.  Simply put, nano will make it so that you buy a license to a cup, because the cost of the cup is meaningless since it will assemble itself from the environment around it.  Material goods then become software.  At that point, peak oil will be meaningless and we really will be living in a post-scarcity world.

       Supremarkets are a bad example. That abundance is the result of commerce and supply chains. If oil becomes unavailable for any reason (or the dollar collapses) you'll see empty shelves in the supermarkets so fast your head will spin. Go check out what Venezuela is going through now.

       Hyper-inflation . . . and it all ends in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Where I think you're right, however, is in your general sentiment. Energy, I believe, is abundant . . . and with technology we had 100 years ago. Things like zero-point energy, and extracting electricity from the Earth [like Tesla did]. The planet is a giant charged particle, after all. The ground is a base. All those lightning strikes just don't disappear magically. The planet underneath us is seething with tappable free energy. I think there's extremely good evidence that we're being kept on this 19th Century paradigm because it's so built into our economy. Great fortunes will be lost if the Powers That Be can't meter and control energy. By controlling energy, you control men and nations. They don't want to give that up.)

       Yes! You are absolutely right. They are hoarding all the resources to drive prices up and hoarding the wealth also. It's more than you can imagine. It's a LOT. They use resources as power. He who controls the resources, controls the rules. That's only like that when the people are unaware but people are waking up now so hopefully things get better.

       I use to work at the Salvation Army and the food which was donated to us usually went to waste. 
I was a driver and picked up many of the food donations. It's sick to see how much food was wasted and thrown away. Many towns actually have laws against giving away food due to the FDA's strict policy on this matter.

       When most people have sufficient wages and sufficient money for buying, they call it inflation. When most people's wages are low, insufficient money for spending and record profits for corporations (add tax cuts and subsidies), they call that growth.

       I was just discussing this with my S/O. We agree with you. We also feel that most of the "food" is not actual food, though. For instance, a chicken has two and only two wings but any given supermarket has an outrageous amount of "chicken wings" and as you said, there are a lot of super markets. This isn't taking into account the restaurants that also sell chicken wings.
I think the whole chicken shortage thing was a lie meant to make things seem normal.

       On a side note: 85/10/5: The country is structured so that 10% of people can actually own large businesses, 85% are kept at a certain level so they can slave for the 10% and 5% of us are conspiracy theorists haha.

       I believe if you look hard enough you can find some... lets just say very creepy videos , of people claiming this is a fact and by design from government think tanks, and even some high up officials.

       A while ago there was highly upvoted post on reddit about how most jobs are bullshit.  Meaning, a lot of people could stop doing their job and the company wouldn't be affected at all.  The question is why in a hyper-capitalist system are they allowing this waste of money?  The conclusion of the article was that at some point, somewhere policy makers must have gotten together and decided they don't want the general population with too much time on their hands.

        and then how much of this food is simply wasted because these supermarkets must make their profit and do not consider helping the problem of hunger.

       Most of that food is given to local food shelfs, which in turn give it to people free of charge. If the food is rotten, then yeahyeah, they throw it away.
