<p>The world <em>of humans</em> is evil, but nature is not.  Look around you at this beautiful place and the heavens above.  We forget that it&#39;s not there to serve us, we&#39;re here to serve it, to understand our place within it... and if we lose that challenge, then we truly do fucking suck and don&#39;t deserve to go beyond.  We were born into Eden and it was our choice to make ugly grass lawns and houses and chainlink fences and cities and other abominations upon the garden.</p>

<p>Humans make lines and corners, nature makes curves and spirals.  We&#39;re cornering ourselves in and don&#39;t realize it.</p>

<p>Who says I don&#39;t? Everyone only cares about themselves. They can lie and put on a face but at the end of the day...the way this material realm is designed is that they would rather you less off if it serves them an advantage. Look at nature. Look at the animal world and the pyramid of predators and prey. The world is greed, evil, selfish.</p>

<p>Really? Who is for you? Do you think if someone had the choice of saving their life or yours...they would saves yours? The majority of people...more than 99.9999% would save their own life. EVERYONE IS FOR THEMSELVES AT THE END OF THE DAY. </p>

<p>Do you think the Lion who sees the Gazelle would stop and think...oh poor little gazelle, have a nice hug? NO. It would fucking massacre it and eat it.</p>

<p>Do you feel sorry for the chicken that was slaughtered when you eat your chicken sandwich?</p>

<p>Explain logically how the statement that the world is evil is false. You keep on repeating the same thing over and over without logically dissecting my argument. It&#39;s an evil wicked world full of people who create delusions to make themselves feel better.</p>

<p>Guess how much Christians killed throughout history? What do you think about the Native American Genocide done by Christians? (with their ten commandments and goodness towards each other and nature and mankind etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is evil because our children are being programmed to be evil.  All things develop according to the Decorator/Phi.  Like a seed perpetually wrapped in layers as we move through life.  When we allow those early layers to be damaged, those damaged seeds perpetuate their bad programs, and the cycle continues.  To end the cycle we have to care for our kids.  It&#39;s that simple.  </p>

<p>Neural net is the mechanism by which we learn.  It&#39;s the most basic form of intelligence.   It&#39;s basically pattern recognition.  There are other more advanced forms of intelligence/cognition that people can learn to use.  But generally speaking most people stay on the neural net level.  Most of the neural net development happens early on in the first few years.  So when we allow kids to be harmed via this network of pedos that seem to be around the planet, we are seeding evil.  Their neural nets are programmed with their abuse.  And since most people don&#39;t have the ability to reprogram themselves, and the controllers of our society encourage badly designed thought patterns, it just continues.  </p>

<p>If we want to fix the world we must start by protecting kids from abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing my point. &quot;Evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; are concepts that are not innate to anything. For something to be evil, there has to be someone observing the thing and then deciding that thing is evil.

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t experienced much -- or you have no clue</p>

<p>It&#39;s evil</p>

<p>Very possibly it was designed as a level of hell from the outset</p>

<p>with the decent folk coming here as missionaries, or maybe as captives</p>

<p>And maybe that&#39;s what Jesus was trying to say -- he was trying to alert the prisoners &amp; captives here that God (the true one) is there and willing to accept us -- all we have to do is reach out to Him, grab his hand</p>

<p>What persuades me that there IS escape is the fact that no matter how bad a person&#39;s gene pool and childhood and environment may have been, they are <em>still</em> acutely aware of justice and injustice</p>

<p>That knowledge, that inherent capacity to know justice and injustice tells me that it&#39;s inborn.  And if it&#39;s inborn, it&#39;s because the cosmos recognizes justice and injustice</p>

<p>No matter how  harshly a person is treated, even if he&#39;s been tortured to death --- the recognition of justice and injustice cannot be driven out of him</p>

<p>Yet justice and injustice have been turned on their heads in this world and that has <em>always</em> been the case</p>

<p>Of course, those who&#39;ve gained what little they know from FB and tv wouldn&#39;t be aware of just how disgusting this world has always been, how unfair, how unjust, how corrupt</p>

<p>Live a bit.  Experience it.  Deal with entrenched corruption and injustice first hand.  Because your claim that the &#39;world is evil if you think it is&#39; is nonsense</p>

<p>Most people begin by believing IMPLICITLY that the world is fair, is just.  They put their faith in corporations, in doctors, teachers, government departments, governments themselves, preachers, etc.  Then they suffer psychic shock when they begin to see the truth.  After that, nothing&#39;s ever the same.  And if they&#39;re very unfortunate (such as children who&#39;re raped, killed, tortured) they are forced to the realization that yes, the world is evil, it is putrid, rank, filthy</p>

<p>But I guess you&#39;ve never been a raped, tortured, murdered infant?  </p>

<p>Or, maybe you&#39;ll insist that raped, tortured, murdered children only THINK the world is evil, huh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning unless we find God, we will not find salvation. Not only spiritually but physically in this world as well. We are much more controlled by sin without religion (atheism). Whereas if you have GOOD religion, even if it&#39;s not the religion I follow, you are less inclined to be negative to the world, thus doing your part to fix the world. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because people don&#39;t care anymore that the world is in it&#39;s current condition. People watching others be oppressed and then joining/spreading the same rhetoric as the groups enslaving them instead of protesting the real criminals. </p>

<p>Stand up for what is right and you will be doing your part. Be aware that the Satan is real and people actually follow him and believe he exists. Therefore, it&#39;s in the best interests of everyone to find his Anti.</p>

<p>In other words, if Satan likes death, we should like life. If Satan says hey, let&#39;s oppress people, we should be saying &quot;let&#39;s not oppress people&quot;. </p>

<p>Just gotta find their Anti and do it to the maximum yo, the Bible helps with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must first understand that you are not the physical vehicle you see when you look in the mirror - that thing known as “the body”.  You are not that.  You <em>inhabit</em> that and wear it like the body wears, say, a shirt or a pair of pants.</p>

<p>That shirt and those pants can come and go - they tear and get destroyed - but the person wearing those pants doesn’t associate themselves <em>as</em> the actual pair of pants they wear.  They just get another pair of pants once the old ones wear out.  You do this, again, because you know you are not what you wear.  You draw a difference between you and the clothes you put on.</p>

<p>We have been tricked and have become convinced that that <em>other</em> article of clothing we wear - the one called “the body” - is actually <em>the real us</em>.  It is not.  The body is simply a more long term pair of socks that the <em>real</em> you wears.  The body will ultimately and eventually go the same way as any pair of socks:  It will dissolve, it will break down, it will discombobulate.  It is temporary.</p>

<p>There is intelligent energy, however, that animates the body, and that intelligent energy is not limited to the same things the physical body is limited by.  It’s not beholden to life on this physical plane (or planet) only.  It may have stints that it must undergo here, but it will not remain here forever.</p>

<p>The sooner one realizes this, wakes up to this fact, and begins to act in a manner commensurate with the eternal identity which they in fact are (i.e. realize that they live in a civilization that is yin and yang, both positive and negative, and they must work diligently to rise above <em>both</em> states), the sooner that eternal identity can continue to develop and evolve more and more, and the sooner it will grow out of its time here on this plane of Earth.</p>

<p>It may take many lifetimes, but we are all evolving, and we are not destined to remain here forever.</p>

<p>Understanding this dynamic can help.</p>

<p>Then, child-free, people would be able to combat the world&#39;s ills without worrying about having to provide and protect their young.  Because (as the world-destroyers are WELL aware) nothing neuters people like parenthood.  Nothing silences people more effectively than parenthood.  Batman, Superman, Catwoman would have divested of their capes and crime fighting the moment kids came along.  People won&#39;t risk offending the &#39;masters&#39; if they have kids counting on them.  Children are the great censors, silencers.  Kids keep parents in line and stop them from taking up the fight.  People can&#39;t afford to be killed or imprisoned if they have a couple of kids who&#39;ll end up helpless, homeless and destined for the sex-slave industry</p>

<p>But for some reason, people are so <em>indoctrinated</em> by society, let alone subject to the biological imperative, that the solution evades them</p>

<p>For some reason, almost all people believe they should produce more of themselves.  They don&#39;t know (because no one tells them) that Nature demands everything create its replacements before it dies.  It&#39;s the same with cockroaches, rats, dogs, cats, lions, weeds, everything.  They devote a huge part of their own existence to creating their replacements</p>

<p>You&#39;d think people would have worked it out by now that children are effectively shackles, hobbles, handicaps</p>

<p>Nothing against kids, but who in their right mind would bring forth children at this point?  Why would anyone do it?  What sort of life do they imagine their kids will have, given the way things are going?  Yet they do.  Mostly by accident.  Nature knows how to get those replacements on the planet and that&#39;s all Nature cares about</p>

<p>So, for those who&#39;re too stupid or lazy to use birth control, maybe exiting the planet prior to putting some poor kid on the ground might be the best idea</p>

<p>For those who&#39;ve managed to remain childless, why not do as much damage as possible to those who&#39;ve made life so unpleasant, before leaving?  At least that way, life will have counted for something</p>

<p>Not when the elite fuck the lives of you, your twin flame, <em>and</em> the progeny of that fire all at the same time.

Your child will be put in &quot;educational&quot; institutions that will sap its creativity and turn it into raging flame of ignorance and callousness.</p>

<p>The MSM will constantly bombard them with everything they <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be - things they won&#39;t know well enough to avoid (likely because their own parents won&#39;t know well enough to avoid it) and they&#39;ll end up corrupted by the influence of that matrix.</p>

<p>The air they breathe, the food they eat, the shows and movies they watch, the things they hear - all will be subtly and overtly toxic; most if not all will be pushing toward a confusion designed to sap more and more of all of your creative geniuses.</p>

<p>None of this is to tell anyone who <em>is</em> in love and <em>is</em> existing under &quot;twin flame&quot; circumstances to not breed.  However, putting progeny into a world as dark and corrupt as this one is something that should be given a <em>lot</em> of significant consideration, for it is a very difficult world that these children are being brought into.</p>

<p>I certainly hope so, my good man, but 1) they’ve been around for a <em>very</em>, very long time, and 2) they kind of seem to be about as strong and powerful as ever at this point actually.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed and correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A baby has a profound effect on a lot of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the responsibility needed in order to help that baby reach it’s full potential is possibly even greater than the profound effect it has on many - and it’s a responsibility many parents unfortunately either can’t or aren’t willing to achieve.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I cannot agree with you <em>more</em> on this.  However, far too many babies are being brought up by people who are far, <em>far</em> from being anywhere near to actualized.</p>

<p>All I’m saying is that those who <em>aren’t</em> actualized should perhaps wait before they bring in more identities to this world that will likely be adversely affected by being brought up and influenced by that un-actualized rearing.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh I am in full agreement with this, sir.  It’s just that with great power comes great responsibility, and far too many of us are <em>far</em> from realizing anywhere near our full power…and until we <em>do</em> realize it, or at least come close to realizing it, we should perhaps stay a bit away from trying to lead others.  I don’t advocate the blind leading the blind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely…IF they don’t get that light fucked out of them before they grow up.  IF they don’t get raised in circumstances that don’t turn them into dark masses of ignorance and violence first.  IF they don’t end up creating even more negativity than would have otherwise been the case because they couldn’t handle how difficult things are in this very difficult civilization.</p>

<p>Yes.  I agree with you.</p>

<p><em>If</em>…</p>

<p>EDIT:  Heck.  Just read some of the stories <a href="http://www.fmylife.com/?page=0#top">here</a>.  A good portion of them are stupid - first world problems or troll posts not really designed to express how things really are.  However, there are a few that will really make you go O_o, and help one understand just how difficult life on this planet can be and is for many.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:  Jesus fucking Christ, bro.  I haven&#39;t even finished reading this...but read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4lwnpl/watched_porn_since_i_was_6_years_old_and_it/"><em>this shit right here</em>.</a>  You think this kid is considered the &quot;angelic, full of potential&quot; being that you described?  Fuck me, man.  Those parents, for example, SHOULD <em>NOT</em> have fucking been parents.  <em>AT ALL</em>.</p>

<p>Fucking straight up case in point.  Sorry to keep dropping F bombs, but Jesus...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing my point. &quot;Evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; are concepts that are not innate to anything. For something to be evil, there has to be someone observing the thing and then deciding that thing is evil. The world is not <strong>inherently</strong> evil, and any response to it(ex. killing oneself) is not <strong>inherently</strong> correct. </p>

<p>I personally believe that some things are fucked up and some things aren&#39;t. I also realize that things being fucked up or not is my own interpretation of things, not something inherent to reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Become aware of the truth through study, personal exertion, and the personal experience that comes with it.</p>

<p>Read the works of individuals like Dr. Ian Stevenson (“Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation”), Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Dr. Raymond Moody, and Dr. Eben Alexander, to name just four academics and professionals who’ve made significant discoveries that have not been disproven by the establishment and which strongly indicate (if not outright prove) that there is an intelligence that exists far beyond the physical realm and that is not beholden to the physical exclusively if at all.</p>

<p>Meditate - not very easy to do if your mind is restless, but if and when you get a handle on it, there is the possibility that you can achieve states of awareness that would otherwise be very difficult to arrive at otherwise.</p>

<p>Just two of various broad steps in the direction of better understanding.</p>
