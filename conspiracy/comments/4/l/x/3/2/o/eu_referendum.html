    <div class="md"><p>In what way is it ridiculous? The founders themselves said the point was to kill off native Europeans. Modern leaders explicitly state that the genocide of natives is the DUTY of Europeans. The invasion from the south happens unabated. Sweden has the second highest incidence of rape in the entire world. The EU is responsible for crimes against humanity–genocide, the siphoning of weath, theft, racketeering, and treason in every member state. Kill them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I don&#39;t have any links to hand I agree strongly that we should leave the EU.</p>

<p>No1 because more government does not solve problems. It never has. We need less government and more democracy.</p>

<p>No2 because the EU has deliberately let over 1 million immigrants into Europe to keep labour rates low in EU countries with high education standards and diminishing reproduction rates.<br/>
EU commissioner stated last month they forecast 2-3 million next year.
(find your own links, do your own reasearch)</p>

<p>No3 the UK pay more money into the EU than we (people) get back in jobs or trade deals.  This is a method for taking money from people (in taxes) and funnelling it into the pockets of company shareholders.</p>

<p>No 4 trade deals are made between businesses.  ( i sell, you buy ) Not politicians.
No trade deals organised by the EU have benefited the working class folks of Britain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the jobs in the north east.  I really do.   but I don&#39;t believe for a second that Britain could not broker a similar deal on our own.<br/>
Britain is the jackpot customer for any international company.  Britain is the high consumer market that all companies want sell to.  Our western materialism combined with lack of internal manufacturing or production makes us the ideal consumer.
Those Nissans will not be shipped and sold abroad....</p>

<p>The EU actively protects manufacturers and producers within the EU, by using quotas and taxes on sellers outside the EU.  This stops uk public from benefiting from cheaper foreign products. </p>

<p>If you have already made up your mind, nothing I say will change it.  But many non EU countries are benefitting hugely from non membership, Norway Switzerland etc.  Britain has been under the EU for so long its hard for some to imagine life outside, but why can all these other countries do without so easily?   not to mention countries within the EU that are totally fucked. Greece, Italy, France, Spain.  </p>

<p>Prove it, then. Shouldn’t be too hard. Oh, wait, no <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html">the definition of the word</a> ‘genocide’ is met in full.</p>

<p><strong>1. Question and minimize the statistics.</strong>
    “Whites are the majority in white countries; their population is going up, not down.”
<strong>2. Attack the motivations of the truth-tellers.</strong>
    “These are just crazy claims by white supremacists and racists.”
<strong>3. Claim that the deaths were inadvertent.</strong>
    “There is no coordinated plan to eliminate the white race. That is just a conspiracy theory.”
<strong>4. Emphasize the strangeness of the victims.</strong>
    “White people have historically enjoyed disproportionate social privileges. Now their countries are becoming just like the rest of the world.”
<strong>5. Rationalize the deaths as the result of tribal conflict.</strong>
    “White people are just worried that they will no longer enjoy the privileges of being an ethnic majority.”
<strong>6. Blame ‘out of control’ forces for committing the killings.</strong>
    “Most immigrants are peaceful and hard working. Islamic extremism is a very small minority and does not represent the immigrant population.”
<strong>7. Avoid antagonizing the genocidists, who might walk out of the ‘peace process’.</strong>
    “Reconciliation is the first step toward solving issues of race in the West. We must learn to live together.”
<strong>8. Justify denial in favor of current economic interests.</strong>
    “Immigrants are crucial to our economic recovery. Immigrants perform jobs most people do not want and spend money that helps grow the economy.”
<strong>9. Claim that the victims are receiving good treatment.</strong>
    “White people today are still well above average in terms of education and financial success.”
<strong>10. Claim that what is going on does not fit the definition of genocide.</strong>
    “Mass immigration is not the same as genocide. Genocide is the destruction of a people.”
<strong>11. Blame the victims.</strong>
    “White people should atone for their history of racism and privilege. Accepting refugees and immigrants from less fortunate countries is crucial to this process.”
<strong>12. Say that peace and reconciliation are more important than blaming people for genocide.</strong>
    “The most important thing is that people from all cultures can learn to live together peacefully. There is no reason for a crazy ‘white genocide’ witch hunt.”</p>

<p><strong><em>YOU’RE A LIAR.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not really, since it’s your claim. Your claim is that there was a genocide of natives. Since you don’t know what the fuck the word ‘genocide’ means, take a look at the link I gave you and then try to match up said actions to what happened. You won’t be able to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;re not understanding me, I&#39;m saying that if at any time you want to change your society you can do it without EU intervention. Also a trade deal is a trade deal it&#39;s not the same as surrendering sovereignty </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you maybe give me a hypothetical example? Also lets say for us to be part of the single market we need to accept EU regulations on the environment, this would undermine our sovereignty as we may risk the deal if we abandon their policy but have no say. </p>

<p>I have a very good understanding of history, care to explain to me why I don&#39;t?</p>

<p>NHS, very many foreign doctors working in it, we kick them out for some stupid reason of &quot;ethnic purity&quot; then health system would likely collapse</p>
