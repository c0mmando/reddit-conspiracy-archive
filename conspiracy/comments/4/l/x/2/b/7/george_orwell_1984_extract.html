        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve picked up the 1984 by George Orwell and came across this on page 74-75:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.</p>

<p>This ain&#39;t a conspiracy I know, just wanted to share it as this sounds a little familiar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a twist.. I remember listening to a podcast (I think Alan Watts?) that spoke about Orwell and Huxley&#39;s ties to the elites. And that their works were specially meant to condition us at a young age to accept our fate. </p>

<p>Remember, these two books are extremely popular and almost mandatory reading in U.S. schools. Here&#39;s one comment I found that talked about this: <a href="http://imgur.com/JzJKwyv">http://imgur.com/JzJKwyv</a></p>

<p>Haven&#39;t looked into this to say for sure, but it&#39;s definitely interesting. That being said, 1984 is still my favorite book : )</p>

If something like this turned out to be true, who knows what else could be &quot;planted&quot; amongst our culture.  The implications of such a reality are terrifying.  Holy hell.  If that&#39;s true then the rabbit hole very well may be infinite.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that texts were at one time reserved for the enlightened, and that the common rabble were in fact widely uneducated.</p>

<p>Then comes the Industrial Revolution and the printing press. Suddenly the rabble are upwardly mobile and speaking to one another independently about such things as oppre$ion and inju$tice, and observing the way in which human resources are managed.</p>

<p>This is bad for business, but progress cannot be reversed. It can, however be brought into the service of the illuminated so as to rebalance the scales.</p>

<p>So the logical countermove is to send out amongst them information that serves the aims of the illuminated, sows discord, disillusionment, confusion.</p>

<p>And to keep things simple, the illuminated called it DISINFORMATION.</p>

<p>The scandals (&quot;conspiracies&quot;) you read about in this sub are the more detailed ramifications and consequences of that particular control mechanism i.e. people being blinded, lead astray, their minds fragmented, knowledge compartmentalised, silenced, dumbed down etc. so they can&#39;t even perceive, let alone describe or discuss the systems (&quot;larger evils&quot;) that keep them in bondage.</p>
