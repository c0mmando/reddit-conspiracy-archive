    <div class="md"><p>Low effort post, asking other people to validate a hazy opinion you hold. If you think Obama has &quot;done some good things&quot; then list them.</p>

<p>I am not American, but I think Obama&#39;s Presidency has been a catastrophic fraud. He promised a lot and delivered absolutely nothing - in fact less than nothing, because his Executive Orders have been detrimental to both democracy and the rule of law. The idea that the Head of State of a country can order somebody&#39;s execution (by drone) unilaterally, without due process is an abomination, and would not be possible in a functioning democracy.</p>

<p>If the President of the United States does not act against a person who he or she believes (with probable cause) is conspiring or planning to <strong>execute</strong> innocent Americans, then that President is complicit in the crime (of not only murder, but also treason) as well, and just as guilty as the person who is planning to <strong>execute</strong> innocent Americans. It&#39;s the same as if you know that someone is planning to murder your neighbor and you do nothing, then you are complicit in the crime.</p>

<p>Firstly, your scenario does not give you the moral OR legal right to kill the person you believe is planning the crime, unless you were to do so whilst the crime was taking place (ie legitimate defence).</p>

<p>Secondly, the US President has no way of knowing if the targets he selects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Pakistan etc etc are actual/potential terrorists, or whether they just &quot;look like they might be&quot;. And in fact, these drone strikes have almost certainly killed more innocent bystanders than actual terrorists.</p>

<p>First of all, I appreciate your POV. I don&#39;t like the idea of drone strikes anymore than you do. However, I accept your &quot;moral / legal&quot; challenge. </p>

<p>That said, I stand by my statement...if you know that someone is planning to murder your neighbor (or someone in your family &gt;&gt;&gt; an even better analogy) and you do nothing, then you are indeed LEGALLY culpable for doing nothing. But for the sake of hair-splitting clarity, let&#39;s say you call the police (eg, in Pakistan or Afghanistan or Iraq) and report your suspicions / facts. But the police tell you that there is nothing they can do because they don&#39;t know where the suspect is or can&#39;t find him. On the other hand, maybe they do know where the suspect is (because you just called them and told them that he is lurking outside your neighbor&#39;s window with a gun), but the crooked / corrupt / inept police tell you they are not convinced of your suspicions / proof and are not willing to investigate / respond (see Lee Harvey Oswald) because they are also complicit in the crime, then what do you do? Are you MORALLY obligated to defend your neighbor? I would argue YES. If you argue NO, then I would not like to have you for a cowardly neighbor, especially if you have a bigger and / or more accurate gun than the perp outside my window.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No way of knowing? Objection! What if you he does indeed know?
Sounds like to me that you assume Obama just shoots from the hip on the basis of half-cocked rumors. No, I refuse to believe he is a Bush. I believe that he does due diligence and doesn&#39;t take these perps lightly. Other theorists here would argue that he is a cold-blooded killer who kills for fun, but I&#39;m not buying it. I believe that he has a conscience.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. However, I&#39;ll argue that he can not be everywhere and do everything. I believe that he demands minimal casualties. However, that is not always possible, and furthermore, he has to rely on his subordinates to carry out his orders to the T. And as we all know, subordinates do not always follow orders to the T. Some are loyal. Some are backstabbers who want to see us fail or worse. No doubt, there are plenty of those under his command. So what can he do? Pull the trigger himself every time? No.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very good question. However, I would argue that Assad does not respect democratic principles. He is a dictator (with a minority of loyalists in spite of majority opposition), which means he values his office and power above the well-being of his constituents, so he can go suck a drone missile. I feel sorry for his people though. Like Hitler, he is going to burn them ALL down for totally selfish reasons.</p>

<p>Morals are different everywhere as are legal standards. By American standards, and the vast majority of the rest of the world&#39;s, dictatorships are both morally and legally in the wrong, so...<strong>no</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very good question. However, I would argue that Assad does not respect democratic principles. He is a dictator (with a minority of loyalists in spite of majority opposition), which means he values his office and power above the well-being of his constituents, so he can go suck a drone missile. I feel sorry for his people though. Like Hitler, he is going to burn them ALL down for totally selfish reasons.</p>
