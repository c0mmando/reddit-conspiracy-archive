       I've been reading this sub for a while now. There used to be many topics that would grab my attention, but I've come to realize that, yes, even in this sub there are norms. Just like on the rest of Reddit; things you can't mention or talk about because the community is not open to them. Ever read about Donald Marshall? Well if you did it probably wasn't here. Go read his website, talk about rabbit holes....
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;Dr lets talk about the shit people don't want to; reptilians, cloning, transfer of consciousness, rape torture murder pay per views, child trafficking.... oh wait, we can't because this is r/conspiracy and rigging elections is as deep as it goes here. (Which is mainstream knowledge at this point....)
      </p>
      <p>
       As exemplified perfectly by u/tunderbar1 :
       <em>
        "reptilians, cloning, transfer of consciousness" - are you fucking retarded? You want to talk about actual conspiracies, you need to get into political stuff. It is what it is.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets talk about this response. This user doesn't like the topics, so the response is 'you're retarded, you
       <em>
        NEED
       </em>
       to get into politics, it is what it is (essentially
'Accept what you see in front of you')
      </p>
      <p>
       Please tell me r/conspiracy what are the
       <em>
        "actual conspiracies"
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       First we are marginalized to groups like these, where we face further alienation if we don't adhere to the strict thinking. I guess the phrase "thought police" really comes to mind here...
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you really are thinking (human) cloning is "fucking retarded", then you should probably consider that as of last year at least 70 countires have banned the technology.

       Yeah I regularly go to 'New' in this sub and that's where the good stuff is. The front page of this sub is usually shillary and politics. I've submitted a good dozen or so interesting conspiracy links and only a few of them ever made it to front.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest conspiracies imho, are spiritual warfare, enlightenment, consciousness transfer, A.I. take overs, alien, tech, illuminati satanists, and all that type of ilk. However I'm hoping once the election is over and Trump proves that we are again, in the same pickle (because he will be surrounded by all the same corporate interests that surround every president) then we can return to better topics

       Have you looked into remote viewing? Specifically the declassified docs about it? Funny how they say the reason those programs were closed is because they didn't work, because every doc I've seen say that they worked very well.

         Reddit has been censoring users and independent media sources for years with an increasing zeal, they are censoring them because they are compromising the narratives of the Corporate Owned Mass Media. They punch holes in the official scenery of propaganda, fear, polarization and lies.
         <em>
          The recipe for destroying the corporate propaganda is straight forward: Data and fact driven journalism with a high degree of integrity.
         </em>
         Reddit is owned by
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">
          Advanced Publication Inc
         </a>
         a de facto Corporate Owned Mass Media outlet.

         There is a lot of racist postings on the front page of r/conspiracy, thinly disguised as "conspiracy anti-Israel posts". They constantly make up 10-20% of the front page volume if you don't repeatedly remove them. There is a lot of wedge issues, pitching various groups against each other, thinly disguised as conspiracies. On top of that you can add irrelevant trivia, celebrity gossip, all designed to distract and entertain. What you have left is maybe 5% of relevant content. This is how "they" are dumbing down the conspiracy forum and Reddit in general, a mere shadow if its former glory, an echo valley for idiots padding each other on the back. People kind of know, everything looks more and more like CNN and BBC, while the intelligentsia is fleeing the forum.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is the reason Reddit r/Conspiracy has become diluted and "vanilla" just a shadow of its former self!

       Yes! I just realized this after rarely seeing anything about the cdc cover-up on here. I had to search and then realized most of them had a huge number of down votes. Censoring of this subreddit is a scary thing.

         (my personal theory) During the Snowden scandal the r/conspiracy forum was a strong catalyst for revealing the truth about NSA's illegal activities. Now they are (successfully) shutting down any useful communication.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (my personal experience) Just 2 weeks before the Snowden debacle became public knowledge, me and some guys posted a lot of data and information about the illegal NSA activities (data, news articles, comments). The moderator team (I assume) kept removing our posts and we got trolled a lot. Then they started banning accounts, for absolutely no reason, in an attempt to contain the scandal. One moderator even went so far as to threatened to ban my account (they actually banned a guy with a 100k karma account).

       Top story right now: An article about a blog post that got deleted about hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you know what people believe now?? If a web site deletes an obvious troll post that it is a conspiracy and warrants a thread here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dumb as hell. People who don't want to post in politics are using this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, users here (and across reddit) abuse the downvote button - especially to keep people from posting more often (time resets). I see that here all the time. It is not a disagree button, but obviously some people cannot read too well.
      </p>
      <p>
       No shocker though when some posters who hate hillary will post anything at all about her and consider it a conspiracy. Maybe the conspiracy is they are being made to post shit like that here.

       For anyone interested, Annie Jacobsen is an awesome researcher... most likely connected not privvy to disclosing all her info, but interesting none the less.

       Then on the science front a lot more could be talked about... Human germline modification, overunity devices, programming viruses to build electronics... Last one catch your eye? Angela Belcher. Crazy mad scientist woman. When you consider the things she dabbles in, it kinda makes you appreciate technological suppression.

       Reddit is another gated forum to contain real issues affecting the average person. Your post is perfect example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real fucking conspiracy that should matter to you is rigged elections, how they are destroying our environment and food and the political elite class using us as a slaves, and stripping away our natural freedom to move and live as we like.

       Aliens, reptilians are fucking sci-fi distraction for supposed freethinkers, it's fucking crowd control bullshit.

      <p>
       Like fucking grown men who like sci-fi star trek bullshit but fucking can't think outside the box to question the validity of their animated space program that isn't real. Instead they are brainwashed to dream of fake animated space and do not question our current scam program eating billions of  dollars. Spot the scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       They us got so lost that NASA's bullshit Apollo program is considered taboo conspiracy cause fucking Joe Rogan and Alex Jones don't support it or in  Rogan's case, he back peddled after sucking in large conspiracy minded people. Bait and switch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to add a royal fuck you to all cointelpro assholes Joe Rogan, Alex jones, and David Icke. Fuck the gatekeepers! I see your game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck the conspiracy distraction bullshiters who peddle sci-fi conspiracy shit to make us forget our real cage and our real problems ailing us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you are awake but you can't see the walls they get you to build around yourselves. Aliens and reptilians is where they derail you from the Truth. Don't lose yourself in bullshit they lay for us to follow.

       And Donald Marshall is not really credible. Just listen to the podcast. I can not take anything he says at face value.

       See, this Donald Marshall stuff is new to me. And I'm not saying he's credible by any means,. It's just a disappointment that we can't discuss it because everyone's too busy telling each other what theoires are impossible and calling each other retarded.

       The consensus of the people that watched the Donald  marshal episode of the higherside chats was that he is a plant to mask or distract from the real cloning operations. That was the host's impression as wells. I like to say if there is disinformation then there is also information.

       Thank you. And to u/tunderbar1, vociferous but correct. The only conspiracies that are real and that matter are conspiracies of men, the most affecting of which occur within political office and other arenas of extreme power/wealth. Wacky fringe shit belongs in fringe subs.

       the NASA scam goes so deep its unreal. Americans are all beating themselves raw to blow more money on giant ships that may never leave Earth. NASA is just another way to funnel billions into Boeing and Lockheed Martin under a patriotic, nationalistic sense of scientific accomplishment.

       It is highly unlikely that aliens don't exist. There are billions of stars in this Milky Way galaxy that we are in. The Milky Way galaxy is just one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the observable universe that we are in. We keep finding more and more earth like planets in the goldilocks zone. It's not imposible that aliens don't exist, it's just highly unlikely. It would take the closest aliens many dozens or hundreds or thousands of generations to reach earth without faster-than-light travel/warp drive or teleportation.
      </p>

       Think of what would happen if the global leaders disclosed the alien presence that is very possible. There would be global chaos in the religions and economies and the fossil fuel oil-igarchs would be made obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: There is also the theory that Watergates Hunt alegedly beleived JFK was assassinated becuase he was going to disclose the alien presence.

       I don't think our world functions like material planets in orbits. It is possible that other beings are within our realm here, but we are separated from them by another plane of existence. In this sense, our world is like realms within realms. Hence, the tradition Alien on ships are not what we would expect but perhaps rather beings that bend time and space traveling through the aether. Like paranormal activity  is more likely. They are not alien in the traditional sense

       Go on. It may not be mutually exclusive. I have come across some certain oddities and claims regarding aliens and inter dimensional beings. Phil Schneider use to give speeches about the alien presence, mainly the Gray's, Deep Underground Military Bases (D.U.M.B.s), alien technology, the alien agenda (decreasing the most of the global human population, collecting adrenacrone (or whatever it's called) which is like cocaine to them. The frantic caller on coast to coast was mind boggling, claiming that extra dimensional aliens want to decrease the global human population so that the few that are left would be more easily controllable. The frantic caller supposedly called back to say that the initial statements were made up, but people think that the second call was faked or maybe forced to do so or whatnot. I have heard of theories that the tall Gray's or tall whites act as hitmen and body guards for the reptilians or something. Considering the state of the world and it's history that we know, the reptilians theory makes sense, but how would one publicly know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Phil Schneider was assassinated two months after his lasts speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the tall Gray's or tall whites act as hitmen and body guards for the reptilians or something.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Tall Grays are the scientists and intellects for the Reptilians as well, supposidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3: It might be the short Gray's.

       I used to think this, but I've come up with my own novel conspiracy theories and posted them and some get traction and some don't.  I've seen more support for my stuff than an organized effort against them.

       One that I suggested that got interest was that the RRR (ridiculously resilient ridge) was a haarp phenom created to restart a stalled gulf loop current that stalled because of deepwater horizon.  So just to be clear, we caused the california drought on purpose to stop global catastrophe of screwing up larger oceanic currents.

       People actualy liked this, because I supported it with research.  That's all.  You just have to get a few links, connect them together and build a narrative.  If you do that, it will get traction.

       However.....they didn't like this.  I also said that there was this group of shemale porn 'mashup' producers (PMVs--'porn music videos') that were embedding a Nazi lebensborn symbol into their works subliminally, but people didn't like it because it was an 'icky' thing they didn't care about. I said really the resurgence of this dovetailes into a larger transification agenda to

       What is there to talk about? Elections are rigged on a number of levels and they taught you about it in high school. Go to r/politics if you wanna follow the election. I guess I am just jaded that Santa has more of a chance of being elected Potus than the US becoming 'great again'.

       Isnt r/politics a cesspool and shenanigan racket where they censor stuff just because? The top posts here relate to the election and not on only policies its also mainly conspiracy related.

       I checked out donaldmarshallrevolution.com, much theory, little conspiracy. Interesting if you want to read a scary stories.
I read to the part where he said Paul Walker maybe was killed because he invested in a company called Bitcoin.

       We don't talk about reptilians because the "Proof" David Icke has presented is little to none, while these tings we do talk about actually have proof.

       Thank you. Even more concerning than the lack of paticular topics is the way other, more mainstream topics are posited. A user here just cross-posted from r/The_Donald recycled garbage: an old YouTube video of an even
       <em>
        older
       </em>
       message from Ron Paul (which isn't a bad thing) asserting that Bernie isn't on the side of transparency. Any thinking citizen can look up the audit vote: Bernie voted in favor of the audit, along with the Republicans. With no real discussion of how they "watered down the bill", and completely ignoring Bernie's stance in the end, you have people on --this-- sub of all places touting severe ignorance to a level of Trump supporters on a thread where any post exposing the mistake is, by their own rules, both bannable and
       <em>
        deserving
       </em>
       of redicule. Making America great again both here and there, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped lurking this morning to join in on lively discussion. Only 4 hours into my participation and I'm considering giving up on this sub since we seem to be stifling each other.

       Looked up Donald Marshal.  I think the reason why you don't see much consciousness transfer/cloning/lizard people posts is because people don't want to sound completely batshit insane.  Donald sounds completely batshit insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think part of the problem with talking about things like that is the fact that it can't really be argued for or against. Any source you might find on that stuff is probably just going to be on a website made by some tinfoil hat enthusiast. We have no idea as to the amount of truth behind what Marshal says.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that he speaks nothing but absolute truths, but it's also possible hes completely off his rocker...a bit too far gone for the people of this sub. I mean, is there crazy fucking science shit happening in secrecy?  I guarantee it.  But are they cloning perfectly functioning human beings to use for evil?  Probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       As interesting as this stuff is, I think a lot of people (if theyre anything like me) don't want to be on that level of conspiracy.  Idk.

       You're 100% correct.  3-4 years ago this was a MUCH better sub.  Typical Reddit assholes ruined it.  Now it's all about bitching about politics and corruption, or even just become a place for bitching about Reddit itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more aliens, no more cryptids, no more UFOs, no more suppressed history.  All of those were segmented to other subs that are hardly even visited.  They even changed the side bar a while back to reflect the "new" "sanitized" "Reddit approved" conspiracies.

       I have left reddit for
       <a href="https://voat.co/">
        Voat
       </a>
       due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.
      </p>
      <p>

       I think the "problem" is that "conspiracy theorists" in their struggle to try to get people to understand that conspiracies aren't crazy have tended to stick more to the conspiracies that have some actual solid evidence.  Things like reptilians etc. are good to think about - but you can't really corner your friends in a bar and say "reptilians are real and I can
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       it" with a straight face.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said - conspiracy theorists have to quit trying to stop worrying about looking respectable in other people's eyes.  In my experience people think you are just as batshit insane if you choose to talk about the Reichstag fire or humans being alien hybrids.  Oddly enough, I've gotten at least one really die-hard anti-conspiracy person admitting that ancient aliens is a pretty interesting concept that makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is conspiracy theorists need to quit trying to appear rational to morons that really can't seem to figure out how they are being lied to and manipulated even after you spell it out for them.  They'll even argue with you about it.  Fuck 'em.

       I think reptilians are bullshit and I don't really buy a lot of the more outlandish conspiracy theories. That said... It is completely against the nature of this sub for the community to react the way it does to these things. We're
       <em>
        supposedly
       </em>
       a group of people who question everything and always consider that there may be alternative motives, yet we've settled down into a echo chamber of political conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get my wrong, political conspiracy is the most obvious conspiracy around today. But we should extend our ideologies to
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       else.
       <strong>
        Question everything.

       I sincerely doubt that there are reptiles living at the centre of the earth and are infiltrating the upper echelons of society to control us. But I don't know, and an open mind isn't a bad thing.

       Excercising an open mind is a great way to not fall into the "your outlandish ideas are fucked, mine totally make sense" trap...

       I know cloning is a thing. We've been able to clone full on people for years and years. Lots of countries banned is as soon as they realized is was a thing that we could do.

       Cloning of humans is possible and is likely happening. Not the end of the world. Let's say you clone Hitler. Without the experience of his upbringing and the experience he had in WWI and the political situation in Germany and the political opportunities, etc. the clone will just be another kid growing up working trying to feed and clothe himself and his family just like the rest of us.

       Maybe. So what? Seriously. What implications does this have to my everyday life? As opposed to pharmaceutical related conspiracies, or GMOs, or the global warming scam, or simply politicians conspiring to enrich themselves by selling their influence? Or the militarization of police depts.?

       We have to pick our battles. There are real conspiracies going on every day that are essentially commoditizing our lives and causing us direct physical or financial harm. You want to speculate about consciousness transfers or cloning or reptiles, go for it. I will gladly read some or all of it before I decide to downvote it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would suggest is another subreddit for this stuff. This one is r/conspiracy, and we discuss conspiracies. You may want to create one named something like r/conspiracytheory or something like that where you can discuss highly dubious and likely unprovable claims.

       This isn't  r/socialjustice
So the things posted in this sub don't have to result in great change or opening the eyes of the sheeple.

       I won't argue that an election system that forces you to choose between a bigoted, money-hungry psychopath who has no concept of who "the people" are, and jesus fucking Donald Trump is significantly more important, and should get more time than reptiles and clone armies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that said, how does that affect your daily life? Besides making you angry? You can't change it, maybe your entire populace can't at this point... so how is it different than consciousness transfer? Knowing about it won't alter your life, nor will it spur you on to feats of great justice and progressive change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information is not heavy, and since no one is telling you to take reptilians as hand-to-god truth... what does it matter if someone says they think there maybe lizardmen living at the core of the planet?

      <p>
       I like to look at this sub as a what if machine... what if there are aliens? What if there is a society in the centre of the earth, what if we have colonies on mars, what if i can upload myself into a machine, or a dog, or another human mind...?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun things to think about, thought exercises.  Having an open mind isn't about knowing that the bad people to bad things and we get screwed by them, it's not immediately dismissing something because it doesn't fit into what you "know" is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men in Black (fitting for a conspiracy sub) said it best: "1,500 years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was the center of the universe. 500 years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was flat. And 15 minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow."

       Then you or your opponents need a separate sub. There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a component of social justice here (although I cringe to use that term given how much shit it has suffered lately when associated with those promoting many core liberal beliefs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I think social justice is relevant? Because I believe that there is secret information and machinations going on in this country and the world that no one would ever know about, yet, despite the sheeple they may be, they as Americans still have a right to know. And with the dissemination of this knowledge, power against tyranny can consolidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a clubhouse where you can discuss UFOs, aliens, cloning, or other topics, when they really aren't as relevant to the destruction of a free society in the Federal government not to mention on a globally?  It's far more beneficial to focus on the connections and plots and conspiracies of the Deep State. Further, we happen to be at a very fortuitous juncture right now: given all of the shit that is going on right now, people are beginning to be receptive to believing in these types of conspiracies.  This bodes well for doing some good...to possibly increase awareness and consequently, the resistance to our being further relegated into slavery by the financial and political elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want this sub to be ridiculed. Eventually, I would like this sub to be vindicated... To be seen as the harbinger...The group that knew the truth before anyone else because we risked taking the unpopular "conspiracy theorist" views regarding Sandy Hook, The Boston Marathon, 9/11, the Aurora shooting, and other topics...which of course includes discussions regarding historical events such as the Gulf of Tonkin, USS Liberty, Gladio B, etc., as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most noble goal is to do good, not treat this sub as a place to discuss interesting, but highly speculative topics, the discussion for which will ultimately do little for the common good.

       If the government knows that aliens exist and is keeping that knowledge from the public, that's a conspiracy and has every right to be discussed here.

       As for the social justice aspect... just no. All of us circlejerking over Dollary Trumpton will accomplish exactly as much as discussing the weather manipulation, chemtrails, or hollow earth theory... Precisely nothing.

       It may be fun...It may be interesting. I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't delude yourself into believing it doesn't do any good to inform people of truth that's hiding in plain sight. I see Redditors who lurk for awhile finally post and say something to the effect of "I thought
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was all crazy nuthouse whackjobs, but a lot of this stuff is well thought out and it has completely opened my eyes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just recently someone just like this, on his own initiative, was interested in Sandy Hook. He watched a documentary and it terrified him.
       <strong>
        That's Progress!!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       As small as that might be, are you incapable of seeing this as a victory?? If you don't believe it is a victory, then conspiracy theory to you is not about truth, but about
       <em>
        entertainment
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not being a snob. In fact, I think everyone here is entertained somewhat with conspiracy theory. I personally love looking at the Zapruder film and trying to find anomalies that prove it was altered. If I convince others of this fact, will it do much good? Not really...I doubt there are even many people who still believe Oswald solely killed JFK. But it's a lot of fucking fun just the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when it comes to examinations of people right now like Hillary or Jeb Bush a few months ago— in contrast to the fun I derive from scrutinizing the Zapruder film—there are histories regarding these crooks and murderers that everyone needs to know about (before they get elected...And I'm thinking if Hillary mostly here).
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to know what we (the U.S.) do to foment wars around the world... why overthrowing Qadaffi was a tragedy... how we financially take over countries... or secretly orchestrate coups.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to know how John Negroponte engineered the most grisly torture campaign in the Honduras and Nicaragua in the 1980s in the name of greed... Or how Bush Sr. overthrew Noriega and crushed Escobar simply because he wanted the Cali cartel to prosper since they cooperated with the US and it's interests. People really need to understand what Fast &amp; Furious meant and what it did. They need to know our government—and the bankers in bed with them—destroy whistleblowers, sexually assault kids, pass laws and executive orders depriving us of basic rights....They need to know that they could be "black-bagged" and never heard from again, and it's all perfectly legal!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think we can accomplish those things in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ? Or maybe
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       ??  Of course not!  The sub
       <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">
        /r/actualconspiracies
       </a>
       is a subtle ridicule of this sub because they already think that our discussion of the Boston Marathon false flag is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it relates to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , I am for an image (I'm sorry, but it's the way the world works) that displays us as using critical thinking to unravel issues...relevant issues. Not fanciful ideas as to what is hidden at Area 51... (and there very well could be an alien there—I'm serious...) But it does nothing but hurt us to discuss that topic—a post about aliens is going to be repugnant to a new visitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the mainstream news already treats us like fools or as individuals suffering from paranoid delusions, why be our own worst enemy and give  others fodder to support that conclusion?

       I'm not the one being selfish, actually.  I feel this sub is for enlightening people. Be it to the corruption of their governments, or to the hidden potential locked up within themselves, or to the possibility that we may be in a galactic neighbourhood.  It is all relevant.  If half of what I've read about the so-called hidden human potential is true, and we all knew about it, these political machinations would be moot, they would no longer be able to control us, and their whole system would fall apart...

       You're right, spreading knowledge is important, I didn't mean to downplay that. But it doesn't matter how many people KNOW the elections are a farce, if the "powers" want Hillary on the Throne, she will have it regardless of how upset we all get about it.

      <p>
       Should we not try to make a difference? Of course not. But to say that if it's not immediately relevant to the political climate of the week, then it's not worthy of Conspiracy is closed minded, and rather selfish...

       If it is to create a mutually masturbatory echo chamber, then by all means discuss these topics, for you will rarely if ever, draw in new people, and will never have the opportunity to enlighten them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd prefer topics such as reptilians, cloning, transfer of consciousness, Jesuits, nation states of D.C., London, and Vatican to
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be discussed here in this sub...I'd even suggest to some degree not talking about chemtrails (at least not use that word in such discussions).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not commenting on the validity of any of those topics, but what I'm doing is trying to make this sub welcoming to new members. I don't want people to stop in and see posts on UFOs, reptilian shape-shifters, and moon landings hoaxes, because they will simply turn around, leave and never return, and worse, they will thereafter more strongly believe in the media's pejorative use of the label "Conspiracy Theorist". A label which portrays us as necessarily wearing tinfoil hats and acting like we're overdue for our 2x daily thorazine shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discuss these other topics, create a sub called "deepconspiracies" or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one don't believe sitting in a sub with a semi-static membership growth. The point of discussing conspiracies is to enlighten others as to their truth. And to do that, you have to start with the most important and plausible topics.

       Remote viewing is vanilla.....i've popped out of the body a few dozen times and seen where we all come from, and all the traps and shit that goes on, on the other side after this meat suit dies......its fucking nuts straight up...we're not even from here and everyone thinks this is all there is....and its not.

       Well... I respectfully disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government knows that aliens exist and is keeping that knowledge from the public, that's a conspiracy and has every right to be discussed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the social justice aspect... just no. All of us circlejerking over Dollary Trumpton will accomplish exactly as much as discussing the weather manipulation, chemtrails, or hollow earth theory... Precisely nothing.
Social Outrage, maybe... on a super small scale, but you and I are going to affect zero change via this subreddit.

       So I say let's actually open our minds, let's discuss everything, because why not? It literally cannot hurt.
