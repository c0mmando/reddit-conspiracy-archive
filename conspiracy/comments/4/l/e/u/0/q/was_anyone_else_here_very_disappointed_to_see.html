<p>I can find nothing about whether Hillary was paid, or paid them to be promoted on the show, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn these two actresses were paid off or coerced into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, it was super wack.  You knew it was coming and they just shoe horned her in at the end.  Then hillary tries to make a joke but since she has no sense of humor it just comes of just like a person with no sense of humor trying to tell a joke.  I really like Broad city but i was very disappointed with this episode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Hillary came across as pretty creepy in that episode. The whole &quot;vote for Hillary because she&#39;s a woman&quot; thing was blatantly pushed in that episode, despite the writers saying they took no political stance. Pretty weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it ironic that a comedy featuring two women that uses an antiquated and demeaning term for women, and has a woman candidate that pushes the &quot;vote for me I&#39;m a woman&quot; thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Learn to cut through the bull shit. You can&#39;t just not laugh and watch things you enjoy out of fear for propaganda. The show is funny. I won&#39;t watch that episode again. I won&#39;t watch MSM because it has no benefiting aspects. But comedy man, that and music is all we got to fight the man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of Amy poehler... I watched all of parks and rec recently and I really think that show is predictive programming for Hillary. She&#39;s always trying impose some shit on the town they don&#39;t want and you are led to feel bad when she can&#39;t just pass something on a whim... Not to mention the way she behaves is a friendly caricature of Hillary. Wide eyes. Manic smile, cackling laugh, married to another reasonably powerful politician.... The site even ends with implying she becomes president in 2020.</p>
