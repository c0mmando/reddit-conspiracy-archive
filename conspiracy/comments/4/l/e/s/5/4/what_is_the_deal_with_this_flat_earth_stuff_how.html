       1) Coming here to gainsay specific conspiracy theories without offering a counter-argument or anything of substance. If your level of argumentation doesn't extend beyond "uh, that's dumb" then this subreddit is not for you.

       2) Pushing the pernicious MSM trope that certain  ideas are "off limit", and introduced to "discredit conspiracy theorists/this subreddit".

       ahh i see. That makes a bit more sense. Thank you for the explanation. I do think that the topic deserves a discussion of sorts, though I imagine there may be a slightly better way to frame it or introduce the concept than OP's post.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, I didn't particularly see this post as criticizing this subreddit per se, since I don't normally see people on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       hopping on the flat earth bandwagon... but maybe I too have been a bit oblivious lately.

       Anyway, thank you again. I appreciate the active moderation and enforcement of the rules here. :)

       Yes, Flat Earth is an outlier conspiracy with only a few adherents within this subreddit, but if people can't discuss it here, where can they discuss it? The ethos of this subreddit is that no conspiracy is off-limits, because if we (the mods) ever published a list of "banned conspiracy theories", this sub would rightly be accused of selling out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That sometimes means the mods have to intervene to stop "self-appointed arbiters" trying to shut down discussion of conspiracy theories (that they don't like) with insults rather than arguments.

       Delusions like the Flat Earth are most definitely introduced by TPTB to not only keep the image of "crazy conspiracies", but to cause a division amongst us in order to keep us arguing about what the "right conspiracies" are.

       You see this phenomenon a lot: It starts out as a thing trolls say to be particularly obnoxious; then you have people who are willing to believe absolutely anything and who simply happened to run across the Flat Earth stuff before they encountered Scientology or Transcendental Meditation or a Trump rally; and finally it becomes a whole self-perpetuating
       <em>
        thing.
       </em>
       The growth is exponential, so it'll look like it came out of nowhere if you haven't been tracking it.

       The technique as such? Not much, really. Meditation is a great way to clear out your head and reduce stress, and it can totally be good for your mental health. TM works for some, not for others, like most things. The problem is with the
       <em>
        movement
       </em>
       and any claims that go beyond the base benefits of meditation. Like Yogic Flying.

       TL;DR: It's easy to make fun of something you don't understand, but as with "enlightenment," there's practical aspects to many things previously considered mystical/spiritual/silly, even if the most extreme things claimed    in the original spiritual tradition never manifest. That includes Yogic Flying.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yogic Flying comes in several stages:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 the body warms up and shakes;
      </p>
      <p>
       2 the body 'hops like a frog';
      </p>
      <p>
       3 the body 'sits in the air' (classic levitation);
      </p>
      <p>
       4 'Passage through the skies' (the rough name of the technique in Sanksrit).
      </p>
      <p>
       No-one has ever seen stage 3 or stage 4, but since the purpose of the practice is to stabilize the physical changes that occur during meditation, that is irrelevant. There are many TM-Sidhis practices, each of which is meant to stabilize meditation changes during some kind of activity. Yogic Flying happens to involve a physical component, so the nervous system becomes accustomed to being in a very meditation-like state, even in the midst of extremely vigorous physical activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6daNyp884Po">
        video of a bunch of boy scouts doing Yogic Flying
       </a>
       . That video is taken from a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoKEUV4Ivwo">
        larger video
       </a>
       of a scouting jamboree involving the charges of Father Gabriel Mejia, who uses TM &amp; Yogic Flying [etc] as rehabilitation/therapy for his charges, all of whom are either child rebels given into his care by the Colombian government, or child sex-workers rescued off the streets of Colombia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Colombian government recently finished a research project looking at the effects of TM &amp; Yogic Flying [etc] practice on juvenile offenders in prison, and has decided to implement its teaching and practice in every such facility, nationwide.

       People believe everything trump says and some of it is more silly than flat earth :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently from trump:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We’re in front of a very hostile judge,” Mr. Trump said. “The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly, he should recuse himself because he’s given us ruling after ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Trump also told the audience, which had previously chanted the Republican standard-bearer’s signature “build that wall” mantra in reference to Mr. Trump’s proposed wall along the Mexican border, that Judge Curiel is “Mexican.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “
        <strong>
         What happens is the judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican
        </strong>
        , which is great. I think that’s fine,” Mr. Trump said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge Curiel was born in Indiana.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And people believe he is the best person to run our country....and some people believe the earth is flat.

       If you follow the flat earth rabbit hole you will eventually see that this "theory" was created by religious people trying to further their ridiculous agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       They believe that once you reach a certain height above earth and penetrate this "crystalline firmament" you reach heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really insane. They start using the bible Genisus as a source of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "theory" is easily discredited by mapping out particular one way flight paths that couldn't happen on a flat earth map.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disregard these people as lunatics. I shouldn't say lunatics, maybe undiagnosed schitzophrenia?

       If the earth was flat the sun would always be visible, and it's not.  When the sun sets, we see it sink below the horizon, not recede into the distance.  Flat earthers have no answer for this.

       Really, the sun could simply go around the (flat) Earth, making a turn over the other side and resurging the next day. Of course for this to work everyone must be living in the center.

       FE is an interesting mental exercise. I think there is good questions there, but it also falls flat on it's face. Personally, I think it's just people questioning the establishment and what we are "told" along with some gov counter psy-op. Hollow or concave Earth is far more legit and fascinating. Plus, did you know that all of the "founders" of science have roots in the occult, esoteric, and majick schools? Curious....

       I don't think it's garbage, completely. I learned quite a bit from entertaining the thought. Rabbit holes are deep, and also intricate. I'm one of the only persons on this board to actually acknowledge this. It's okay to entertain the thought, and see where it takes you. I have no regrets entertaining it, and came up having more questions and intrigue. I guess the problem may be if you get stuck. But the same can be said with any theory... I still shake my head at people who talk about lizard people and not know, it's just a metaphor and damn... That's a deep rabbit hole, in itself...

       I believe that it is essential to think for oneself- and to fully comprehend any subject of interest as much as possible.  So when presented with an idea (FE) that calls everything I 'know' into question.. I take that as an opportunity to rethink my world vision.  FE got me thinking all about geography and geometry that wouldn't have come up on my radar otherwise. I don't believe the earth is flat.. I would still love to take a space shuttle ride just to be sure.

       from ufos to lizard people passing by the century old jewish conspiracy, there's a shit ton of disinformation out there and the majority of us believe in some of it. believe it or not, it's not that hard to contain "conspiracy theorists", you simply have to promote the more idiotic ones.
