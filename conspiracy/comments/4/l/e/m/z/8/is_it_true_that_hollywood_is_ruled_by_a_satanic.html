    <div class="md"><p>Look I&#39;mma  tell you like I told everyone else. </p>

<p>Satan is portrayed as real, therefore, YHWY is real. </p>

<p>Jacob (Israel) had a brother Named Esau (Edom, Khazar) and that brother was destined to conquer the world by the sword until the Messiah came (So called Jesus) who was of the black race (Fine Brass). </p>

<p>Get you a KJV Bible</p>

<p>If you are white, you are a gentile (Christians)</p>

<p>If you are black, latino or native American you are a Hebrew</p>

<p>If you follow white supremacy then you are for Satan (Edomites)</p>

<p>Plain and simple. Yes, Zionist are the the synagogue of Satan spoken of in the Bible even white Jews protest this today. </p>

<p>Zionism is the root of all evil, and yes Satan is real, it&#39;s just the mentality of rebelling against YHWY. Nothing extra ordinary just mans own evilness but embodied in certain aspects of humanity. Meaning, it&#39;s the idea that man, not YHWY is the correct route to follow. </p>

<p>Satan is a man, just like the messiah is just a man but the difference is, the messiah has higher help (aliens, ufos) instead of just man made devices (nukes).</p>

<p>Basically, the real Jews (still lost) have a ultimate (think MOBA) compared to Satan who has all his power right here on earth.</p>

<p>Which is why 2008 was the year the &quot;change&quot; the final battle between Jacob and Esau began.</p>

<p>Which is why Jesus said, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 3:9King James Version (KJV)
9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So at the time of return everything will be corrected, conspiracy is just a precursor till that moment to get the world ready for UFO disclosure (YHWY&#39;s return) and to gather those who will be on the side of YHWY vs those who will be on the side of Satan.</p>

<p>WW3 will be the last world war for 1000 years and the NWO is really the presetting of the throne for the messiah. The antichrist will be defeated and life will go on after the countless of billions are killed. </p>

<p>I hope this helps you understand conspiracy a little better, if not, google what I&#39;ve said here and I&#39;m sure you will find the modern Jewry today is connected not to Jacob but to Esau. Thus spanning a war that has been long predicted throughout history. </p>

<p>Use google, don&#39;t be ashamed to search for anything on google, the government already knows who you are so fuck it, search until your hear it contempt.</p>

<p>Almost forgot, this comment will be downvoted but research it anyways, nothing can come from the harm of it.</p>

<p>All of that was just a precursor to what god said would happen. Nothing new, just old material. </p>

<p>We are in the final stages of the Bible I know that Obama will announce aliens. It is only right that it comes from his mouth, he has both Jacob and Esau&#39;s blood running within him. He is the perfect candidate to finish the story obviously completing the one (1) world narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why yes, science has concluded that Black was the original gene. I knew this while I was a open atheist, boy you couldn&#39;t tell me anything about YHWY before. I&#39;d laugh at people all the time about it.</p>

<p>Sumerian worked with the Hebrews in order to establish said religion. Very close relation between the two, same as the Dogon tribe and the Hopi and Mayan Indians. All of them claiming the same thing.</p>

<p>The problem is, people forgot. Through Edom becoming so powerful by the sword, the world was changed (reality) and we forgot what the old reality was. </p>

<p>Babylonian is the start of Edoms move from the Caucasus mountains. The black Muslims were conquered (ham, not shem) but both of the black gene. Whites are here today through albinism. </p>

<p>This is where you will see white history begin (Greeks, Alexander The Great) VS Persian Empire (think 300) Cyrus The Great (or Elder) &amp; Darius were Black African Muslims (hamites) that protected Black Hebrews. This is why God references Cyrus in the Bible. You will also find that <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization">Hellenization</a></strong> (white washing) began with Alexander, this is why so many statues of black rulers and black kingdoms have their noses and removed and why it seems that blacks have never accomplished anything. </p>

<p>Yes, blacks used to push the whites into the caves, this was part of the commandments to follow in Deuteronomy. They referred to them as lepers and strangers but that didn&#39;t stop whites from worshiping the black god, nope, they still loved him, this was the barbaric form of Christianity before Jesus touched down on the scene.</p>

<p>The Irish were really big with protecting the Black Hebrews, which is why after they took over Scotland, (King James, who was a black Israelite and white washed him) they went after the Irish next.</p>

<p>Finally they took over the west of Africa in which 400 years of slavery began on the real Hebrews. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them <strong>four hundred years</strong>;</p>

<p>Honestly it would be easier to just view the world as a simulation, at least that&#39;s what scientist believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I&#39;ve got all the answers because I speak Irish and read old books written in Irish. Branden the explorer made contact with Africa. We were friends with Africa and that&#39;s as far as the relation goes. When we first met black people we already had the term &quot;fear dubh&quot;. &quot;Fear&quot; means man and &quot;dubh&quot; means black but the full expression means the devil! Not wanting to insult black people by calling them the devil, we instead say &quot;fear gorm&quot; which actually means blue man but it is what we call blacks in our language. You greatly insult our heritage and clans by claiming we were ruled by Africans. You are another dumb American ignorant of world history. Read a book and get off YouTube for once in your life. </p>

<p>Why are you so obsessed with races having one point of origin? Don&#39;t you believe in God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir, because the Bible tells a story dealing in race. This is why it is important to recognize that. </p>

<p>When you see a white Jesus plasterd on a church wall, it is a lie. If race didn&#39;t matter why did they paint a pale man on the church and not a earth toned or <a href="https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/10060/48_13/very8/very_l.jpg">fine brass</a> Jesus? </p>

<p>If race is such a non adding factor in conspiracy, then why is one of the oldest conspiracy centered around a pale white Jesus. If you can&#39;t answer that on your own then you are doomed to question reality for eternity, unless you are a atheist in which case, you were doomed from the start.</p>

<p>Race does matter to YHWY contrary to belief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Romans 9:13King James Version (KJV)

<blockquote>
<p>LAMENTATIONS 4:8
&quot;Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.&quot;
The Bible says that the visage of the Jews is &quot;blacker than a coal&quot;.</p>

<p>Definition</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Tenth Edition:</p>

<p>visage - poetic/literary a person&#39;s face, with reference to the form of the features. a person&#39;s facial expression</p>

<p><strong>Example #2</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>JOB 30:30
&quot;My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example #3</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>SONG OF SOLOMON 1:5
&quot;I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.&quot;</p>

<p>Solomon, a Jew from the tribe of Judah, is describing himself as black! Furthermore, here is the verse in the original ancient Hebrew:</p>

<p>SHAYAR HASHAYARYAM 1:5</p>

<p>&quot;Sha-chaa-war-ha an-ya, wa-na-ah-wah, ban-wath Ya-raw-sha-lam, ka-ah-hal-ya Qa-dar, ka-ya-ra-ya-i-wath Sha-la-mah.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first part of this verse which reads &quot;Sha-chaa-war-ha an-ya&quot; literally translates to &quot;I am dark skinned&quot;!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s look up the meaning of the word for black, &quot;shachar&quot;, as used in this verse for proof:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From The New Strong&#39;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>shachar from 7835; prop. dusky, but also (absol.) jetty:--- black</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So the word &quot;shachar&quot; means &quot;dusky&quot;. Let&#39;s look that word up and see what it means:</p>

<p>The definition of the word dusky from The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Tenth Edition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dusky - adj. (-ier, -iest) darkish in colour. euphemistic, dated or poetic/literary (of a person) black; dark-skinned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example #4</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>ISAIAH 29:22
&quot;Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, <strong>neither shall his face now wax pale.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example #5</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>JEREMIAH 14:2
&quot;Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; <strong>they are black unto the ground</strong>; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example #6</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEUTERONOMY 28:68
&quot;And the Lord shall bring thee into <strong>Egypt again</strong> with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Egypt means bondage in Hebrew, this verse is literally speaking of The Transatlantic Slave Trade</p>

<p><strong>Example #7</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example #8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again referencing the Transatlantic Slave Trade which lasted 400 years, no other race on the planet has been through this.</p>

<p><strong>Example #9</strong> </p>

<p>From the Quran</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I saw Musa (Moses) and he was a black-skinned man.”
Musnad Imam Ahmed Hadith # 3365</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example #10</strong></p>

<p>From the Quran</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Umar said, “No! I swear by Allah that the prophet (pbuh) didn’t say that Jesus was light-skinned, but he said ‘While I was asleep, I was walking around the Kaaba when I saw a black-skinned man with straight hair between two men. I asked who the man was and I was told that he was Isa (Jesus) the son of Meryem.’…”
Bukhari (hadith number 3185)</p>

<p>Shall I go on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I&#39;ve got all the answers because I speak Irish and read old books written in Irish. Branden the explorer made contact with Africa. We were friends with Africa and that&#39;s as far as the relation goes. When we first met black people we already had the term &quot;fear dubh&quot;. &quot;Fear&quot; means man and &quot;dubh&quot; means black but the full expression means the devil! Not wanting to insult black people by calling them the devil, we instead say &quot;fear gorm&quot; which actually means blue man but it is what we call blacks in our language. You greatly insult our heritage and clans by claiming we were ruled by Africans. You are another dumb American ignorant of world history. Read a book and get off YouTube for once in your life. </p>
