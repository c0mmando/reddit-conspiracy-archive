       This is why I recommend 7 dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms alone in silent darkness to help clean up that third eye.

       The problem is that people don't realize that internet shilling is a proven fact. The best that you get on Reddit is lazy people mentioning the JIDF, typically without even sourcing their claim.

          The Israel Defence Forces have pioneered state military engagement with social media, with dedicated teams operating since Operation Cast Lead, its war in Gaza in 2008-9. The IDF is active on 30 platforms – including Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram – in six languages. “It enables us to engage with an audience we otherwise wouldn’t reach,” said an Israeli army spokesman.

       To expand on this, I know it's a bit controversial, but self hypnosis might help too. It takes time and it's the same as meditation but I've seen it work before.

       you are already transcended. the only steps you have to take are in becoming comfortable with yourself and who you are, understanding and accepting your own limitations (and those of others), meditating on dissolution of the self, and doing what makes you happy!
      </p>
      <p>
       making actions out of love for other people is great, too. it is basically a meditation on altruism if you do that, and helps open the third eye. : -)

       I can't take lsd because of my paranoia and schizophrenic effects. I really love shrooms tho. If u ever get ur hands on some start with a gram or so, wait an hour or two and see how you feel and then take more until you don't want any. I have gone up to 5gs like this and felt perfectly amazing. I try to do it 3 or 4 times a year to "defrag"

       I would first recommend a mindfulness practice to take control of Your mind/senses and get to where no thoughts are running/ruining Your consciousness.
Next step I would recommend transcendental meditation.  There are some that report DMT like experiences after a certain level of proficiency in TM.
      </p>
      <p>
       If You don't have time, You could try MDMA and psilocybin together.  MDMA will keep You feeling good while the psilocybin does the healing energy work.

       Let's clarify something. Psilocybin is a tool, much like a hammer, a screwdriver, or some nails. If you hold the hammer in your hand with a few nails in your pocket, and take no action, nothing will get built. You have to put in some work too. Eating drugs, or combinations thereof, WILL NOT cause spiritual awakening in and of themselves. The drugs are a conduit for self-driven experience.

       You're absolutely right.  It takes actual work to achieve the goal.
The work of reading, contemplating, meditating, living, experiencing, choosing, doing,  failing, suffering, understanding, adjusting, removing self-imposed limitations and learning to create and manifest desirable experiences for Self and Others.
There's a lot of work to be done, drugs are merely tools.

       I used Self and Other in reference to creating desirable experiences in our consensus "reality".  Believe me I understand about Oneness, I've been there with an overdose on LSA.  Knowing it doesn't make one a perfect saint automatically.  There are still groups of people I must allow myself to forgive who've caused me pain and suffering in life (freight brokers come to mind).
Karma, Causality (cause/effect) make sense when one has experienced the Oneness.  You're only ever hurting aspects of the Self when in ignorance, derived from the limitations of the human mind, we think we are separate and hurting others.
Of course negative actions come back, because You're hurting Your Self.  Nobody is outside the Oneness of all creation, both manifested and unmanifested.

       I took 750 seeds of LSA last December.  400 is considered a massively heavy dose.
I don't recommend that.  Depersonalization/Derealization is the worst thing that can happen to one following a gargantuan dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend going light. 
Especially with non-DMT based psychedelics such as LSD/LSA.
I prefer DMT based psilocin  (4-hydroxy-DMT) because DMT is already endogenous in our body. 
Mushrooms are the best in my experience.

       It was an extraction from untreated Heavenly Blue Morning Glory Seeds.
I can't comment on how similar LSA and LSD are since I have no experience with LSD.  It is the erowid.org description of LSA and people's trip reports that claims similarities between the two experiences.

       Well, I wish I knew that.  Because the only reason I tried LSA was reading erowid and thinking it was similar to LSD which has many glowing endorsements as a healing, transformative and transcendental experience. 
I won't be doing any psychedelics any time in the future.  DP/DR is like tripping without drugs coupled with horrible anxiety, panic attacks and existential terror.
I think it's just plain old blue pills for me like modafinil from now on.

       They're definitely related chemically but as I understand LSA is a heavier trip with less desirable side effects than LSD. I've no experience with LSA firsthand though, so take my words with that massive grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had friends that tripped on an LSA extraction though who had a bad time. LSD trips, however, seem enjoyed by more people.

       If only it was LSD I took.  I probably would have take a lower ug first because there is so much information about dosages online regarding LSD.
Some people might wonder wtf is wrong with me to take the extraction of 750 seeds.
I honestly didn't know about the dosages and since it was my first extraction with any substance I didn't even know/believe if it was going to work.  I followed the directions for extraction to the letter but just due to ignorance and inexperience with the substance I really went overboard and took way too much.

       Not really.  I was desperate. 
The 3 months before I took the LSA I was suffering from a physically painful depression that made me suicidal because I just wanted the pain to stop in my heart and brain.  I understood then why people commit suicide.  Most don't want to quit the world.  People want the unbearable pain to stop. 
It gave me an incredible understanding and compassion for people suffering this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       In those 3 months prior I tried to get mushrooms from people I met and knew and nobody came through for me.  If I had taken a psilocybin dose it would have cured my depression for the next 18 months as it has in the past. 
Instead I now have Depersonalization/Derealization disorder which I have to take modafinil and hemp oil for to keep my symptoms under control.
It's really sad that one of the best if not the best anti-depressant drug (psilocybin) is not available legally for people that are suffering.
I really hope Bernie gets into office as he has as vowed to end the war on drugs.

       Bernie or mushrooms won't save you. A healthy lifestyle and less self pity and self diagnosis will. You can't just wholly depend on consuming mushrooms to not get depressed. Sure they help but you can't depend on them for it. Go find a hobby and a physical activity and cut out the self pity bullshit.

       I don't pity myself.  I'm just describing the facts.
       <br/>
       It is easy to say go find a hobby and physical activities when my job during the time working 18 hour days as an over the road truck driver and staying on the road for 3 months at a time meanwhile only to return home and still be broke because the job doesn't pay enough.
       <br/>
       I've recently sold my truck and am now lookin for another job outside the deregulated trucking industry that has been going down hill since deregulation in the 80s. 
This trend of blaming people for suffering is not good.  Describing reality honestly is not self pity.  I'm sorry You feel that it is.  Many on this planet suffer far worse under this global corporate fascist police state.

       No one is blaming you for suffering. I'm just saying that the way you word things and blame external forces sounds like you refuse to take any personal responsibility. It's not healthy to have the mindset of "the only thing that can fix me is mushrooms because the world is unfair." self pitying and defeating behavior is temporarily gratifying but not a solution to a problem. I'm just saying, try to stay open minded rather than focusing in on one solution for your self pity party.

       Edit: also I worked as a freight broker so I can tell you that your sob story about an unregulated trucking industry is bullshit. Plenty of drivers make tons of money and certainly don't drive 18 hours a day which is illegal.

       Wow, a freight broker.  It makes sense now that You're a person with zero compassion for others.
Please don't drag me into a pointless exercise of will and facts which You would lose as I have unlimited time to eviscerate ignorance with knowledge and wisdom.
       <br/>
       Over my 12 year driving career I've talked to many "brokers" and they're professional liars by default.
I've pulled loads that the broker gets paid $12,000 for sitting on his ass answering phones and only pays the owner operator $2000 who has to drive a heavy load across mountains with snow and ice.  Meanwhile it is truckers who do %99 of the work and suffer a shortened life span (17 years) by virtue of just living this lifestyle (stress, shitty food, not enough time off etc.) let alone never have a real home life, family and friends.
18 hour days is normal if You want to turn miles.  Old School truck drivers do not run Regs because they can't afford to.
The only reason the DOT was created was to force the wholesale creation of massive monopolies.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Owner operators went from making doctor level income before deregulation to barely making ends meet and running 10 to 11 months out of the year.
When operating costs are over $1.00/mile yet brokers want to pay $1.3 to $1.5 per mile when company drivers make minimum $0.40/mile You come here claiming good money? You're delusional or a liar.
Minimum freight charge for dry van should be $2.50 and we still wouldn't be where it was in 1980 if adjusted to inflation which would be $3.60 today.
Brokers are the reason this industry sucks and truckers aren't making any money.  You've directly profited from the corporate fascist policies of deregulation and the suffering of others.  Trucking is the worst job in this country and the only industry i know of without a minimum wage.
Try going over the road for 11 months out of the year and come come broke and tell me this industry is awesome.  Please, this is just me venting a fraction of my capacity.

       Lol wow, way to label people based on a job, that really matches your open minded peace and love hippy narrative. First off, no one forced you to be a truck driver.  Either way, I know plenty of drivers that locked down dedicated routes, with my assistance and/or others, and made thousands a week working 3 to 4 days. The fact that you weren't motivated enough to build relationships and network in an industry completely built around such is your fault and your fault alone. Although with your shit attitude and victim complex it makes a lot of sense as to why you wouldn't be able to build a good relationship with a logistics coordinator, broker, or customer. The government doesn't owe you for your failures at your job. Routes are paid for based on supply and demand. Your numbers are complete and utter bullshit. During winter in Buffalo for example you can't pay anyone enough money to do certain routes.You exemplify everything that is wrong with sad unmotivated Sanders supporters that think he'll save them with free shit. Get a grip, homie.

      <p>
       Bernie Sanders' favorable rating in National polls was only 4% last year January and now is at 44% and the chart shows a gradual steady climb while Shillary's approval rating is dropping like the Panama Papers on billionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is despite the corporate infotainment propaganda networks consistent attacks and slander against Bernie Sanders over the past year.  He's still rising in National Polls.
I'm no stock trader but if I was, I know which trend I'd be betting on in this race.
Don't be so quick to pretend to know the future, because reality might come and kick You in the nuts (just ask Hitler).

       Do You understand the 30 years between 1950 and 1980 the tax for giant corporations was 91% and after deductions they paid around 50%.
       <br/>
       Ever since Reagan and deregulation aka the advent of corporate fascism  (minority rule) we have seen corporations pay less and less and now most pay nothing. 
Ever heard of
       <a href="/r/PanamaPapers">
        /r/PanamaPapers
       </a>
       ?
Not only does he know exactly what he's doing and we will actually get OUT OF DEBT when the corporate fascists start paying their taxes but we can even have enough left over to guarantee a universal basic income.

       Your logic is so flawed.  You don't think an old white jew can be elected in the United States.  Meanwhile in our current reality and past we have a black man as president and his name is Barack Hussein Obama.
If that is possible than anything is possible.
God Bless The Republic of the United States of America.
If You actually knew anything about "Citizens United" and how it enables the elites to buy elections legally and that Bernie Sanders will overturn this corporate fascist ruling, would You then realize that neither Shillary nor Drumpf will ever do so as they serve the corporate elite.
Go read some Panama Paper news man, You're speaking out of turn and in complete ignorance.

       Shillary is an establishment candidate to the core who will only perpetuate the status quo of the corporate fascist police state elite.
You're so delusional man.  It's clear You've never read a book in Your life on any of the issues and lack any historical context.
The Clinton's are one of the most corrupt shills of the New World Order ever.
       <br/>
       Clinton perpetuated reaganomics (NAFTA) during his term which has destroyed the working class, middle class and increased income inequality by benefiting the 0.1% and outsourcing jobs through globalization.
You think You're a patriot yet You support globalist NWO candidates that are destroying every last vestiges of the Republic (rule of law) and thereby the Constitution.
Just look at the treasonous "patriot act", the "NDAA", "citizens united".  Ahhhh who am I kidding, You don't do research, You don't think, You don't read.  Just keep on watch Faux News, CNN, MSNBC etc.

       Sure but psychedelics are not a magic pill towards ultimate Self realization and piece of mind.  They are great for people who need help now to heal from some form of physical or mental trauma, however they must be respected, understood and taken only with the proper intent set and setting. 
If one takes psychedelics and then does not endeavor to develop a daily spiritual practice of some sort then it's kind of a moot point. 
The goal ought to be greater wisdom, understanding and ultimately compassion which will bring Piece of Mind.

       I agree, but at the same time I find it comforting to allow yourself to see reality as inherently subjective, then you can let go of the resentment of how others perceive it.

       I hold no resentment.  If You read up on Depersonalization/Derealization which is what I have now after LSA, the suffering of existential terror gives one a first row seat into this "reality" and after produces an enormous amount of compassion.  As a matter of fact if I encounter someone who claims to suffer from DP/DR yet still carries and displays judgements and resentments towards "the other" chances are they are not experiencing DP/DR. 
DP/DR to me feels like all matter/energy is all one consciousness and Oneness that we are really only fragments of the same totality. 
The anxiety and fear comes from feeling like all of this consensus "reality" is one infinitely looping fractal pattern out of one's control and feeling disassociated from ones incarnation aka avatar (human existence) on earth and it not feeling real but a projection/thought.
Others also seem unreal as the physical mind falsely perceives the Oneness meaning my consciousness is the only authentic and co-creating one and everything else is "fake".
I wouldn't wish this existential terror on those we think are the worst of us on Earth. 
I do believe we are all One, but the human mind cannot integrate this in real time which causes this DP/DR.
I do think this is a possible reason we invented morality and religion.  To try to be more magnanimous to each other as an effort to live the Oneness in our daily lives.  Unfortunately, this original human effort (religion) has been corrupted and now resides solely with ego driven petty aspects of the Self.

       Whether or not you are a shill is not the issue. Assuming you are a regular dude who is not trying to hide information, you are doing the work of a shill for free, which is worse than actually shilling, imo. So, it doesn't even matter what your intentions are here; the effect is the same.

       This would be an example of "forum sliding." This is similar to manipulating search results.

Somebody REPLIED to me and asked a question.  I replied back.

       Get over it, dude.  You're being ridiculous, seriously.
Over a year on Reddit and I've not ever encountered this horseshit argument.

       I get that you derailed the conversation in a fair way. Someone asked you a question and you decided to respond with an enormous amount of replies. The issue is why would you
       <em>

       What is Your perception of this world and let alone reddit?
Mine is like this.  Biosphere earth has an incarnation vehicle called humans. 
Souls/consciousness incarnate in the talking monkey to experience material life.  Monkeys have ego and self determination and do whatever the fuck they want until killed by nature or another monkey displeased by their activities. 
Sorry about this wall of text.  This monkey enjoys communication over the Internet.  Feel free to kill monkey to end said communication.

       I'm not here to make enemies, but sometimes it is very frustrating to see people going right along with destroying the integrity of this website. Unwittingly, I'm sure. My apologies for the harsh words. Hopefully you realize how important it is to educate people about all of this hidden propaganda and advertising they are constantly subjected to. Vast amounts of people are totally vulnerable and even among those who know about this, few care at all.

       Ah, so since the site is only 10 percent of what it used to be, we might as well participate in the destruction of the vestiges of it. There is still plenty of room for information sharing, which is why I'm here. And that is also probably why you're here...unless....

       In fact, I once saw a shill whistleblower justify his efforts because the site had already gone downhill. "Who cares," he thought. He needed a paycheck and he also needed to justify his unethical behavior to himself so he could sleep at night.

       And no, I don't want to discuss my previous accounts and all of that, or have an argument about who has been here the longest. That would be a waste of time.

       Honestly man, I really don't give a shit what people believe since beliefs are for stupid people who do not think for themselves.
I'm not here to crusade for anyone, neither for nor against reddit.
       <br/>
       To me this site is a path towards connection with people.
I've lived long enough on the fringes of society the past 12 years as an over the road trucker that I have very few real world friends and even those are people that I either worked for or with at some point.
I joined a little over a year ago and the site was already fucked by then.  I had no say in it.   Now people throw around the word "shill" like it's no big deal.
I have no interest in proving or disproving anything.  I'm honestly expressing myself and what I see happening in reality from my perspective.  That's all one can expect of anyone.
Divide and conquer, problem-reaction-solution, shill this, shill that, it's all being used to control the narrative in every form of media including reddit.  One should expect this given the globalist predicament.

       Everything is heavily manipulated so long as financial tyranny exists, the people that are being squeezed by the 0.1% and barely have resources to survive will always be susceptible to being bought and corrupted. 
There are few people in this age that have unwavering principles and quality  character that refuse to compromise with those only serving themselves (evil).

       This is why I support a guy like Bernie Sanders who wants to increase the income of the working people in the country.
Only when people are comfortable enough and not constantly stressing over bills and how to feed themselves can they actually raise their heads above the gutter and focus on intellectual topics and not just survival.
This is all by design.  Keep the surfs barely surviving and busy working 2 or 3 jobs working over 60 hours a week so they never have time to figure out how they're getting fucked by the 0.1%.

       Yeah I'm 5 '11 1/2 240lbs. 
My wife is tiny and she took 7 grams too and after we got into the "inside out clarity" she wanted to go higher.
I was fine because I learned the lessons I came to learn and had the realizations that I needed ate the time.

       Here's my entire psychedelic history:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        one does of 3.5 dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms alone.
       </li>
       <li>
        roughly 2 years later, another psilocybin mushroom trip with 7 grams each with my wife.
       </li>
       <li>
        Dec/2015 approx. another 2 years later, the worst/best trip ever all in one.  extraction of 1500 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds total (took 750 each with my wife)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A fellow redditors comment about Salvia made me remember that I did in fact take that on two occasions and each was smoking a bowl of 80x extract.  I really don't consider it a "psychedelic" experience for me personally because each time I had no conscious recollection of what happened during the trip although I filmed myself and was apparently enjoying myself.  All I remember is the comedown which had unpleasant "return to body" effects that caused me anxiety for 3 hours after the trip.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So no DMT.  Not for a lack of trying, but as an over the road trucker between 12/2004 and 12/2015 I never had a real life and no real friends in Metro Detroit where I live.
I originally heard of DMT from Joe Rogan (of course I did).
Which led me to read (well actually listen on audible) Rick Strassman's book "DMT:  The Spirit Molecule" and other books like "Supernatural" by Graham Hancock and I watched the DMT documentary on Netflix.
I was fascinated with DMT for a long time but could never manifest it in my reality so to speak.  And I never wanted to risk ordering from the internet as I value my "freedom" in the open air consumer zoo versus prison.
I wish I did that instead of LSA, I'd probably be just fine now since DMT doesn't alter one's own sense of self from what I've read.
Do You mind sharing Your most profound insights into reality and the human condition from Your consciousness traveling using DMT?

       That's awesome that you read "Supernatural" by Hancock! It's one of the books I recommend most on this subject; I think he does a great job showing the likely reality of shamanism for an empirical perspective. The other really fantastic one is "The Cosmic Serpent" by Jeremy Narby.

       I'm actually currently in the early stages of working on a web site with another redditor about the DMT phenomenon! I have hundreds of trip stories collected and some stuff written. It's really difficult to reach a lot of people about it, as you can imagine, since people are very wedded to materialism, which they tend to view as the only alternative to organized religion, with total ignorance of shamanism. I'm happy to share the trip stories with anyone interested- PM me- but I don't want to clog up this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short version for me is that I've 100% encounter non-human, "alien" intelligence, sentient forces way too powerful to put into words. As far as a real breakthrough, the realism and power of it, whatever your expectations are, multiply them by about a thousand. I mean, it's absolutely unbelievable. Life matters, death isn't absolute, there's something else going on here. For me I've tried to take the ball and run with it, because the place DMT shows us is real, and I've been working for years on accessing it (at least somewhat) just through meditation, without DMT. And I can get in there, especially with a little weed. There's a separate universe tucked in our minds, perhaps embedded in our billions of miles of DNA in our bodies that scientists don't know the function of. There seems to be an interconnected web of intelligence that must exist at the atomic or sub-atomic level. If you look it's not hard to find it, but people are aught up in addictions to substances that tend to block these experiences, like alcohol, coffee and cigarettes. Put that stuff aside, though, and work with DMT in particular, and you find the most extraordinary worlds behind your closed eyelids, filled with intelligence and all sorts of beings or entities.

       I'll add You and PM You.  I'd really love to visit that website You're helping create.
As an observer with no actual experience of DMT, I can only go by what people report.  Based on people's reports, it seems to me that DMT allows the non-local "consciousness/soul" of the individual to untether from the limitations of the body and actually travel into space/time and other dimensions.
It seems like a vehicle for consciousness travel.  In Your experience, do You think this assessment is sound?  Are You able to direct the experience through concentrated focus of will or other methods like affirmations or chanting mantras?
The DMT phenomenon is the single most mysterious subject that I've ever encountered other than DP/DR which causes people to trip without drugs and perceive consensus reality as an artificial matrix and/or dream.

       I think Mckenna suggested 5 dried grams not 7. 7 would be way too gnarly.

       7 grams of mushrooms will turn you into a god damned medical experiment.

       You're getting shitty mushrooms if you need that much.

       omg you just made me remember that I did take Salvia, now I gotta go edit my previous post about psychedelic history lol.
I don't really consider it a traditional psychedelic because I filmed myself while I was on it and I can't consciously remember anything from the experience, only the horrible physical side effects during the comedown that takes over 3 hours.
I only tried Salvia twice and each time it was smoking a full bowl of 80x Salvia "extract" (i don't remember what it was called).

       You did too much man. There's like 6 stages to a salvia high. If you can't remember what happened, you hit stage 6 which is just too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       S - SUBTLE effects, Relaxation and increased sensual appreciation may be noted. This mild level is useful for meditation and may facilitate sexual pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       A - ALTERED perception, colors and textures are paid attention to. Thinking becomes less logical, and more playful.
      </p>
      <p>
       L - LIGHT visionary state. Closed eye visuals (clear imagery with eyes closed).
      </p>
      <p>
       V - VIVID visionary state. Complex three dimensional realistic appearing scenes occur. With eyes closed you experience fantasies. So long as your eyes are closed you may believe they are really occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       I - IMMATERIAL existence. Individuality may be lost; one experiences merging with the Divine.
      </p>
      <p>
       A - AMNESIC effects. Loss of consciousness. The individual may fall, or remain immobile or thrash around. Dangerous!
      </p>
      <p>
       Aim for stage V and I.

       Completely agree. I went to Canada recently and you know what shocked me the most? The lack of cops. I can't drive a mile in my city without seeing a cop, seriously. When I did see cops they seemed like uniformed citizens with a badge. I have hope for our future though. If the youth are voting for Bernie it won't be long till the revolution happens.

       I think it can easily say both things. Repubs wanted Bush because he would have given them all the corruption of Hillary without the vengefulness and spite. They misplayed their hand hard and now they're fucked unless they figure out how to sneak the establishment in through a brokered convention.

       In reality it is probably just a handful of people if they are getting paid, sitting in an office somewhere, going through twitter, Reddit, Facebook etc and posting as fast as they can for 8+hours a day.  Oddly though there are enough fanatical Hillary people out there that are bashing Bernie, but actually arguing with me about REFUSING to read the actual transcripts from Bernie speeches.  The WANT their confirmation bias, their sound bytes, and are actually opposed to the facts.  It was with the "hillary isn't qualified" speech, and the lady would not read the transcript.

       I caucused and there were 11. They fit the Washington State Hillary supporter demographic to a tee.  White, over 50, upper middle class to wealthy women, often professionals like lawyers, and their husbands.

       There are still many people out there who have no idea that shilling is openly admitted to, even on Reddit. If most people don't know that something is an advertisement or propaganda, their guard will be down. This is not like a commercial on television where you have a healthy skepticism of the claims made because you know the content is sponsored.

       And people really enjoy their confirmation bias. . . Cognitive dissonance is a hard wall to breech.  The young are more likely to research and choose based on facts, while the older many people get (excluding you LSD/mushroom people of course) stuck in their thinking and lose that freedom of choice.

       I had an interaction with a Hillary supporter who refused to read the transcript of Sanders speech where he listed reasons why HRC may not be qualified to lead.  She refused to READ.  If Bernie had not joined the Democratic primary I would have thrown a vote at Stein or Rand Paul or any other third party candidate, not because I would agree with all their policies, but because I do not agree with a two party system having so much power.  Perhaps the two party system is my confirmation bias, and maybe it is really good for oligarchs to own our government.. .and I just don't see it.

       Have experienced this as well. See it with both Clinton and Trump supporters. It's like they just want to belong and do not want to see. In a way, I can't really blame them, but fuck is it frustrating to have a political conversation with them.

       Well yeah must've been because they didn't want to pollute their mind with notions they don't agree with. That or they love oligarchs. Most of the time I assume that people who disagree with me or don't do what I want are just trolls, shills or really barely even human. I owe them no respect.

       I prefer Bernie, but I downvote the Hillary threads because the litany of how she's literally the World's Greatest Monster is fucking endless.  I see at least four or five threads every single day.  I'm sick of it.  In fact, I downvoted this, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's not paying me to downvote, I'm fueled by sheer irritation. I hope Bernie gets the nomination.  But if Hillary does instead, I'll happily vote for her, because the alternative of voting for Cruz or Trump is, to me, unthinkable.

       Yeah, my mom is a really passionate Hillary supporter.  She voted for Bill in the '90s, remembers that as a prosperous and fairly peaceful era, and wants Hillary because she thinks it brings two great minds (hers and Bill's) to the table.

       The problem is that when examining the facts, you realize that her entire history in politics seems to revolve around shady dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people should form their own opinions about things, but when the information they are basing that on is wrong or slanted, your opinions are being manipulated by those who hold power. That's not to say that Reddit/Bernie don't try to distort the truth for their own means, but the coverage from the MSM should tell you everything you need to know about who's really a threat to the status quo. Maybe you're the type of person who wants more of the same, but one would hope the recent revelations of the Panama Papers would make someone reconsider this notion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most powerful tool the media has is to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       talk about something- even bad press is still good press these days. I mean people can act like Trump/Hillary having all these negative stories about them almost every day pushes voters away, but in reality they're hearing their names, they're forming opinions about these people, whereas if you don't talk about someone, then they're not going to seek out to know more about them. More importantly they're distracting us from talking about the real issues. I mean seriously, abortion? Gay rights? Not to downplay their importance, but these are issues of the 90's that we are literally going back in time to talk about, and have no real bearing today on the direction our country is going. We have presidential candidates who believe climate change is a hoax, that is patently ridiculous.

       the thing that is most pressing to the realities of our situations. So while yes, I think people should form their own opinions about things, and yes Reddit can be an echo chamber for Bernie supporters- but when you see this history keep repeating yourself and finally hear someone who says "hey, no, this is bullshit" it's hard not to support them, even if you don't necessarily agree with all of their policies. A lot of what we saw with the Ron Paul campaign back in the day has been happening to Bernie; i.e., a lack of media coverage/bias of media against his campaign, strange circumstances that prevented him from sharing his message or measures in place to prevent potential voters of his from being properly represented..

       I didn't mean to go off on such a tangent, and I don't mean to make assumptions about you as a person, but I'm tired of people just accepting that choosing the President should be picking between 'the lesser of two shit-heads'

       If you had a basic understanding of market economics you would realize this isn't going to be a vote for the lesser of 2 shitheads it is already a vote for the lesser of 4 idiots.

      <p>
       Also, Bernie is getting at a minimum 20x the coverage Ron Paul ever had and clearly is getting enough coverage for people to vote for his giveaway packages in the primaries. Unlike Ron Paul who ran on principle, Bernie runs on a very simple platform "I will give you stuff and take the money to pay for it from the rich."

       Maybe if those businesses which are to be taxed more had been paying a livable wage to begin with, didn't take government subsidies, while getting tax breaks and stashing profits off-shore we wouldn't need to take the money from those who got their large sums of money through likely nefarious means. Whether you like it or not the government needs money to keep society running, and decimating the middle class while allowing the corporate plutocracy take over is

       I was the opposite. I supported Hillary until I learned more about Sanders, now I support him. I believe I can trust him to take care of the people of the United States and not just champion the agenda of one's donor's.

       Well, I guess he is kind of championing the agenda of his donor's since he is getting a lot more small individual donations. I feel good about that. He really gives me hope about the future of our country.

       I've stated this another way in a different thread but the crux remains- I see a half dozen Trump yard signs to four Cruz bumper stickers to three Bernie t-shirts to a single HRC anything.  But by God if you post anything negative about the Wicked witch from Arkansas the hounds are at the door. So who exactly is voting for her, and from whence is this fountain of online support flowing?

       I think this is a good sign, because Bernie is going to win the democratic ticket. He really does have a lot of momentum, and the biggest states left are huge pockets of progressives. I think the Hillary campaign is super desperate right now.

       I respect both Hillary and Bernie. But i cant stand how patronizing Hillary can be and I cant stand how aloof Bernie can be. I just hope they don't create a split in their base before the general.

       The base is split.  I am excited to live in a time where the 41% of Independent voters might actually get to break the Parties.  I abhor what Trump stands for, and Cruz is going to bring WWIII, but Hillary will solidify the oligarchy's rule.  So bern it up with Bernie Sanders or burn it down with Trump.

       The_Donald is more of an example of this to me, than Hillary's sub. When your subs stance is to immediately censor any dissenting opinion about Trump, and inundate
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       with shitposts, it drowns out the other opinions. A few months ago, viewing reddit by all by the hour was a good way to see which posts would hit the front page, but since The_Donald, the amount of upvotes you see on posts by the hour is substantially lower because of the amount of posts by this sub which drown out the rest of posts being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, if you were to go back a few months and compare the number of  comments on new posts from other more legitimate subs with the number that we're seeing today and I think you'll find that it's substantially lower. A lot of what's on the front page are posts that have been vote fudged by the admins to make it seem that Reddit isn't in a very strange place right now. What we're seeing is an infiltration by the corporate infrastructure with troll accounts that exist for the very purpose of distracting and dividing Reddit's collective userbase.

       Bernie is pretty irrational I'm not saying that to troll he does not have the bullet proof plans his supporters think he does. I don't know how Bernie supporters think everyone is going to agree with them on a bad version of socialism being the best way forward for america.

       That's what gets to me. Everyone has  had a political opinion and a favorite candidate, but there's always a realization that others have a different opinion. Sometimes this leads to arguments and anger between both sides, but I've never seen something quite like the Bernie supporters on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, I'm a republican supporter in most cases, and I realize that for the past 8 years, I was in the minority and America decided we should have a Dem in office. Great, I'm not happy about it, but I accept defeat and continue on. With Bernie supporters, it's like they fail to realize they are stating an opinion and not everyone agrees with them. Everything they say is a fact, and the only reason he's unable to get votes from his own party is a conspiracy. Not because there's true Hilary supporters out there, not because everyone doesn't agree that his policies are a good idea. Every time they see a Hillary supporter, it's a $hill. Every time he loses a state, it's because there's a conspiracy to hide his message and turn away his voters. Like, seriously, just chill out and accept the fact that not everyone agrees with you.

       Shills exist. We should be allowed to discuss the topic. I would imagine that most people who accept the reality of internet shilling do not honestly think that every single person who disagrees is a shill. Your comment is a strawman.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, shills are losing their jobs to bots like everyone else. It could very well be that in certain situations, nearly everyone who disagrees is a shill bot. Let's hope people educate themselves first on whether or not shilling occurs before this practice is completely automated and drowns out people like me.

       <a href="/r/shills">

       Now you must ask yourself why people would pay so much money to "win dumb arguments online" by hiring shills. Maybe it actually works quite a bit better than paying for commercials on television?

       Hey man. I know it! Obviously everyone who supports the candidate I don't like is a paid $hill. I'm just pointing out the obvious (and I even used the $ sign in the name to drive the point home - it's about money!). I hate doing it because I would rather have an objective argument about things but it's just so obvious to me that every single person who endorses a candidate I don't like is doing so in bad faith! Because they are being paid! With money!

       You are using exaggeration and a poor attempt at comedy to block the acceptance of obvious facts. Are you scared to admit to being wrong, or scared to accept that you have been fooled? I bet you didn't even look at the information I have given you.

       Sure. We've absolutely got to set the fact straight. Shills exist. There is even a sub reddit! Therefore anytime someone switches to support a candidate I don't like or disagrees with me, it's cause they were paid! Or maybe they're part of a secret globalist cabal! Or lizard people!

       I would normally give the same advice out to other people, but I'm a fast writer. I figured it was worth the effort. A few people may have been confused by the troll's efforts, and this topic is one of those where educating people trumps everything else. If even 1 person was dissuaded from clicking
       <a href="/r/shills">
        /r/shills
       </a>
       because of the troll, I would consider that a major loss.

       You are right about the reporting though. It would be best to erase this mess they created so nobody else has to wade through it.

       We weren't even discussing HRC. We were discussing the existence of shills which you vehemently avoid for a very peculiar reason.

       For example theDonald is a Trump  sub, but they are real people. However the shills at political discussion are paid by George Soros.

       This whole post is how OP thinks any person in a political discussion on reddit who supports HRC is a shill. Go ahead and scroll to the top and read it. My point is that not everyone who disagree with you is a "Soros paid shill" and it's ridiculous to believe so. And it does you no favors. And doesn't particularly speak well to your credulity but this is the sub with the "truthers", isn't it?

       Bernie has spent his entire career speaking out against the very people this sub decries on a daily basis.  Socialism is just another means to an end.  When wielded by the wrong people it can become a tool of control, exactly the same way that Capitalism can be.

       Spending it on what? Oh that's right, the brands that are owned by the multinational corporations.

       If you give tax breaks to the wealthy and you create a good atmosphere for business investment they will invest in new business and innovation.   Which creates more jobs which increases the standard of living for more people etc

       FYI, you aren't taxed at the higher rates on all of your income that is below the threshold. For instance, Joe Schmoe makes 70,001 dollars per year. A theoretical percentage increase in taxation over 70,000 dollars would only apply to that extra dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are crazy people out there who believe that if you make that extra dollar, you actually lose a bunch of money.

       If you do a quick study of how supply and demand works, you will notice that the whole econonomic system works only by assuming infinite resources to supply our current demand, which we obviously don't have. Anyone not advocating for dramatic change of our economic theory at this point in history is simply not seeing the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly there will be even better ideas coming from necessity in the next couple of decades, going beyond minimum wage and a carbon tax, etc. Basic Income for example or eventually a wholly resource based economy, but for now, Sanders offers the best solutions for problems many people in power are not even acknowledging yet.

       A healthy dose of both. Right now we have no capitalism!
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to dial it back because our capitalism is now an oligarchy. That's not healthy. No competition in an oligarchy. No free markets in an oligarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great irony is we need this D socialist to increase capitalism.

      <p>
       When resources are in hands of the people, there is competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a few have all the resources there is no competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Competition is the hallmark of capitalism.

       Great irony in your comment is this quote from Sanders:

       “You don’t necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country,”

       All of these candidates and all presidents have supported and enacted socialist programs. Therefore they're socialist right?

       You know there are arguments that FDR made the depression worse for poor people with the New Deal, right? And that WWII led to richest, most badass country, right?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yet after all this, the grand promise of an end to the suffering was never fulfilled. As the state sector drained the private sector, controlling it in alarming detail, the economy continued to wallow in depression. The combined impact of Herbert Hoover's and Roosevelt's interventions meant that the market was never allowed to correct itself. Far from having gotten us out of the Depression, FDR prolonged and deepened it, and brought unnecessary suffering to millions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even more tragic is the lasting legacy of Roosevelt. The commitment of both masses and elites to individualism, free markets, and limited government suffered a blow in the 1930s from which it has yet to recover fully. The theory of the mixed economy is still the dominant ideology backing government policy. In place of old beliefs about liberty, we have greater toleration of, and even positive demand for, collectivist schemes that promise social security, protection from the rigors of market competition, and something for nothing.

       Government intervention into markets isn't needed. That's all Bernie talks about doing. He's not talking about expanding the firefighting powers of the Chicago FD, he's talking about breaking up banks and expanding the powers of the federal government.

       That's awesome that you read "Supernatural" by Hancock! It's one of the books I recommend most on this subject; I think he does a great job showing the likely reality of shamanism for an empirical perspective. The other really fantastic one is "The Cosmic Serpent" by Jeremy Narby.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone not familiar with this subject, here's the documentary he referred to, "DMT: The Spirit Molecule"
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually currently in the early stages of working on a web site with another redditor about the DMT phenomenon! I have hundreds of trip stories collected and some stuff written. It's really difficult to reach a lot of people about it, as you can imagine, since people are very wedded to materialism, which they tend to view as the only alternative to organized religion, with total ignorance of shamanism. I'm happy to share the trip stories with anyone interested- PM me- but I don't want to clog up this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short version for me is that I've 100% encounter non-human, "alien" intelligence, sentient forces way too powerful to put into words. As far as a real breakthrough, the realism and power of it, whatever your expectations are, multiply them by about a thousand. I mean, it's absolutely unbelievable. Life matters, death isn't absolute, there's something else going on here. For me I've tried to take the ball and run with it, because the place DMT shows us is real, and I've been working for years on accessing it (at least somewhat) just through meditation, without DMT. And I can get in there, especially with a little weed. There's a separate universe tucked in our minds, perhaps embedded in our billions of miles of DNA in our bodies that scientists don't know the function of. There seems to be an interconnected web of intelligence that must exist at the atomic or sub-atomic level. If you look it's not hard to find it, but people are aught up in addictions to substances that tend to block these experiences, like alcohol, coffee and cigarettes. Put that stuff aside, though, and work with DMT in particular, and you find the most extraordinary worlds behind your closed eyelids, filled with intelligence and all sorts of beings or entities.

       Let's clarify something. Psilocybin is a tool, much like a hammer, a screwdriver, or some nails. If you hold the hammer in your hand with a few nails in your pocket, and take no action, nothing will get built. You have to put in some work too. Eating drugs, or combinations thereof, WILL NOT cause spiritual awakening in and of themselves. The drugs are a conduit for self-driven experience.

       You're absolutely right.  It takes actual work to achieve the goal.
The work of reading, contemplating, meditating, living, experiencing, choosing, doing,  failing, suffering, understanding, adjusting, removing self-imposed limitations and learning to create and manifest desirable experiences for Self and Others.
There's a lot of work to be done, drugs are merely tools.

       Wow, a freight broker.  It makes sense now that You're a person with zero compassion for others.
Please don't drag me into a pointless exercise of will and facts which You would lose as I have unlimited time to eviscerate ignorance with knowledge and wisdom.
       <br/>
       Over my 12 year driving career I've talked to many "brokers" and they're professional liars by default.
I've pulled loads that the broker gets paid $12,000 for sitting on his ass answering phones and only pays the owner operator $2000 who has to drive a heavy load across mountains with snow and ice.  Meanwhile it is truckers who do %99 of the work and suffer a shortened life span (17 years) by virtue of just living this lifestyle (stress, shitty food, not enough time off etc.) let alone never have a real home life, family and friends.
18 hour days is normal if You want to turn miles.  Old School truck drivers do not run Regs because they can't afford to.
The only reason the DOT was created was to force the wholesale creation of massive monopolies.

       Owner operators went from making doctor level income before deregulation to barely making ends meet and running 10 to 11 months out of the year.
When operating costs are over $1.00/mile yet brokers want to pay $1.3 to $1.5 per mile when company drivers make minimum $0.40/mile You come here claiming good money? You're delusional or a liar.
Minimum freight charge for dry van should be $2.50 and we still wouldn't be where it was in 1980 if adjusted to inflation which would be $3.60 today.
Brokers are the reason this industry sucks and truckers aren't making any money.  You've directly profited from the corporate fascist policies of deregulation and the suffering of others.  Trucking is the worst job in this country and the only industry i know of without a minimum wage.
Try going over the road for 11 months out of the year and come come broke and tell me this industry is awesome.  Please, this is just me venting a fraction of my capacity.

       Spending it on what? Oh that's right, the brands that are owned by the multinational corporations.

       If you give tax breaks to the wealthy and you create a good atmosphere for business investment they will invest in new business and innovation.   Which creates more jobs which increases the standard of living for more people etc
