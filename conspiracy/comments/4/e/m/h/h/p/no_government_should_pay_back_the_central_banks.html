       The US government borrows money from the Federal Reserve Bank, which is privately owned, which is 100% against the Constitution which says that Congress MUST print/create the money NOT a private bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all the central banks world wide are owned by the exact same people, who are Jews loyal to Israel. But is is not who owns these banks, it is that government are borrowing from them when they should be printing/creating the money themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The International Oligarchs who own the Federal Reserve Bank, are just printing money for themselves because it all gets paid back to them with interest, and are using it to buy everything of wealth so they own everything and leave the people owning nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Constitution, Congress is to print the money, lend it out, and use the interest to build roads, bridges, and retirement funds, this would be debt free.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government were following the Constitution, the US would not be in debt at all right now, therefore, all debt to the Federal Reserve Bank is actually null and void due to unconstitutionality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you hear the International Oligarchs saying “You have to have growth to pay us back” is they are sucking compound interest which requires more and more and more “growth” to even pay back, this all the while the are intentionally using vaccines to lower fertility rates below replacement rate, which make growth impossible, then the country has to start gutting itself and selling off its own land and resources to the International Oligarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, no money should be paid back to the Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank.

       You're right, but if we had a 'public sector' bank rather than a private sector one, the inflation would be so god-awful that our money would be practically useless. Unless we went back to the Gold Standard, which is a great idea but at this point will never be done.

       I agree with this.  I would just point out that having a constant amount of money in total circulation with no moneys added or removed, resulting in zero inflation year after year, decade after decade is the more important goal. Granted gov't taking back the power of printing money from the Fed would be necessary most likely to achieve this but not in itself the real goal

      <p>
       The constitution does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       grant congress the power to allow a private bank to print money or regulate its value. But, considering the power that the banksters have over all branches of government (specifically including the judicial branch), it's done anyway. It doesn't really matter what the constitution actually says, the only thing that matters is what the judges say.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress">
        Section 8: To borrow Money on the credit of the United States

       - Which links directly to:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States">

       So it looks like that article and section enables congress to borrow from these various banks.
