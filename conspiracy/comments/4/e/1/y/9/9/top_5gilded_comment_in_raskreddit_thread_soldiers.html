      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's a place where you don't have to worry about your bills, mortgage, family, in-laws, homework, or neighbors. You can't get busted by the cops or shut down for having too good of a time. You're with your best friends in a valley for months and you get to fly in helicopters a couple times a week. You get to go camping all the time, and you'll be in the best shape of your life. You'll get paid more than you've ever been paid in your life. Seriously. It's tax-free. You get girl scout cookies at a certain point, and then it seems like every officer (and some of the medics) somehow never runs out. You don't have to do or fold your laundry, and you don't even have to get out of bed to pee. You shoot the biggest and coolest guns you've ever seen or heard of - and, goddamn, you shoot them a lot.
       </p>
       <p>
        And then you get back and you're 21 and drinking a bottle of liquor every night with your best friends, because you can afford it and it's a damn good time. Everyone at work thinks you're a hero and listens to what you have to say. What you say, goes. You are the expert in your field because you've earned the right through the blood, sweat, and tears you poured into something you didn't even really think about over the past year or so. It's just part of the job - deal with it, guys. The Army pats you on the butt on the way out and the Department of Labor says you'll do well getting a job going out - thanks for training the medics to replace you!
       </p>
       <p>
        You get home and it feels like leave. You think "now it's real". College classes are easy and part-time work is a joke. The VA is the hardest thing, because they ask you to describe in detail every ache and pain and irregularity you suffer - multiple times, to multiple people, and why. Each time you remember, you remember a little more, but it never feels like you had an incomplete picture to begin with.
       </p>
       <p>
        You remember the explosion, and you remember running your lieutenant to the bunker. It's your fourth or fifth firefight, and it's only his first one. He's cowering and trying to get his armor back on because he was giving a radio class to Afghans, but with the sound of incoming and outgoing gunfire praying to find each other, he can barely move.
       </p>
       <p>
        You laugh, and look to see if the story makes anyone else laugh. Instead, there are three horrified teenagers form your group project staring back at you.
       </p>
       <p>
        You miss that place. You miss it, and you got shot at every day, and you can't explain to anyone why.
       </p>

       As someone who was took part in OIF, I could easily write the exact same thing as that guy. Easily both the best and worst times of your life, and truly something that can't be described to anyone who hasn't had the same experiences.

       He makes signing away your life to the bankers in a war of aggression so you can go to a foreign country and kill the natives so the tyrants can install a central bank sound like a all-expenses paid year at summer camp!

       The feelings behind it ring true to me, though, except for the "got shot at every day" part. It doesn't feel positive or Disney Worldish, it's sharing a phenomenon and feeling many vets I've known have described when they get back to the States.

        Thanks. I turned 24 last month and it's just now that I can see a future where who I was, who I am, and who I want to be line up. There are thousands of people who say it better than me, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

        This reminded me of my experience. You go from having a huge support group of people that did the same stuff as you did, to being on your own. It was scary at first but you get used to it. The thing that sucks the most is that you can't just talk to anyone about it. Most people will never experience it. it's hard to talk about the experiences without feeling like an asshole so you don't say shit. You're right though, it was fun. I'll probably never experience anything like it again and it makes me a little sad.

        What I miss is that everything you do matters. You trust your gut. You trust your buddies. You hold the power of life and death in your hands. When you come back to the real world, you're a twenty something who talks too loud, drinks too much, and laughs at inappropriate things. And nothing you do matters. THAT is what PTSD is for most veterans. The realization, that like it or not, you got really good at this ONE thing with some guys you think of as your brothers, and now you can't do that one thing you're really good at, and you don't see your brothers anymore. And nothing matters.

       His post transitions from a bright and cheerful outlook to rather grim towards the end. So if you only read the first paragraph you might think it's just pro-war.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 2nd paragraph he mentions alcoholism (Drinking a bottle a night is symptomatic of deep problem) and unearned heroism (It's just part of the job - deal with it, guys.)
      </p>
      <p>
       3rd paragraph talks about VA and post-war injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       4th paragraph talks about his lieutenant being too stressed to even move.
      </p>
      <p>
       5th paragraph really nails it home that the things he describes to people is horrifying and that he can't relate to other people.

       Dude that's a pretty fucking pro-war post. Sure he mentions bad things, but the emotion behind the post is about how he longs for it because of the the freedom he felt, the fun he had, and the fact that he was a mercenary for the bankers (though he didn't quite say it like that). I don't know what posts you're reading, but the 20 suicides a day of American veterans tells a slightly different tale than his post does.

       It didn't seem pro-war to me - he/she's basically saying they were totally dysfunctional in real life and craved going back to where they had no agency or free will because they couldn't handle day-to-day living in the States anymore. Basically, the author is broken now. Seems very anti-war to me.

       Maybe I'm looking through the lens of this post too much, I can't tell, but you have to understand and I'm sure you do just how much military propaganda is really on Reddit, so I always will remain skeptical. The most popular Reddit location was Eglin Air Force Base on some Reddit Blog post IIRC and that helped me understand just how heavy military presence, and therefore military ideology permeates throughout Reddit.

       Oh, absolutely. But I just don't think that post was glorifying it (although some of the follow-on comments absolutely did), to me, all I saw was how fucked up it made this guy (for the record, I do think the commenter might've been full of shit, though, the whole 'shot at every day' is hyperbolic). And I think vets (of which I am not one) would understand it, because those I've talked to have sadly shared the same perspective. That they found it hard to re-assimilate. Same thing in all wars, read some WWI and WWII literature (Vietnam, too, although I'm less familiar with it), and you'll see the same phenomenon. It's not a positive.

       On the Eglin thing - I guarantee you the real manipulators (of which there are many from many competing interests, we see them here on a daily) aren't coming from the same IP and are using Tor or something else.
