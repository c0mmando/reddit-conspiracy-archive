<p>Such as the fact that there was no genocide? I’m not ignoring that.</p>

<p>Either post proof or continue being laughed at. There was no Indio genocide. Speaking to northern North America specifically, more action were taken there to prevent genocide than anywhere else. Oops!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  Again, I wholeheartedly agree.</p>

<p>But wait a minute then...A condemnation of <em>all</em> liars is okay...but a condemnation of <em>one</em> liar might be ban worthy?  If he&#39;s <em>not</em> a liar, then I can understand that...but if the person in question seems to demonstrably show himself to be such (as the individual in question seems to), then it would seem calling him a liar/troll/shill might actually not be entirely inappropriate, no?</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is besides the point of this OP though, so we totally don&#39;t have to get into it.  All good.  As I said initially in this response, I understand what you&#39;re saying and it certainly seems fair.</p>

<p>Yep. Rules are rules. I didn&#39;t write them, but I am tasked with upholding them and I support them in principle. It&#39;s semantics. <em>Without hard proof/gnosis</em>, negative accusations about an individual here is not allowed (because it is a popular form of propaganda, see my recent comment history for an example of someone doing just that against me). Concern trolling 101. </p>

<p>Condemnation of bad behavior in general is of course the entire point of this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I rather think OP has to support his, since <em>he</em> made the claim. Anyway, here’s a testimony I received once.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a Native American. Our culture died because we allowed it to die. Culture can only survive if someone is willing to fight for it. If no one is willing to, it will die. You’re seeing it happen now in Europe, as well as in America, Canada, and Australia. It was never about the land. It was about the hearts of the people. The clay was secondary at best–irrelevant. You don’t need land to preserve the identity of a people. It does help, but it isn’t necessary.</p>

<p>The majority of our people, if one could even use the term to describe the numerous disparate and warring tribes, were not interested in preserving their ways. Or, at least, not interested enough to make significant efforts to do so. Our ancestors could have used the knowledge of the Europeans to build towns and cities, chapels and schools. We could have sent children to study medicine and engineering, built our own printing presses and firearms, and raised our own libraries filled with books penned by our own hands.</p>

<p>They chose not to. What happened to us is terrible, regrettable, and tragic. But do not pretend we do not share at least equal portion of the blame. We did not march ourselves down this path, no, but we did not strive to survive it, either. We were given land. Was it enough, No, not even remotely. But we were given it, nonetheless. It was ours, to do with as we pleased. What did we do with it, in all the intervening centuries? Nothing. We have built trailer parks and casinos. Are we blame the white man for that, as well? How far down the rabbit hole will you reach, looking for excuses? To what lengths will you go to avoid accepting responsibility for your own choices and actions, including your lack thereof?</p>

<p>It is easy to pass the blame to others. Feel free to cite me what that has ever accomplished for anyone, ever, in the history of the world. Will you blame the long dead for your circumstances today, forever? Is that your goal?</p>

<p>The dead are dead. They mean nothing. Stalin is dead. The Nazis are dead. The people who fought Nazis are dead. The American pioneers are dead. Joan of Arc is dead. Bismarck is dead. Winston Churchill is dead. Sitting Bull is dead. The men who founded the United Nations are dead. The soldiers who fought in World War I are dead. Our ancestors are dead. And so are all of the people who tormented them.</p>

<p>They are all gone. They have power only as memories and ideals. And while an idea is not to be underestimated, that does not change that they are all gone. What is real is what is here right now. You. Me. Everyone around you. That’s real.</p>

<p>The world is made up entirely of those who were born into it with the inherited lots that were cast to them. Whether that lot is a weapon and a blessing, or a curse and a burden, is entirely up to you and what you choose to make of it. We can make of this world and our inheritance a palace or a prison, at our discretion.</p>

<p>You can accept responsibility for that, accept the burden falls squarely on you to change your lot in life if you are dissatisfied, or you can cry as the walls come tumbling down. It is your choice. And the consequences of what you choose are yours, as well.</p>

<p>Yes, because no genocide occurred.</p>

<p>You have to have an argument for your statement to make any sense. <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_blankets_hoax">There was no genocide planned or carried out.</a> Not in North America, at least. Latin America is quite probably the largest silent genocide in world history. Never mind that the vast majority of Indios died <strong>before European contact</strong>. Animals carried diseases to the Americas. Not us. How else could they have survived contact with us when they came across Beringa and found Europeans there first? Why would they have been immune then but not later?</p>

<p>You keep saying this, and yet the population has objectively been subjected to genocide. You need to support your assertions somehow. Your argument seems to hinge on whether or not the genocide was popularly intentional or not, which is beside the point that the genocide occurred regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You keep saying this, and yet there’s no demonstrable evidence for it. They died off en masse because of diseases brought over by animals, not Europeans. Let’s run through “genocide”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>

<p>(a) Killing members of the group;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But any war is like this, and they certainly killed Europeans, so let’s ignore that for now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same as A.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Losing a war means damages/reparations. In the case of Indios, it was land concessions. Never mind that peaceful accession of land nearly always preceded such action and were broken by both sides.</p>

<p>Again, the reservations were made to <em>keep them alive</em>, not to kill them. If overt genocide was a desire, it could have been done at any time from 1820 on, and covert genocide would have been possible until the late 1800s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn’t happen in the north.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not too sure about this, but tie it in with D and you have the horrors of Latin America. <em>There</em> a genocide is still ongoing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>whether or not the genocide was popularly intentional</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because that’s the <em>definition</em> of genocide. Genocide implies intent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is beside the point that the genocide occurred regardless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it’s not genocide if it’s not on purpose. If it happens, it happens. If it was caused to happen, it’s genocide.</p>
