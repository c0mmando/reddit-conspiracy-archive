    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. I needed a second opinion to help me calm down. Here&#39;s a story:</p>

<p>Earlier today, feeling defeat, I got really angry and started throwing stuff around in my house. I was so worked up. I decided to take a breath and lie down on my lawn. It felt good just feeling the grass in my hands and looking up into the sky. A plane flew by, spewing aerosol, I closed my eyes. I realized that I can&#39;t just reach my hand in the sky to stop it. Since then I started to do some deep thinking and realized that the nature connection, the good feeling, can&#39;t be taken away no matter what they do. </p>

Personally, I wish more real historians would pipe up.  Any history teachers out there?  History is the only framework we have to really see what is going on.</p>

<p>edit: not to be an alarmist, but I&#39;ve always felt the human race is more like lemmings than we would care to admit.  We have a collective choice, right now, to either go on to our destruction, or to turn it around.  I&#39;m not seeing the latter...</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>Newsflash</em></strong></p>

<p>In case you missed it, I will spell it out loud and clear, please pay attention! This will not sit well with the administrators or moderators!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> r/Conspiracy has methodically been introduced to C3ns0rsh!p policies under the guise of p0lit!cal c0rrectne55, thereby slowly cooking the proverbial frog. Since Reddit was bought by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a> it has moved towards a more mainstream corporate mass media style of c3ns0rsh!p, information control and p|20paganda. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> All of Reddit, including  r/Conspiracy, now has a fully automatized algorithm system in place to detect and c3ns0r any negative/revealing/damaging information about the US !ntelligence C0mmun!ty, US government, corporations, financial industry and key political figures. The algorithms scan for specific words, wordings and flagged links to alternative media outlets. If an undesirable element is detected, the system will automatically remove or discretely r!g the vot!ng pr0cess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> As many of us has already notices, if you post something <del>controversial</del> truthful about the 9-11 attacks, illegal NSA surveillance, crimes committed by the CIA/FBI/Law enforcement agencies, financial crimes, economical inequality or US war crimes and genocides it will properly not end up the front page. And let us not forget the legions 5h!lls and 9und!ts. Reddit  controls the process minute by minute, the slip ups are getting fewer and far between, and they refine their already sophisticated methods for every day that passes by. The days when you could easily detect hamfisted blatant c3nsorsh!p attempts are over. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> First <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">Advanced Publications</a> introduced a new and marvelous CE0, then they proceeded to removed all the troublesome administrators, after which they continued the process and removed all the undesirable moderators. And there was much drama! </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>5)</em></strong> Then the ban-wagon finally hit the r/conspiracy forum, deliberately purging the intelligentsia, people who tended to post quality posts with lots of data and statistics, during and shortly after the height of the Mr. 5n0wd3n scandal, thus turning the forum into an echo camper for fools and idiots.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>6)</em></strong> Since the &quot;great purges&quot; the r/conspiracy forum has been absolutely spammed with racist anti-Israel posts, often making up 20% of the volume on the front page, and the moderators are doing absolute nothing about it. Users like Indra-Varuna, User_Name13, TouchMeHerePls, Tito333, AntiHasbaraUnit, dillonban, high-priest-of-slack and flyyyyyyyy has been allowed to spam the forum with racist and blatantly none-conspiracy post for months (Just to mention a few).

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Newsflash
In case you missed it, I will spell it out loud and clear, please pay attention! This will not sit well with the administrators or moderators!</p>

<p>1) r/Conspiracy has methodically been introduced to censorship policies under the guise of political correctness, thereby slowly cooking the proverbial frog. Since Reddit was bought by Advanced Publications it has moved towards a more mainstream corporate mass media style of censorship, information control and propaganda.</p>

<p>2) All of Reddit, including r/Conspiracy, now has a fully automatized algorithm system in place to detect and censor any negative/revealing/damaging information about the US intelligence Community, US government, corporations, financial industry and key political figures. The algorithms scan for specific words, wordings and flagged links to alternative media outlets. If an undesirable element is detected, the system will automatically remove or discretely rig the voting process.</p>

<p>3) As many of us has already notices, if you post something controversial truthful about the 9-11 attacks, illegal NSA surveillance, crimes committed by the CIA/FBI/Law enforcement agencies, financial crimes, economical inequality or US war crimes and genocides it will properly not end up the front page. And let us not forget the legions shills and pundits. Reddit controls the process minute by minute, the slip ups are getting fewer and far between, and they refine their already sophisticated methods for every day that passes by. The days when you could easily detect hamfisted blatant censorship attempts are over.</p>

<p>4) First Advanced Publications introduced a new and marvelous CEO, then they proceeded to removed all the troublesome administrators, after which they continued the process and removed all the undesirable moderators. And there was much drama!</p>

<p>5) Then the ban-wagon finally hit the r/conspiracy forum, deliberately purging the intelligentsia, people who tended to post quality posts with lots of data and statistics, during and shortly after the height of the Mr. Snowden scandal, thus turning the forum into an echo camper for fools and idiots.</p>

<p>6) Since the &quot;great purges&quot; the r/conspiracy forum has been absolutely spammed with racist anti-Israel posts, often making up 20% of the volume on the front page, and the moderators are doing absolute nothing about it. Users like Indra-Varuna, User_Name13, TouchMeHerePls, Tito333, AntiHasbaraUnit, dillonban, high-priest-of-slack and flyyyyyyyy has been allowed to spam the forum with racist and blatantly none-conspiracy post for months (Just to mention a few). On top of that legions of Pundits and shills has been allowed to down vote and spam any undesirable posts.
And this, my friends, is how the oligarchs control r/conspiracy forum. This is how the oligarchs has taken control of all the corporate owned mass media. The pundits and shills is just the last nail in the coffin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not look for people to trust, that is a trap.  There is a frequently used technique where a leader will attempt to capture a specific, profiled demographic by taking a number of positions that they know the targeted group will agree with.  Once trust has been gained, manipulation can begin.</p>

<p>Instead look at ideas.  Work on your own processes of evaluating ideas and arguments.  Refine your understanding of the techniques of disinformation.</p>

<p>I like this quote from Bill Cooper: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen to everyone, read everything, believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this does not imply that I trust Bill Cooper, but I think this idea is useful.  This approach is vulnerable to being drowned in a mass of garbage information, so I think it needs to be modified slightly. </p>

<p>I like this Miles Mathis paper on how opinion makers operate:  <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf</a></p>

<p>In this paper, he makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying you should trust me.  You shouldn&#39;t trust anyone, especially someone you haven&#39;t met
in person.  You should read everything closely and make a decision based on continuity and logic, not
on trust.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this I don&#39;t mean that you should not communicate with other people, rather to focus on the merits of ideas rather than looking for people to trust.</p>
