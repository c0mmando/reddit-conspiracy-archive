       I think those things are very possible. I rule nothing out because I may never be in a place to decide authoritatively one way or another in this lifetime. I am using this life to gather information and hopefully access some of the hidden realms to figure out if I have any sole purpose for my existence.
      </p>

       One interesting fact I just found out: my favorite tree is the Weeping Willow tree. I thumbed through a book called The Pagan Book of Days, by Nigel Pennick. In it, I found out that in the Celtic tree calendar, it is the 5th month (April into May). This coincides with my birthday, so it just hit me that perhaps the reason the willow is my favorite tree is that it marks the time period in which I was born. Thought that was cool, and further increases my curiosity on the mystical level.

       Scientifically, I believe many unexplained phenomena like ghosts and spirits are the result of multidimensional interactions between the dimensional branes.

       Conspiracies are mostly rooted in occult globalist agendas.  This battle for control is rooted in the spirit world.  If you don't believe in the spirit world, watch 'The Spirit Molecule' on netflix.  Then take that one step further.

       All of it is real just maybe not in the way we define them. People with mental health issues are meant to be healers but the way we treat/ medicate them hinder their abbilities and break their minds further. Demons/ghosts/aliens/monsters are all real except they are not seperate categories. All of them and all of us are the same, we are just different forms of living things. If you think about how huge the universe is, and how much of our earth is unexplored/empty, there is a lot of room for beings we have yet to fully understand. They are all probably here they are just beyond our understanding, really good at hiding, and those that find them are often killed or devoured. I may be biased seeing as I kind of want all these things to exist.

       maybe some people are more "sensitive" &amp; i think this allows their other "senses" to pick up info. obviously there's more to it IMO; if it's a family trait, etc.

       Dont bother with Rockran. Like I've said before hes the heckler.  He came to this sub not to learn, grow, or help with the discussion.  Hes here just to heckle and call us stupid.  This thread is the perfect example of his contributions.  what we believe is just nonsene to him but hes here everyday religiously calling us out on everything.  Ask yourself, would you dedicate time every single day to a forum that is full of people that believe in nonsense?  With people you dont care for?  What does he get out of it?

       I do that for a few months... then i have to say something.  Him and i have this discussion a few times a year and i always get the same simple answers.  So i guess you're right.  Maybe that ignore function will show up soon on my reddit app.

       Im not afraid of your criticism.  I welcome true criticism... it helps keep us grounded.  However, you arent here to help with real productive critiques.  Maybe the first 50 times i read your very negative, condescending, higher-than-tho attitude i was able to accept.  But after YEARS of literally just bashing and calling our beliefs nonsnese ive come to realize that there is more to it.  Its not natural to be this dedicated to something you despise so much.  Its actually unhealthy.

       I disagree.  I don't feel the need to fix everyone.  I actually learn by reading the really out there theories even tho i know they may be rubbish at times.  I do call out some people but you do it all the time.  Nonstop.  All year.  You dont want to contribute,  learn, add to the theories, grow... you just want to police a forum you despise.  Weirdest hobby i know.  Or is it a hobby?

       Contributing negativity when none is asked for.  You know the point im making but keep skirting it.  You are a negative influence on a sub designed for open mindedness and theoretical suppostions.  Im not against correcting dangerous ideas but you feel the need to attack core values for alot of people nonstop.  Why come here jusy to police.  Why not positively add to the discussion?  Why just always try to shut us down?  You claim SOME need to be corrected but you do it to everything on this sub thats even remotely out there.  Again, yiure only goal here is to police our thoughts.

       Doing something for thousands of years doesn't make it 'real' - I put that in inverted commas because your comment was a bit vague.

       Getting high as a kite on drugs is certainly a real experience, in the sense that your mind is indeed getting blazed, but that doesn't mean the experiences you have during the trip are real.
