       So basically all these accounts popped out of nowhere at around the same time, all post in the exact same subs, and do nothing besides post pro-Hillary and negative Sanders comments all day. This took me like 10 minutes to find all these accounts in a couple different threads on that sub, I'm sure there's quite a few more.

       You have it entirely wrong. Who we are voting for is irrelevant to the sub, and I feel quite confident that most who belong to the sub are extremely well versed in their own candidates proposals and history . We joined the sub because everywhere else on the internet had become a scorching plague of Sanders Spam. Irrational thought, outright lies, and general silliness (when teenage foreigners are talking about ways they can illegally donate to Sanders campaign). Sanders campaign has become a parody. Sanders could have reigned it in, but he didn't because  apparently, he believes even bad publicity is good publicity.

       Funny, I hear a lot of people complain about that sub being overwhelmingly predisposed to Sanders. I dunno tho, because I'm not really concerned about it. I follow two subs primarily: r/HillaryClinton and r/EnoughSandersSpam. The only reason I posted here was because someone linked to it, and I thought the OPs conspiracy was perfectly typical of Sanders Spam.

       is much more about activism and getting people to vote, way more so than spam. Donald's sub is literally 100% spam
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's like you folks have never seen a political race before, people promote candidates, that's how things go. Especially in subs for politics. Getting mad that people are talking politics in political circles is going to lead to you jumping off a bridge

       Not really. I'm sitting here in my back porch, watching my dog play on the grass and sipping ice tea. My first election was 1980. I've been through a few of these horse races before. As I mentioned, I really don't care what goes  on in other subs. Once this election is over I'll probably leave Reddit just the way I found it, several weeks ago: a weird collection of mostly young, male testosterone.

       it's not extremely biased towards hillary, though there are more hillary supporters there than you will find elsewhere. i spend a decent amount of time in that sub and there are people from both sides of the aisle.

       Bernie's trip to the Vatican isn't worthy of political discussion, here is the basic gist - Not-Pope invited him without authority to do so, Bernie gave a 10 minute stump speech, was rudely introduced to the Pope, waiting outside his office as he was getting ready to take a flight, and left New York, the most political discussion one could get from that is 1. He is pandering 2. he is a liar, 3. The pope didn't invite him and he took a pointless trip to give a 10 minute speech. That isn't material for political discussion, that's for lawling at on enough sanders spam.

       Additionally, caucus vote totals have not been released, so I guess we'll have to take your word on the number of votes that she's ahead since I guess those "votes" don't matter.

       Caucuses don't change the number much at all. The largest win Bernie has had was in Washington, a caucus state. Washington had turnout of 230,000. That's extremely low. South Carolina, a mid size primary state, had 400,000 people vote. Bernie's biggest win had less people vote for him than Hillary did in one small state. But you sure love to use this shitty non talking point don't you?

       The problem with that counterpoint is that turnout for caucuses is so low compared to turnout for primaries that, even without knowing the vote percentage breakdown, you could give Bernie all of Hillary's votes from caucuses (as in, give every single caucus vote to Bernie) and she'd still be winning by well over a million votes.

       .... you're the one negating voters here by completely leaving out a number of states from your vote count, and ignoring the fact that some states do things differently than others and pretending that "overall vote count" is what matters, when that vote count doesn't count everyone.

       Lol keep thinking everyone who likes Sanders is a kid. Speaking of metrics, how many demos does Hillary have? It's just the over 45s now right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's less than 200 delegates now right? Use that number

       Meh. That many new accounts are created almost every day to post in this subreddit alone. Nothing alarming about that tactic. We have a rule that your account has to be at least 48 hours old before your posts are allowed to be visible *(unless a mod sees them and deems them legit). Without that, you'd see

       No, it's not. It turns out that some people just don't agree with the guy. I used to just casually lurk on Reddit but when all of this sanders garbage started to flood my feed, I found
       <a href="/r/enoughsandersspam">
        /r/enoughsandersspam

       and my world changed forever. I go there for sanity, away from shitposts like this. Bernie bots are literally the only reason I have an account.

       Sure. Guaranteed they target reddit, probably mostly via PACs. The Obama spammers were relentless and blatant. Reddit admins were probably in on it.

       Some people would rather have a secondary account that they post their political views on after all the brigading that has been going on these past 6+ months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use my normal account but I know that I have had a shit ton of downvots on any posts I make that supports Clinton on
       <a href="/r/politics">

       Yep. Using my Hillary account to post to other areas of Reddit is just asking to be brigaded. I also like the added level of privacy by posting from separate accounts for each of my interests (eg I have an account for posting to my university and city sub and another for my fav hobby)

       I post on those subs regularly, and I am not paid off by anybody. I think these people just join that sub at the same time because the anti-Hillary rhetoric was really ramping up and they needed a space where they could be open about their support for Hillary without being attacked for it.

       Well I'm certainly my own person and not a bot (that makes me sound more suspicious...) but I spend a lot of time lately posting on Clinton and EnoughSandersSpam subreddits, because I support Hillary Clinton and am sick and tired of Bernie Sanders. If y'all wanna make a socialist party, just go ahead and do it. But don't pretend to be democrats. You idiots aren't even gonna go vote in the general election anyway. You're too busy making conspiracies and wasting your time tracking users from /hillaryclinton. Don't you have a job or something?

       I support Bernie Sanders and am sick and tired of Hillary Clinton. If you want an economically conservative and socially liberal party, go start your own. But don't pretend to be democrats. You idiots are going to vote for more regime change, more wars, TPP, mass incarceration, growing economic inequality, fossil fuel interests, and the status quo. Guess what? Climate change isn't incremental, it's been rather abrupt, even worse than our prior predictions. And a corporate kiss ass isn't going to rally the bully pulpit except to try to silence dissenting democrats as she already has this entire primary. Y'all have fun on this sinking ship as the sea levels rise, the sixth mass extinction continues, winter becomes the new summer, and summer becomes the new death valley. I probably won't live that long anyway under the continuation of status quo and incremental crumbs of neoliberalism.

       Well aren't you just a ray of sunshine... I'll have you know, Hillary Clinton is a Democrat. Bernie Sanders is an independent running as a Democrat. Also, political beliefs lie on a spectrum, as do a party's beliefs. So perhaps I am not as into government planning in economics as a Sanders fan, but I'm still a Democrat. You are misrepresenting what Clinton and her supporters want, and what their policy agendas are. I'm not going to sit here and rebut all of your statements, as if you are somehow the purveyor of the Clinton campaign's intentions.

       MEHH I really doubt Bernie is going to win New York, and when he makes his concession speach afterwards it might be the straw that breaks the camels back. Milennials know the game is rigged, and I saw several articles that leaked into
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       stating that fact. Will there be riots? We'll see.

       Oh, for Christ's sake. I created my account because around mid-March I got fucking fed up with Bernie and his cult, and my primary is today. So naturally I've been posting and bitching a lot. That's a pretty similar timeline to other people who thought Bernie was pretty OK at the beginning of the primaries, then starting hating his guts over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find hilarious are all the Bernie Twitter accounts that are just a picture of a hot girl and then Bernie spam.

       You know what I've noticed? The word "optics" - never seen/read it before in the history of ever and all time (on the internet), and BAM two days ago
       <em>
        it's fucking everywhere
       </em>
       , and
       <strong>
        it's always a pro Hillary post.

       Is it a trending word? Is that a thing? A cool word spouted on some network and now it's in everyone's vocabulary? Or a new word added to "the script"?

       I have wondered how Hillary has so much support, but only 9,000 subscribers in her biggest subreddit. I guess most of her supporters aren't on the Internet--and so many of the ones who are appear to be professional supporters. If you look at their profiles, every post they have is something trying to rebut Sanders comments.

       So what? I only post here. It's why I came to Reddit a couple of weeks ago. I didn't have another good place to share my distaste of Sanders and my love for Hillary. I go elsewhere for other topics. Oh, I did post in the Game of Thrones subreddit, so there's that. Are you trying to pretend we're not real people?

       Her campaign is like a magic show where there's a lot of illusionists working behind the curtains to make what you see appear real. At least that's how I perceive it. With the access to the resources she must have, I'm surprised there's only 11k subbed there.

       sounds like an echo chamber for Hillary and Trump supporters. So they're just wasting their time posting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to pay a brigade of shills to control discussion on reddit, you're going to get better value for your money by sending them to keep an eye (and post comments) in the bigger subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that would be subs like news, politics, worldnews, politicaldiscussion, etc. I guess the Hillary related subs as well. Though you'd think she would have enough
       <em>
        genuine
       </em>
       supporters there that they wouldn't need shills for that.

       Ok, so you found some new accounts, and I am not meaning to take away their importance, but could you give a ballpark percentage of accounts that were new and old?  Did you find the new accounts were making a significant amount of comments?  I don't doubt that they may be Clinton hires, but reddit is always attracting new supporters and this could also be a reason.

       The actual shills do a way better job than this. This is probably just some Hill Dog fans trying to game reddit bu to novice to know what they're doing.

       There are operatives engagaed in online covert action. It only takes a cursory glance at wikipedia edit history, or a simple compare/contrast reddit to voat. HUMINT operations do not cease because someone tweeted at them.
