        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I won&#39;t drag on about myself too much, but some context will help you understand if my situation is relevant to yours. I&#39;m a former &quot;scan the frontpage of reddit because it&#39;s funny&quot; 20-something average kid who came from a relatively privileged background. I like to build on my worldview, and understand what&#39;s &#39;really going on&#39; in social/political situations. That discovery process turned into an obsession with politics/history/economics, because the craziness to reality just wouldn&#39;t stop coming! That led to communities like this. </p>

<p>If you are like me, you have learned A LOT about the world. The vast majority, entirely too burdensome. If you are my age, you have learned more than past aged elders learned about their communities, before the age of 30! This is a lot to bear. In an age that is already tortuous enough to a well-intentioned soul, we are bearing the weight of truth on top of it all.</p>

<p>This has been getting me down - until today. Today I am turned on to a new mindset. One that is guaranteed to serve me with motivation to change the world for the better, and to improve myself as well.</p>

<p><strong>Your journey to find the truth is only worth having trekked if you make it through to spread your view of the world.</strong></p>

<p>Take your knowledge, and be persistent in life. Do not let fear cripple you with anxiety. You have a more informed worldview than most, and while you should be vigilant in always discerning truth from falsehood, you should also be confident in what you have learned so far.</p>

<p>Live your life, succeed, and work to dissolve fear in your life and in others&#39;. Peace be with you all, shills included.</p>

<p>Polaris does move as you can see in long exposure photographs:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/biCMD4q.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/biCMD4q.jpg</a></p>

<p>Not only that, but over the years it also changes position due to axial precession.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate, and actually quite surprising that you&#39;ve never learned this in all of your research, you can confirm it yourself any night in the Northern Hemisphere with a clear sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no axial precession, stop buying bullshit and parroting it. Ptolemy recorded the same position with Polaris 2000 years ago it has not moved in 2000 years (except for an extreme minor wobble that can only be captured with time lapse). What I mean by Polaris never moving I mean by visible means with observations, in other words find a chair or spot that you can sit year round and find where Polaris is and watch it night after night it will be in the same spot year after year after year after year. There are star charts from 50 years ago and are still perfectly accurate which would be impossible at the astronomical rates we are supposedly moving at. The stars remain fixed to each other and have been for over 2000 years and rotate around Polaris, why is this fact so hard to comprehend? </p>

<p>Wrong, as usual. I suggest you do some research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard&#x27;s_Star">Barnard&#39;s Star</a>, which has measurably moved in just the last 20 years. I know asking you to research is a lost cause, but I&#39;ll join the group pointing out just how wrong you are. </p>

<p>There is no axial precession, stop buying bullshit and parroting it. Ptolemy recorded the same position with Polaris 2000 years ago it has not moved in 2000 years (except for an extreme minor wobble that can only be captured with time lapse). What I mean by Polaris never moving I mean by visible means with observations, in other words find a chair or spot that you can sit year round and find where Polaris is and watch it night after night it will be in the same spot year after year after year after year. There are star charts from 50 years ago and are still perfectly accurate which would be impossible at the astronomical rates we are supposedly moving at. The stars remain fixed to each other and have been for over 2000 years and rotate around Polaris, why is this fact so hard to comprehend? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to well informed enough regarding the issue at hand.  Anybody who does astrophotography is well aware of the movement of Polaris due to axial precession needs to be accounted for in order to maintain polar alignment.  This is why polar scopes have different positions for stars as you progress through decades:</p>

<p>Again, this is something that you can easily verify yourself and will be visible over the course of your lifetime.</p>

<p>My polar scope has similar markings, would you like me to take a photo of it for you?</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m here, I don&#39;t think you should hijack other people&#39;s posts to make them about Flat Earth. I doubt very muich this is what the OP had in mind.</p>

<p>This is exactly what I was doing not hijacking but sharing the truth I have found in a world full of lies. You are not spinning around at 1000mph just sit down and fucking think about it for Christ sakes. Bunch of fools buying this bullshit CGI space.</p>
