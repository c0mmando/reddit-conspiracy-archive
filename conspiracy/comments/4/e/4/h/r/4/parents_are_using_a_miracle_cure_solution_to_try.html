    <div class="md"><p>This is slightly off topic but I think it helps understand this sort of thing.</p>

<p>I used to work with a guy who had inherited money. He wasn&#39;t smart in much sense of the word. He was married to this girl who was even less. She was pregnant and took 10000 dollars from their account and went to NYC where a guru was going to attempt to deliver her baby through her mouth. </p>

<p>Point of the story is people will always try to take advantage of people, especially if they think they aren&#39;t smart, to either make money off them, or sway them to be more dumb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh, that&#39;s not true.  Think about it.</p>

<p>Numerous peer-reviewed studies have been produced which prove there is no link between vaccine and autism.  Supposed studies which have shown a link have been shot down for bad research methods, incomplete data and downright lying/misrepresentation of facts.  </p>

<p>Now, given that reality, how and why would a vaccine maker release an insert which says their vaccine causes autism when that is in fact not true?</p>

<p>ALSO - why is it that the pharmaceutical companies absolutely cannot be trusted but when they say something which you and others completely misinterpret, their word is gospel?  Think about that.</p>

<p>If you actually read the vaccine insert sheets then you would now that the word autism is mentioned only in a section that CLEARLY states that there is no actual link between the vaccine and autism, but rather than some people have reported their child developing autism at some point after having the vaccine.  It has as much worth as you saying that after you got the shits a couple of days after having an eye exam.  Yes, it happened but that does not prove a link between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No there wasn&#39;t.  The whole thing about belief in a flat-Earth is misleading anyway.  It wasn&#39;t a widely-held for a long time.

<p>The entire Inquisition was peer-reviewed. All &#39;science&#39; had to be reviewed through the Church and the priest class. Ask Galileo. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite similar to today: you work in an area that the current priest class, scientists, disagree with, they try to burn you at the stake (try publishing data refuting anthropogenic climate change and see how it happens)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come off it chief.  You can&#39;t compare the decision of a group of people involved in the Inquisition to peer-reviewed scientific journals.  The scientific method has nothing to do with alleged religious transgressions.</p>

<p>To compare &#39;scientists&#39; as a group to priests is also extremely disingenuous.  It&#39;s a common tactic of people who are wrong to compare religion to science.  For one, science is not dogmatic and does not rely on &#39;received wisdom&#39;.</p>

<p>You could try publishing data which refutes climate change and people do, but it&#39;s not true and therefore isn&#39;t taken as seriously as the piles of data which support the anthropogenic climate change theory.  But let&#39;s not get into that debate now.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>For one, science is not dogmatic and does not rely on &#39;received wisdom&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely true. But it DOES rely on received FUNDING. 
Go ahead and try to get federal funding for a study to refute something entrenched as federal policy. Good luck. It&#39;s a career ender. All the money right now is for studies that reinforce the outcome politicians want, there is no disagreement with that, it&#39;s simple self-evident fact. </p>

<p>You want a scientific law? Here you go: the easiest way to control scientific outcome is to control funding. It happens daily, sadly. </p>

<p>Also, to address your last point, I&#39;m appalled at the assertion that &quot;x isn&#39;t true so it&#39;s not even taken seriously&quot;....that sounds like some Inquisition-style thinking there, that because it doesn&#39;t fit our arbitrary BELIEFS we discount it out of hand. That&#39;s not how any of this works. Countless scientific laws-of-their-time were shattered by one single dissenting theory that went on to be realized as the correct theory. Alfred Wegener died as a penniless crackpot, ridiculed by all other scientists for his crazy hypothesis that our continents were parts of plates that floated on a molten layer of the planet and their collisions caused earthquakes...now we know it as the accepted theory of how the planet works, Continental Drift &amp; Plate Tectonics. 
Even the laws of motion and gravity set in place by Newton were tweaked and corrected centuries after their universal acceptance. The only true law of science is change, and people who deny that aggravate people like I who have degrees with Science in the title, rant end, blocks set. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it relies on funding, and I&#39;m sure that when you have a look at where some of the funding for climate-change denying papers comes from, you&#39;ll find a link to the petrochemicals industry.  You&#39;re also talking from a very US-centric viewpoint.  What you are stating as fact is not the case in many other countries where scientific bodies aren&#39;t as beholden to governments and governments aren&#39;t in the pockets of corporations - at least not to the ridiculous extent as they are in the USA.</p>

<p>The idea that scientific ideas change according to the evidence is very true.  But what was the actual evidence which contradicted plate tectonic theory?  There are still people - scientists, no less - who contend that plate tectonic theory is incorrect so do we throw the baby out with the bathwater just because is opposed to a widely agreed-upon theory?</p>

<p>I get your point and I appreciate it but what are you proposing?  We disregard the huge piles of evidence and the overwhelming scientific consensus because people told Galileo he was wrong or that Zweig was crazy?  You&#39;re right that money can and does affect the outcome of certain studies and politics can do the same.  Like when many scientists were pressurized by people like oil-industry lobbist Phil Cooney or when NASA suppressed studies and data on global warming during George W. Bush&#39;s reelection campaign (hmm why would they need to censor data during the election campaign of a climate-change denier?).  </p>

<p>But where is the money and the political influence in this particular situation?  The example which you gave of Wegener and the examples of Galileo, Zweig and other scientists who have proposed theories which were discounted are examples of those who have challenged the establishment and the status quo.  That is exactly what the theory of anthropogenic climate change has done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no it is not &#39;fucking bleach&#39;, any more than digitalis is &#39;fucking curare&#39; or No it is not Chlorine Gas either.  it is Cl02, it is a super powerful disinfectant that has many uses, like sterlizing operating rooms and people have actually had good results drinking, bathing, brushing teeth, etc., with the solution.  There are commercial dental products that use Cl02 since it is the one thing we know about which removes biofilm.  Yes, like dental plaque.    There is also pretty convincing evidence it actually kills malaria to drink this stuff.  I would say you should be a little more objective.  Yes, it is a harsh chemical which needs to be treated with respect, but so are many medicines.</p>

<p>A main problem with this stuff is that it might be a good alternative for many profitable and possibly even less-effective but very profitable medications. </p>

So, please tell me how the science that led to the eradication of polio in America and smallpox world wide is somehow missing the magical benefits of MMS. </p>

<p>Please feel free to provide some links to studies showing the positive benefits of MMS. Please provide links to all the reputable studies on all the &#39;myriad toxins&#39; in vaccines. I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<p>Your anecdotal, biased observation don&#39;t compete with the vast body of accumulated scientific evidence. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact people administer this to children I would tip my hat and let Darwinism do its job. </p>
