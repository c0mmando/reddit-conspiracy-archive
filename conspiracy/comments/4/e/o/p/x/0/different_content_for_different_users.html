        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This morning I was browsing this sub and came across the post about the Conspiracy of Silence documentary doing really well in r/documentaries. I went to go check it out, impressed it had managed to make it so high there. I saw it had probably 3k upvotes and was the top post. I came back here to comment in the thread about it, then went back to the post in <a href="/r/documentaries">/r/documentaries</a> to read the comments there and it was gone. Completely missing from the list there. So I came back to the thread here and posted that it was gone to be told it was still there. I screenshotted the fact it was missing for me and we compared. I then checked on my main account. Guess what? I could see it on that one. It wasn&#39;t just that link that was missing from my feed in the documentaries in either, there was another. It was also able to be viewed on my main account.</p>

<p>Just something to be aware of. Content is being filtered for us apparently. I saw stuff disappear. Other people saw things that were missing for me. I wonder how often this is happening.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/xMszgvK">http://imgur.com/xMszgvK</a> as you can see it was completely missing from my feed. I usually use Alien Blue. You can&#39;t see as many in the list but here&#39;s a comparison of both my accounts in that awhile ago. The one video that has replaced the missing one only has 10 upvotes? As opposed to 3k on the missing Conspiracy of Silence one. It&#39;s all very strange.</p>

<p>Just took brand new screenshots of the same thing so you can see times stamps on each account so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m messing with stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I wouldn&#39;t say I find it shocking. I&#39;m just not sure most are aware it&#39;s happening. And it definitely makes for awkward conversation when you are insisting something isn&#39;t there and someone else says it is. I think most are/were likely under the assumption that they would be seeing the same content as others in individual subreddits. Obviously the users are having less and less control over everything every day. This is just another example.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that OP is engaging in disinformation here, but the uncertainty and doubt elements are the crux of this post. There&#39;s no proof here that suggests anything dodgy is going on.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t know if they are doing that or not. That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking basically. That&#39;s why I took the screenshots. No agenda, just questions.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand. </p>

<p>Just keep in mind that posts like this tend to rile up the irrationally paranoid and hostile users that this sub does tend to attract. They literally see your desire for understand what happened as &#39;proof&#39; because you actually made screenshots.</p>

<p>Great username by the way. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey that&#39;s the only way to sort stuff out. I just tested downvoting a link and then refreshing (in alien blue which is what I normally use) to see if that feature even works and it doesn&#39;t look like it does anything. Links still show up even if downvoted. So I think I will just message admins to ask just in case and ask alien blue as well if they know of any glitch in that regard. Could even be a glitch between the two. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll update if I hear anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>could</em> be that, but it could also be a side effect of reddit cached pages and load-balancing. I&#39;ve noticed these effects before after edits that &#39;didn&#39;t take&#39;.  It turns out they did take in another browser, but in mine they were cached and this wasn&#39;t a browser cache.  It was literally giving 2 differnet pages.  I&#39;ve even seen it &#39;flip flop&#39; between previous edits and new edits.</p>

<p>this made me insane at first and I though I was being QUANTUMINSERT&#39;ed then I thought about it for a second more and knowing what I know of shittywebdevelopment, I realized they were having problems propagating new edits and new content across ALL their mirrors in their loadbalancer.</p>

<p>What this means is that some web servers of theirs have the old version, some have the edited, newer version and they with sporadically serve the old and new versions at differnet times.  It&#39;s fucking nuts, and very bad.  But that&#39;s reddit.  If Aaron were still alive he&#39;d tell them to get their act together. </p>

<p>At any rate, this happens with teh content queue as well.  you can have things not show up quite yet, and then they do.  This badcaching looks like treachery but really it&#39;s devops incompetence.  Actually this problem is common with loadbalancing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did check to make sure I hadn&#39;t hidden it, that would have made the most sense. Nothing appears to be hidden. I&#39;m not sure what sort of settings I would have different that would cause me to see different articles in the same subreddit though. Any ideas?  I do like having two accounts for a variety of reasons though. The other one is mostly abandoned now. I only checked with if because I realized this missing thread stuff during a conversation with another user so I logged in the other account to see if it was affected as well.</p>
