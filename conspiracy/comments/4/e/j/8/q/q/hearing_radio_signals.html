        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It comes as a high pitched ring I can just barely hear now. It has to be quiet, like at night when everyone is asleep. It&#39;s not tinnitus because it gets louder as I move closer to the source. And only happens if there are electrical sources near by. Does not happen deep in the wilderness.</p>

<p>I noticed this when I was a kid. Even if the TV or radio was muted, I would wake up from the ringing. My parents hated it when I was real little. It was much louder as a kid, before all the gunfire damaged my hearing. I still have exceptional hearing though, but the ringing has become tedious after all these years.</p>

<p>Ear plugs never worked. The sounds penetrate solids pretty well. I can be on the other side of a house and know that something that draws significant voltage or audio source has been turned on. I won&#39;t hear the regularly audible noise until I&#39;m much closer, but the ringing is immediate. </p>

<p>With the rise of WiFi, anytime I&#39;m in a neighborhood I hear a little bit of ringing if I sit and listen for it, especially at night or when it&#39;s quiet.</p>

<p>I guess I want to know if anyone here has experienced this and has found a way to deal with it, or just that I&#39;m not alone. Now I&#39;m curious if I can find the exact frequencies ranges I can hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you are not only talking about WIFI, but in general, electrical equipment.  </p>

<p>I, too, hear electrical equipment too if the environment is anywhere close to quiet.  Some of it is louder than others; My brother has a phone charger that is very loud to me.  It sounds kind of like a ringing,whirring whirring, high pitched noise/frequency.</p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever heard WIFI (or even if it&#39;s theoretically possible; I guess it is....)  Your hearing (or brain) seem to be much more sensitive (very sensitive)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes! It definitely evolves in it&#39;s characteristic sounds. I didn&#39;t want to be too specific before.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain it&#39;s at least the electric signals generated in WiFi routers and or modems, as the signal exchange uses different amounts of electricity.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve plugged and unplugged, and I could hear a difference when the data exchange began, when the system was &quot;full-go.&quot; Did this in the middle of the night so I had a pretty controlled environment.</p>

<p>Maybe give it a try since you seem to hear something like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical explanation is leaky capacitors,  but that only explains a specific subset of noise,  there is a lot we are surrounded by that can generate high frequency signals, so the best i can offer is wild speculative links. Most terrifying (newly developed) application:  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/beware-of-ads-that-use-inaudible-sound-to-link-your-phone-tv-tablet-and-pc/</a>  </p>

<p>Also there may be ways to communicate over AC lines, look  up power-line networking.  not an electrician or have any knowledge behind how these things work but it&#39;s awfully sketchy when you hear a high frequency buzz pops in out of nowhere with identifiable characteristics and changing patterns, and you start power cycling everything plugged in to identify the source of the noise, with little effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been reading up since people have replied. Lots of good material out there.</p>

<p>Some of this definitely can be explained by leaky capacitors, but more remains indeed. I have heard about this technology before. Not a fan. Maybe that&#39;s the noise I hear before my email syncs. I keep everything unplugged/off on the fuse box, if its not in use immediately, that&#39;s mostly how I deal with things, saves electricity too.</p>

<p>The struggle is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Np,  It&#39;s important to remember I&#39;m just some random dork on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and also have no clue what&#39;s up with all the weird high frequency noises that I am noticing too.  There are likely many many more explanations besides leaky capacitors that i haven&#39;t done much research on, I just wanted to point out surveillance implications of higher-than-normal-human hearing frequencies while we are all surrounded by microphones and speakers with jacked up graphics processors that can be programmed for heavy signals processing, and everyone with the facebook app basically legally agreeing to be a walking wiretap in their ToS agreement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too hear the white noise that some electronics produce, i remember one day walking past the tv in the livingroom that everyone was watching, but i heard this high pitch frequency, i turned to the entertainment center and noticed the surround sound system was on, but the device it was connected to was off(dvd player) so i hit the power button on the surround sound and my family thought i was nuts.. I looked at them and said &quot;what? U guys left the stereo on&quot; nobody else could hear the high pitch and they thought I was crazy lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s difficult to say. On my Juniper and Cisco gear, I&#39;ve never heard the noise, never had a problem (with the hardware.) However, I have a few PoE injectors from a reputable company that have leaky capacitors pretty consistently. They&#39;re fine straight from the box, for anywhere from a day to a week. Then the noise complaints start.</p>

<p>We swapped to a different manufacturer for PoE injectors and haven&#39;t had a problem since (and they&#39;re cheaper.) but I still get the occasional noise complaint. Out of 100s of PCs, 1 was a capacitor screaming for its life on a network card. The majority were hard drive or fan related.</p>

<p>Hmm... it might have something to do with the 25Mhz crystal used for 10/100 Mbps ethernet, as that is the common factor in the issues I&#39;ve seen. Still, it&#39;s rare, but an ever present possibility as the equipment ages. </p>
