        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hillary Clinton is a criminal. But it doesn&#39;t matter, because all of her crimes will be swept under the rug. The media will not report them, and if the media won&#39;t report them, then as far as the general public is concerned, they don&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>She will literally steal the election. Voter fraud is rampant in this election, and it is to ensure that Hillary becomes the next president. It doesn&#39;t matter what the actual public votes for because the people in charge have already decided that Hillary will win, and they will commit any crimes they have to in order to ensure that result. </p>

<p>Why? Because Hillary will give the elite exactly what they want. More for the rich, less for the poor. She will drive us into even more false wars, and the elite will continue to profit from them. </p>

<p>I think at this point, the best thing we can do is attempt to expose her as the criminal she is. Make the proof go viral, so much so that the mainstream media can&#39;t suppress it. That is the only way she can be stopped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the &quot;powers that be&quot; have decided she will win, they must have some method of ensuring it (rigging the vote).</p>

<p>So why does she need to &quot;do anything&quot; to win? Surely if the outcome is assured, she doesn&#39;t have to do <em>anything</em> to win?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She could do that by running a &quot;squeaky clean&quot; campaign, but the OP is suggesting she is pulling dirty tricks.</p>

<p>It seems silly to be pulling dirty tricks that might result in exposure, when you already have the outcome in the bag, and whatever she is, Clinton is not silly.</p>

<p>I think the dirty tricks are a sign of desperation, not that she has already been &quot;selected&quot;.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had 8 years of a Democrat, the Republicans are next up to bat. What better way to get all those right wingers in the public to toe the line than to put their man into &quot;power&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s all theatre: the powers that be are playing a massive game and both &quot;sides&quot; are corrupted. It may not be Trump, but I expect the next President will be a Republican, and it will likely be Trump to make the people feel like they actually had a say.</p>

<p>American elections are like &quot;America&#39;s Got Talent&quot; - you&#39;ve been given a choice between pre-selected candidates so the powers that be can figure out which one you&#39;ll tolerate. But make no mistake, every single one of them is &quot;acceptable&quot; to the elites, or they would never have made it this far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this is the thing that gets me. I agree that Trumps numbers don&#39;t look good when it comes to the general election, but i honestly think that would change once they have the debates. The problem right now though is the GOP establishment and Ted Cruz trying to overtake Trump by stealing the delegates.</p>

<p>But if by some small chance Trump gets the nod from the GOP, which is highly unlikely, he would smoke Hillary. One of the head guys of Newsmax of I&#39;m not mistaken, even said the same thing. He said Trump is willing to go places no one else is willing to go.</p>

Which means we can no longer rely on a Dylan Storm Roof type character to take her out like immediately next year, which means that the whitehats in the cia / fbi are going to have to come up with some kind of socialist, eco, pro-drugs or peace militia really fast between now and then, to express that one &#39;extremist lone wolf&#39;.  I feel really bad for them, lots of nights and weekends for their staff.  Hope the mgrs order them lots of pizza and orange fanta.</p>
