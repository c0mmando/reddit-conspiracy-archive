      <p>
       I'm seeing a build up to a point of critical mass, both within myself and within our society.
Corruption is widespread, commonly known here, but we are reaching a point where it is being so publicly, by officials who fear to lose their precious control over us, that it being picked up by the meta-consciousness. Same goes for war, I personally know quite alot of people that are realizing that fire can't be fought with fire. Violence creates more violence, you punch me, I punch you. This is the mentality of child. A child we would teach that it doesn't matter who 'started it', but that peace and reconciliation is the way to go. There are many similar themes coming to the forefront of our collective mind and they all show symptoms of the disease we have as a human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       The love of self. Solipsism. Egotism. Psychopathy. Whatever name you choose to give it, it doesn't matter. This is the fundamental flaw we have allowed ourselves to develop. We have forgotten that there is such a thing as connection, or
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       of others and the environment we live in. By forgetting such a thing we forget that there is such a thing as collective truth. Moral truth. We are allowing ourselves to be completely consumed by our selfish needs and wants, whoever it may effect negatively. There are those who actively pursue this mindset of solipsism and those who they enthrust this worldview upon, namely the people who are afraid, ignorant and apathetic. Or leaders and followers if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as always there exists a resistive force. We are realizing that we don't want this eternal conflict of 'good and evil' and decide to, peacefully, not participate in this hamsterwheel of contrasts. People who are tired of being run through a mill just to serve the selfish, decadent needs of few while many are in actual dire need. Tired of standing by and watching it unfold. Finally becoming ready to eminate love and let go of fear. Fear of conflict, fear of others, fear of 'the enemy' and for many, fear of the
       <em>
        self
       </em>
       . Letting go of the fear to think, feel and act in the holy name of love is what we need to do as individuals and by doing so, as a collective species. Forgive yourself, so that we can forgive the enemy. Unity, internally and externally, is what we
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to achieve if we want to survive in the long run. Seperation is a logical phallacy which leads to solipsism which leads to the current state of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have only recently grasped this concept and it became painfully clear to me what I had to do. After realizing the power and healing ability of love it would be selfish, and therefore fearful, of me to not spread this message of hope and peace. "If you know but don't do, you don't know". I am finally realizing that for me to affect change in the world I first have to affect change within myself. And I think there are millions if not billions here in this collective consciousness with me who wholeheartedly agree with me. We'd rather not act, we'd rather things just be perfect the way they are, and if they're not, it's easier to think they are than acknowledging they are not and actually going out and
       <em>
        doing something about it
       </em>
       . I feel like it's not only me as an individual who is getting ready to actively affect change, I think we are all, just now, ready to express ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now my actual reasons to post this post is seeing if we are, in fact, ready. And if anybody would be interested in joining me in creating a document, a
       <em>
        manifest
       </em>
       of our thoughts and feelings as they currently are, and a proposed plan of action, as individuals and as a species, of combating the negative state of our current society. I feel like us making a detailed documentation of this and then actually manually spreading it to whoever we can reach might be an excellent way to starting to spread this positive movement.
We have to pick a moment to come together and becoming our own society within society. And now is the perfect time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very curious for your thoughts and feelings on this, sharing any and all is welcomed.

       This country is being so divided but I have no doubt that the Global elites want this division. They want this hatred. They want this war. They want this power and money.

       Glad you agree, I think it's about time we put a stop to this cycle of war, death and corruption. And in my mind, our only chance is to band together in non-agressive opposition.

       The only way to win is to slaughter the people responsible and destroy their institutions. Refusal to fight their actions is how they have enacted all of them. Compared to us, they have no power. Their only power comes from apathy.

       Your agenda here is all to clear. Stop with this us vs them paradigm pushing. Bloodshed has only ever helped the privileged few. If you had any sort of grasp of history you would know this.
Education is the only tool that won't end up hurting those who wield it. It's ignorance not apathy that encourages the current paradigm.

       Their power comes from our consent of this system, their twisted worldview. We have a sick need as a people for this system. That is the root of our problems not the fact there are people who crave power and who will do anything to attain it, that will always be true whether we kill the current ones or not. The key to taking away their power lies within. Taking revenge on these people and supplanting a supposedly superior regime only perpetuetes the system they have already mastered.

       This can be concatenated to the phrase
      </p>
      <p>
       "Greed is not good" People have been taught that the opposite is true. It's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a short simple truth that can be conveniently placed into many conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conscience is the most important human attribute that is in short supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge potential leaders by the presence or absence of conscience. Those suggestions  would be my best contribution to you. It's a long road but it's the most needed journey.

       Man, I've recently started doing the exact same and it has a hell of a positive effect on not only other people but me as well.

       Love you too, seriously. This is what we need more of.

       Hey, I'm all for peace. If all the Muslims go back to Africa and the MIddle East, and all the Hispanics and Mexicans  go back below the Reo Grande, and black Americans stop expecting white people to pay their way in the world, and Jews stop trying to brainwash everyone and run everything .... if all that happens, maybe we can be peaceful. But if all these groups keep trying to fuck me in the ass, merely because they think they are getting away with it, then I don't think peace is what I want at all.
