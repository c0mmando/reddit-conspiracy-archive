        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...or say a &quot;Limited Hangout&quot;??</p>

<p>[In case anyone is unfamiliar with the above term, a &quot;Limited Hangout&quot; is from the lexicon of the intelligence game, and is a form of <em>propaganda</em> in which a selected portion of a crime, scandal, sensitive or classified information, etc. is revealed or leaked, but without telling the whole story and the limited disclosure by itself is usually of minimal significance.]</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4e37lp/top_secret_28_pages_may_hold_clues_about_saudi/">link</a> to the post in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.</p>

<p>I try to be a judicious cynic/skeptic, as I&#39;ve seen those who start believing <em>everything</em> that the media reports is an illusion or some type of government/NWO ledgerdemain. I don&#39;t think this is case. Why? Because we have seen in the past that TPTB are quite often, far from careful. Further, I believe to some degree that their hubris is their weakness—most of us know that they believe that the overall majority of Americans (at least those who aren&#39;t part of their favored meritocracy minority) are, jointly and severally, as &quot;dumb as a fence post&quot;. Think about it...they have gotten away with pretty much everything (1993 World Trade Center bombing, Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11, Aurora shooting, Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon bombing, and others), so why would that change?</p>

<p>However, they may be prudent enough to realize that this current debate over the 28 pages brings 9/11 back to the foreground, if even for a moment. And because there would seem to be a growing (albeit slowly) movement demanding answers about 9/11, a movement led by various capable/credible individuals and groups such as Richard Gage and the AE911Truth (and many others), I don&#39;t think they&#39;d risk a possible stumble right now.</p>

<p>At the moment almost everyone—even if they do not believe 9/11 to be an &quot;inside job&quot;—believes they may have been mislead...that perhaps we were not given all relevant and correct information. Given this, the American public could grow to believe that there were far more significant details concealed.</p>

<p>So in the course of this information war we are in (those of us smart enough to have removed our blinders), I think that these &quot;undisclosed 28 pages&quot;, whatever they consist of currently or at some point in the past, will be used by TPTB to make the group that is arguing for their release appear to be a &quot;legitimate critic of 9/11&quot;. In this way, when the 28 pages are released, they will effectively be performing a second cover-up—one that is far more precise and secure than the original. By carefully allowing these 28 pages to disclose very selective information while ensuring that the most important details are omitted, the government will &quot;appear&quot; to be functioning normally: as a representative of the will and an in dutiful service to The People of this country. The net result and benefit though will be in the <em>diversion of public attention away from the most damaging facts</em> by making the government look as if it were <em>forced</em> to release guarded information. </p>

<p>The only problem is that this is a fire they must control. They must create enough of an appearance of a &quot;search for truth&quot; to come away looking like the truth has <em>finally been revealed.</em> They cannot allow this staged struggle for truth to inadvertently expand in a way that might cause the public to believe that there are startling facts yet <em>still lurking in the shadows.</em></p>

<p>Similarly, they cannot allow this current debate in Washington to mention or allude to the whitewash done by the 9/11 Commission. This would be dangerous as a large enough voice could demand another investigation. While undoubtedly such an investigation would still be under their control, such an event would create a great deal more risk. If another investigation was compelled, you can be sure the online community and alt-news groups will be watching every step. Since recent polls have shown that the mainstream media has lost the trust of the public at large, they won&#39;t be as effective in running interference permitting the &quot;truthers&quot; to gain more credibility in the investigation process. The public could forseably begin demanding that the new investigation address the countless anomalies and inconsistencies that are of <em>enormous</em> consequence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember too that the head of the Saudi Intelligence Agency just days before 9/11 was trained by Jesuits at Georgetown University. The Sauds were put into power by Churchill and Mussolini, the latter of whom was advised by a Jesuit, Pietro Tacchi Venturi. And it was Knights of Malta who set up the oil fields in Saudi Arabia which made them rich in the first place. The head of the CIA during 9/11, George Tenet, is also a Knight of Malta and trained at Georgetown University by Jesuits. Also the head adviser of JINSA (which is the most powerful Jewish policy group in America) David Steinmann, was also Jesuit trained from Georgetown. So the Americans, Saudis, and Israelis all worked together, or at least took orders from the same men; these men being powerful Jesuits, and the Jesuits forming the greatest intelligence network in the world according to CIA agent E. Howard Hunt.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Which is why I started by saying I try to be careful and not immediately assume everything that is done in Washington is really some type of manipulative propaganda-oriented event.</p>

<p>But they have kept this 28 page section alive in the media for a long time. I also think they might be concerned about trust in the MSM declining, and losing control of public opinion on the internet. </p>

<p>So I was just suggesting that perhaps they&#39;d use the &quot;28 pages&quot; as a vehicle to manipulate...And that is essentially how a Limited Hangout works. I guess we&#39;ll sees.</p>

<p>I know there are Israelis/Zionists in the U.S. government, but do you believe that any of these individuals are Mossad? Just curious because if Israelis orchestrated any or all of  9/11, they almost certainly would have been Mossad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due to many actions (and inactions) that happened on 9/11, such as the fact that not one plane was intercepted by fighter jets in the most secure air space in the world, etc... Project for a New American Century... etc, etc... it was definitely done as a dual effort.  The plan worked beautifully with the help of our tightly controlled media.  There&#39;s a reason building 7 came down, it destroyed the evidence of the missing 2.3 trillion, stuff about Enron, etc.  There&#39;s a reason the pentagon was hit on the side that just happened to be under renovation, killing only lowly accountants (guess what they were working on) and no brass.  There&#39;s a reason Bush couldn&#39;t recall and changed his story about how he first learned about 9/11.  There&#39;s a reason he and Cheney would not testify under oath, and on the record for all to see.  There&#39;s a reason why flight 93 looked suspiciously like just a hole in the ground and there was absolutely zero wreckage.  Did you know you can&#39;t go to the actual area at the &quot;memorial&quot;, or you&#39;ll be shot?  Israel runs this nation, of that I have zero doubt.  9/11 brought about the eroding of our rights, and put the war machine into full gear.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you believe that any of these individuals are Mossad?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look into a guy named rabbi Dov Zacheim.  He&#39;s a dual national born here, but is he mossad?  I doubt it, but that is only a technicality.  He definitely was beholden to Israel and not the USA, his actions spoke to that.  Chertoff also.  Rahm Emanuel is another guy who is worthy of looking into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about something the other day... Other than the infamous &quot;Dancing Israelis&quot; (and the other vans of Israelis on 9/11), there really isn&#39;t any other component of all the parts of the conspiracy <em>directly</em> linking anything to Israel.</p>

<p>But just recently, in releases in about the last year, I&#39;ve seen much more credible evidence.</p>

<p>First, if you haven&#39;t listened to Rebekah Roth, you definitely need to. She is a former flight attendant of 30 years prior to 9/11. She just released two books in the last 16 months or so. I haven&#39;t read them, but using her knowledge of the industry, she points out some really fascinating stuff (and I&#39;ve been a student of 9/11 lies since 2006). She also establishes so many links to Mossad and Israel.</p>

<p>This is a good video to start:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/f0NKlilvKvM">Rebekah Roth Interview 1</a></p>

<p>This is also excellent. I couldn&#39;t decide between the two... The one above is slightly more engrossing, but the one below has ever more new info (when I say new, it&#39;s both  things we&#39;ve heard but through her eyes and considerable experience, and unknown things that only she would think to look for because she knows how planes normally do things. This video also has numerous links and connections to Mossad and Israel.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qdP95oSoOFk">Rebekah Roth Interview 2</a></p>

<p>Then here are some articles that are a bit complicated, but if you know what had been happening in the world stage in the past few years, these disclosures make sense. Each article covers something slightly different, but they are also all joined by a key factor in the destruction of the towers.</p>

<p><a href="https://donaldfox.wordpress.com/2013/04/20/mystery-solved-the-wtc-was-nuked-on-911/">Article 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com/2015/09/2-2-israel-nuked-wtc-on-911.html?m=1">Article 2</a></p>

<p><a href="http://m.journal-neo.org/2014/07/07/so-you-want-to-know-the-truth-about-9-11/">Article 3</a></p>

<p>The second article is written by the same guy as article 1, but it has some other info...It&#39;s also written as a guest post on Jim Fetzer&#39;s site. I mention that because Fetzer can be annoying as his beliefs sometimes change quickly.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, all of the links above are excellent (although the articles are a little technical)... To me, I feel like a lot of answers are coming together got the first time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have a look at your links later when I have more time, but isn&#39;t Roth a &quot;mini-nuker&quot;?  I don&#39;t buy that whole thing and think it&#39;s disinfo.  Why muddy the waters with mini nukes when nano thermite can cause the molten steel that was there.  IMO there would be far more evidence if nukes were somehow involved.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also Ptech and the B-Thing, Urban moving systems... Lots of info on mossad &quot;art students&quot; etc.  I can respond better this evening, if I weren&#39;t about to need to go do some errands.  Thanks for the nice reply.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">2</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/pjvex.html">pjvex</a> 2016-04-10</p>
    <div class="md"><p>A couple of things... First I had just discovered Roth today and while she honestly and legitimately adds some information and links a lot of Israeli companies to virtually everything 9/11 (I mean just take ~40 minutes and listen to the first YouTube interview with Jeff Rense. The links she claims she found are mind blowing) she may be less than everyone thought.</p>

<p>The thought at the moment is that perhaps the government is one step ahead of us. I just found this <a href="http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=127319">Article</a> today dated January 10, 2016, in which an author on that site who had previously participated in disinfo strategies writing articles   <em>for the U.S.government</em> in the 1970s and 1980s, grows suspicious of Roth as there are some unusual inconsistencies about her, as well as some links that might call her credibility into question. The author in the above article also mentioned—with respect to Roth&#39;s flight attendant insight and the information she uncovered that fit in perfectly where there hadn&#39;t been any knowledge before—that during the Cold War, an intelligence strategy to spread disinfo was to send over someone to &quot;defect&quot; and provide disinformation, <em>however,</em> you couldn&#39;t pull this off unless you genuinely had some hard relevant intel that was unknown. For example the USSR might send a KGB agent to the U.S. to defect and he would give the names of 4 or 5 legitimate Russian spies, spies that Russia felt had either outlived their usefulness or were otherwise worth sacrificing in order to spread the disinformation. So the KGB agent would give the names of several spies, which in turn gave the defector <em>serious</em> credibility... Credibility they promptly took advantage of by turning around and &quot;leaking&quot; a very problematic piece of <em>dis</em>information. </p>

<p>Anyway it&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s up with Roth right now. You should listen to the first interview I linked (its shorter) and read this article above. If anything, she does give information about Mossad and Israeli companies that very much implicate them and this info also had been confirmed, so there is a question at the moment as to whether she is a genuine &quot;truther&quot; or a <em>very</em> shrewd agent of disinformation. I don&#39;t know the answer.</p>

<p>Now... on the other topic... I honestly think that a very significant percentage of truthers have a very limited and obsolete understanding of nuclear devices. Essentially everyone knows Hiroshima, those scary mushroom cloud films from the Nevada desert, and they kinda understands what a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; is. </p>

<p>What most fail to consider however  is not only what exists beyond the above types of first generation fission bombs, but that also research and development on nuclear weapons has continued to this day (albeit with little fanfare given the fear brought on by the Cuban Missile Crisis or reactor catastrophes like Three Mile Island and Chernobyl).</p>

<p>First,  a significant variation of nuclear weapon does exist and these weapons were publicly and actively developed in the 1960s. These weapons are called <em>Enhanced Nuclear Weapons</em> (&quot;ENW&quot;  and also sometimes referred to as a&quot;tactical&quot; device). One example of this from back in the day (which I&#39;m sure you recall) was called a &quot;neutron bomb&quot;. </p>

<p>Although neutron bombs were hailed at that time as a &quot;clean bomb&quot; because it killed people in a smaller area without damaging structures <em>or</em> leaving behind residual radiation, this is misleading.  ENWs do have a <em>significantly</em> lower yield than fission bombs using the same amount and type of radioactive element.  However, since the 1960s, research has continued but the nuclear weapons R&amp;D isn&#39;t exactly discussed in the news or on <em>Meet The Press</em>.   </p>

<p>Today, an ENW can be made which is very small (perhaps the size of a brick or a softball) and which possesses a considerably lower-force air and thermal blast (the shockwave and intense heat upon detonation). Lastly, the air and thermal blast range can be as small as a maximum radius of 150-200 feet! Not only that, but the residual radiation of an ENW is of very low weight and very little decay and as such will dissipate in about 100 hours!</p>

<p>The only thing that is particularly lethal about them is the radiation given off upon detonation (sometimes called &quot;prompt&quot; radiation). Initially a ENW will emit a tremendous burst of gamma rays and neutrons which are veryi lethal However, these particles will also be  absorbed by other matter within their range of 200-250 feet. Therefore, if you detonate these behind barriers or higher up off the ground (higher than 200-250 feet), human death from this &quot;prompt&quot; burst of radiation is very minimal.</p>

<p>Everyone seems to think that using a nuclear weapon will violently kill people much like in Sarah Connor&#39;s dream sequence in <em>Terminator 2</em> or spread long distances and contaminate some area for months or years like we think happened at Chernobyl (and it almost did). But none of this represents an accurate nor very complete understanding of what nuclear weapons exist and how much or how little they can create or cause damage.</p>

<p>Since you are up to speed on the evil ways of Israel, did you know that Israel detonated a nuclear bomb in Yemen about a year ago? Yep...it&#39;s true, and the <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/possible-tactical-nuclear-strike-neutron-bomb-in-yemen/5452876">article</a> discussing it was shared right here in this sub. In fact, while the information is not  quite indisputable, many believe that  numerous countries have detonated over 20 nuclear bombs in the past ~20 years. However, in every case, they were almost certainly ENWs and may not have differed <em>that</em> much from conventional weapons except in the the force of the closely contained blast.  We (the U.S.) may have even used some in Afghanistan (as a far more effective &quot;bunker-busters&quot;).</p>

<p>Read the bottom three articles in my above post... Because you misunderstand the nature of thermite/thermate/nanothermite (collectively just &quot;Thermite&quot;) and I think if you understand the capabilities of thermite, you will see why there are countless problems.</p>

<p>Thermite melts or cuts steel or other high tensile strength materials. But it does not rapidly expand the air around it like dynamite, TNT, or the air blast from an ENW, <em>so thermite alone could not have destroyed the twin towers.</em> If explosives such as those used in controlled demolitions were used <em>with</em> thermite, you could have destroyed those towers, but.. <strong>you could not have vaporized them.</strong> Yet that is precisely what happened.</p>

<p>We can talk more about it later though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree that&#39;s true. In fact that&#39;s how I looked at 9/11 for a long time...like a Bush family initiative. But lately I&#39;ve come around to seeing the much more major presence of Israel.</p>

<p>Also, while you and I could list numerous benefits to the U.S. government (with PNAC&#39;s <em>Project For A New Century</em> as their guide), there are a lot of reasons why 9/11 involved the World Trade Center buildings (1, 2, 3, 6, and 7). You need to remember that all of these buildings had a major asbestos problem. When the towers were built, asbestos wasn&#39;t just sprayed on over the structural frame, it was actually in the concrete mix (it was in brand of concrete mix called &quot;Perlite&quot; which in addition to concrete, contained asbestos, gypsum, and powdered volcanic glass). Given how the asbestos was so deeply integrated into the construction of the building, it was said that the estimated costs of asbestos removal for the twin towers <em>actually exceeded the value of the buildings</em>.</p>

<p>The NY Port Authority, which had owned the the WTC buildings for many years, had just lost a lawsuit which ordered them to proceed with a plan to remove the asbestos. But doing so would essentially bankrupt the project and be a tremendous financial problem.</p>

<p>But just as everything seemed bleak, who comes to the rescue? Larry Silverstein and his partner ride in and enter into a 99-year ground lease for the World Trade Center property and buildings. He bought a bad asset...which when you factor in the asbestos removal was a losing deal. So...as you likely know, 9/11 made Lucky Larry billions of dollars...And it also allowed him to develop cash-generating real estate by letting him rebuild a new modern office tower.</p>

<p>The most frustrating aspect of all of this (lack of transparency for American citizens) is that American tax money pays for information to be withheld from American citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read it, but plan to. It&#39;s the Judy Woods book, right?</p>

<p>From everything I&#39;ve heard, she gets everything in that book right, but her explanation isn&#39;t quite correct. Then again, <em>in a way she&#39;s right.</em> There is no way to focus a &quot;directed energy weapon&quot; from a satellite or from some other building, but a <a href="http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/basics/neutron-bomb.htm">enhanced nuclear weapon</a> (&quot;ENW&quot;) <em>is</em> also, essentially, a directed energy weapon, and if enough of them  were placed in each tower when detonated in sequence, they would be turned to dust.</p>

<p>Since nuclear weapon technology has <em>always</em> been classified, there are devices that conceivably could have been developed that don&#39;t even use a fission trigger (which had largely contributed to the lethality of ENWs in the past). In other words, the ionizing radiation could have been so small, especially if it was away from street level, and with a lot of other things to block it...that it would have caused just minimal radiation in detonation, and residual radiation would dissipate in about 100 hours.</p>

<p>You&#39;d still get the shockwave and thermal blast, but because it&#39;s a ENW, the range of this energy may only be 150-300 feet, which is just about the span of the WTC (say a 600&#39; circle blast...so you could &quot;vaporize&quot; one tower with probably 3-5 such devices, timed just like conventional incendiary explosives in conventional controlled demolition would be).</p>
