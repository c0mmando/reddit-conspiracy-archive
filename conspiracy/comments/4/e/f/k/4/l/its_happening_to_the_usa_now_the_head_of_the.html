The head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde appeared on CBS This Morning on 4/8 and started recommending internal US policies to make the IMF happy. Did you think they would only destroy Greece?</p>

<p>Its on the CBSN Roku channel.</p>

<p>I cant link to the video or I would have.</p>

<p>She started talking about her list of them and then Charlie Rose cut her off from saying them which I thought was interesting.  Charlie rose acts like a dottering freindly old man but if you watch carefully he actually expertly prevents the establishment from getting exposed.</p>

<p>Edit. Watched it again.</p>

<p>She argued against the breakup of big banks. (surprise!)
She argued against non big bank competitors (which they cast as &quot;shadow banks&quot;) and urgesthatthey be cracked down on (surprise ..no competition to the international bankers big banks is wanted!)</p>

<p>She said the US should follow the &quot;three pronged approach&quot; they recommend for all countries (like Greece so I guess its one prong up the ass. Another up the ass. And then have the citizens in perpetual debt)</p>

<p>And she argued against fair trade sanctions against the estblishments favorite nation of worker slaves China (surprise!)</p>

<p>Charlie even mentioned how something was part of their &quot;five year plan&quot;  ...right out of the totalitarian soviet union playbook.</p>

<p>And just remember... It doesnt matter what she recommends or what the policies are.   Its not her place to recommend anything.  </p>

<p>We can never let it devolve into a discussion about whether or not what the international bankers say is good or bad.    The international bankers have no right to suggest any internal policy for the united states.</p>

<p>In fact in my opinion it should be treated as an attack on us sovereignty just as an invasion would be with all the appropriate reponses both covert and overt just as if the international bankers were an attacking nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought Trump was splitting the Republican vote for Hillary.</p>

<p>I think Sanders is a personal opportunist, and his views clearly have limits.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they are broaching topics that Cruz, Hill &amp; Co. would simply ignore.</p>

<p>I think they are opening those conversations with specious intent, but at least the topics are in play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an issue when a millionaire(?) business man and a life long politician are the best choices for routing corruption in those same fields. I think the original plan was to allow them to run to gauge where the populace was at, I don&#39;t think the money that controls politics thought they&#39;d get such a large supporting movement so quickly. I think they under estimated how much the public is paying attention and wants change, I believe they were hoping for a more run of the mill election  where left argues with right and that&#39;s all that happens. I&#39;d love to be wrong, but I just don&#39;t see people who pour millions to billions of dollars towards controlling the outcome to be content with letting dogs into there race that someone isn&#39;t controlling. </p>

<p>The two party structure has done a great job fabricating the illusion of choice and it&#39;s quite impressive, if you ask me. If it didn&#39;t make me so sick to my stomach about the fact that these people who don&#39;t give  a shit about us(the middle and lower class) and would gladly sacrifice us all for one more day in paradise. They have us fighting their arguments for them, we fight and bicker and draw lines in the sand against one another all the while the rich get richer behind the curtain.</p>

<p>I may of gotten off topic but, thats how I feel about the whole &quot;election&quot;.</p>

<p>When/if Sanders gets elected, there will be zero resistance left to hold off the international socialist&#39;s club.</p>

<p>This is the end game and America&#39;s youth just can&#39;t wait to feel the burn of globalization.  They are literally fighting their little hearts out to tear our borders down, hand our sovereignty over and usher in an age of servitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>This in one of Sanders giant screwups. </p>

<p>Its why eventually those who support Sanders becuase of his anti TPP stance will come around and understand they need to be supporting Trump because you can&#39;t be against the TPP and for unlimited and illegal immigration.</p>
