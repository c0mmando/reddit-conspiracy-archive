       We need to start a revolution or a "trend" of being "disconnected" from social media and other big brother outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish that in a decade or so, the kids will think it's "uncool" to still be on social media. I'm hoping there will be a grassroots movement to abandon social media and go back to a life of "old school" low tech flip phones and just meeting up at coffee shops and pubs for a chat instead of staring at Facebook all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less tools for the governments and big brother, the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just more than angry with all the sketchy shit the governments around the world do to their citizens. Using Facebook as some kind of PsyOp  experiment, hacking webcams, smart TVs listening to families... I'm ready to go live in the bush and never look at a piece of technology ever again!
      </p>
      <p>
       /paranoid rant
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else feel the same, or am I on my own with this one?.. Is abandoning technology for our individual freedom, possible?

       If you want the freedom to choose without being bored, get a small farm.  I'm constantly busy; planting fruit trees, taking care of chickens, hatching turkeys, tiling garden, fixing equipment, digging well, fixing wells, and the dreaded mowing.  At the end of the day, I come inside and Reddit.  Right now I'm pooping, and par for the course, on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took all forms of digital from my kids recently.  No tv (movie family day on Friday, it was Star Wars, the new one), tablet, phone, games.  They're no longer fighting, screaming, or ignoring.  They're giggling, playing, cooperating, laughing, and back to being kids again. The girls sat in the recliner with me during the movie, where they had pretty much ignored me.  I think kids find an escape in digital world, one they're not prepared for.
      </p>
      <p>
       What precipitated this event was over a week ago.  While in town visiting my in laws, son constantly asks if we can go home.  Turns out he wants to play with the damn tablet.  He's already been limited to one charge per day.  Girls get home from school, fight on the bus.  Hair pulling, scratching, and biting each other.  Digital everything is gone, all they have is each other and pets.  Of course, the computer is available for school research.  They actually agree, their life is better without it.

       I thought about this afterwards, and forgot most places are stupid expensive.  4 acres, 1800sf home, 2 wells and a large workshop for 149k.  Some apartment buys are that much.  Not sure what that term actually is.

       <p>
        I commend you for taking an approach which most people scoff at. In the long run your kids will thank you for giving them the tools to learn and actually see life for what it is. I have six brothers and they have 13 kids between them; when we get together it's a nightmare.
Everyone of them is in a different corner playing on a phone, tablet or video game. The girls are obsessed with how many likes they can get on Facebook / Instagram while the boys are playing the new first person shooter game. It disgusts me on so many levels as their parents perpetuate the problem by giving in to them.
There is zero interaction and the most conversation I get from them is hello and goodbye. We created a world where no one knows how to talk with one another anymore and families have no clue what their kids are really looking at. The internet is a fucked up place if not monitored and the more room you give them the greater chance they start to develop a desensitized outlook on things. I don't have kids however I'll be damned if they'd have free reign over their internet usage. The amount of porn and violence alone is disturbing to me let alone a 11 yo. and it gives them the idea that this shit is normal. Kids should be doing kid things like fishing, baseball etc. Not finding out what a gangbang looks like. Every year I leave Chicago and go to the Smokey Mountains for 7-10 days and totally unplug. I camp in the back country and it's the best experience each time I go. There is something about nature that allows you to naturally regenerate your mind. We are so undaunted with work social media we tend to forget what our purpose is. u/ImWatchinUWatchinMe, I commend you for your approach. I wish I had the money to get some land down in TN and live that life and one day that is my goal. Best of luck to you and your family.

       They were more concerned with games than each other.  I involve them with everything we do on the farm.  I bought an expensive microscope capable of looking at the cellular level, art supplies, and involve them with hatching baby chicks.  It doesn't matter I have girls; "hey daughter, help me hold this whole I weld." Afterwards I explain to them why it works, and will supervise when they wish to participate in the more dangerous stuff.   They hug and kiss me goodnight ever night.  It all changed when they got tablets.  Saying the tv is evil is like saying a gun is always evil.  In the wrong hands, anything can be abused or misused.  You would be remiss to think that people don't have a problem with tech, as they sit at a dinner table with phones in hand.

       I came to loathe micro management in the military.  There are a plethora of studies showing how it stymies imagination and self reliance.  I try to give them everything within reason to pique their curiosity about the world around them.  There was a study recently about parents who intervene with child conflict, and the impact on their lives down the road.  Hands off parenting allows children to learn to solve their issues because we parents won't be around forever.  While I respect your opinion, I think you're wrong in this case.  Furthermore, there's very few blanket solutions in life, and we must discern the correct action in each scenario.  I deemed this to be the right one, and the desired result has been achieved.

       I feel absolutely refreshed when I'm in nature unplugged. I rarely watch TV or mainstream music/radio anymore and have zero social media. I understand your points, but I think people have to first be smart enough to see how this stuff is manipulating your brain. If you can do that, you can easily disconnect.

       It is, but I'm not posting pictures of the pancakes I ate for breakfast. I was more referring to FB, IG, Twitter, etc. where people get so consumed in this fantasy of what people are portraying and feeling they must continue with consumerism to fill that void of feeling less than.

       Let's be honest though reddit is no different. Instead of pancakes you're bombarding yourself with stupid shit posting. People want to pretend that because reddit is more words then picture it's informative but it's the same thing as Facebook just most people are behind screen names.

       The point (I think) is to not be plugged in
       <em>
        all the time
       </em>
       and advocate responsible social media usage in moderation and as a component (not the sole outlet) of what Americans used to call
       <em>
        leisure time
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       To abandon it altogether would be to discount and waste the best weapon we have to slowly influence the hearts and minds of those still plugged in and stuck in the Matrix that has been carefully constructed and tightened over the last 100 years (and most importantly the last 10 or so).

       I think there has to be something that hits home to people in respect to online privacy. In order for things to change, or for people to get mad enough at the government to start a paradigm shift. A lot of the exposure and news articles are of government leaks and Snowden's revelations. Most people don't think it can happen to them, and are too disconnected from it. Or they just don't care anymore because they "have nothing to hide"... Which is the attitude of most people I talk to.

       I forgot my phone one day at home, the 12 hour workday felt very strange, random fake vibrations in pocket, gloom feeling that everyone is trying to call you, important messages arriving.
      </p>
      <p>
       End of the day - a few missed calls from friends, not that important messages, everyone that wanted to check on me called someone else on my work and I got the message by voice, haha.

       This was before smartphones, but I went 6 months without a phone for a bit a while back, and it was totally a liberating experience. If anyone needed to get in touch with me, they'd come find me. It wasn't 'oh, bombs isn't answering his phone, I guess we'll just not include him' it was 'oh, bombs isn't answering his phone, let's go find him and ask if he wants to do x'. And also, because everyone else has a phone, if you reaaaallly needed to make a call, you'd just borrow your friends. It's supposed to make your life more convenient, but I think the amount it actually does that relative to the amount it just creates anxiety is telling. I have a cellphone again, but I'm sure if I ditched it, it would be the same thing today.

       This won't happen for a long time. I don't think there is a topic that I am more passionate about than this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a society we will continue to grow through the Internet and social media. We've become dependant on it. The fact that everyone will "follow" people that they are interested is only providing fuel to the trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snapchat, Instagram, Tinder, and a whole lot more applications are a testemant that social media isn't the only habit that is numbing the senses. Sex sells. You have these apps that the literal purpose is to allow easier "hook-ups", this was snapchats original purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The generations are changing as we get older, the youth now days were born to younger and younger parents so they follow these trends alot quicker than any generation before them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate what the internet has become. It is such a powerful tool, but unfortunately it is abused by the masses. We can't even blame big brother this time. We did it to ourselves.

       agreed.  as a start, I've been enjoying just turning my phone on friday afternoon and putting it on the shelf for the weekend... sometimes it stays off until wednesday... they tell me my business life will implode if I am not always connected to the tether, so I say, well, fuck them.  It is very wonderful to not have that fucking thing beeping at me all day, disrupting my attention

       Maybe it wasn't in the US, but I remember being told not to give up personal information and such when "learning" about the Internet in school. Which of course was well after we were already using the Internet, but at least I didn't notice this public hatred of anonymity and demand that everyone make themselves a target until I was already an adult.

       I am already living this life!  I currently:
      </p>
      <p>
       -- own a flip phone
       <br/>
       -- do not engage in social media except for checking for unexpected messages/events on facebook every so often (as long as reddit doesn't count as social media)
       <br/>
       -- have been living this life for more than two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't be happier.  My time is spent with friends who don't check their phones or pleasantly by myself while not checking my phone unless it makes noise.  I have an incredibly amount of time for writing, reading, sitting in meditation, hiking, cooking, exploring, loving, and dicking around on this bigger screen that doesn't follow me where I go.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of the best decisions of my twenty-nine years of life so far.  When people in my life realize I have no smartphone (which means no instagram, snapchat, twitter, pinterest or facebook presence, not to mention no gps which means I use my knowledge of the area or write down directions before leaving), there is no sense of alienation at all.  More often than not I feel a powerful sense of respect from their side, but it's rare that my lack of internet communication is noticed.  I think this is because I am a well-adjusted, attractive young woman who is fairly intelligent and I've worked to surround myself with people I can trust.  I don't need a smartphone or social media, and I definitely don't miss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's actually a huge community of us in Asheville, NC who engage in little to no phone use or social media.  Seems like everyday I meet someone else who lives a similar lifestyle.  Not trying to sound like a creepy advertisement, just genuinely happy with my decision.

       This is not what I'm talking about..
I'm talking about the governments using social media as a social experiment, spying and tracking people continuously. 
I use the Internet everyday, it's very helpful.
But "staying connected" and letting everyone know where you are at all times is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do something to get on the FBI's radar, they have no problem digging up your internet fingerprint and blackmailing the shit out of you with it. You willingly gave them your whole life's story, interests, friend networks and everything else about yourself...
Just by joining social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just really, really want to see an uprising and people get pissed right off at how the government runs things and controls people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be getting off topic, but it just boils down to ditching the tools the governments use to keep hold of the people and take away their individual freedoms and privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make the government and police WORK to get information. Don't just hand it to them willingly.

       I agree, and don't see the point of singling out specific forms of technology. To me Facebook is basically just "messenger", and I don't even use it that much.

      <p>
       People just have smartphone addiction. It's not the ability to constantly be in contact that's the problem, it's the feeling that doing so is necessary.

       Not that I support any of the things mentioned in the original post, it's futile, people are not gonna disconnect and the Government will always be gaining more and more control. The smart ones will not resist. It's just the way things go, life's not fair, and neither are the nature of things in society.

       Ha! The government.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not the ones in charge, not really. Governments don't make change. Their job is to keep things the same. Sure governments change the specifics of how they execute their monopoly on murder, rape and theft. In the end it's ultimately the same. Government lording over the common people, so the elite have financial stability and success.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bailouts are a recent famous example that illustrate the true relationship between government, people, and the elite. We're talking industry leaders. The richest of the rich. The people who own and control the natural resources. Gold and other metals, oil and other fuels, lumber and other plants, water, etc. You can't join the elite class. You're born into it. The pecking order has been well established for about 500 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is an insulating and protective layer for the elite. When the governments say they protect and serve people, they are talking about the elite. The government is designed to sacrifice itself for the elite. If you join the government you are ultimately singing on to die for the elite, not join them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, the whole "If you can't beat 'em join 'em" thing does not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it's a pragmatic short term band-aid to align with the government. You might be able to make the oppression softer in one place, if you get lucky. You still only have as much power as the elite allow you to have. You also owe too many people favors by the time you have any real power. Any good you do will mostly be undone. For example you'll have to take money from public services and send it to a business venture for managing a sweatshop that violates human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed the fastest way to change is to do it our selves, by doing away with government.

       I have no idea how to explain myself to some one who can't see the forest to the trees. I did not say if you can't beat them join them. I said the people in control seats have dedicated their entire lives to their careers and if you so strongly want change you need to devote your entire life to that career as well so you can sit in those chairs and make decisions. The laziest thing people can think is screw the government. Intelligent people can see that it is unwise to over throw. I think I'm wasting my time here . Your argument is all over the place and regurgitated from other like mindedness. If you care about educating yourself leave your echo chamber and except that your one consciousness and don't understand the average American nor the country you live in.

       You're saying it's stupid to over throw the government, so go be the government. That is perfect textbook example of the idiom, "If you can't beat 'em join 'em."
      </p>
      <p>
       You haven't supplied any logical rebuttal. Your response is limited to elaborating on your "if you cant beat em join em stance," and insults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really you have no argument thus far. Only an admission that you have no argument. "I have no idea how to explain myself..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you have no idea how to explain yourself because your position is logically flawed and your struggling for a way to make it look logical. In the mean time while you think you'll resort to insults to try and distract from the logical argument at hand.

       You know what Fuck it. Your reinforced perspective is trash. by branding people more well off then yourself as an unattainable level of existence your really just writing off the fact that you feel weak and small. Through branding and labeling your not accepting that no, your ancestors did not work hard enough and your not accepting that your stuck in the same rut they survived in.your trying to empower yourself for being small. And I'm sorry bub but not everyone deserves a trophy for participation in life. 
Just a final shit on your parade this pathetic pity party nonsense needs to die.

       What's funny is that all this negativity your directing personally at me is simply a refection of how you feel about yourself. Judging by your very emotional response, lacking any logical rebuttal, I've clearly hit a nerve in your psyche. Sorry for making you uncomfortable. I guess you must know exactly what I'm talking about, but you've probably internalized your oppression. Doing your best to align you self with those of that cause. Being reminded of that is probably very painful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was very specific as to what was unattainable. I don't care if people are successful or "more well off." They are not the problem. I'm talking about the landed elite who make it a point to squash everything below them. I stated that clearly in my original reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for lacking hard work. Success on the scale of the landed elite has nothing to do with hard work. The success of the landed elite comes down to them designing the rules of the game, not hard work. It's not hard work stepping on ants. They just got lucky being born where they are.

       I'm currently looking into getting a brick phone again, rather than my current smart phone. No longer have social media apps on devices and have to log into them (apart from one) when I open - this has reduced my usage loads. On fb, I've also unfollowed everyone I'm friends with. They can message me if they want, but there's nothing in my newsfeed so I don't spend ages looking at it anymore.

       I understand the sentiment completely. On an emotional level I agree with you. On a logical level, there is no going back. Living in the bush you'll realize it's polluted, and more barren than in the past. But it certainly is still doable. The skills learned in the bush are critical to sustaining provisions during the revolution. You don't need to live in the bush to learn the skills or practice though. A more adequate realistic practice is to be homeless and try to survive without interacting in the mainstream economy. That's practicing like you play, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best solution until the revolution is to use 'burner' electronics and accounts. This also muddles the system with erroneous data. Recycle old tech to help the environment just a bit at the same time. Very cheap, very abundant, and the capability to buy in bulk. Theoretically one could create a nonprofit organization doing this. This is why an education of some kind in computer information systems is so important because it allows the recycling of old technology to go far more smoothly and safely. Save your old tech and learn to hack it to give your self the greater privacy you have a legal and human right too. This way you can still receive the benefits of the information age as we transition into the robotics and nano ages. The tools are not the problem. We are.

       People are always going to want to check the weather, the news, their local diner, what time a movie starts, what time the shop closes, where the nearest place for a cup of coffee is, and i dont think this level of progress is necessarily a bad thing. Having a tool to regulate your day to day and everything inbetween is helpful. What we need to exemplify is how this tool or these tools can manipulate the fuck out of us to a dangerous level. We need to be educated on the in's and outs of our technology and how they can be used against us with physical evidence, and push more easy and user friendly encryption methods that can be adopted, as well as the education of what markets truly respect your privacy. To denounce a tool, with no regaurd to its usefulness is a dangerous path to walk. I think we need to do our own social experiments on facebook, compile evidence of manipulation, and let it be known.

       Already participating in this movement and have been for 3 yrs.  Not necessarily by choice.  All the celltowers 'dried up' because of the 'economic cutbacks' according to AT&amp;T.  You know, because Obama tells us the economy is doing well now.  I tried a walmart phone and it did not work even in town.  So I've been without a cellphone for a while now.  And facebook/twitter is for those unawakened people we talk about.

       Finally, I'm in Western NC high mountains and just today I planted another variegated lavender plant and some english thyme.  I've got a fully working perennial bed and today exactly I had my first 3 yr asparagus raw in my dedicated asparagus bed I toiled so hard on.    It was the single most flavorful, best asparagus I've ever had in my life.  It tasted like soveriegnty
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone should start gardening right now.  And the first things to plant are mary washington and jersey knight asparagus (female biased and male biased heirlooms), since it will keep coming up with very little effort from you...for 50 yrs.  Also plant everbearing strawberries on top of it and rhubarb on either side of the bed; all three are low maintenance perennials.

       You will get a bunch of haters making a joke of this idea, since you posted it on a social media type of site, though not as bad as FB.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a great idea, I make love making sarcastic jokes about ppl using Facebook, and can tell deep down that their addiction to it isn't ideal. I do think there is an underlying urge in a lot of people to quit, but can't take the plunge. Much like a cigarette addiction. People who smoke know it's bad for them, they can't argue otherwise, but it's not easy to break addictions. We need public opinion of social media to be on the same level as cigarettes. Fuck it, tax em too.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI I'm a smoker who permanently deleted FB over a year ago. I hope to end my tobacco addiction next, but I figured FB was doing more damage and took priority.

       I can only hope so. It would do our society wonders. Facebook is awful to look at on a regular basis. It can really mess up your perception of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most the "news" stories are filtered, click bate or advertisements made to look like news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most the trending videos that people repost are just sensationalize commercials to either sell you something, get you emotionally charged about something irrelevant or make you feel bad for some tiny little issue that probably doesn't exist.. Like a blind, no armed piano man feeding a bird that was bullied for its sexuality.. I don't know where they come from, but they're nothing but distractions and distort ones perception of the actual world by focusing on there very rare, irrelevant issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, all the post from people on your feed are what they want you to see. Every week they can post amazing pictures of themselves on wild vacations, only to find that they were taken years ago. That triggers a psychological reaction from people where they feel either competitive and jealous, or depressed about how unglamorous their life is in comparison. These are people you actually knew at one point until you just uploaded your friendship to the cloud and moved on. Now you think that they're living a perfect life while yours has all the struggles that actually make life what it is. You feel the need to post all the great things you do as to not be left behind, only to pass the sensation on to the next mindless scroller so they can repeat the process to their following.

       I do think the use of social media becomes dysfunctional over time... I realized the other day that I can barely sit still and not use my phone long enough to even follow a movie!

       If it is the latter, then social media/mobile internet is also a tool to acquire "better" information than the MSM..

       Well, I know I'm being spied on, but I write, and I get paid by the view. I'm probably on a watch list or some shit, but I don't give a fuck. I write to help other people, and I'll need to wait until I'm more established before I can get off of social media entirely.

       I think media has over-sexualized us to such a degree, with consequences so terrible, that it is hard to describe it outside of witchcraft. Remember when we were warned about too much TV and radio? They had no clue how right they were? Look at us now. Its mind control and sorcery both. Even conspiracy theory sites and the like are being invaded by Transcendental Meditation/Transhumanism ideology that uses technology and a scientific gospel to offer is the hope of becoming gods. DARPA has announced the hope of Transhumanism. Becoming a god is the goal of every practitioner of mysticism/magick. Before you dismiss me, consider nanotech and the philosopher's stone for instance. This sorcery is almost in our hands. The system works better than any other alternative for a beast system. The Baal Temple arch replica on Time Square, starting April 19tj (May Day) has me concerned that we are about to see a whole different world. I've spent time in this sub discussing the connections. I'm concerned that the conspiracy is larger than most of us will bother to research honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that David Wilkerson's 1973 prophecy, and his potential as a true prophet may come to pass, very soon. He gave other prophesie. Those all have been fulfilled. I think most trademarked preachers are Intel agents or assets. My eyes are becoming more open daily, and I have thousands of hours invested in this. A brief and abridged portion of prophetic happenings to be fulfilled in short order from DW is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       It will start with economic confusion in Germany, given that the official story is that the German newspaper retrieved the Panama Papers from an anonymous source and gave them to the cabal and CIA funded ICIJ. According to Wilkerson, economic confusion will spread from Germany to all over Europe. Then Japan will find itself in economic crisis. Next is the US, followed by Camada, and then the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The audio can be found on youtube. We agree that these people are into witchcraft, correct? So let's give the other possible team some attention. You deserve a full portion and clarity in the powers at play and you should learn about it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying this now because a time is coming when  people that stand in true opposition will be hated, beat, and murdered. The radicals aren't and will not be the unplugged nature crowd nor are they any Christian archetype that we know from real life. These people will be a thorn in the side of all that is the upper eschelon. After all, Satan's goal is to take Jesus' inheritance (the church). That has been the plot all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you are laughing at what I'm saying, but from a psyops perspective, you must admit that a eschatological hoax would be the key to world domination.

       The smart ones know that they must resist. The people can always rise up, but sooner is better than later.

       Thank you for the link. I agree with the position of the OP. When I talk to people IRL about these things, they usually become fearful. Some start cleaning guns. I hate to see such, because it is apparent to me that people with a weapons cache and/or survivalist food supply are targets due to martial law (making such things government property).

       You're post has me excited, I can't wait to see what's to come!
      </p>
      <p>
       Resistance is futile, better learn to consume, obey, and accept what's to come, than to fight it. George Orwell predicted total control from the Government, and if you read it to the end, you'll understand what an incredible power you are up against if you resist. It can not be defeated, so it's better to accept and join their side, than to fight it.

       I quit social media about 4 years ago and got rid of my smartphone for a flip phone 2 years ago. Before I became a parent it kind of sucked being the only friend without Facebook. I wouldn't hear about parties and events until the last minute because the only invites were done through there. Now it doesn't really matter and a few more of my friends have quit fb as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say flip phones suck to use compared to a smart phone. I wish someone made a nice touch screen dumb phone with a decent camera that didn't have all the apps. It's nice to not have the constant distraction in my pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have good internet at home and I'm guilty of browsing Reddit on my old smartphone on wifi at work though. I'd like to give that up but I'm not ready to quit the internet all together.

       I deactivated my Facebook, my Twitter, and the YouTube part of my Google account (to disable the commenting notifications for Thumbs Up, and to prevent myself from getting sucked into the YouTube trolls etc.), and I feel a lot better in day-to-day life, and my overall mental health has seemingly improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take everyone for their true personalities now, and don't really get any hints into their life through social media, so conversations also seem to be more natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't really get too attached to my smart phone, I just use it like I would a flip-phone, besides occasionally looking something up online while out and on the go (directions, online reviews for a book I'm checking out at the store, etc.)

       I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately and completely agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had a smartphone (android based) for roughly a year now, and while it is very helpful, I am frankly tired of the numerous updates I get and the constant interruptions in wanting to do basic tasks like text messaging and other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       My phone is constantly "updating," and it's quite frightening to have a device on you at all times with software on it that you're not quite sure exactly what it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the flip hone idea, people already do this, and I'm thinking about doing it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not necessarily abandoning technology, but switching from "high tech" to "low tech" in the sense that we strip off the fat and only keep what is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already don't watch tv that much, if at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use the internet all the time, though, so that replaces it. I find myself watching a lot of YouTube documentaries and other stuff far more than television.

       That's easy for you to call him out, but don't you realize that we all have lives so intertwined with modern society that it's very, very hard to just break 100% free from it? People have jobs and families. And it's not like you can live without a source of money in today's world, it just isn't feasible. Add to that your close relatives being not on board with you and it becomes a very hard task to achieve.

       I hunt, butcher, bake bread, and do all the cooking my house hold.
I garden, and chop about 10 cords of wood every winter at the cabin. We ice fish in the winter and head out in the canoe in the summer.

       I'm capable of living off the grid and away from technology. Electricity would be the biggest hurdle though.

      <p>
       This is about social media technology and limiting it in your day to day life. Not about living off the grid.

       Yeah this seems like an idea handed down from the Bilderberg meetings themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's encourage the only percentage of society that knows anything about anything to "disconnect" from social media and stop being involved in the goings on of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should promote this "return to nature" as a way of clearing opposition to our policies and reducing dissenting voices in the social media networks and internet overall while at the same time implanting our own agents who will disseminate the types of ideas and concerns that benefit the end goal of our agenda.

       I agree, and don't see the point of singling out specific forms of technology. To me Facebook is basically just "messenger", and I don't even use it that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       People just have smartphone addiction. It's not the ability to constantly be in contact that's the problem, it's the feeling that doing so is necessary.

       It's exactly the same situation as "guns don't kill people, people kill people".

       This is not what I'm talking about..
I'm talking about the governments using social media as a social experiment, spying and tracking people continuously. 
I use the Internet everyday, it's very helpful.
But "staying connected" and letting everyone know where you are at all times is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do something to get on the FBI's radar, they have no problem digging up your internet fingerprint and blackmailing the shit out of you with it. You willingly gave them your whole life's story, interests, friend networks and everything else about yourself...
Just by joining social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just really, really want to see an uprising and people get pissed right off at how the government runs things and controls people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be getting off topic, but it just boils down to ditching the tools the governments use to keep hold of the people and take away their individual freedoms and privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make the government and police WORK to get information. Don't just hand it to them willingly.

       Most of my peer group don't really use it often. I literally only have a Facebook to post a random picture of the kiddo for all the grand parents who live clear across the country.

       I'm 26 and a veteran. My peer group would be more closely to ex military than just the age.
