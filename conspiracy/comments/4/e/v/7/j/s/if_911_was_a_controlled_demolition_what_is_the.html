<hr/>

<p>The security company who provided security to the WTC was directly linked to the Bush-family;</p>

<p>(I googled &#39;bush security 9/11&#39;)</p>

<p><a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911security.html">Marvin P. Bush, the presidentâ€™s younger brother, was a principal in a company called Securacom that provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport. The company, Burns noted, was backed by KuwAm, a Kuwaiti-American investment firm on whose board Marvin Burns also served. [Utne]
According to its present CEO, Barry McDaniel, the company had an ongoing contract to handle security at the World Trade Center &quot;up to the day the buildings fell down.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is little or no evidence for any &quot;complete power down&quot; the weekend before 9/11. One person (Scott Forbes) has made a claim, but subsequently backtracked and <a href="http://georgewashington.blogspot.com/2005/11/interview-with-scott-forbes.html">admitted</a> he has no clue about the situation outside the handful of floors his company (Fiduciary Trust) occupied. On the contrary, there is <a href="http://www.911myths.com/assets/images/wtc_ticket2.jpg">a pic of a ticket</a> for the &#39;Windows on the World&#39; observatory, timed right in the middle of the alleged &quot;complete power down&quot;. </p>

<p>The Securacom story is also, at best, severely exaggerated. There is no real evidence they were ever &quot;in charge&quot; of security and their official SEC filings show <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/stratesec.html">their income from the WTC ended in 1998</a>. Marvin Bush also left his position with the company in 2000. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You throw an interview that actually validates a power down and claim it is evidence against it because he can&#39;t verify it was &quot; complete&quot;? That&#39;s an absurd argument just like Marvin Bush stepping down from an executives position is just as silly since he was a founding investor. He still has controlling interest in business and like in CIA you don&#39;t leave those type of companies those are lifetime CIA fronts. You also left out that they did the security for the facility the Anthrax used on the same weekend came from. The hole only gets deeper and the evidence just piles up only to be ignored. Your not even a good skeptic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim was, and I quote &quot;WTC CAMERAS, LOCKS, ELECTRICITY TURNED OFF WEEKEND BEFORE 9/11&quot;</p>

<p>There is simply no evidence for this. There <em>may</em> have been a small, localized outage affecting CERTAIN SYSTEMS belonging to a SINGLE COMPANY. But if the power was out to the entire building, as alleged it would have been noticed: it would, for example, have been closed to tourists. That WOULD have been noticed, certainly. And if that proves Forbes&#39;s central claim of a total outage to be false, why should we believe anything else he says?</p>

<p>Even if Bush was somehow still involved, you failed to address the fact that their financial records show that Securacom stopped working with the WTC three years before 9/11. There is NO EVIDENCE - again quoting the claim - they &quot;provided security&quot; at the WTC on 9/11. </p>

<p>What evidence, exactly, is piling up? You&#39;re joining random dots and claiming a connection, when half your dots never even existed. </p>

<p>*&quot;Austrian&quot; and &quot;German&quot; students but yea whatever you say fool. You do realize that the students could still be any ethnicity and have any number of background relationships with any country or covert agency. It&#39;s not hard and to make fake passports and documents.</p>

Indeed, the rense.com article specifically says: &quot;the Gelatin crew <strong>made up of up to 14 Austrian and German students</strong>.&quot; The source you claim supports you, actually says the complete opposite - and the whatreallyhappened.com article doesn&#39;t even mention Gelatin at all! </p>

<p>You do realize that the students could still be any ethnicity and have any number of background relationships with any country or covert agency. It&#39;s not hard and to make fake passports and documents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That wasn&#39;t the allegation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the completely unsubstantiated claim <strong>they were Israeli</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pleased you admit that you can provide absolutely no evidence for any claim Gelatin are Israelis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha your sources were just better? The links I sent you had plenty of offshoot links throughout it so I assumed three would be enough to get you started. There is much more to the story than just Gelatin, if you can&#39;t accept that then there is no point arguing. What do you mean it says the opposite of what I support? They weren&#39;t all Austrian like you stated, they were supposedly &quot;Austrians&quot; and &quot;Germans&quot; but that doesn&#39;t really mean anything realistically. I&#39;m sorry you couldn&#39;t grasp that. If you want to believe the &quot;Official Narrative&quot; be my guest, just realize that you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<li>There is no meaningful evidence of any Israeli connection to Gelatin.</li>
<li>There is no meaningful evidence of any Gelatin connection to 9/11.</li>

<p>Whatever the truth about the rest of the &quot;official narrative&quot; - which isn&#39;t the topic here - efforts to draw a line between 9/11, Gelatin and Israel actually show how weak the evidence is for the &quot;Jews did 9/11&quot; crowd, that they have to make up unfounded claims like the above. </p>

<p><strong>My quick compendium.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>WTC 1&amp;2:</strong> ACE Elevator Inc. was in the process of performing the biggest elevator maintenance/upgrade/modernization project in the history of the world.  Power was cut frequently during the 48 days Larry Silverstein owned the World Trade Center; additionally, the bomb-sniffing dogs were called off, yet guards armed with mp5 sub-machine guns were hired to guard certain <em>maintenance floors</em> and elevator shafts. </p>

<p><strong>Sidenote 1:</strong> The Port Authority had carried $1.5 billion in insurance coverage on <strong>all its buildings,</strong> including the WTC 1&amp;2.  In the 48 days Larry Silverstein owned WTC1&amp;2, him and his lenders had managed to insist on more, eventually demanding $3.55 billion in coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote 2:</strong> Larry Silverstein used only $14 million of his own money in acquiring the WTC Complex.  His partners, who include real estate investors Lloyd Goldman and Joseph Cayre, put up a further $111 million, and banks provided $563 million in loans.  <strong>The insurance payout ended up being $4.55 billion.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sidenote 3:</strong> William Rodriguez and his testimony regarding not just <em>what</em> he heard [in regards to what was happening on the maintenance floors on 9/11] but <em>how terrified</em> he was when trying to describe it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a major elevator renovation project at both twin towers that started in the summer. Instead of giving the contract to the major company that was in charge of elevator maintenance, it went to a much smaller company (which may or may not have had shady ties, I don&#39;t remember). Anyway, they were working on the elevators for months. The elevator shafts allowed direct access to the buildings&#39; central columns. So that explains how they got easy access to the columns. I&#39;ve seen this in a few places. I think one of them might have been 9/11: The New Pearl Harbor (great doc on youtube). </p>

<p>It has also been reported by eyewitnesses that there were large trucks seen coming and leaving the towers late at night in the weeks leading up to 9/11.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They planted the explosives into <em>decoy CAT5/6</em> cables when they did the <a href="https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/trade-center-cameras-locks-electricity-turned-off-weekend-before-911/">WTC IT upgrades</a>.</p>

<p>That would basically allow them to put the cables along each and every truss in the WTC since every office would be wired up.  </p>

<p>The IT people would consider it absolutely ordinary for some wires to &#39;not work at all&#39; to fail even continuity tests because it&#39;s ordinary for 5% of cables to simply have a bad connection somehwere (made in china).  They don&#39;t remove the wire because that&#39;s nearly impossible, it&#39;s bundled with hundreds of wires into a bundle thicker than your leg and ziptied together at regular intervals, and then fastened to run along the trusses.  The wires all look the same so there&#39;s no way to distinguish them.  They use continuity to mark both sides and if it fails, they just write &#39;x&#39; or &#39;dead&#39; on the cable where it comes down and out the wall to connect to a network patch panel, typically in a server room.</p>

<p>Or the decoy cable can even be designed to look like a regular cable and maybe even act like one too.  Or there needent be a cable, the explosives could be placed within the bundle during the upgrade and placed along the trusses, no one would ever know or look at them.</p>

<p>This is to my mind the simplest and easiest way they could deploy these explosives, since that is where a demo team would place them anyway.</p>

<p>EDIT: This would also allow someone to hook up the &#39;dead&#39; cables just before 9/11 and allow someone to denotate them over the network in a specific sequence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some very strong evidence that some may not have seen.</p>

<p>Israeli art students were staying in the 91st floor of the North tower during the weeks just prior to 9/11. They built a temporary balcony outside and planted boxes and boxes of fuse holders while doing a project called Gelatin or The B Thing. Here are some links. Including their own film of themselves and their boxes of fuse holders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Listen to everyone, follow none.&quot; - I mean you can double check her research and make up your own mind (what we should do in any case). I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that there&#39;s a reason for to lie for everybody and it doesn&#39;t need to be as nefarious as shilling for the government, but act and think your own authority.</p>

<p>There definitely is a reason to get into the arrested agents on 9/11 (the 5 dancing ones) as well as the art students that probably had something to do with the planting of bombs inside the buildings. Maybe it was just a &quot;security&quot; measure to blow up additional floors to ensure, the weight of falling debris was enough to pull the entire thing down.</p>

<p>But ofc you&#39;re right ... stay safe, don&#39;t believe everything, but also remember, that you should never lose trust in your fellow brothers and sisters, as that is exactly what they wished to achieve with 9/11. We still uphold great responsibility within our own communities and on a personal level. Love and light, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a conspiracy theory about that one that perhaps makes it a bit more benign.</p>

<p>I suspect that MANY potential military and terror targets are already rigged to minimize collateral damage, as sort of continuity tactic.  If there was a fear, after the 1993 bombing that the towers could topple sideways, the potential impact of that could be many times as devastating as it was.  They damaged several buildings, but there HAVE to have been risk analysis models that showed potential for them damaging many more.  My theory is that a &quot;controlled&quot; demolition was employed as strategy to mitigate that risk.  Much the way <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ihjg1/til_switzerland_is_rigged_with_over_3000/">swiss infrastructure was rigged with explosives for half a century to potentially defend from german invasion</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, admitting this would open a whole can of worms.  For one thing, it would mean that whoever was responsible for calling the pull was directly responsible for deaths of ~3000 people.  It&#39;s an insurance issue and even the most heroic version damages the credibility of the narrative.  Also imagine that there are other buildings like this still.  Do you really want people questioning that they&#39;re sitting on a potential powderkeg?</p>

<p>There&#39;s always the argument about how a large number of people would have to be involved in this conspiracy, but that&#39;s not really true.  THIS aspect of the conspiracy is where the most people would have to be involved, but on it&#39;s own there is nothing inherently nefarious about it.  It would just be a security protocol that was ordered to save thousands of lives (at the expense of others) and billions of dollars of infrastructure.  It would be seen to them as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good in the face of an attack.  It would not automatically imply an &quot;inside job&quot;.  Those &quot;in the know&quot; would be angered by that  implication while feeling that they bear the weight of considerable inside knowledge. </p>

<p>If my theory was true, this would probably be done on the books as a top secret security initiative.  But it would still be subject to some level of oversight, I would think.  That would mean that the 9/11 commission would probably be aware of it.  This would be post patriot act, but I would think that the commission would not be able to outright lie. SO what I would need to look for to confirm or deny my theory is whether the language around the actual building collapse is vague or specific enough that it does or does not specifically negate the potential use of controlled demolition. </p>

One of the subjects covered was why it was Code to insulate steel building structural components from fire, when steel obviously isn&#39;t flammable. Because in a skyrise during a fire, a chimney affect occurs and the structural steel melts compromising the integrity. Well known fact. You&#39;ve read about it. </p>

<p>As I was watching the towers burn on live TV at work amongst a crowd, I verbally predicted that they would collapse based on what I learned. I was scoffed at...until we watched it unfold. </p>
