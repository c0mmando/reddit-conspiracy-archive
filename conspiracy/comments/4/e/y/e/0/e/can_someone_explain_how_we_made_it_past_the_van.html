       I'm just curious as to how we got past them; I believe we went to the moon and all that stuff; but upon further looking; this seems to be a big problem; now I know NASA claims to have sent them to the smallest portion of the belt; but im still confused. Do we even know what the Van Allen Belt is capable of? Or is it all speculation as to what it is

       Not a direct answer to your question, but I always felt it was bizarre that when the Bush admin announced goal of manned moon mission in 2004, original timeline was given as 2018 (since extended to 2023 under Obama admin).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm certain not an engineer, but it just seems strange that 15-20 years would be required to repeat a feat we'd already accomplished multiple times, and with the benefit of decades of technological improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA also somehow managed to "lose" the original moon films.

       There are hours upon hours of primary video footage, hundreds of kilograms of rocks verified by hundreds of scientists of being lunar in origin while simultaneously lacking the fusion crust of lunar meteorites on Earth.  There are hundreds of audio recording between mission control and the astronauts, thousands of photographs, reflectors left on the moon by astronauts as well as third party verification of the landing sites by other space programs yet you consider all of this evidence "flimsy"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people seem woefully uneducated regarding the overwhelming amount of third party evidence verifying the moon landings took place.

       A lot of the videos of astronauts walking on moon, look like them walking in a studio, when sped up. It's comical how naive the average person appears to be.

       "Regardless of the differences of the flux levels in the Inner and Outer Van Allen belts, the beta radiation levels would be dangerous to humans if they were exposed for an extended period of time. The Apollo missions minimised hazards for astronauts by sending spacecraft at high speeds through the thinner areas of the upper belts, bypassing inner belts completely."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely to send spacecraft through only the thinner areas of the outer belts.[24][31] The command module's inner structure was an aluminum "sandwich" consisting of a welded aluminium inner skin, a thermally bonded honeycomb core, and a thin aluminium "face sheet". The steel honeycomb core and outer face sheets were thermally bonded to the inner skin"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah not really a huge problem because it was quick and they avoided the inner most belts. If they had stayed in orbit in the belt for days or weeks the electronics and people would likely have taken some damage from all of the charged particles.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Most of these links are probably worth less than a grain of salt here. But anyways here's a bunch of links on the science if you're actually interested in it. Prior to the mission is was heavily considered in both the functioning of on-board electronics and the health of the astronauts.

       His take on this from what I've gathered (it's like I'm trying to talk to a brick wall with this shit) . Is that if we never went to the moon; then NASA is a big conspiracy. All the pictures are fake, digital images. Go pro have fish eye lens. And basically we haven't been past this belt. So if they are lying about space; what's to say they haven't been lying about the shape of earth( why lie bout that?)
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes what his eyes see; and that's flatness. I've sent him to a link that is a self experiment so you can see the curve with your own camera but of course; he refuses to do so. I asked him how he feels about optical illusions because that's the eyes and mind playing tricks. He has no response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more curious about the Van Allen Belts. Because they do exist but what's the significance in space travel? Or anything at all. Just a bunch of questions I have on it. Conspiracy has to be one of my favorite subs and I figured y'all would have the answers.

       Yes we know.  We even sent a manned mission to loiter in the region where the belt is strongest for much longer than it would take to pass through them just to test the actual impact of the radiation.  Also, saying they went through the smallest portion doesn't really capture how much it varies.  It's essentially doughnut shaped, virtually disappearing at the poles.
      </p>
      <p>
       These facts don't of course prove a moon landing but they do indicate that these trips wouldn't cause the kind of instant death or guaranteed cancer some claim.

       It's all covered in a quite interesting piece
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDLFm-DRPQg">
        here
       </a>
       in a debate on Penn Jillette's show between Joe Rogan and Phil Plait who's an astronomer who's done work tangential to NASA projects and spends time discrediting weird astronomy ideas.  The debate itself of course doesn't reach a definitive result but it's quite funny and one of the few instances on such a topic where both people can fully and civilly air their side.

       They risked the Astronauts' lives. Not every day comes a solar wind event. But had it happened in flight, they'd have been dead men. As it stands, they did see flashes before their eyes as cosmic rays hit their retinas.

       <strong>
        Yes.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it completely outside the realm of accepted postulation sans vociferation to the possibility that the scientist who in fact theorized, analyzed, and ultimately aggrandized their existence into the research field of magnetospheric physics, which would grow to involving more than 1,000 investigators in more than 20 countries; 11 years prior to the Apollo 11 lunar mission itself -- that any amelioration whatsoever wouldn't come about in this time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there is deadly radiation in the Van Allen belts; this was hypothesized by the man after which they would be named. In 1958, James Van Allen had chosen to equip the Explorer 1 [the first satellite of the United States] with a Geiger-Muller tube, which would ultimately confirm his theory of radiation surrounding the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Van Allen belts span only about 40° of Earth's latitude -- 20° above and below the magnetic equator. The diagrams of Apollo's translunar trajectory printed in various press releases are not entirely accurate. They tend to show only a two-dimensional version of the actual trajectory. The actual trajectory was three-dimensional. The highly technical reports of Apollo, accessible to but not generally understood by the public, give the three-dimensional details of the translunar trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each mission flew a slightly different trajectory in order to access its landing site, but the orbital inclination of the translunar coast trajectory was always in the neighborhood of 30°. Stated another way, the geometric plane containing the translunar trajectory was inclined to the earth's equator by about 30°. A spacecraft following that trajectory would bypass all but the edges of the Van Allen belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side-note: In July of 1962, Van Allen himself addressed the American Rocket Society on radiation and Apollo. The protons of the inner Van Allen belt, he said, could be a serious hazard for extended manned missions. But, he went on, it might be possible to clear out that radiation by detonating a nuclear payload in the vicinity. The additional material might give the particles the extra energy they needed to escape the Earth’s magnetic field. America’s nuclear testing program of the early 1960’s was called Operation Dominic. Within this program was a group of atmospheric tests named the “Fishbowl” events designed to understand how nuclear weapon debris would interact with the Earth’s magnetic field in the event of nuclear war. The highest of the Fishbowl events was one called Starfish Prime. This test saw a 1.4 megaton bomb detonate at an altitude of 250 miles. Rather than clear out the inner Van Allen belt, Starfish Prime added more radiation around the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even with Starfish Prime, additional research into the Van Allen belts determined they weren’t a deal breaker for missions to the Moon [by 1969, the high-energy electrons injected into the lower Van Allen belt by the Starfish Prime event had decayed to one-twelfth of its post-test peak intensity]. By February of 1964, NASA was confident that Apollo crews would be passing through the belts fast enough that the spacecraft’s skin and all the instrumentation lining the walls would be enough protection. It might seem foolhardy in hindsight for NASA to have accepted the risks of sending astronauts through the Van Allen belts without extra protection, but it was a minor risk in the scheme of the mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       To monitor radiation exposure during the flights, Apollo crews carried dosimeters on board their spacecraft and on their persons; these readings confirmed NASA had made a good choice. Over the course of the Apollo 11 mission to and from the moon, the crew incurred ≥ .036 rem [roentgen equivalent in man], or 0.018 rads [radiation absorbed dose] which is far lower than the yearly 5 rem average experienced by workers with the Atomic Energy Commission who regularly deal with radioactive materials.

       Orbital inclination doesn't
       <em>
        necessarily
       </em>
       mean they bypassed the inner and outer Van Allen belts.  Depends on the timing of firing the S-IVB, as the belts are encountered immediately in the first seven hours of the 70 hour transit to the Moon.  So inclination or no inclination, they could still end up sweeping down through the middle of the belts.  Also, on return trip home, no matter what you do, you're still going to be sweeping through Van Allen on that last ten percent transit as the total trip and Earth and Moon gravity will flatten your original inclination dramatically, making the Earth approach more equatorial.

       If you make changes to a shuttle, you have to test it works.

       Did they need to? I heard an argument that we didn't need to go through the belts to get to the moon. I haven't deeply researched that claim.

       Thanks for all the replies! The video I've seen on multiple comments is the reason I even asked this question. I'll be checking out the links and stuff everyone provided.

       Unfortunately I was shown this video from a person who believes the earth is flat.

       Basically the belts are thin in some places, and thicker in others. It was a very short trip for the astronauts to get through the belts.

       They're completely full of shit. A third "transient" belt was discovered in 2013 that was allegedly destroyed by a shock wave from the sun, but they had no idea it existed until then?

       Isn't all of space awash in radiation?  I don't think the belts are the only problem.

       It's all fantasy.  Nasa is not what you think it is.  They generate so much wealth and have more to do with disinformation and military testing. A part of the big lie...shhhh.  People cant know where they came from.
