       <p>
        After growing pressure, Congress established the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, a joint inquiry of the two intelligence committees, led by Graham and Goss. Goss and Graham made it clear that their goal was not to identify specific wrongdoing: Graham said the inquiry would not play "the blame game about what went wrong from an intelligence perspective,", and Goss said, "This is not a who-shall-we-hang type of investigation. It is about where are the gaps in America's defense and what do we do about it

      <p>
       The bottom line is that Bob Graham and Porter Goss were with the man who paid for 9/11 as we were being attacked, also before that. The man was never seriously challenged about his role. Then Graham and Goss pointed fingers at Saddam Hussein and or the Saudi's, away from themselves. This is a tangled mess of links that together tell a story of treason.

       Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do - having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad's] task was to persuade Afghanistan's Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the following month [General Ahmad] was fired."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Times also revealed that on September 11 -- while the attacks were in progress -- the two current Co-Chairmen of the Joint-Intelligence Committee investigating the 9/11 attacks, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), met for breakfast with the ISI Chief who had ordered $100,000 wired from Pakistan to terrorist leader Mohammed Atta in the days immediately preceeding the attacks.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the FBI, Indian Intelligence and several press reports, the ISI Head was instrumental in providing financial support to the 9/11 terrorists. General Mahmoud Ahmad had allegedly ordered the transfer of $100.000 to the presumed 9/11 ring-leader Mohamed Atta.

      <p>
       How fitting that this is the same House Intelligence chairman Porter Goss who was having breakfast in D.C. on 9/11 with Pakistan's security chief, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad—who was later revealed to be hijacker Mohammed Atta's bagman.

      </p>
      <p>
       A Times of India (10-12-2001) story by Manoj Joshi revealed that Pakistani ISA Director-General Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after the U.S. attacks -- confirmed by top sources in India, because of evidence produced by India showing his links to Mohammed Atta, the terrorist hijacking leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Times said that "U.S. authorities sought his [Ahmad's] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh on the instructions of ISI Lt. General Ahmad." Senior [U.S.] government sources "have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief."

       On the morning 11 September, 2001, Goss and Graham were having breakfast with General Ahmad.[9][10] Ahmad's network had ties to Osama bin Laden and directly funded, supported, and trained the Taliban[11].

      <p>
       Was it an ‘intelligence failure’ to give red carpet treatment to the ‘money man’ behind the 9-11 terrorists, or was it simply ‘routine’?

       A bit off-topic but still related.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Warren Commission which immediately followed JFK's assassination was started by:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Lyndon B. Johnson (ex-VP, POTUS)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It consisted of some interesting characters:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Allen Dulles - head of CIA.
       </li>
       <li>
        Gerald Ford - later POTUS.
       </li>
       <li>
        John McCloy - President of World Bank, Chase chairman, Ford Foundation chairman, Rockefeller Foundation trustee, chairman of Council on Foreign Relations until succeeded by David Rockefeller. Had a long history with the Rockefeller family, while in Harvard they taught him how to sail.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       McCloy had doubts of the official narrative, until head of the CIA changed his mind:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Notably, he was initially skeptical of the lone gunman theory, but a trip to Dallas with CIA veteran Allen Dulles, an old friend also serving on the Commission, convinced him of the case against Oswald.
       </p>
       <p>
        He stated that any possible evidence of a conspiracy was "beyond the reach" of all of America's investigatory agencies, principally the FBI and the CIA, as well as the Commission itself.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Next up, the Rockefeller Commission. This one also investigated the JFK assassination and the CIA's illegal domestic activities. This is the commission that publicized MKULTRA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rockefeller Commission was created by:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Gerald Ford (POTUS) and Nelson Rockefeller (VP)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Can you guess who censored the report and redacted the 86-page section on CIA assassination plots?
       <em>
        Dick fucking Cheney
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The changes included removal of an entire 86-page section on CIA assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by then-deputy White House Chief of Staff Richard Cheney.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay now fast forward a bit to 9/11 - good old Dick Cheney and the Halliburton war machine. But what's he up to now?

      <p>
       Dick Cheney (ex-VP), Jacob Rothschild, Rupert Murdoch (owns News Corp) and James Woolsey (ex-CIA director) are on the board of directors for an energy company looking to extract oil from the Golan Heights. Where's that located? Right between Israel and Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where am I going with this? No idea, but it's damn interesting.
