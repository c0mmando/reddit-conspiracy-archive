       I'm going to give you the long answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three ways to coordinate the activities of a group towards a goal. We are taught two of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, you have management. This is hierarchical, and it requires authority be divested in a manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you have coordination. This is hierarchical or heterarchical, but it requires the selection of coordinators. These coordinators must be given some authority, by virtue of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, you have harmonization. Harmonization requires no structure or authority, and it requires nobody coordinating the group. To my knowledge, every group I've come across tries to organize, rather than harmonize.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is not with the effectiveness of organization under laboratory conditions... the problem is that whenever you select a structure that centralizes ANYTHING, it becomes a primary surface of attack, and with enough resources, you can take down any such group.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative community wants to embrace leaderless structures, but they don't know any... so they fail.

       If I understand correctly, if a group if “harmonized”, every single individual in the group  should essentially govern themselves. Because that's the only way I see a group could work without hierarchy. In such way, all that is needed to make change happen would be within every single individual in the group. So in a way, the individuals would work from their own unique perspective to things. The question is, how can you have enough unity in such setting? Would the individuals simply gather based on shared ideals united with a common goal?

       Harmonizing is just concerned with getting people into small groups (3-7'ish), which are centered around tactics. Those groups are quite often organized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall Goal: Get John McAfee Elected.
Tactics (this week)
1. Multimedia - Focusing on Hillary
2. Direct Action - TwitterStorm #RebootTheSystem
3. Direct Action - Door knocking
      </p>
      <p>
       Selected Goal (3. Direct Action)
21 groups total. 12 groups looking for more.
G1: Seattle, WA - Weekend Warriors
Needs 3 members. Location Bound. Coordinated. Lazy. No prerequisites.
G2: Memphis, TN - Weekend at the stadium. 
Needs 1 member.  Location Bound.  Uncoordinated. No prerequisites.
G3: Making a how-to video for door-knocking.
Needs 1 member (video editing)*
       <em>
        .  3 week project. Scheduled. Strict.

       </em>
       You have video editing listed on your skillset.
G4: ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Groups are as organized, on the cell level, as they need to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       These groups cannot be said to be acting "on behalf" of the coordinators, because the coordinators are not generating the tactics... they are only providing the tools and a minimal scaffolding of structure to allow groups to organize themselves.

       For people to "govern" themselves requires a very uniform and united population. There must be the same race, the same culture, the same religion, the same history. If you don't have that, you are not going to get self-generated concord.

       Why? I don't understand, can you elaborate?. Only requirement I see needed for such unity is internal monarchy. People can still be different but they need to work hard internally to achieve such indepence from outward rulership.

       This is something I wrote up for Luke Rudkowski:
"Why does social game theory matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you dream of a libertarian, anarchist, socialist or capitalist society, it behooves you to understand the mechanics of how groups come to decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do it right, you will harmonize activity toward a variety of individual goals. If you do it wrong, then the simplest task can become a political struggle. People are not naturally cooperative or competitive… they are both. Most systems treat people as primarily one or the other, but you have to treat all groups of any significant size as if they are made up of members with varying degrees of cooperative and competitive motivations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not understand how to harmonize a group, you will be left with organization, which will invariably become the job of the wrong person. Every child should be taught how to harmonize a group. Organization requires structure, responsibility and guidance. Harmonization is an information catalyst, alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes about by asking the foundational questions of a group in the correct order, collecting the information, and tabulating it, so people can see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where social game theory comes in… because every question you wish to gain the answer to has a variety of ways to arrive at that answer. Some of these ways are highly manipulable, in ways that are truly insidious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a question… a very common one, which is seldom correctly answered.
I've got an audience of ten thousand, and I want to do whatever I can to allow them to have the greatest impact on what I am concerned with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a question of organization. The direction comes from an authoritative source, and someone like James Corbett can easily organize his audience to sign a petition or attend a rally. However, social game theory allows us to ask a different question, for which the answer is much more powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got an audience of ten thousand, and I want to do whatever I can to allow them to have the greatest impact on what they are concerned with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a goal with no need for direction of any sort from above, or from a centralized source… but without that single source, what does everyone do? Activity is harmonized by coincidence of desire. Harmonization is simply a process by which opinions and desires are asked and collected. That is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you collect the data, and distribute it, the job of harmonization is done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social choice theory, social game theory… collaboration theory… they are baskets of tools with which one can solve any social problem or perform any social task. For harmonization, the technique is very simple. For an audience of ten thousand:
You can imagine this process with sticks and stones… pen and paper… or websites and digital certificates… the technology does not matter. The precise way you collect and tabulate the data are all that matter.
    1. Collect a list of passion areas: Federal Reserve, General Corruption, Climate Change, Money In Politics, Education.
    2. The participants then start suggesting activities. They must choose a category, and then the suggestion is recorded and placed in the list of activities in that category.
    3. All other participants can see the list of activities, and they can signal their support for as many of them as they wish, and that is recorded.
    4. Next, each person picks an area to focus on for the week or month, and joins or starts a group, or works independently.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't direct people whether to get into groups of 3 or 12 or 7… each person starting a group simply states how many people they want to coordinate with, and what, specifically, the group is intended to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is harmonization. It is all about information. It doesn't matter who introduces it, even. It requires only tools and understanding of the process… which is pretty dang simple. Once people are on a project, they may seek to coordinate activity, or they may just remain harmonized.
You don't have to have rules like, "Groups will meet once a week." All that can be handled organically. Some groups and some tasks benefit from heterarchic organization, but that is task dependent. Whether groups are formal or informal, and whether any responsibilities are generated from the harmonization… that is dependent on the circumstance, and social game theory has a lot to say on how to effectively coordinate without causing chaos. Groups can move freely back and forth from harmonization to coordinated activity in an organic manner, as needed. 
Harmonized activity tends to generate a multitude of projects that could not ever be effectively coordinated, and these projects have a greater total effect than any single coordinated activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part… it is an attack from a thousand directions. It is guerilla activism at its finest.

       Also, I have to apologize a little. The word, harmonization, isn't a real, stable, coined phrase. This technique is uncommon, and many people think they independently came up with the idea, and they gave it their own name. I did the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I taught people about voting by "Greatest Common Consent" versus "Choose a favorite"... for about six years... and then someone told me they were called, "Approval Voting" and "Plurality Voting".

       I've done the same type of verbal butchery to "Harmonization" as well =P

       C.W. Mills is a good place to start, kinda similar with the logic of organizing a collective thought effciently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, many civil rights activists take on his logic (also many political leaders as well) Saul Alinsky, known for one strategy of taking individuals from minority groups, oppressed groups or any group with the potential for being oppressed then teaching them techniques for leadership that way they can properly voice the needs of their community, therefore creating positive representations for their community further inspiring progressive work to continue through every generation. In theory ;P

       I studied social choice theory and collaboration theory for about five years, really intensely. From that five years, I got about 10 tips about collaboration that aren't common knowledge. This one is as simple as what I just wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is an example of harmonization. Even though their mechanisms for anti-gaming are at the pre-school level, Reddit still serves as a powerful tool of harmonization. It fits this category because people simply state an interest (
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ), and then anyone can post and vote. The weaknesses in other areas retard its true potential, but harmonization is something you can't effectively fight. It is REAAALY expensive, and controlling Reddit is really expensive for them... and it only works 70% (throwing out a number).
      </p>
      <p>
       Harmonization along tasks would work very much like Reddit. You would post an action. It would include the google hangouts meetup time, the general action, and a signup list. It would randomly or explicitly form small groups, and it would have a way to vote on stuff (like mods have)... other than that, it's just a flavor of Reddit.
You might be interested in the entire field of social choice theory. Or you can read my book =P

       Nice summation. How do you think human laziness comes to affect the concept of harmonization? Would it play a part? Say you get into a group of 3, and you manage to come up with an agreed upon goal. How do you get there, if not for organization? If there is simply a coincidence of desire, then the concept of a timeline for completion must be erased from the realm of thought and possibility.

       Organization can occur, as needed, in smaller groups. It is entirely appropriate for some tasks. Slackers creating art for a campaign might have no coordination. It might just be a social quorum to discuss ideas informally while people work independently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harmonization is the process by which you get people into these smaller groups, to organically organize to the appropriate level, at a scale where organization doesn't provide much overhead (3-7 people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lazy people in such a system are benefited by putting, "I'm Lazy" on their group request. Only other people who are lazy will join, but 3 lazy people can be brought from 0% productivity to 5% productivity by simply having direction, and importantly:
The feeling that their contribution is noticed and felt, and this is guaranteed in a small group.
      </p>
      <p>
       For harmonization along a goal such as, "Get Libertarians Elected", you WILL have MANY people start groups that have strict rules, by necessity.

       I understand where you're coming from, but the results I see are compartmentalised echo-chambers ripe for "guidance". A lot like reddit, I guess.

       It is a lot like Reddit... with many of the strengths and weaknesses.

       Harmonization is not intended to shift opinions or to uncover truth. You can harmonize a group of assholes around a single goal, and use it to deceive. This is, in fact, happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is perfect for CoIntel. You break people into independent social units as the first step. These small groups of 3-7 people are usually going to jump on something like google hangouts to meet up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is NOT a cure for echo chambers, but there are cures for that, too.

       I think there is nothing to do, metaphysical forces are at play, the long winning force of capital (which appeared as soon as we started trading) is being overcome by the force of truth thanks to the end of the information bottleneck, you can help it along if that's your thing, but really there is nothing to do, the grain of sand will turn into a massive unforgiving rock by itself. The only way capital force stops it is by taking full control of the internet or nuke it. Just pick a path and try to stick to it.

       While I understand your view and agree with it, I feel such attitude xan easily become an excuse for not taking action. I do have the feeling that things are somehow “predestined” to be this way, as if due to divine will. But then again, how could I really know such a thing? I know for a fact that if I put my effort into something I can manifest it in reality and perhaps help other individuals who've been less fortunate. I really feel hopeless about this grand mess that is going on here. Nothing depresses me more than knowing how much better things could be for everyone (eg. “free energy”) but there's a force that wants everyone to suffer.
