       Let's start with 911. It was planned before the towers were built. September 11 is the true birth date of Jesus Christ. America (the corporation) has had 8 bankruptcies since the turn of the century and is entirely foreign owned. The elite worship ancient gods and demons, conduct ritual human sacrifice, and operate a global ring of paedophilia and human slavery. Humans have been cloned for quite some time now and all of Hollywood and the music industry is one huge system of mockery and deception, more paedophilia and demon worship. The music industry is entirely a creation of the military industrial complex and television is literal mind control on several levels. Our food and water are purposely poisoned, particularly in ways that weaken and inhibit our own natural abilities. We are free ranged slaves for a select few and we see nothing more than the shadows on the cave walls. 
The earth is flat. God is very much real. Politics is more of a charade than Hollywood. It is all theatre, none of it is real. Your figureheads are selected, not elected, and the whole thing is just a pantomime. Everything is an inversion, Orwell or Satan, you pick. Bill hicks never died, and he plays Alex Jones now. Michelle Obama is a man. Paul McCartney was one of the earliest public examples of a clone, but the shit they do with clones is mind-blowingly fucked up. The one thing that keeps most of them silent is the fear of what the public would do to them if they found out. You have to be inducted into Hollywood through sacrifice, generally of a close family member. You have to get 'gravy, baby' to get into the music industry - basically filmed being gangbanged, a few of the tapes have even made it into the public domain on liveleak and similar places. GB Senior was one of the G-men who killed Kennedy. Man has never been to the moon or even beyond the firmament above us. The sun is not millions of miles away, but more like 300 or so, the sun and the moon are the same size and literally function as a clock. We fuck up our calendars specifically to make it seem random. Moonlight is different from sunlight, and is cold. The phases of the moon are not the result of reflected sunlight whatsoever, but are functions of the massive timepiece above our heads, and it all functions for us.
       <br/>
       This is a test, a polarity experiment. The only thing that really matters in this life are your interactions with others. By doing so, you are putting parts of God back together. This is all God, all of it. Every last atom and substrate is a part of the fractured essence of The Divine. We are encouraged though ego to only see the separation, but the connection is where the sublime resides, and where we realise our true potential as part of that Grand Divinity. Magick occurs in the reattainment of our place in the cosmos as an aspect of God through recognition and reciprocation; not merely being, but being together. We truly make reality.

       This post is a perfect refection of what is happening on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I Agree with the whole 1st paragraph, this paragraph show the writers critical thinking, enlightenment and true questioning of the corrupt monetary system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subsequent text shows how the shill planted topics posted on this sub such as flat earth and mechanical sun pray on people who's minds have been opened and are looking for answers.

       The realistic truth, is the one where the LEAST amount of humans would be included in the secret and lie to everyone. 
Astrologists, astronauts etc,  all lying???
Or just some asshole with a page on the internet....?

       So you agree with the entire first paragraph, discussing the reality of God and the deceptions surrounding the concept, including the idea that we live on a plane(t) which orbits on an axis of 23.4 degrees? If we were however on a plane (sans 't') that measurement would of course be 66.6 degrees, but that is just a coincidence, I'm sure. It is not like that kind of deception would be dangled in your face your whole life. You are too smart for that.

       All religion is based on ancient Egyptian worship of the sun.  Research this or watch zeitgeist or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mind is always open ready to accept new truths backed up by facts. I learn something new every day and old beliefs can be completely dropped when presented with factual science based argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was once tempted by the flat earth distraction, and upon deep rabbit holy research, ZERO scientific facts are present.
The fact that our planet orbits the star at an angle has absolutely no relevance in proving that this is some sort of flat plate and huge mechanical arms manipulate a giant sun and moon on our horizon that project heat or cool.  (this heat/cool bit shows real basic lack of understanding energy)

       If you are suggesting I look at Zeitgeist we are not playing even pool, but I will nonetheless respond. I am more than familiar with radiance and convection, and while I am not about to use reddit as my CV, I would instead ask you to do a simple experiment and go outside. Full moon is best, but any sufficiently moonlit night will provide grounds for your own experiment. Philodox (half moon) waning or greater is more accurate obviously. Now here is where is gets really complicated: go stand in the light. Then, go stand in the shade. I have a dual laser thermometer that can tell you the same damn thing but seriously, go outside and actually do it for yourself. If you are right and I am wrong, then you will at the very least get some Vitamin D reflected which is better than what you are getting from the screen you are arguing from behind.

       What's the worst that can happen? Your realise that you've been lied to all your life? Meh. Think of how the cows feel. You are just special cattle.

       My comments actually come from a place of love.  As corny as I know that sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take ur arrogant, defensive tone as a sign you feel lost, and deep down confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at this type of 'conspiracy' in the same light as aliens, lizard overlords. Or god.
In that it has absolutely no relevance. To your life or everything around us.
Just another distraction to stop you from thinking about how you could change this world.  Just like religion, tv, sports etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth is flat!!  Ok.  Well done.  Now what?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem on earth is the unbalance.  The earths natural resources belong to everyone but are being kidnapped and destroyed by evil people.  So evil they have brainwashed so many.  Divided and distracted us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when people awaken from the facebook, tv  bullshit and stumble onto forums in search of answers and direction we should focus on realistic goals of changing the system, spreading awareness and saving the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not jumping in and out of a shadow to prove.....  That the earth is cube!!! 
What a serious load of absolute nonsense.
If you spend ur life thinking about this I promise you will regret it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please focus on things that matter, and don't scare off people looking for answers.

       Indeed, we should do all things we do motivated by love, nothing corny about it. As to any defensiveness in my tone, I would imagine be due to the fact that we are not sitting under an olive tree engaging in the Socratic method of discourse, but arguing largely anonymously on the internet. Any arrogance, I am afraid, is just me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of relevance, I believe you are missing one very large consequence of such a revelation: this is all for you. Far from a meaningless something-from-nothing emergence of goldilocks conditions and chemical soups, your entire existence is basically an experiment in a snowglobe. Your choices matter. It is not the binary dichotomy you have been led to believe between good and evil, as both aspects are part of creation and therefore God. You are a creature of polarity and every choice you make is an opportunity of sorts to put a small part of divinity back together. As you do so things become more ... obvious, for lack of a better word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggested you try the simplest of moonlight experiments because you chose to bring up that particular point as a point of contention, arguing according to the physics you were taught in about year 9 and have never since questioned. I offered you a simple, free and quick experiment you can conduct for yourself. Your argument in response does not so much even address the idea or suggest flaws in the methodology of the proposed experiment, but instead to rail that even the conducting of such would be a waste of time?
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, that experiment would not prove anything regarding the dimensions or structure of our plane/t, but would suggest only whether or not moonlight is incalescent.  Your largest sensory organ is all you really need, just feel the light on your skin. If your cognitive dissonance rails at the idea of conducting experiments for yourself, then I would suggest that your belief in science is more akin to ontical fideism and superstition than the sceptical curiosity demanded by verifiable experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as to the "now what"? Well that should be pretty simple: accept the glorious privilege of the mantle bestowed you by the Cosmic Conatus itself and take responsibility for your own contribution to existence. Recognise that the very concept of ownership is an inversion, as we are but custodial care-takers to everything we interact with. It is 'selves' all the way out, and all the way down, and responsible existence functions foremost through a recognition of that selfhood inherent in everything, and a mutualism of respect for all other such selfhoods. So the 'now what' is entirely up to you.

       Sir, I very much enjoy these conversations, however you and me are not on the same page.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this talk of divinity, glorious privilege of the mantle, cosmic conatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are disconnected from reality sir.  This is similar to brainwashed person who watches the matrix over and over and starts to assume it is how the world works.
Disconnected from nature.

       Humans are just a species of animal.  We live the same way, breath the same air as any animal on this planet. (give or take)

       I have witnessed the creation of life in my children, witnessed the end of life in the death of loved ones.  I have studied multiple religions, the 3rd eye and astrology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are but mammals.  Because we developed consciousness we arrogantly believe we are part of some grand plan, some higher power.  And the twisted evil mafia of this world will encourage this spiritualistic view as it fosters a disconnection of responsibility.  We are not responsible.
  'its not meant to be'
'will be resolved in the next life'
'have faith'
      </p>
      <p>
       We are but intelligent animals.  And we must do all we can in our one time only life, to improve and evolve things for future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else is a distraction.  Even if your right, its still a distraction.  And a pointless one.

       I assume you mean to misquote (yourself, presumably?) in meaning to say 'muddy.' Namaste.

       Well just for the record, no, I am not a mason. I have been approached on three occasions in my life and have had the same response every time. I am happy with the idea of discussing ideas but I do not swallow platters of dogma biscuits as is demanded by religion and secret society alike. I am not a Christian, but a follower and believer in Christ. Subtle distinction perhaps, but one worth making. I also didn't really see your original post as being a contribution to anything further than your own ego, but if it must be appeased I am happy to do so. If you would like to continue the discussion I would be happy to do so through private message. Namaste.

       Sorry, I didn't mean to offend based on my observations. My ego is not at stake here, humanity is. I have to disagree about the flat earth though and hope you get past that disinfo.

       The Allegory of the Cave is not used to describe the human condition as you use it here. It's a way of articulating the stark difference between the enlightened and unenlightened.

       It is the Simile of the cave, book 7 of The Republic, and is more properly metonymy than allegory. And yes, it is a metonymical description of the state of man as enlightened versus unenlightened. Other than being able to identify the parts of speech we are both employing, we are both in agreement, but you somehow felt the need to point out or agreement while displaying your ignorance of the language you employ in so doing. Thank you for your contribution. Namaste.

       TL;DR - JESUS "CHRIST" Never existed, and there is NO Historical evidence that proves such.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible was copied from the Egyptian 'Book of the Dead',
      </p>
      <p>
       The cross was taken from the "cross" of the Zodiac,
      </p>
      <p>
       and Jesus was most likely modeled after Osiris. Although there are plenty of figures who share the same attributes, which are ASTROLOGICAL in nature.
