       The Clintons have gotten to Seth Rich's parents (Joel and Mary) and have completely silenced them.   It is obvious to see the before/after of when the order of silence took place - immediately after Julian Assange made his announcement regarding Seth and his possible link to the Clinton's emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to that announcement, his parents spoke freely and lovingly about Seth; immediately after Assange's announcement, the Rich's were silenced and only a Democratic spokesman (
       <strong>
        Brad Bauman
       </strong>
       ) would speak for them and would do so disparaging any and all people who believed of the Clinton's involvement (with Bauman calling these people

        "nutters"
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at this timeline of Daily Mail articles:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3685119/DNC-staffer-27-dies-shot-multiple-times-4am-Washington-DC.html">
        July 11:
       </a>
       Joel and Mary talk lovingly about Seth; for example, his mother Mary saying
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "Our son may have had a short life but he had a very wonderful life that he smiled and enjoyed."
        </em>
       </p>

        July 13
       </a>
       :  This was the Daily Mail's headline (emphasis mine):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         EXCLUSIVE: DNC staffer's
        </em>
        <strong>
         <em>
          father tells
         </em>
        </strong>
        <em>
         how his son, 27, who 'wanted to make a difference' was on his cell with his girlfriend when he was murdered on a deserted Washington DC street as family attends his funeral

        August 4:
       </a>
       Seth's parents continue to call out for help in finding his murder:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Mary Rich has appealed to the public to help catch her son's killer
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Aug 9:  Julian Assange announces the reward for information/capture of Seth's killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3726250/Enemies-Hillary-Bill-say-27-year-old-murder-victim-Seth-Rich-suspected-leaking-DNC-emails-belongs-Clinton-Death-List-people-ties-couple-died-time.html">
        Aug 10:
       </a>
       <strong>
        Immediately after that,
       </strong>
       Joel and Mary Rich are silenced and are no longer allowed to speak to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       They now have to have a spokesman speak for them.  This spokeman is
       <strong>
        Brad Bauman
       </strong>
       , who is a
       <strong>
        Democratic operative.
       </strong>
       This is his current position, per his
       <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradbauman">
        LinkedIn page
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <em>
         Managing a crisis communications and full service public relations firm
        </em>
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         Providing strategic communications advice to Democratic candidates and labor unions
        </em>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Brad Bauman has turned the narrative from finding Seth's killer to that of disparaging the current coverage:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Outrage at Julian Assange for implicating murdered DNC staffer in email leak and offering $20k reward
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         'Some are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good,' a spokesman for Rich's parents told Daily Mail Online
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Once again, the Clinton's have silenced people they don't want to talk.  This time it is the parents of murder victim Seth Rich - Joel and Mary Rich.

       Great work! CtR has released their hold on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       as of this am 8/11. I wonder if their focus will shift to directed issues such as the Seth Rich murder. Watch for CtR then to jump in on this thread to discredit what OP claims.

       They are already posting tinfoil hat none sense on this sub. I shut one post down the other day. I called them out, got scolded by the mods for calling him a troll, but it was way too obvious. The account was less than a month old, had 5k post karma, mostly crazy tin foil hat stuff. They are trying to discredit this sub and its subscribers. Be wary.

       I noticed a definite change on r/politics since 8/10. I figured it was because they clearly turned the knobs to 11 after Trump's 2nd Amendment comments and then realized they had been way too obvious and went way overboard. It was a total joke. Maybe something else caused them to release their r/politics bear hug though.

       This is some serious damage control.
I feel it is only a matter of time before they start attracting the wrong kind of attention.  The credible kind.  darknet is starting to light up on it.

       If certain donors start pouring into wikileaks and other places they could be looking at some serious conflict.

      <p>
       Some of the donor confidentially and highers are out in the open from the DNC leaks.  If it was me on that side, I would be very nervous.  They are making enemies with a lot of people out there.

       The DNC probably threatened to kill the parents as well if they ever talk to anyone. Unbelievable. The DNC killed their son and are taking them hostage to get Hillary elected. And yet this is totally fine and not an issue according to the FBI, DOJ, and all of the mainstream media. Everyone needs to see this. Now.

       Nice post brother. It really touches base when you show Mary seeking out help to find their son's murderer and only after Julian offers that help does the script get flipped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself; who would go from asking for help in finding a murderer and when that help comes (5 days later mind you) the help is shunned away? It doesn't add up at all. Good job ppinting this out; i hope a lot of people see this.

       I was listening to NPR and the story of Seth Rich was being discussed in a way that was so biased it was sickening. The host kept saying that the local police were investigating the "failed robbery" and everybody should just let this poor man rest in peace by inferring that those who suggest the DNC had anything to do with Seth's murder should feel ashamed. Basically don't worry guys, the DC police are on the case!! Conspiracy theorists are CCCcRRAaAZZzYYy!

       Does anyone else find it a strange coincidence that Assange, after four years of asylum, could NOW be pulled and questioned for a sexual assault charge? One day after his claims? Guess he pissed someone off! He better be careful or he might be committing suicide in the back of the head with his left hand, even though he's a righty.
