       Did not go well. Pretty much shunned me, I'm 16 and they just said stuff like "we have 50 years of experience here blah blah" and weren't even open to the idea of it possibly being done by someone other then the "terrorists". I don't see how people can't just open their eyes to the massive amounts of evidence that stack up against it.

       You're going about it wrong.   Your parents are the conspiracy theory proponents.  They believe that 19 arabs plotted in secret to sneak attack the US.   In fact you'll note that they believe hundreds of impossible facts, based only on faith in authority, and not in objective evidence.
      </p>

       If your parents want to talk to me anytime, I've got your back.

       Bro 100% pm me pls. I was talking to them and they kept saying stuff like "stop getting into those CONSPIRACY THEORIES" putting lots of emphasis on those words. Which Is probably evidence of media brainwash over their 45+ years of existence.

       It absolutely
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       evidence of their brainwashing. Most people are rational but are just massively uninformed. You just need to go about it the right way and show them how their kneejerk "conspiracy theorist/theory" label is literally part of the government's tactics (specifically the CIA) to keep the lid on real government conspiracies. You can easily look this info up and even print it out. All you are asking for is a brief minute of their time and attention so you can present a few of your best arguments, and if they love and respect you, they at least owe you a few minutes of their time. I've made the mistake of falling into the trap of sounding like a panicking lunatic because I get so passionate when talking about such a serious matter, but just try to remain calm and rational, and the truth will do the rest. The truth is on our side, which is something the other side does not have. People are good at recognizing sincere truth so use it to your advantage. Good luck friend.

       Yeah I make the mistake of sounding like a lunatic and can get quite heated when arguing things I'm passionate about. But yeah I need to master the calm passive approach and let the non passive arguers come to me.

       Decades and decades of grooming and propaganda. I know it's difficult but you gotta put yourself in their shoes. Imagine not having access to vast amounts of information like you do on the Internet. Imagine decades of reading the paper, listening to am news radio, watching cable news. You'd be just as brainwashed as your parents. I'm sure your parents are great people but like most older folks (including mine) thy still have blinders on. They were groomed that way.

       eh before 9/11 it was the moon landing. There were always things to question and most people don't question them. I don't think more people have taken their blinders off, it's about the same.

       Yeah man this is exactly how it feels. I feel like I can't even talk to them about this stuff because they are so stuck up in the system they've been taught their whole lives that they can't see anything else. And it sucks it really sucks, I'm glad I was given an open mind like this.

       Don't get discouraged my friend,  for a 16 yo you're way ahead of 90% of your peers.
 Keep on seeking the truth and forming your own opinions. The only way to be awake in this world is to look at a vast amount of information and sift through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't watch network news at all as it's  controlled by people who have an agenda not in your best interest.
Keep on seeking the truth and you will find yourself.

       I'm in my 50's and there are more like me than you can know.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same, I also face these blank faces. It knows no age, demographic, religion...for some, it is just too much to
       <em>
        deal with
       </em>
       and they're too pressed with just getting by in the daily grind!

       There was a moment that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       were fortunate to see 9/11 under your own volition, for whatever reason you went looking. Do not stop seeking!

       Stay in school. Be respectful, considerate and hone your critical thinking skills and the Rules Of Engagement!

       Thanks for this man. Sometimes I feel like I'm nothing in this world and my existence can't change any of the problems we face today, but then I realise I'm one of the few that question what we are presented and that we our job is to wake our people up and show them the light.

       My 75 year old friend and I (65) both acknowledge 911 was an inside job. So much of anyone's world view is based on their assumptions. If you assume govt and mainstream media can be trusted your palette of available beliefs is limited. If you assume the opposite you are open to a wide range of beliefs. You can follow the evidence, not simply buy the story.

       Well done. Don't try to convince your parents. Your reasoned, calm approach to any discussion with them is the best argument you can make.

       My dad also freaks out. Tells me he knows Bazant personally and they've been over it. He tells me it's complete nonsense and thinks I'm cray cray for questioning it but when I asked how many buildings fell that day he said 2!  UGH. I really think 9/11 is a lost cause to find the truth in.

       They use his paper as proof of a natural gravity collapse - he completely ignored newtons laws of physics. But his was the main explanation used. NIST only attempts to explain the start of the collapse but then point to his paper for an explanation for the rest of the collapse. He is front and center of the 9/11 propaganda machine. He will need to face justice and the resultant penalty - which for treason is death.

       there is 'accessory after the fact', that could be used to mop up a lot of the 9/11 lesser minions, and esp their 'marketing' buddies online in forums.

       Bazant is the most ridiculous theory.   You can look at the video and see that there's no block to crush down the building as it is disintegrated in air.   Also, there is so much energy in destroying the building that there is hardly the possibility it would be from a gravitational crush-down crush-up.   And then there's building 7, which Bazant wouldn't touch with a free falling 8 story pole.

       You don't have to convince me I'm hook line and sinker on this conspiracy theory.  However, I know how futile it is to talk about this subject to people who refuse to think about any alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is I can't get into the physics of it since I know I know shitall about the subject, however I know 3 buildings fell in exactly the same way, 3 planes were on their way but only 2 made it. It's simple math.
      </p>
      <p>
       One major concern for me in the theory is the amount of people who need to be in on it and no one spoke out?  That shoddy vid of the taxi driver does not cut it for me.

       the number of people that need to be in on it?  not as many as you'd think thanks to 'compartmentalization'
      </p>
      <p>
       the milgram experiment results demonstrate how easy it is to get people to do evil things based on authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       people did speak out.  people like John P. O'Neill.    People like Barry Jennings.    Who was there left around to rat out that didn't have a stake in it?    There are plenty of first responder reports that include explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Building 7 is easy to understand even without physics.    Either the collapse was progressive (as the government claims) or it was instantaneous (as would happen with explosives)
      </p>
      <p>
       We can all observe (even NIST agrees) that the building fell at 'free fall acceleration' for over 8 stories.    This means that there was ZERO resistance for the whole building to fall through (as we see)
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to remove all resistance and achieve free fall known is through well timed and placed explosives.   There has never ever been demonstrated a gravitational fire caused collapse of a large steel frame buiding, and never will be.  Nobody even tried to model it.    Buildings were not redesigned to account for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we work in steel deathtraps that could melt and fall at free fall acceleration from fire?  I hope not.

       I used to tell people that the police in my country were staging fake terror.   First they ignored me.   Then they ridiculed me, saying I was mentally ill.   Then some actually fought me.   Then last Friday the police were caught staging fake terror.  250 RCMP involved in a fake terror incident that would have sent a half-witted couple to jail for life.   The news came out on a Friday long weekend, but it still came out.   You will be vindicated, like I was.

       Most parents and older people are relics, bro.  Fuck'em.  I know they're your parents, but don't depend on them to know or understand what's really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I say this as a person who's probably closer to your parents age than to yours.  I'm
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       old enough to be your father.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, don't worry about the fact that your parents don't understand.  They're old - and most old people are too set in their ways to understand much other than the super old falsehoods they had indoctrinated into their heads long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure and be a critical thinking individual and be unafraid of inconvenient truths regardless of what age you are.

       I'm glad I was given the gift to critically think but then again I feel as if everyone can, it's just breaking through. Maybe some are too stuck in their 'own perception' to escape.

       Most of us are to some extent or another.  We're all kind of "stuck in our ways" in the sense that, more often than not, we think what we think, and we think it's actually
       <em>
        right
       </em>
       .  We don't purposefully set out in life to have incorrect mindsets, so we tend to justify whatever it is we think regardless of how ass backward or incredibly ignorant it may otherwise be.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be wrong.  Even if we totally are.  It takes great strength and mental/emotional discipline to be strong enough to go "Yeah.  That was incorrect thinking in that regard right there." and then change your mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it's so very important to check and recheck the things you research - and be ready to discard almost any perception you may have almost regardless of how cherished it might have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, easier said than done though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also all the more difficult when you live in a world such as this one where you have at least a dozen different opinions in every which way for any particular topic, and almost every one can be a wordy, intelligent, well-thought-through justification for just about anything and any different mindset...patently false and incorrect as it may otherwise be.
      </p>
      <p>
       And often you won't find out any particular thought is false unless you're really able to cut through the bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway...Enough blabbing.  I've talked too much already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep your head up, and remain diligent.
      </p>

       You'll learn as you grow that you just won't be able to be yourself around some people. It's tough but it makes it even better/warmer when you meet somebody randomly who is in the know. You'll learn how to ask careful probing questions to know what you can and cannot talk about. Cognitive dissonance sucks.

       Most people in the world don't believe that the official conspiracy theory is accurate.  They don't even have any evidence of 19 hijackers in those airports that day.  not one credible photograph.   all you'll see is a photo from another airport (portland) and an undated one from dallas could have been any day.    19 ghosts - leaving behind magic passports and jihad manuals.. lol.

       Ask your ma and pops about Stalin and how that regime killed more than Hitler (~20+ million - Slavs). Then ask, if that government did, what makes you think our government couldn't? They ask, we couldn't. I respond why? Do you know the government personally? Do you know anyone in government? They say: "no". There is your hook.... The government is not the people, but narcissistic, murderers.... Will take time, but bring up relevant history....

       Don't worry about convincing your parents. Their opinions don't matter much. Most people, by the time they get that age, have made a compromise with life and settled into a routine that they will maintain until the end. And that's that. You and your peers are the future. Keep your focus there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, less than 30% of the population believes the government's theory about what happened on 9/11. You're not the weirdo. Even if someone doesn't agree with you in public, they
       <em>
        most likely
       </em>
       have their doubts in the privacy of their own hearts. If they don't, that means that they are "true believers", and there's probably nothing you can do to convince them otherwise. Oh well.

      <p>
       We
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       that the Bush administration covered up the people that were actually being 9/11, the Saudis, and instead used it as a reason to invade Iraq (the recently released "28 pages").
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the government was in on it, or knew it was going to happen is unknown, but we absolutely know that they covered up the true people behind the attack in favour of attacking a country that had nothing to do with it.

       It's a process that for some can take years, just send them little bits of information that can slowly open their eyes. Some don't want and never will open their eyes, and it is out of your control, but even those that eventually wake up, can take a long ass time. Don't be too pushy, it takes time, one step at a time.

       Your parents, my parents... They're irrelevant. They'll fall in line when we show them the new way, they're all terrified of the world and are aching to be able to acknowledge that they don't know what's going on.

       We fix this by sidestepping them all coz we're from the fucking future.

       In psychology, there's a "thing" (notice I'm clearly a highly skilled in the field, ha) which states parents will never truly accept new knowledge from the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see this many times when the parent says they have more experience, but might be using outdated thinking or don't have new knowledge. Part of it's an age gap, the main part however is just as a parent, you subconsciously know you're the teacher to the kid, not the other way around. There's an immediate resistance to new information.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I eventually and slowly converted my parents over to a more "prepper" like mentality, but they're not fully in. They still have almost all their money in stocks, but do believe there's more than what meets the eye. They've significantly cut back on mainstream media news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably dropping a bombshell like you didn't wasn't the best way to go about it. Sure, you'll meet resistance. You have to understand they have 50 years of being glued to the TV and newspaper for their only real news sources. Even the internet is relatively new to people like that and most don't surf Reddit (although some do) or other underground news sites.

       I have found that asking questions works better than telling someone what is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try asking them "How can two airplanes flying into two steel-framed buildings cause
       <em>
        three
       </em>
       steel framed buildings to collapse in their own footprint?" Then ask how a steel framed building that was not struck by an airplane could fall into its own footprint at freefall speeds. Then show them a youtube clip of building 7 collapsing.
