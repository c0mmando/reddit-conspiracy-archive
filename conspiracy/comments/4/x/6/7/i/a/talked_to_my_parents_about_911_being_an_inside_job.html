    <div class="md"><p>It absolutely <em>is</em> evidence of their brainwashing. Most people are rational but are just massively uninformed. You just need to go about it the right way and show them how their kneejerk &quot;conspiracy theorist/theory&quot; label is literally part of the government&#39;s tactics (specifically the CIA) to keep the lid on real government conspiracies. You can easily look this info up and even print it out. All you are asking for is a brief minute of their time and attention so you can present a few of your best arguments, and if they love and respect you, they at least owe you a few minutes of their time. I&#39;ve made the mistake of falling into the trap of sounding like a panicking lunatic because I get so passionate when talking about such a serious matter, but just try to remain calm and rational, and the truth will do the rest. The truth is on our side, which is something the other side does not have. People are good at recognizing sincere truth so use it to your advantage. Good luck friend.</p>

 Keep on seeking the truth and forming your own opinions. The only way to be awake in this world is to look at a vast amount of information and sift through it. </p>

Keep on seeking the truth and you will find yourself.</p>

<p>Life is going to change, in my estimation, very rapidly in the very next few years!</p>

<p>You serve those around you best by staying awake! </p>

<p>My roommate was losing it with me with all the 9/11, Boston Bombing, Aurora and then the Hebdo shit show hit...</p>

<p>I&#39;m a steady shooter, the roommate knows Firearms and ballistics. Humoring me, I played the video and it was an HOLY SHIT moment! Sent the Sandy Hook stuff via email and the ghost expression the next morning was gob smacking! </p>

<p>We&#39;re still struggling with the US/Israel entanglement via Religion and Politics and the 9/11 issue is just too much...loving this person is more important! </p>

<p>Never forget to Love deeply where you eat, laugh and sleep!</p>

<p>Your childhood is over. </p>

<p>Cherish this moment where you know your freedom has some shelter for a little bit longer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 75 year old friend and I (65) both acknowledge 911 was an inside job. So much of anyone&#39;s world view is based on their assumptions. If you assume govt and mainstream media can be trusted your palette of available beliefs is limited. If you assume the opposite you are open to a wide range of beliefs. You can follow the evidence, not simply buy the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bazant is the most ridiculous theory.   You can look at the video and see that there&#39;s no block to crush down the building as it is disintegrated in air.   Also, there is so much energy in destroying the building that there is hardly the possibility it would be from a gravitational crush-down crush-up.   And then there&#39;s building 7, which Bazant wouldn&#39;t touch with a free falling 8 story pole.</p>

<p>The thing is I can&#39;t get into the physics of it since I know I know shitall about the subject, however I know 3 buildings fell in exactly the same way, 3 planes were on their way but only 2 made it. It&#39;s simple math.</p>

<p>One major concern for me in the theory is the amount of people who need to be in on it and no one spoke out?  That shoddy vid of the taxi driver does not cut it for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the number of people that need to be in on it?  not as many as you&#39;d think thanks to &#39;compartmentalization&#39;</p>

<p>the milgram experiment results demonstrate how easy it is to get people to do evil things based on authority.   </p>

<p>people did speak out.  people like John P. O&#39;Neill.    People like Barry Jennings.    Who was there left around to rat out that didn&#39;t have a stake in it?    There are plenty of first responder reports that include explosions.    </p>

<p>Building 7 is easy to understand even without physics.    Either the collapse was progressive (as the government claims) or it was instantaneous (as would happen with explosives)   </p>

<p>We can all observe (even NIST agrees) that the building fell at &#39;free fall acceleration&#39; for over 8 stories.    This means that there was ZERO resistance for the whole building to fall through (as we see)   </p>

<p>The only way to remove all resistance and achieve free fall known is through well timed and placed explosives.   There has never ever been demonstrated a gravitational fire caused collapse of a large steel frame buiding, and never will be.  Nobody even tried to model it.    Buildings were not redesigned to account for it.  </p>

<p>Do we work in steel deathtraps that could melt and fall at free fall acceleration from fire?  I hope not.</p>

<p>Most of us are to some extent or another.  We&#39;re all kind of &quot;stuck in our ways&quot; in the sense that, more often than not, we think what we think, and we think it&#39;s actually <em>right</em>.  We don&#39;t purposefully set out in life to have incorrect mindsets, so we tend to justify whatever it is we think regardless of how ass backward or incredibly ignorant it may otherwise be.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t <em>want</em> to be wrong.  Even if we totally are.  It takes great strength and mental/emotional discipline to be strong enough to go &quot;Yeah.  That was incorrect thinking in that regard right there.&quot; and then change your mindset.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s so very important to check and recheck the things you research - and be ready to discard almost any perception you may have almost regardless of how cherished it might have been.</p>

<p>Again, easier said than done though.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also all the more difficult when you live in a world such as this one where you have at least a dozen different opinions in every which way for any particular topic, and almost every one can be a wordy, intelligent, well-thought-through justification for just about anything and any different mindset...patently false and incorrect as it may otherwise be.</p>

<p>And often you won&#39;t find out any particular thought is false unless you&#39;re really able to cut through the bullshit.</p>

<p>Anyway...Enough blabbing.  I&#39;ve talked too much already.</p>

<p>Just keep your head up, and remain diligent.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In psychology, there&#39;s a &quot;thing&quot; (notice I&#39;m clearly a highly skilled in the field, ha) which states parents will never truly accept new knowledge from the children.</p>

<p>You see this many times when the parent says they have more experience, but might be using outdated thinking or don&#39;t have new knowledge. Part of it&#39;s an age gap, the main part however is just as a parent, you subconsciously know you&#39;re the teacher to the kid, not the other way around. There&#39;s an immediate resistance to new information.</p>

<p>With that said, I eventually and slowly converted my parents over to a more &quot;prepper&quot; like mentality, but they&#39;re not fully in. They still have almost all their money in stocks, but do believe there&#39;s more than what meets the eye. They&#39;ve significantly cut back on mainstream media news.</p>

<p>Probably dropping a bombshell like you didn&#39;t wasn&#39;t the best way to go about it. Sure, you&#39;ll meet resistance. You have to understand they have 50 years of being glued to the TV and newspaper for their only real news sources. Even the internet is relatively new to people like that and most don&#39;t surf Reddit (although some do) or other underground news sites.</p>
