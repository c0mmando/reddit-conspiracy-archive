<p>Has anyone considered that wikileaks is a limited hangout/ CIA honeypot and the entire point of it is to &quot;control&quot; leaks?
Has anyone actually looked at the Clinton leaked emails? As far as I saw there was nothing there that could actually indict Hillary for anything. So what if (here&#39;s my conspiracy theory) wikileaks was set up in order to create a &quot;safe space&quot; for whistleblowers... but it&#39;s really a trap.
When a leaker came forward with the Clinton emails, they felt they could trust wikileaks. Wikileaks then leaked only enough information to get people excited without actually revealing anything we didn&#39;t already know (limited hangout) or anything that is actually useful in a court case.
Of course, keeping the REAL important files secret would tip off the leaker that wikileaks was compromised so to solve that they simply give his name to agents who murder him.
But it doesn&#39;t look good if wikileakers are killed so to keep up the charade Assange comes out and acts upset over this death and basically tells the world that this guy was the leaker.... only he never directly admits it, only skirts around the issue. In other words, he wants us to know it without the words being spoken. Why? Because if the words are spoken then that will be used in an investigation for this guys death. It can be used to grant seizure warrants, etc. So just let the public know without giving anything law enforcement could possibly do anything with.
Now Assange has effectively distanced wikileaks from the murder. So we all assume Clinton killed him (which is true enough) but we don&#39;t connect wikileaks role as the honeypot. And no information is actually provided which is DAMNING.

The only figure in this whole imbroglio who&#39;s actually the real deal has been absolutely rotting in prison w/the key thrown away and exactly zero MSM time being spent on them (on purpose).  Meanwhile all the wikileaks figures and everyone even tangentially associated with it have been made into practical rock stars w/all the constant press, MSM time and frickin&#39; <em>movies</em> made about them.</p>

<p>And think about it for a second.  Exactly NONE of the Wikileaks information has been <em>truly</em> damning - damning in the sense that it&#39;s really revealed anything that wasn&#39;t already known or strongly suspected before.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all controlled opposition.</p>

<p>All except the one who&#39;s been silenced, ridiculed, marginalized, and tortured in prison.  He/she wasn&#39;t part of the plan.  So TPTB are <em>really</em> laying the punishment down hard in this case.</p>

<p>And Manning leaked through... wikileaks, no less. I had forgotten. So that&#39;s one wikileaker rotting in a cell, and another rotting 6 feet under.</p>

<p>Yes.  It&#39;s been kind of asinine to trust them from the jump.  However, so many people seem so desperate for <em>anything</em> that will take the elite down without the citizenry actually having to do any actual work that they (the people) will take almost any limited hangout bait TPTB throw at them and go <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/10/7b/89/107b89d4775c46602d0a48eef3a4bfa4.jpg">&quot;Yeh!

    <div class="md"><p>Assange is being sheltered in the Ecuadorian embassy.</p>

<p>Ecuador is a tiny, powerless country that is all but a client state of the US. If the US wanted to shut down Assange, all they would have to do is call up the Ecuadorian President and say, &quot;give us Assad&quot; and he&#39;d be in handcuffs on the first plane to Washington DC.</p>

<p>So, apparently, Assange is useful to the US where he is doing what he does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this.  Both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden seem to me to be little more than two parts of a PTB limited hangout plan designed more than anything to get the citizenry to &quot;fear big brother!&quot; more than ever before.  Neither have revealed anything <em>really</em> damning, and all they&#39;ve done is simply get people more scared w/how much power the government and the three letter agencies really have (even though they have a <em>lot</em> more than anything Assange and Snowden have revealed or come out with).</p>

<p>In a sense, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good thing as well that this information has come out, however, even if it is in the form of a cointelpro limited hangout because it at least helps some people that were <em>really</em> in the dark open their eyes a bit to just how much power some of these groups have, and the extent to which they use that power for nefarious purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one possible ascept of WikiLeaks, if not of the whole organized leaking, one should definitely think about. In public perception WikiLeaks became kind of an authority - which to me is an indicator for the fact that scepticism is necessary. Let me emphasize that I&#39;m talking about alertness, not demonizing or prejudice. Same with the Snowden narrative. Most people here on /p/conspiracy don&#39;t like to think about a second layer beneath the WikiLeaks/Snowden phenomena - but to me it is mandatory. If in the end I&#39;m wrong - fine! But this thing is too big.
So what I assume is: the stuff they&#39;re leak is true but  it&#39;s limited and its release is being timed. They&#39;re boiling the frogs. Maybe I&#39;m wrong. If I am it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden is also limited hangout, for sure.</p>

<p>Thing about wikileaks is they still push &quot;the narrative,&quot; for example Assange scorning 9/11 truth. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right; wikileaks has become an authority in the same way Infowars became an authority. I hadn&#39;t looked at it quite like that, but it&#39;s naive not to. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if we should assume what they leak is true though... I&#39;d personally assume most of it is- but wouldn&#39;t it be the devil&#39;s playbook to slip in some lies as well? A little poison at a time, as well as suppressing the truth deluge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t think snowden is a shill.... i don&#39;t doubt CIA sometimes tries to control the leaks and does them themselves but you don&#39;t need a whole wikileaks to do that... all they have to do is call a reporter and give him some info to write about</p>

<p>same with wikileaks ... cia wants to leak something? why not send it to assange anonymously and have him write about it? same effect and you don&#39;t need to control the whole of wikileaks</p>

<p>and snowden did leak a few interesting secrets, so why would NSA want that released? unles of course it&#39;s completely irrelevant and depreciated technology for decades, i seriously doubt they would willingly leak business practices they still use</p>

<p>but who knows, all i knows is, I don&#39;t trust anything any politican says, not just in US, in EU it&#39;s the same story, they&#39;re all corrupted lying bastards, every single last one of them.</p>

<p>The speculation was that Kubrick had identified the guy that pimped out his kids - IIRC.   I think in the final movie it was an Asian?  I&#39;d have to go back and check.    Anyway, I recall reading/hearing that the guy was identifiable as ZB and that&#39;s why they took out Kubrick.      </p>

<p>The thing that most convinces me is the resemblance, more so as he ages.   The government connections to the cult don&#39;t seem to be unlikely either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks showed there was collusion in the DNC and exposed the weapon &quot;rat line&quot; from Libya to Syria. This is not in the best interest of the coming unelected global governance.  This post is classic disinformation that is being upvoted by paid political operatives.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s disinfo.  Wikileaks deserves the moniker of limited hangout in the opinion of many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if it&#39;s disinformation it&#39;s not intentional. Please show me a specific document wikileaks has provided which showed us information that was not previously available and then show me the resulting actions of said leak. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking you with an open mind to show me why I should trust wikileaks. </p>

<p>edit: If it helps, I&#39;ll disavow Clinton. I&#39;m no fan, I&#39;m just open to the possibility there&#39;s more than one monster in the closet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden is also limited hangout, for sure.</p>

<p>Thing about wikileaks is they still push &quot;the narrative,&quot; for example Assange scorning 9/11 truth. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right; wikileaks has become an authority in the same way Infowars became an authority. I hadn&#39;t looked at it quite like that, but it&#39;s naive not to. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if we should assume what they leak is true though... I&#39;d personally assume most of it is- but wouldn&#39;t it be the devil&#39;s playbook to slip in some lies as well? A little poison at a time, as well as suppressing the truth deluge.</p>

<p>Admit, I had never entertained, nor even heard <em>smatterings</em> about this!</p>

<p>Any links or is this just original theory? Quite interesting now that you&#39;ve pushed my buttons, fucker!</p>
