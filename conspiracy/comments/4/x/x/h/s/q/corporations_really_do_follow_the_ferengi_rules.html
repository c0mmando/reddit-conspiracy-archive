       The New World Order began as a way for nations to trade and avoid big disruptive wars and after a few dozen assassinations during the 60s, morphed into a corporate take over of the world economy and elimination of the idea of nations and governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has included all this movement of people from one continent to another, to help erase that idea of national identity.

       Spacejews is a trope.  Lol.    I always thought the ferengi were Italian space jews.  One very fascinating story arc of ds9 was that quark, the shrewd, 'neutral' ferengi bartender actually grew a pair, showed his scruples and became the kind of 'good person of high moral standing' that the federation favored, deputizing him at least once into the federation.  His brother became an  officer also, I think maybe the first ferengi or one of the first.
