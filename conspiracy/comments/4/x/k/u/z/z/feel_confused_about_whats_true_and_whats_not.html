        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">255</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-08-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine the resources the CIA has, they get $80 billion a year, and that&#39;s not counting all the drug money which is probably way more. It&#39;s happening just as he said, this election is really pushing the disinfo campaigns over the edge and the propaganda and amount of polarization is off the charts. </p>

<p>We know the American media is 95% owned by 6 companies now. The bad economy is causing a lot of frustration, and the media is selling biased answers that only cater to two polarizations (liberals vs conservatives) but many viewpoints are left out of the spectrum created by having those as the endpoints. </p>

<p>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” - Noam Chomsky</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; basically puts off-limits any discussion outside the predefined dichotomy. Every event that happens in the world is cast in to two different narratives, a left one and a right one. And then they are made to fight viciously through the media, getting rid of any public discussion of gray area in between. They would like all subtlety and nuance to be dead, because then there are only two allowable reactions to any situation, which makes the public and their reactions very easy to predict. Cattle have fences. We have this. </p>

<p>In addition to the separation in to boxes, they add disinfo. They destroy the signal to noise ratio, making information gathering a chaotic practice. This is a useful tactic, especially in places where people are getting close to the deeper truths not yet realized by mainstream society, like this subreddit. So they inject chaos through disinfo. Chaos creates distrust, and distrust isolates people from banding together to solve problems. Problems like a disinformation campaign system that has taken over the media, even social media. They want to keep the power structure in place as it is, or if they can&#39;t maintain that, guide the revolution in the way they see fit. (They have overseen the overthrows and revolutions of around 53 countries since WW2.) </p>

<p>This is why thinking deeply and trusting yourself over ideologies is so vital, because only through cooperation of many clear-minded individuals can the overarching problems affecting the country be fixed at the root. There are thousands of ideologies that are pitfalls and diversions, and they have to be realized as such and let go of when you happen to find yourself ensnared. Then we can think freely. Don&#39;t fall in to the disinfo pits just because you&#39;ve seen past the veil. Not <em>everything</em> is a scam. Not <em>everything</em> is corrupt. These mistaken assumptions lead to people believing things like flat earth and reptilians, because they found out &quot;everything they learned was a lie&quot;, so they assume the exact opposite is instead true, which is also wrong. If you go too far in this type of thinking, you shoot right past the actual big conspiracies that humans are doing right here today on earth, that there&#39;s plenty of direct evidence for. Might be a little less flashy than aliens, but the truth isn&#39;t always flashy. If enough people keep their eye on the ball and communicate with others about this stuff, even if just through the internet, society will wake up to the tricks being played on us. But people are prideful and stubborn... </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s easier to fool a man than to convince him he&#39;s been fooled.&quot; - Mark Twain.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to adjust that saying, to say: It&#39;s easier to fool a society than it is to convince the society it&#39;s been fooled. The media knows this, and our collective pride of fear of looking foolish will be what causes the time lag between us being tricked and us finally realizing it as a culture. How many years will it take before our culture admits we&#39;ve been had so we can fix it? Or are we going to collectively go insane before we have the guts to repeatedly publicly admit we&#39;ve been had by the thing everyone spends 5-10 hours a day watching, reading, and listening to? What are you doing to help wake people up to how the media truly operates? Every little effort by each one of us counts, because a national culture is created one word at a time and we should all do our part. </p>

<p>&quot;If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.&quot; - Desmond Tutu</p>

<p>So have a great Saturday, and today pay close attention to how we interact with our media. Knowledge is power. Communication of knowledge spreads power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Yeah I&#39;ve been here 8 years and I agree the last 6 months of reddit have been pretty outlandishly broken, and the last month has been the cherry on top. Sometimes I wonder if there&#39;s even that many people left here, or if it&#39;s mostly paid posters and voters.  Now even <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> often looks like GLP (Assumed to be CIA&#39;s TAVISTOCK internet disinfo program) which is a damn shame. It&#39;s really infecting the whole internet, especially with companies like facebook and google changing what people see to censor or promote various things. I feel like they&#39;re really pulling the reigns on the internet media control to make sure they&#39;ve got it, which makes me wonder if a big disinfo campaign beyond the election is about to start, like a war in Syria or a bank crash or something. But that&#39;s just speculation on my part.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t this unbelievable that we&#39;re having this convo? To me, on one hand it&#39;s seems obvious that we&#39;d reach the point in society where discussion and info sharing would be censored, on the other it&#39;s weird to see it appear so quickly. Strange times..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, it&#39;s that we&#39;re <em>going back</em> to the point in society where discussion and info sharing were censored. </p>

<p>Those of us who didn&#39;t grow up with the internet would all do well to remember, and those of us who did would do well to understand, this isn&#39;t them wrestling control away from us out of nowhere. They&#39;re taking back the control they&#39;ve historically had. </p>

<p>If the lies that took us into the Iraq War had occurred pre-internet, we wouldn&#39;t have ever found out that they were lies. If Obama had wanted to go into Syria pre-internet, we wouldn&#39;t have had the backlash that we had against it, and we would&#39;ve gone in. I could list dozens of more examples, but you guys get it. Our information was controlled and censored by default. </p>

<p>Our knowledge of the world was based solely on the information, truthful or not, given to us by a media which was overly obedient to our government, and a few ambitious journalists (and even fewer brave Editor-In-Chiefs) here and there who felt strongly enough to buck the system.</p>

<p>There has been a brief moment in time where the internet has been able to crack through the guise of the &quot;official story&quot; and spread the truth. The mainstream media has been trying its same old tricks, not quite knowing how to adapt to this new lack of control, but their effectiveness has grown dangerously thin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s taken them a while to figure out exactly how to handle the internet, but now with things like controllable algorithms, enough collected data to feed into those algorithms, and AI bots that can regurgitate tweets/comments full of whatever data you feed into it, etc., their methods are vastly improving. These algorithms are also extremely beneficial to advertising and online marketing agencies, so there&#39;s money to be made.</p>

<p>It may seem to have come on quickly, and it did hit reddit full force this past year, but they&#39;ve been trying to do this since the advent of the internet. They&#39;ve just been waiting on the technology. It&#39;s here now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But most shills are human, which makes it extremely difficult. The only way to detect them is to see that they consistently post in a certain way about certain topics, but regular humans do that to. It&#39;s a very difficult business to detect forum manipulators </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I almost want this to be the OP instead of what I wrote. This is so right on the money. What do you think that technology is? Just organizational techniques to slide forums and so on, or do you think there&#39;s an AI technology aspect to it that is coming in to play now? I still think 90% of quality message promotion comes from hiring humans, current AI is just too dumb to win a real arugment</p>

<p>Dude, no. Your post was so on point, I RES tagged you as &quot;this guy gets it.&quot; I&#39;m just addressing a different perspective on why it appears to be &quot;happening quickly&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>current AI is just too dumb to win a real argument</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say at least once per visit to reddit, on average, I find myself reading a comment and saying to myself some variation of &quot;nobody can be that dumb, can they?&quot;</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the line between that and me saying &quot;no AI can be that smart, can it?&quot;</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/30/microsoft-racist-sexist-chatbot-twitter-drugs">TayTweets</a>. If you&#39;re not familiar, the gist from the article is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s attempt to converse with millennials using an artificial intelligence bot plugged into Twitter... got a crash-course in racism, Holocaust denial and sexism courtesy of Twitter users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were told that it was considered an abject failure. But was it? </p>

<p>TayTweets&#39; racism, Holocaust denial and sexism would fit in perfectly on a lot of subreddits around here. And if you can program a bot to fit in conversationally with a group of racist, sexist, Holocaust deniers, then couldn&#39;t you get a bot to fit in with a bunch of cuck hating, meme loving, Cinnamon Hitler worshippers, or a subreddit filled with feminazi, tumblr abusing, sHillbots, or a bunch of Cop-loving, gun-toting, &#39;Muricans, or a bunch of Sam Harris regurgitating, fedora tippin&#39;, <a href="/r/gonewild">/r/gonewild</a> lurkers?</p>

<p>Now think of that technology, but with the ability to draw its answers from an entire subreddit. It would fit right in. Or, worst case scenario, we&#39;d think it was just some idiot on the internet.</p>

<p>Also take into consideration that the point isn&#39;t to win the argument. The point is to derail the conversation and/or to make you look foolish so people will discount what you are saying. How many debates have you gotten into on reddit where the other user veers off on to an entirely unconnected topic or didn&#39;t make any sense at all? Dumb person or smart AI?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw digg.com go down in 2006 when it got bought out and became a PR/advertising machine. Then I came to reddit, knew it was inevitable here too. But what I didn&#39;t expect is that it also took over the whole rest of the internet. There&#39;s so very few places where lots of people discuss things openly without shills/trolls. You really have to dig for them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty unbelievable. It feels like the internet is becoming TV, where there&#39;s like 100 channels and it&#39;s all controlled and PR&#39;d to hell. There will always be back alleys to the internet, but they get more and more obscure. Maybe once people see how fucked the &quot;mainstream internet&quot; is there will develop a back-alley internet that will be more raw and uncensored, and it will grow in popularity. </p>

<p>Definitely strange times...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going to be tough for those that have recently stumbled upon  alternative News and information. The well is so poisoned, AI bot responses 24/7, and PR firms that specialize in pro govt. corp. agendas and have unlimited access at all levels, have truly changed all comments to &quot;control&quot;, as well as News stories to pure &quot;bias&quot;. </p>

<p>To anybody that is trying to find sense to any of this, has their work cut out for them, especially now. The Geopolitical, economic, ect. game has changed forever, and the players have amassed so much power, that I believe the threshold has been crossed, and we are in uncharted waters (globally), and each and everyday is going to bring out a &quot;what&#39;s next&quot;, and what I mean by that is, it is like being forced to watch a really bad &quot;B&quot;movie, and not only that, you have to be in it as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, it was much easier to get clean info even just 5 years ago. But now it seems like they&#39;ve fully realized just how powerful the internet is for awakening the public, and they&#39;ve realized how to prevent that, and it&#39;s being implemented more and more. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of global moves being made, because real globalism has only really been a thing for about 100 years and this is ruffling a lot of feathers and a new pecking order has to be determined. It really does feel like a bad movie, or like the WWE or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes really, feeling this way also. It seems like almost every day there&#39;s a major revelation breaking, yet when I come to Reddit to look for discussions they&#39;re a mess of people arguing counterpoints that as you say could equally be called disinformation -- it&#39;s becoming the online version of a panel of talking heads yelling over each other effectively burying the original story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome! Good people make up at least more than half of people, I&#39;m sure of it, it&#39;s just that the bad people have a lot of pull right now in our modern society, so the media reflects their perspectives and it can be alienating. </p>

<p>I often wonder if the reason there was so little culture generated (so few books and movies) from 1914-1918 and 1940-1944 is not only because of the war, but because everyone was so consumed with confusion and anxiety from the media that it was hard to be creative. It&#39;s said that the first casualty of war is the truth. So the answer is probably to consume less confusing media, so we&#39;ll be confused less. I think we can learn a lot from the world around us, and from each other, without having to consume mainstream media that is made to manipulate and confuse us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek recently opined the following in Newsweek:</p>

<p>“The popular rage which gave birth to Trump also gave birth to Sanders, and while they both express widespread social and political discontent, they do it in the opposite sense, the one engaging in Rightist populism and the other opting for the Leftist call for justice. And here comes the trick: the Leftist call for justice tends to be combined with struggles for women’s and gay rights, for multiculturalism and against discrimination including racism. The strategic aim of the Clinton consensus is to dissociate all these struggles from the Leftist call for justice, which is why the living symbol of this consensus is Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple who proudly signed the pro-LGBT letter and who can now easily forget about hundreds of thousands of Foxconn workers in China assembling Apple products in slave conditions—he made his big gesture of solidarity with the underprivileged, demanding the abolition of gender segregation.</p>

<p>“This same stance was brought to the extreme with the U.S.’s first female secretary of state Madeleine Albright, a big Clinton supporter who served in her husband’s administration from 1997 to 2001. On CBS’s 60 Minutes (May 12, 1996), Albright was asked about that year’s cruise missile strikes on Iraq known as Operation Desert Strike: “We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?” Albright calmly replied: “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price—we think the price is worth it.” Let’s ignore all the questions that this reply raises and focus on one aspect: can we imagine all the hell that would break out if the same answer would be given by somebody like Putin or the Chinese President Xi? Would they not be immediately denounced in western newspapers as cold and ruthless barbarians? Campaigning for Hillary, Albright said: “There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other!” (Meaning: who will vote for Sanders instead of Clinton.) Maybe we should amend this statement: there is a special place in hell for women (and men) who think half a million dead children is an affordable price for a military intervention that ruins a country, while wholeheartedly supporting women’s and gay rights at home.</p>

<p>“…as Todd McGowan, professor of film theory and history at the University of Vermont, put it (in a private communication): “The consensus of ‘right-thinking people’ opposed to Trump is frightening. It is as if his excess licenses the real global capitalist consensus to emerge and to congratulate themselves on their openness.””</p>

<p><a href="http://europe.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-presidential-election-bernie-489993?rm=eu">http://europe.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-us-presidential-election-bernie-489993?rm=eu</a></p>

<p>And indeed, it appears quite remarkably that this American presidential election is shaping up to be an ideal example of what Prof. Cass Sunstein would describe as a form of (mass) nudging within an equally massive scaffolding of psychological consumerist “choice architecture” that allows for an almost surgical level of “guided free will” within the quite pressing and inflexible strictures of (teleologically) “global governance” neoliberalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are they though or is that your expectation? It seems they are calling for a network of counter measures which work to break up the influence of private sphere funded echo chambers of thought on public discourse. What does that specifically entail?  Who knows. It is possible that they&#39;ll create their own version of these echo chambers to counter balance the ideology they dislike. That&#39;s only going to increase tension and degrade public discourse further. Imho, the best option is to open up these spheres and stop the amplification at its source. We should watch closely to see what new technologies pop up in spaces controlled by Soros&#39; opposition. This will be interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, when they do it it&#39;s &quot;a network of counter measures which work to break up the influence of private sphere funded echo chambers of thought on public discourse&quot; based on the internet, and when other people do it, it&#39;s &quot;just forum manipulation and deliberately trying to sway public opinion.&quot;</p>

<p>I think they&#39;re just using fancy words, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re talking about using forum goons to post and vote on social media sites. How do you propose to &quot;open these spheres up&quot;? This sound like an interesting approach</p>

    <div class="md"><p>disagree on that its not flashy.</p>

<p>the bible says this would happen, and if you understand the catholic church is the mother of the modern tyranny state... then you&#39;d understand our leaders actually are directly possessed by fourth dimensional aliens.</p>

<p>there is in fact some truth to the &#39;shapeshifters&#39; as the masters they are raising, the fallen angels actually have such power.</p>

<p>this may seem crazy to you, but all the legitimate evidence of conspiracy we have points to the old gods, aliens, and horrific rituals.</p>

<p>the parts we have proof of are the secret societies that control the world.  there is evidence of this.</p>

<p>however, the evidence of their belief system one must assume from the gathering of evidences prior. there is no proof positive from their mouths,</p>

<p>but if you look at history, world events, biblical prophecy, and what little has been leaked about ritualistic societies together that there actually IS a flashy end times event about to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they obviously use scripture to give themselves power. They re-enact scriptural prophecies and then go &quot;Look guys, we&#39;re just doing the work of god, it&#39;s out of our hands&quot; and so many religious zealots totally buy in to it. It&#39;s the very means by which Israel has convinced the Zionists that expanding in to &quot;greater israel&quot; is not only a good course of action, but the only course of action allowable by biblical/torah prophecy. Then they can say &quot;it&#39;s out of our hands&quot; while they actively bomb other countries, and many people believe it. I mean if you were an elite, why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> you do this? It&#39;s a fantastic way to gain power by taking advantage of people&#39;s pre-existing beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a shame reddit admins got rid of the individual up and down vote counts, or else it would be even more obvious. Still can&#39;t believe they did that to hide the real votes, after it had been that way for 7 years. Just shows how complicit the admins are in all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, when they do it it&#39;s &quot;a network of counter measures which work to break up the influence of private sphere funded echo chambers of thought on public discourse&quot; based on the internet, and when other people do it, it&#39;s &quot;just forum manipulation and deliberately trying to sway public opinion.&quot;</p>

<p>I think they&#39;re just using fancy words, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re talking about using forum goons to post and vote on social media sites. How do you propose to &quot;open these spheres up&quot;? This sound like an interesting approach</p>
