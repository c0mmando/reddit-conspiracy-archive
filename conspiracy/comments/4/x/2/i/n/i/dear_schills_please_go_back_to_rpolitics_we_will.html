       It's been interesting watching how
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       got usurped by special interests. Not a month ago the place was full of organic, pro-Sanders, anti-establishment comments. Now look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Article critical of the TPP? Top comment (gilded twice) is a TPP apologist explaining how it's a godsend for American workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Article about Wikileaks? Commenters jerking each other off to the idea that Assange is working with Russia to betray the precious Democrats. Sound familiar? The Cold War never ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Clinton's corruption scandals? Scrub that shit clean and replace with 20 articles about a single thing Trump said.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth isn't even a conspiracy here. We know Clinton's Correct the Record spent millions to "correct" Reddit commenters.
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is a huge discussion hub, so why not "invest" in it? Pay the mods to clean the new queue of anti-Clinton posts, then pay 20-30 interns to shill for the woman. The initial wave of circlejerking will influence the rest. Easy brainwashing and probably cheap, too.

       Voat at least has transparent voting (so you can see some of the bullshit in action) and moderator logs so you can comb through removed content to see if a sub is compromised.

       You're right, and that's the danger. Both candidates should be under the spotlight and given the same treatment, it seems (especially on
       <a href="/r/hillaryforpresident">
        /r/hillaryforpresident
       </a>
       ...I mean
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ) that for every article that is remotely critical of hillary gets deleted or drowned in the 30+ trump articles spamming their front page. It's crazy that hillary is almost held in a "it's ok, she's not trump" regard even though she's definitly doing shit thats probably even worse then trump on the day his campaign managers take a break.

       Hillary's campaign did a good job in working that angle of propaganda and narrative: That even though stuff is sketchy about her, you should be voting on the fact that Trump is worse and is the antithesis to democracy- as ironic as it is.

       The mods actively control the information being presented on the sub.  When it was Bernie vs Hillary the sub was filled with anti-Clinton articles.  I used to make jokes about how the articles being posted won't be allowed once Hillary took the nomination.  Now that she has, the mods are actively controlling the submissions so it supports the message they want.

       I'm glad you cited some examples , because that shit is 100% true, man.  If anyone thinks that someone with Clintons kind of money &amp; power (and history of corruption) wouldn't be spending money to manipulate the news, they are absolutely ignorant.

       If by "well sourced" you mean it has a bunch of shills saying they think the TPP will be great without giving any reasoning, sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPP is corporate protectionism garbage and seeks to import third world working conditions and wages for Americans, give corporations an unlimited taxpayer sieve, allow corporations to jail people for
       <em>
        ten fucking years
       </em>
       for something that isn't even a criminal offense right now, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who supports the TPP is unequivocally a piece of shit subhuman shitheel.

       this place is run by shills.  this is just another echo chamber for you to complain in while corruption continues its course.  if you think it is any more than that, then you haven't been paying attention at all.  even better, you aren't going to do anything about them anyway.  you aren't exactly willing to take action to stop them.

       my biggest question for this forum, which i love, is why would all the other subreddits be shut down or totally run amuck with propaganda, but not this one? its not like r/conspiracy is some hidden thing or anything.

       that's the joke.  this isn't a bastion of free speech.  this page, and every other page, is here for you to vent to like minded sheep for the sake of maintaining the peace.  anyone that tries to get them organized gets banned, because this isn't what reddit is here for.

       It's completely obvious that Trump shills are targeting this subreddit a lot more than any CTR folks. You would have to be completely blind not to see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, CTR isn't getting much traction in here due to the Trump shilling. I find it laughable every time this comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and try to submit anything that's anti-Trump or links Trump to the establishment. It's going NOWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I gave up trying to post half of my regular content due to the influx of shills from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever, after November it's going to be business as usual and all those shills will be looking for another job.

       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       This comment wouldn't have been down voted outside of an election cycle. The majority of folks in this sub have always been anti-establishment and believe that both political parties are controlled opposition. You want to believe in something? Believe that any individual who speaks out against both candidates are downvoted hard and silenced.

       He's exaggerating but he is right in a way, trump isn't paying people to correct stuff about him, and we've already proven that there are people here that are under Hillary's "correct the record" on reddit.

       Well we don't for sure, but from the public records of everything his campaign has spent money on, there's no evidence that any funds are directed to actively correct anti-trump posts online, we know for a fact that $1 million Hillary's campaign spent on her "correct the record" whatever it is. Is trump attempting to censor negative images and posts about him? I'm not sure, but we have yet to see evidence of such, as apposed to Hillary.

       "Everything his campaign has spent money on"  Yes, unfortunately his campaign finances do not comprise the entirety of the money being spent on him getting elected, it is simply a record of what him and his campaign staff have spent and where they spent it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize that there are organizations and wealthy individuals who are helping to fund him, right? Are you as certain about where their dollars are being spent?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be in the best interest of anyone sponsoring him, or even anyone merely standing to benefit from his presidency, to keep any social media manipulation secret because of the fact that much of his success has been as a result of his self-described  "outsider" or "anti-establishment" status. That being said, it is unlikely you would see "evidence as such" any time soon because of how easy it is for donors to hide their spending records on his behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond this, if you believe, as many of you claim, that Trump is either simply running for the Clinton's benefit, or that he is just playing the role assigned to him by those pulling the strings behind the scenes, why would you think Trump is not enjoying the same type of social media manipulation, considering he is in cahoots with the real power brokers?  If he is one of them, they would undoubtedly use massive social media PR campaigns to promote him, just like they do with everyone else in their "stable".

       Very true, but in that stance online censorships are nothing new, and could potentially be tied to any cadidadate running after the advent of Internet use. So singling out trump should be followed up that he potentially is, but at the same time so could any other cadidadate running the 21st century, so we must also give him the benifit of the doubt unless proven otherwise, like we have for hillary.

       No I'm not but once again until we see and evidence of illicit funds being used in such a way (once again, like hillary has and is doing) we should as rational people consider that since there is no evidence, his private donors are not helping fund an pro trump censorship.

       You say that yet look how easy it was to dig up all that dirt on hillary (notice a trend here?). Yes, maybe republican donations are better with hiding their money trails, but with all the work being put into hacking both the DNC and RNC I'd expect more proof of it, maybe it will come out later down the line, once again, we don't know, so assuming it is going on isn't really the right course of action.

       Again, because we see no evidence of it, trump is obviously running because he believes that he can make American better than it is, your opinion on whether he's delusional in this regard notwithstanding. He stands however to loose more by hiding promotions of large corporations, and has a significantly easier time funding his campaign over clinton, even with all of her corporate "sponsorships". If trump was running as dirty of a campaign as Hillary is, why haven't there been any whistleblowers, no huge cache of evidence, you can put together a puzzle if there are no pieces. Also, in terms of social media manipulation, how on earth would trump be able to do that? Almost every media outlet hates him, constantly attempting to slander his campaign. Reddit more or less despises him, we have document evidence of admins and mods censoring pro -trump content (apparently there's a lot of evidence of this, put based on trumps AMA there's clearly not a lot of pro-trump censorship here, again as opposed to hillary). While it's important to never believe that Trump is totally dirt free, it's even more important to look at the evidence, we've yet to see any HUGE evidence of trumps dirty dealings, and with hillary buried under a few tons of her dirt it makes all the more sense that Trumps campaign isn't holding extra cards under the table. And as I said earlier, the election isn't over, maybe we'll see something that chances, but when is doesn't walk like a duck or quack like a duck, it's probably not a duck lol.

       Oh bullshit.  This is why I dislike this subreddit sometimes.  People just resort to calling someone a shill when they don't agree with the consensus or have a viewpoint that people don't like.  And then assume when they are downvoted they're being targeted by shills and it only further cements their opinion and somehow proves they're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying there are not shills or targeted downvoting but to just accuse someone is disingenuous and unfairly baiting someone.

       ... So you're on board with this whole thread and the general attitude that anyone who doesn't believe that Hillary is the literal antichrist and Trump is our anointed savior must be a paid shill, but as soon as I make a joke about it going the other way too you bust out the wall of text?

       I have absolutely zero problem with you or anyone else speaking negatively about Trump.  People just don't agree with your view that both candidates are bought and paid for.  I have seen far more real evidence that the Clinton's are completely corrupt.  Say what you want about Trump but you "have to be completely blind" to not see the huuuuge pile of evidence stacking up against Hillary Clinton...

       I dunno, I get the feeling that Trump wants to be friends with Putin while Hillary wants to antagonize Putin with lies and start WW3 with Russia. I feel like Trump would just dump nukes on Syria or something instead. Horrible, but probably not a world war, just an expansion of our global war on terro... wait.

       So.. what about MSM targeting GOP voters? Are they not reporting on Clinton negatively while promoting their candidate? Is Fox News targeting Trump beyond the claims that he's "anti-establishment"?

       Isn't the majority of the Pro-Trump submissions from MSM?

       You can't use JUST DNC targeting propaganda MSM in order to justify your belief that Trump is an uncontrolled candidate. You guys are submitting plenty of content from MSM sources that are pro-Trump.

       Maybe that is your problem. You are pro establishment therefore you don't see the agenda the establishment is working towards and don't realize the impotence of stopping your own enslavement. I see you still speak of the "GOP" as if the 2 party division illusion is real. There is nothing but those working towards the agenda and the people. Nothing else.Hillary is working towards the agenda that is a fact.

       The GOP has always targeted their audience primarily through radio talk shows and local news affiliates. This cycle they also included social media sites. Trump shills were in this subreddit way before the election cycle went into full gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't have to pay anything because the MSM already had their job assigned to them by the bosses up high.

       It's a great time for all the new generations of voters to wake up. I don't recall any other political cycle being this blatant in their bias (not just hostility). They've completely shown their hand when it comes to the fact that they are all working towards one goal, and thus showing us all that everything produced by them should be treated with skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond all the vitriol of politics, the enlightened amongst us should be taking this opportunity to remove the blind-folds from the less enlightened. They can point at any one of the many hugely biased articles that MSM are pushing and look at any one of the many recent conspiracies that the MSM is blatantly ignoring or minimising.

       Trump is a plant to ensure a hated asshole like Clinton can actually win an election. The media hating on him is their way of supporting the system that he's a party to. Trump isn't trying to win, he's trying to get Clinton to win, so by attacking Trump, they're serving his ultimate goal.

       He spent his own money in order to propagate the belief that he's independent and anti-establishment. That's his whole campaign and the GOP is pushing this message due to the massive amounts of GOP supporters they almost lost this election cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are using a lasso to bring everyone back under their banner. The GOP almost died as a party in the last few years due to anti-establishment sentiment. That's how the Tea Party was formed and it was the beginning of bringing the sheep back to their pastures. Trump is just a continuation of this.

       Nope, the real people on this sub have supported Trump since he spoke out against issues such as vaccines and also said he wanted peace with Russia.  Trump is not meant to be there, that's why the mainstream media are going for his throat all day every day.

       Normally both parties are not good, but this time Trump has changed that.  Anyone on /conspiracy would have to be mad not to vote for him, this is the only time we're getting a real option.

       Yeah, so you don't want to believe that you are being targeted as a "conspiracy" believer? I can understand that.

       It's all lip service. He speaks of anti-establishment yet wants to "strengthen the military". That means profit for the war chest, which is a neocon agenda. He's "not afraid to use nukes", which is a warmonger viewpoint and neocon agenda.

       Exactly!  It's lipstick on a pig.  He supports the same old neocon policies but dresses them up with creative language that distracts from the core of those policies and appeals to the base.  Classic misdirection.  Look at my right hand waving around while my left hand goes in your pocket.

       No.  Im not a schill.  I was a Sanders supporter until he sold out.  I just think the obvious anti Trump campaign is ridiculous... Lets make a top ten list of negative things known about both Clinton and Trump... Look at that list... Who is more corrupt in your opinion?  Who has the most ties to the global elites?  Lets have a real duscussion...

       Not when it's on a pro-Trump sub, by telling /conspiracy to vote third party you are only getting Trump supporters to waste their votes.  This is the one time we've got someone real to vote for, we're not so stupid to follow your advise.

       Someone real to vote for?  Give me a fucking break!!!  He is authoritarian garbage that supports the patriot act and NSA domestic surveillance!  He is the candidate for rich people because he will reinstate the god awful bush tax cuts for the wealthy which nearly ruined the economy last time.  I don't understand why you people think trump has your best interest in mind at all.  Talk is cheap.

       We're in r/conspiracy. Do you think that you are somewhere else? This is not a forum for Trump or Hillary. It's above them both. It's a place to discuss groups getting together to plot; that encompasses both presidential candidates, and much more. I see straight through both of their ploys. They are both part of the aristocracy. They were both chosen by our Military Industrial Complex to run. Neither will get my vote. Edit: For the record I believe Trump is the lesser evil. I'm just completely done with evil.

       I do not support the TPP whatsoever. Gary Johnson is another sham. Jill Stein is the only independent I can somewhat consider, but I have my doubts with her too. Trump says that he doesn't support the TPP, but I'm not falling for that. The Republicans and Democrats have been playing this game for a long time, and I'm sick of it. Trump's VP is in full support of the TPP, and globalization. I just can't wrap my head around that. Why would you choose a running mate that completely goes against what you stand for? Trump has been paying his dues to the Clinton Foundation, talked to Bill before he ran, and comes from the same royal line as Hillary.  I can't trust the man. I don't need to explain why I don't support Hillary; if you still plan on voting for her please wake up! So that leaves me to continue to lend "credibility" to our voting system and voting for Jill Stein, or deny the system the satisfaction. If it doesn't matter to anyone but me, then what are we really doing here? Voting has been corrupt ever since we started backing our currency on debt of this world. Maybe even further back if you can see the strings behind the wealth. They are usually called the Illuminati because they don't want it called what it really is; which is an aristocracy. Actual change for us is going to have to take far more devotion than a simple vote. It will require time and planning from a very large group of individuals. Do you see the trap that has been created? The chattel is kept to busy selling it's time for the debt of others, and almost every communication is now monitored making planning a weakness. We live in a physical matrix, and now they've been working on this digital one as well. It is insane. My vote is for the continued spread of truth, and hopefully enough people will understand what has been going on. I personally don't think this election will actually end up happening. May Jesus Christ watch over you. God bless!

       Hillary has silly money, with Rothschilds and Goldman Sachs backing her up, anyway you only have to look around to see the obvious Hillary shills who are suddenly appear.  Trump doesn't need to send people to this sub, the majority of us support him anyway and happily spread positive news about him free of charge.

       All I'm seeing from this thread and the comments below is "If you think Trump would make a worse president than Clinton, you work for CTR as a Clinton shill." Also the addendum to this is,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x2ini/dear_schills_please_go_back_to_rpolitics_we_will/d6bxri7">
        "If you think Trump &amp; Clinton are both terrible options than you also work for CTR as a Clinton shill somehow."

       Yeah, I mentioned earlier that the majority of the content I normally share doesn't make it anywhere. The front page is dominated by election cycle propaganda. So I've taken a hiatus for a bit. It's not even worth it due to submissions unrelated to the US elections being bombarded by shills pushing their candidate.

       Sorry, I didn't realize that I should find additional examples. A lot of discussions as of late have boiled down to "Trump Supporter = Good, Clinton Supporter = Shill, 3rdParty Supporter = Shill."
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize there's some of us on the alt-left around here, too (like all six of us), and we pretty much hate both of 'em equally and more likely to advocate voting for SAlt or the green party or writing in Giant Meteor. It would be nice to get an alt-left and and alt-right party in the debates, if only because it'd be awesome to see Gary Johnson and Jill Stein wipe the floor with the democrats and republicans, and watch the social upheaval that would happen when the average low-information voter realizes they may have more than two choices, and one of those other two will likely sound closer to what real people actually want than the two nonchoices they were(n't) given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotal, but from talking to real people I realize that most republican voters agree more with libertarian party than the republican party. Most democrat voters I speak to agree more with the greens than the dems, and some of those dem voters would likely vote for a libertarian. I try to push people to vote for third party when I talk to them, even push right leaning people towards libertarians.

       Of course it is. Which is why voting for either two major parties right now is a waste of time. And voting third party is almost as much a waste of time. I got out and voted for Sanders, but there's no point in voting in your presidential race. I hope people that are disillusioned with their choice at least still come to the polls to vote in city, state, and local races that matter.

       You got me there. I believe the average viewer on this sub to be generally a member of the alt-right with all of the caveats this entails. But just because a lot of this sub doesn't agree with me politically does not mean I dislike y'all. I created a reddit account to sub here, and
       <a href="/r/occupywallstreet">
        /r/occupywallstreet
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/socialism">
        /r/socialism
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The discussions that happen in this sub are generally absolutely important. Regardless of where one stands politically, everyone should know about this shit. I hate to see it devolve into everyone accusing everyone of being a shill because we're all fucking paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that we don't have any reason to be, but getting hung up on witch hunts for 'shills' easily turns into "ban everyone we disagree with" and then this place becomes significantly less important as a news source.

       Yes, and I'm simply worried that it's going to happen here, too, but that it will be rather self-imposed. There are very few good sources of news left (on reddit).

       Okay but first do we really mean actual "shills" or just people we disagree with, I see so many people now just whipping out "shill" "CTR" etc. oh and I can't forget the idiot calling me a Muslim in
       <a href="/r/uncensorednews">
        /r/uncensorednews
       </a>
       a couple of days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably exactly what the CTR thing was all about, getting us nice and whipped up into a frenzy and now anyone people disagree with are "shills" or to take it further "SJW" "liberal" for the
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       dicks or apparently freaking "Muslim." This shit is stupid and all kinds of people are being accused of things they aren't and we're making it easier for the ones that are actually shilling by turning on each other, good old divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think someone is a shill or CTR don't confront them, especially in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       where there is a standing rule now on accusations, I was banned for it myself, instead message the mods with your evidence, if your evidence is solid and the mods still don't do shit then lets light the torches and grab the pitchforks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then it's just us looking like idiots when we call someone a shill and they wind up not being one or worse you get banned for it when you should have kept your accusations to yourself, compiled evidence, and gave it to the mod team.

       Idk what Hillary shills you are talking about cause all we do here is bash the shit out of Hillary. If anything we have trumpets in here trying to act like their candidate isn't bought and paid for just like Hillary.  I still don't understand how this sub believes elections can actually be won. I thought most of us would know how rigged elections are by now...

       I was just looking at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       - it changed back to more standard overnight! A mix of anti-Clinton and anti-Trump articles, and other political issues (e.g., marijuana legislation).
      </p>
      <p>
       CtR efforts clearly have been pulled from there. Perhaps they consider it "won" so they turn their efforts elsewhere? Watch out
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       then, or perhaps the $6million ran out and they need a fresh influx of $$, or are they to concentrate on individual issues - like Seth Rich muder. Fascinating play CtR!

       yesturday the post about the new okeef video got to about 8000 upvotes and made it to r/all
      </p>
      <p>
       somehow the post got bounced to the second page behind other posts with less upvotes.  the post then lost literally thousands of upvotes...down to around 5k while the upvote percentage stayed at around 67%

       i do believe that some guy by the username spez on here who works with reddit in some fashion (im fairly new as an active member) also worked with clintons team to delete posts from the guy who actually asked questions on how to use bleachbit on her server

       I thought the r/politics shills had all left. That is not the case. Their tactics have clearly changed though. They are not flooding the board with anti-Trump posts. Perhaps they realized that drove everyone away? Shills are still posting though.

       While the idea is just, the problem here is that everyone with an opinion that doesn't fit the status quo of the sub is going to be labeled a shill. People here talk about "not being a part of the Reddit hive-mind/ Pro-HRC brainwashing".... But there exists a sort of hive-mind at the r/conspiracy level as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dare not say EVERYONE in this sub is following the conspiracy hive-mind, there are certainly more free thinkers here than most subs. But my point stands... It is absurd to believe EVERY conspiracy you come across, yet saying anything positive about any of the negative topics thrown around in here gets downvoted to oblivion. Any sort of mild disagreement with the top commenters brands you a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we as a sub, and community of truth seekers, encourage free thought and anti-censorship while at the same time identifying and labeling true shills?

      <p>
       I agree that there are a lot of shills out there and a lot of fakes, but it's the extreme ones that are the shills and CTR people in my eyes.  The more extreme your thoughts and beliefs, the more likely I am to think that you're not only full of shit, but trying to debase the roots of the truth.  Political corruption is real.  Reptilians are not.  The world is dying because we are overusing its resources.  Yet we sit here and fight on whether Hillary is corrupt or not.  Of fucking course she's corrupt, that's the ONLY WAY TO WIN IN POLITICS.  You know it to be true, so now what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you're going to accuse me of not being real?  No wonder nothing has changed.  We get scared of the extremists and hide behind our masks.  The middle of the road people need to start speaking up and doing something instead of hiding, or there will be nothing left for anyone on any side of any fences.

       , just reddit in general) love to go through your comment history to debase you when they don't like your arguments. I got tired of having to re-explain things I've said to others in the past, and I got tired of having to correct the usage of out-of-context previous posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't make anyone a shill. Fucking everyone on this site should be removing their comments if they're over a certain age. Edit them first, because supposedly deleted comments are stored in their undeleted form on the server unless you edit them. I doubt Reddit themselves actually remove any data at all.

       But there are legitimate reasons for doing it. Perhaps to prevent from being doxed if you have an unpopular opinion in mainstream subs, like if you share a negative opinion of cops while in

       Then delete those specific comments that make you fear for your safety if it's that important to you, or don't make the post in the first place if it will cause undue danger to you or your family. Freedom of speech isn't a guarantee that you can always say anything freely, it means that you can say what you want but there could very easily be consequences. Legally I could go into Harlem or Compton and start talking about hating black people, but it would be fucking stupid and so (if I held those views) I probably wouldn't go do that.

      <p>
       We can agree with this to a point, and outside of the internet where everyone is anonymous you cannot retract previous statements. Showing 'integrity' on reddit or other social media is a waste of time, and places you at undue risk. On a further note, absolutely nobody has any integrity on an anonymous or semi-anonymous online forum by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to threaten me in real life over something I say to you in an argument, sure. We can deal with that then, and I can show you whatever 'integrity' you want. But you want to scrape my post history to find the town I live, the approximate description of the vehicle I used to drive, and follow me around town, I'm not having that. I'm not allowing it, and I wiped all of that so I can be more careful in the future to make sure I don't reveal any personal information that can lead to me again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured I would be accused of being a shill far more often if I was making these posts with a week old account. Wiping the post history was a better option.

      <p>
       The thing of it is, I'm not that kind of person. I consider it an ad-hominem attack to just rake through someone's post history 'till you can find something you can use, rather than debating the substance of their arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made the decision and took it upon myself to make those kinds of arguments less effective when they are used against me. Especially when my opinions have changed slightly from three years ago and I'm stuck having to debate views I no longer hold because dumbasses on the alt-right think I'm a shill because I left the alt-right and moved to the alt-left.

       What's the point of commenting anything if you're just going to delete it? You should be confident in what you put without including information that can identify you. Your comments could be top notch, controversial, and groundbreaking. The fact you delete them removes all credibility from your account and thats your fault. You might as well be a bot or shill, too much effort for us here to care about your legitimacy rather than talk to other users who keep their history up. Weak ass excuse if you ask me.

       I've begun starting to leave more comments up after purging them all unilaterally. I adjusted Shreddit to not remove comments from particular subs (incl. this one) about a month ago.

       I can agree with this, but hindsight is always 20/20 innit?

      <p>
       The point is, someone managed to piece together the approximate location of where I lived from posts that included very little personal information (just inferences based on the subs the comments were posted in), and then use that information to attempt to threaten me. They didn't have much, but it was enough for me to say "fuck this" and delete every single comment up to that point without regard for the content of the post.

       That's part of the problem! To even speak here, you have to allow yourself to be vetted. What's to say shills won't start paying a premium for accounts with intact post history so they can more effectively shill in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? When they cotton on to this, the (not-so) surefire method some members of this sub use to 'detect' shills is gone! What's to say that the obvious shills aren't just coverups for the more sophisticated ones? How are you going to filter those people?
      </p>
      <p>
       What, are we just gonna continually witch hunt for shills until we're sure we got all of 'em, or are we going to continue sharing and spreading the news they don't want you to read?

       Just in case they could still be used for identification or purposes of deduction, somehow, some way, or in the future something I said before the incident could be used to tie more of my real world identity to my online ones, or tie this online identity to other ones. Although the end result was that I got a lot more careful with what I end up saying, I will still remove my own posts from default subs and other particular locations from now on.

       This also sounds about accurate. I was scared shitless and paranoid as hell over it, so I took care of it. Made some changes in the real world, too, that I won't detail here.

      <p>
       My area is much smaller, and also demographics would easier to pick me out of the crowd among them. It certainly did help someone else find me, since at the time I was the only white person who lived on that particular street.

       Yes, I fucked up, and you're right on that accusation. I never said that it

       my fault that people were able to get enough information from my internet posts to threaten my real-life identity. Just that people do it, and I had made some mistakes which I took

      <p>
       Keep in mind, the entire reason to delete your own post history is so your account cannot be tracked, and aggregated, and so shit like snoosnoop or whatever the fuck it's called doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't you taking steps in the real world to prevent the NSA from tracking and aggregating you? Aren't you using encryption as often as possible? How is deleting your post history any different than this? It has the same exact effect. In the real world, if you buy everything in cash the government adds you to a list of potentially civil disobedient people. On reddit, if you delete your post history,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       adds you to the list of potential "shills".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it that, to you, it's not okay for you to be tracked and aggregated, but it's fine to do it to anyone and everyone else online? Because if this isn't the case, this is how you seem: like a fucking hypocrite.

       The worst thing about this election is that the lines are so defined and there's so much hate directed to both sides.

       Most people are generally decently intelligent and reasonable when they feel they aren't going to be attacked for their views.  Trump folks are mad at the establishment, I think we can all understand that.  Hillary folks are worried about someone who is inexperienced as a politician taking over the top spot, also very reasonable.

       We all do ourselves a disservice when we decide on an ideology and turn off our brains in favor of feeling superior to others.  We all need to remember that we're in this together, neither candidate is as bad as their being made out to be and we can't let them divide us.

       Hillary is at least as bad as she's being made out, whereas Trump is just being demonized by propaganda

       Of course, the majority on /conspiracy are pro-Trump, he is the best option we've had in years.  We don't like Goldman Sachs, Rothschild and Co, they are supporting Hillary.  Of course, we know that Trump will probably get assassinated, we're already seeing people within the Democrat Party getting assassinated for leaking Hillary's secrets to Wikileaks.

       You're right about the big banks but Trump has his obvious faults.  I think that if supporters of both candidates were really honest, they'd have to admit that both candidates are hugely flawed.  It isn't about who you pick, it's that we're all in this together and it's not good that were as divided and vitriolic as we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't support Trump, I like that he's against big banks but there's too much other stuff, that's okay though.  I don't think less of people for supporting who they support and that's the point of my post, just mutual respect.

       The anger and hate is generated by the parties and we just eat it up like it's the way it should be.  That's the real conspiracy.  Trump and Hillary supporters are ready to kill each other, Trump and Clinton are buddies, it's well documented.  Let's realize that this is what they want and work together instead of calling each other names.

       I'm glad you cited some examples , because that shit is 100% true, man.  If anyone thinks that someone with Clintons kind of money &amp; power (and history of corruption) wouldn't be spending money to manipulate the news, they are absolutely ignorant.

       TPP is corporate protectionism garbage and seeks to import third world working conditions and wages for Americans, give corporations an unlimited taxpayer sieve, allow corporations to jail people for
       <em>

        It's been interesting watching how
        <a href="/r/politics">
         /r/politics
        </a>
        got usurped by special interests. Not a month ago the place was full of organic, pro-Sanders, anti-establishment comments. Now look at it.

       The mods actively control the information being presented on the sub.  When it was Bernie vs Hillary the sub was filled with anti-Clinton articles.  I used to make jokes about how the articles being posted won't be allowed once Hillary took the nomination.  Now that she has, the mods are actively controlling the submissions so it supports the message they want.
