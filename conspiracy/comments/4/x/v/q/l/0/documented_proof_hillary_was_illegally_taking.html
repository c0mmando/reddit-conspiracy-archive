    <div class="md"><p>From: Lopez, Jacquelyn K. (Perkins Coie) [mailto:<a href="mailto:JacquelynLopez@perkinscoie.com">JacquelynLopez@perkinscoie.com</a>] Sent: Wednesday, May 18, 2016 3:35 PM To: Alan Reed; Comer, Scott; Brad Marshall Subject: SEC letters and donations  Hi all,  Can we set up a time for a very brief call to go over our process for handling donations from donors who have given us pay to play letters? Want to make sure we have a robust process in place to make sure that donations that come in from those donors, in any form, get put into the operating account.</p>

<p>&quot;Pay-to-Play practices have come under scrutiny by both the federal government[18] and a number of states.[19] In Illinois, federal prosecutors in 2006 were investigating &quot;pay-to-play allegations that surround Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich&#39;s administration.&quot;[20] The allegations of pay-to-play in Illinois became a national scandal after the arrest of Gov. Blagojevich in December 2008, on charges that, among other things, he and a staffer attempted to &quot;sell&quot; the vacated U.S. Senate seat of then-president-elect Barack Obama.[21][22]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bit confused because the first quote you linked doesn&#39;t appear in OP&#39;s link. </p>

<p>Also, as I understand it not all &quot;pay to play&quot; is illegal, but what Blagojevich did was. I don&#39;t think it has any place in politics but OP didn&#39;t claim it was unethical. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking for a cite to the law she broke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were talking about &quot;pay to play letters&quot; which are the records that campaigns have to have certain financial donors (financial advisors mainly) sign in order to acknowledge that they aren&#39;t straight up giving money for kickbacks/favors/bribes (at least for two years they can&#39;t, after that it is mostly fair game).  The SEC enacted these rules to prevent &quot;pay to play&quot; which is why the emails are mentioning SEC records...it really isn&#39;t the smoking that people think it is, it is common SEC compliance legal mumbojumbo.  </p>

<p>edit: The person who wrote the first email hadn&#39;t even passed the bar yet, she is doing legal gruntwork probably even still an intern...she wouldn&#39;t be the person doling out contracts or other bribes, not to say it isn&#39;t happening, but no lawyer is dumb enough to write it out in an email like this.  These people know how to cover their ass, they don&#39;t implicate themselves in a large email thread using plain english from their work account of all things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused, going over pay-to-play laws with a doner is a good thing, pay-to-play letters means you&#39;re going over congressional requirements that since they donated they can&#39;t bid for government jobs for something like 3 years.  It&#39;s like a standard disclosure document that the SEC, FEC and probably FINRA require.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re actually doing &quot;pay-to-play&quot; with your doners you&#39;re not going to send a form letter with the words &quot;pay-to-play&quot; in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I think most here thought this was a smoking gun - they actually used the term &quot;pay to play&quot; that has been complained about for months. In this case it is an actual <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/pay-to-play-faq.htm">SEC term</a></p>

<p>I want Clinton to go down in flames, but efforts need to be turned elsewhere. This is a non-starter. Unless CtR wants folk to waste their time on this...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s hardly documented proof, son. However, I have no doubt that there&#39;s some oiling going on behind the scene&#39;s - for both candidates.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget Trumps campaign manager, Paul Manafort recieved millions of dollars in undisclosed cash payments from the former pro-Russian regime in Ukraine. Did Putin pay Trump to run? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is undoubtedly corruption on both sides of any political situation. The real question is who is the lesser of two evils?</p>

<p>Hillary has had real power before and she blew it. She was a terrible Secretary of State and I think she would be a horrible President.</p>

<p>Trump is something of an unknown in that respect. He&#39;s never held a position of power outside of the business world, so who knows what he will do.</p>

<p>As for the Libertarian and Green Parties they don&#39;t really have a snowball&#39;s chance in hell to win.</p>

<p>I think I will abstain from participating in this election.</p>
