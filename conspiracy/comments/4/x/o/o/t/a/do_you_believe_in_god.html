      <p>
       Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think I'm going to relate to the Bhagavad Gita for this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the ultimate God (Brahman)...like the ultimate universal God. This God is incomprehensible to most people on Earth in our state of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in order for God to connect with the people on Earth, he (or she or it or whatever) has the personal side...Krishna...or Yahweh...or whatever the many names people have used from various cultures. The personal aspect of God is just an aspect, not its entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people do not need that personal connection with God in life and they ultimately find some universal truth. However, most people do, which is why religion is so popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately religion has been completely corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be an atheist, but that changed in my early 20s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up exploring Buddhism and Hinduism and I see a lot of truth there. I will always practice certain tenets of Buddhism.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I find there is something lacking in Buddhism. I am finding that I was lied to about Christianity in some ways. For one, most Christians I have met are complete hypocrites. So, I am now exploring Christianity myself and finding most of what I learned about it was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to ask me anything!

       I too am the same way. I explored almost all avenues and I find that there is something lacking in Buddhism and Hinduism is far too abstract. I find an affinity to Gnosticism/Esotericism and am researching more into it.

       That's awesome that I have found somebody that came to the same conclusion...or at least is getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly am always researching religion and spirituality. I see those things as the utmost importance. I think people have purposely been fooled to believe there isn't something beyond themselves. In fact, I'm starting to think people do not want to believe there is something more.

       As a former agnostic who explored Eastern religions before having a totally unexpected Christian awakening, I'd like to hear more about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity and Jesus Christ are under assault and I am not and all surprised you and I both learned that the way we learned of Christianity through the media and hypocrites who claimed to be Christian was a big lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worth noting: Trying to type Christ got autocorrected to Christmas. Christ still isn't an option, even after I tried to save it as correct. Watch: Christmas

       That is exactly what happened to me. First of all, I was raised in rich white suburbia. I was not rich, but the people around me were.
      </p>
      <p>
       I automatically associated Christians with those types of people: greedy, hypocritical, egocentric, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this (and everything I heard about how terrible Christianity was), I hated Christianity. Really.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not until about a year ago that I realized I never really explored the bible myself. I always listened to what others told me about the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found that much of what I learned was completely wrong. I also realized that studying the scriptures takes an enormous amount of time and critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found a lot of truth in Jesus's words, and while I'm not so sure all of the Bible is perfect, I am coming to a lot of truths about Christ himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like anything, I will continue exploring and trying to find my way. The biggest thing I learned is do not take any other person's word for it. It is our duty to explore on our own. Perhaps that is the danger of churches.

       I believe in multiple higher dimensions vibrating at lower densities than our current reality, and at the very highest dimension is the source field. The source field is god which to me is essentially the sacred geometric blueprint that governs how all life is formed. I would wager no matter where you go in the entire universe, you will find plants with spirals and torus shaped objects like fruit and the earths magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are capable of communicating with only 4th or 5th dimensional beings. Humans physically exist in the 3rd dimension and are capable of 4th dimensional consciousness which is why through shamanistic hallucinogenic herbs we are able to access these higher realms. To communicate with any beings higher than the 5th dimensions, they would have to lower their density to communicate at our level.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain angels and demons, seeing as 4th and 5th dimensional beings can be positively or negatively oriented.

       some interesting concepts you put forth here i myself have been thinkin of the universe within the small amount of quantum physics i can possibly understand but that there is like cross dimensional planes that spirit can manifest within ....like death is just crossing into a plane where 3 rd dimension is expanded to offer more and time line not fixed in the here and now and only forward direction ... have you thoughts on this and ty for sharing yours

       I consider myself a skeptic. I am skeptical of government, big business, media, secret societies, cults, religion, even science. Why? Because all methods we have for obtaining knowledge are imperfect. Therefore,
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       should be subject to scrutiny and
       <em>
        nothing

       I believe in God/Jesus because when I was overdosed on cocaine I asked him to rid me of the choice I made and I went from dying to sober in a split second. Needless to say I cried for the rest of the night. The lord has saved me from myself multiple times and has answered all prayers with random verses in the bible that I simply look up on my phone and they literally speak to the situation I am in EVERY TIME WITHOUT FAIL. I'm not a bible thumper or preacher, I am a sinner and a beggar, but somehow I can feel the Holy Spirit in my darkness and he pulls me up because we are the ones he died for. Being broken is not ok by any American standard, hey, they might as well throw you into an institution because you're deemed insane, but being broken and vulnerable with God is such an amazing place to be. Think about it. You can only go up from there and when you're dealing with supernatural power - the possibilities are actually endless. He knows you and I more than we do honestly and that's what I love about him. When I lose myself and become overwhelmed with my job and life and people and bills and worries and stress and failure and successes, he gently speaks to me when I come falling to my knees lost and afraid. He lifts me up like no human words of encouragement ever could.

       Belief is accepting without proof. I don't even see the right sort of anectdotal evidence to convince me.  So no. I have no idea what started the whole universe.  But god doesn't sound right to me. And as for where we go after we die? It's very simple.  We die, that's it.

       Good question! I grew up Christian but what I didn't like about Christianity was this idea that an all-loving god would subject you to an eternity of hellfire for refusing to pay admiration to it. I didn't like that this god killed vast amounts of people for being "wicked." I didn't like the dogma. That lead me to researching other religions and eventually the occult and esotericism, which I like the best because it leaves the most room to "carve your own path."
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the biggest selling point of Gnosticism is the idea of the demiurge. I view the current PTB, and their coming NWO, as this demiurge and its "kingdom on Earth." Nothing exists except what is approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Salvation for humanity comes not in dogma and authority, but using the "divine spark" that was given. Consciousness. Deciding for yourself (instead of being TOLD) what is good or bad, and naturally choosing to do the good, instead of the bad, since the bad is ever-present. Suffering will always exist but we must do our best to relieve that suffering in whatever way we can.

       That's totally fine and a very fair question! It's actually a pretty big misconception that Lucifer is Satan. Lucifer only occurs once in the Hebrew bible and that was in Isiah 14:12 and that was translated as "helel" which means "shining one" or "light bearer." A lot of people believe that this verse is speaking of Lucifer's fall from heaven but Lucifer was never mentioned in the context of Satan or the devil. The term "Lucifer" was used in the context of condemnation of a dead Babylonian king, believed to be Nebuchadnezzar II, under whom the Babylonian captivity of the Hebrews began. The idea of a star falling from heaven, or fallen angel, comes from Canaanite mythology. (see Attar and Ishtar.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is evident that Isiah 14 was against a man rather than the devil due to the verses "But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'"
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer, in Latin, means "bringer of light" and has also been used as a name to describe Jesus himself. It's just Christian tradition to erringly describe Lucifer as a proper name for the devil. And tbh my username refers to a lyric in a kickass metal song. I hope this was helpful for you!

       Yes, I believe in "god," but I don't think of him as a man in the sky with a beard.  God is just the emergent intelligence that's beyond our comprehension as lower-scale intelligence.

       I can understand that!   For me, this phrase is a nice condensation of an idea that I see over and over again in life.  I think of this phrase when I learn about fractal geometry and patterns observed in nature.  The patterns and shapes we see at the microscopic level of reality are similar to the ones we see at the macrocosmic level.  Look at a hive of bees, then look down at a city from an airplane.  I also think of this phrase when I think about the Taoist concept of Heaven &amp; Earth.  What you can conceive of up in the mental world of "heaven" can be expressed in the material world of "earth", but in order for something to be manifest here, it must first be thought about in the unseen world.  All events in the material world are preceded by an event in the unseen world.  Always, always always.   If you can prevent people from accessing this "unseen world," then they are limited to a "read-only" version of reality where the constructs of all their thoughts and experience are Lego-blocked together from what other people have already manifest here.  Every night you go to sleep and dream your private reality - then you wake up to the collective dream.  The only way to make the collective dream better is to sharpen your ability to access the mental realm

       I don't have time to reflect on this deeply at the moment, but anytime people use fractals with spiritual concepts I get interested (or any concept really, fractals are fascinating). 
My initial impression is that it seems like plato's realm of forms? 
Quick question, dreams interest me and you mention private reality - is this a throw away comment or do you have any suggestions of interesting places to read about dreams?

       Not a throw away comment at all:  Dreams are a way for you to observe the fractal nature of reality directly.

       Let's say that tonight you dream that you are I are sitting in a cafe having a discussion.  From your perspective within the dream world, you seem like you, and I am me.  We are two separate people.  From within the dream, it is difficult for you to conceive of the larger mind that exists outside the dream that is "dreaming" the two people inside.  But the minute you wake up from the "dreaming world," you return to the "waking world" and from this new perspective it is easy to see that it is you, the dreamer, who was creating two minds.  From within the dream it seemed like there was separation, two minds, duality.  But then you woke up and were like, oh yeah, one mind.  Me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now you are in the waking world.  Here you see many minds and are unable to conceive of the larger mind that is generating all of them.  But the minute you die, you will graduate into bardo of death and understand the larger mind that has been dreaming this entire universe.  These realms are called Bardos by the Tibetans.
      </p>

       Look into lucid dreaming if you like a science-y approach to your weirdness.  If you're up for the left-hand path, I'd highly recommend anything on dreaming by the very wonderful Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche.

       Interesting. I'll have a look ah these.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up lucid dreaming naturally until I was about 15. It then got reduced until I had anothing event at 17 where I lost the ability to exercise any free will within my dreams and had severe nightmares for a couple of years. Following that I dream regularly. Sometimes I know what they mean (or what I'm processing etc) and sometimes they are seemingly random and occasionally they are... different.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Christian I would potentially be inclined to 'translate' the concept to being one in Christ but I'll have to give it a read before I try and interpose my own metaphysicall structures and language onto it.

       I really don't know what to believe in anymore. 3 weeks ago I would have considered myself a militant atheist. Since my eyes opened to see the world is ruled by satanists within these past few weeks I have kept a more open mind. All the flood stories in ancient texts seem to match up with growing earth theory which I firmly believe in. So were they just stories? Now I'm on the fence. I used to think the Bible was used as a form of control. Now I'm thinking was I tricked into thinking that?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the elites spent all this money and time invested in satanic sacrifice, maybe there is something to the occult.

       If you wanna shit your pants on the flood thing, Randall Carlson has some good evidence for it and he guest stars on Joe Rogan's podcast multiple times. Highly suggest both his solo appearances, and the one with Graham Hancock. Graham Hancock is a writer so keep that in mind when he is speaking, but Randall has good info.

       I subscribe to the Christian Faith in Jesus Christ as the living embodiment of God; the person who genuinely establishes the relational connection and communion between the created reality and the divine reality, between humanity and God.
      </p>
      <p>
       My underlying preconception about knowledge is that we know things in accordance with the kind of thing which they are. This is the principle of
       <em>
        kata
       </em>
       <em>
        physin
       </em>
       , according to the nature, which is important to critical realism. Having studied philosophy and  Christian Theology I find myself generally convinced of the creedal confessions of the Church, though I would be the first to acknowledge that there are a plethora of opinions and streams of thought on almost every aspect of faith, from hermeuetics and the interpretation of scripture through to doctrines, Church History, ethics and the way in which faith engages with non-faith based spheres of knowledge (such as science; evolution, the big bang etc etc). That said, I believe that there is genuine truth present there and that when I think of God, I think of Jesus; the Palestinian Jew who was certifiably killed and was bodily resurrected before ascending into the presence of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also acknowledge my own personal experiences of both God and spirituality having an impact in the formation of my beliefs. However my main experience of God primarily assures me of his existence rather than generating any beliefs about him in isolation from scripture and the witness of the Church as a whole. As for my spiritual experiences, there's many different languages and schemes with which to discuss them and I'm still trying to figure that out. (Speaking of, if anyone knows of any works on dreams which you've found particularly thought provoking then let me know).

       Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them. ~ Steve Eley

       Man is certainly stark mad: he cannot make a worm, yet he will make gods by the dozen. ~ Michel de Montaigne

       I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours. ~ Stephen Roberts

       A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. ~ Albert Einstein

       When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi

       Yeh I belive in the God of the Bible. Was brought up as an Atheist in the UK. Woke up about 2/1 and a half years ago. Looked into all this nwo crap, the agendas they were pushing (LGBT,Mass immigration,destroying communities) Kept seeing Biblical references,occult symbolism and the push of Atheism onto the West particularly. Came to the conclusion I can't deny their is a spiritual side to this insanity. The elite wouldn't be doing this for fun would they.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looked into the Bible for 5 months give or take. Look at the prophesy's of the Bible (Basically the proof the Bible is true is the prophesy's it's predicted past/present and future) And I can see that it was right in the past. And prophesy's right now are lining up to be fulfilled. The Bible arguably has the most in depth prophesy's of any religious text. You can suggest that this is part of the nwo propagating the largest conspiracy ever in which the NWO started Christianity. Bought off ancient historians and kept the lie going now fulfilling prophesy's. But then why are they pushing Atheism so hard in the West?
      </p>
      <p>
       God is not a 'man' like everyone assumes he is in the Bible on a hill with a beard who's extremely old.We're made of Spirit,body and soul. Jesus is the Body, The holy spirit is the spirit, The Father is the Soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to question, why is Atheism being pushed so hard? Why are they trying to make faith seem stupid but continue to do occult practices themselves? If they control our leaders you have to have a free mind and say by in most they control the scientist's (bought them off or whatever) so a lot of that is dis-info as well.

       You're jumping too a subjective conclusion. You don't know me or why I chose faith. I guess the elite are doing these occultist rituals for fun right? Nothing to do with the fact they actually belive in what they're doing. Bohemian grove just for fun?  9/11 was a ritual, let me guess that was for fun? They slander Jesus constantly in mainstream media, is that for fun?

       I'd actually be disappointed if I had a child, free thinker and he turned out half as close minded as you. Don't even make me go into all the occult symbolism in these block buster Hollywood movies. Or the huge pedophilia rings. I think you yourself have some growing up to do.

       Again all the past prophesy's in the bible that came true. Due to the sheer amount it got right it has to be part of a grand conspiracy, or the luckiest piece of work ever written? haha please. Which you have no evidential basis to suggest a grand conspiracy.

       You're suggesting I'm not a free thinker because of my view on a faith. You yourself with that kind of opinion cannot be much of a free thinker. You're treating it as if I just went for a blind pick and chose one. I've studied this for 5 months before deciding whether their was truth in it or not. Can you tell me if you've ever read the text?

       Let me guess all the peasant J3w's like us are also involved with the some of the elite J3w's plot to control the word? What about the beast system described in the Bible? Sounds exactly like the NWO we're walking into.

       Yes I believe in God. I am a Christian. I believe in God and Yahshua and Satan. I prove there is a God, by proving that there is a devil. If there is a devil there must be a God because if there was only Satan things would be horrible and there would be no good in the earth. I know there is a devil (satan), because of mentally ill individuals whom I believe are inhabited by some type of demon. I feel that the spirit that possess these people is evil and effects there actions accordingly. Have you noticed that people never go insane and do positive things? I mean nobody goes nuts and starts randomly cutting there neighbors grass or washing everyones car on the block. This to me proves the existence of God and Satan.

       Its proof to ME. Everyone has to find a proof of God for themeselves. Looking for someone to prove Gods existance to you is illogical. If he IS real you can ask him yourself to reveal himself to you and he will. In fact he will reveal himself to you in a way that YOU will understand and recognize.

       You should be frightened by the world economy, the petro dollar, and whether or not we as people are destroying our planet with our habits. Instead your frightened by the opinion of a random person on the internet. Prioritize.
