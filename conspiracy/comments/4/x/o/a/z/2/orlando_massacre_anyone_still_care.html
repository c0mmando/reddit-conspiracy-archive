<p>Orlando did what it needed to do - galvanize LGBT, anti-gun, and pro-muslim groups to get politically active.</p>

<p>As the loose ends to Orlando die down in attention and media, so will the rabid pushes for gun control and everything else. The voters will need to be &quot;reminded&quot; again every so often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>San Bernadino shooting still messes with my head. One, what I&#39;ve been able to read about Tashfeen Malik is that she was very petite, however she managed to wear full body armor, while wielding a pistol and assault rifle like God-dammed Rambo, with both getting a staggering high kill rate. Plus, all early reports mentioned three shooters, not just two. Plus they disappeared for a few hours, then were found again in a rented, black SUV? There is so much about that shooting that makes little to no sense whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Charles Mesloh, Professor of Criminology at Florida Gulf Coast University, told NBC 2 News that he was shocked Cho could have killed 32 people with two handguns absent expert training. Mesloh immediately assumed that Cho must have used a shotgun or an assault rifle.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m dumbfounded by the number of people he managed to kill with these weapons,&quot; said Mesloh, &quot;The only thing I can figure is that he got close to them and he simply executed them.&quot;</p>

<p>Mesloh said the killer performed like a trained professional, &quot;He had a 60% fatality rate with handguns - that&#39;s unheard of given 9 millimeters don&#39;t kill people instantly,&quot; said Mesloh, stating that the handguns Cho used were designed for &quot;plinking at cans,&quot; not executing human beings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude come on with that bullshit. It&#39;s incredibly obvious you&#39;ve never fired a 9mm. </p>

<p>At close range (such as in a classroom) you don&#39;t stand a fucking chance! It&#39;s the most popular self defense weapon in the world for good reason. </p>

<p>A .22 is for plinking cans, and even those are deadly as fuck. They enter your body and usually don&#39;t exit. But they bounce around and knick everything up while they&#39;re in there, which is even worse. </p>

<p>That criminology expert you quoted sounds like a conspiratard douchebag. I&#39;d like to see how he holds up against a +P 9mm hollow point. I&#39;d bet my house his opinion changes pretty quickly. </p>

If it was,  it worked;  the Manson murders are considered by many to be the end of the hope of the sixties. The powers that be much preferred the apolitical sex and drugs and rock &amp; roll attitude of the 70s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not disagree with your points, however, I think it&#39;s dishonest to suggest that any of these incidents brought out more &quot;pro muslim&quot; groups than anti-muslim sentiment.</p>

<p>It&#39;d also be dishonest to suggest that it didn&#39;t rally the pro gun supporters, too.</p>

<p>LGBT was galvanised long before the shooting - Whatever people think of that is almost irrelevent - Gay marriage wasn&#39;t going anywhere before that.</p>

<p>No, if there&#39;s a global conspiracy of murder, it&#39;s for money, power, control. It&#39;s not to achieve some kind of communist system. Communism is an idea of economic equality ultimately, but the powers that be don&#39;t care about people being equal in any regard. In fact, they actively want us to be unequal so that we bicker among ourselves without rising up against the real enemy. The powers that be seek only to consolidate their power and subjugate the masses under corporate overlords for their own selfish means. This kind of corporatized domination is practically the exact opposite of what Marx would have wanted for the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slippery slope. Remember all the young, with-it liberals laughing at the idea of a slippery slope where morals were concerned? I do. They laughed, and laughed. Fact is, our society is boundlessly perverted and corrupt. It has been corrupted largely by the Jews and their pornography. One consequence of a society that is as perverse and corrupt as ours, is that any outrage, any obscenity, becomes possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lived in Pakistan for a good 18 years of my life, and I can tell you that Pakistani media is a bigger circus compared to that within the US. However, when tragic events like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu5oZ99zw8">bomb going off in a market</a> or <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xw588u_geo-news-firing-by-anp-terrorists-in-karachi-jinnah-hospital-in-front-of-rangers_news">armed gunmen breaking into a hospital to open fire on some poor soul occur</a>, the Pakistani media ALWAYS, I repeat, ALWAYS shows proper video evidence either from CCTV footage or nearby cell-phone users. Sometimes, when the identity of the perps has been confirmed, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtrpth_exclusive-cctv-footage-bomb-blast-in-haideri-market_news">CCTV footage showing them as well as the origin of the event</a> (e.g. blast) is also broadcast on the news. (anyone who doesn&#39;t speak Hindi or Urdu should mute the last two videos if they don&#39;t wish to be annoyed by gibberish). Also, GORE WARNING.</p>

<p>Now compare that to the absolute lack of such evidence when such massacres occur in the US, or even in Europe (Brussels, Paris, Charlie Hebdo etc.)</p>

<p>Some of the stuff surrounding the Orlando &quot;shooting&quot; is actually quite laughable, almost as if it&#39;s a blunt &quot;F*** you&quot; to the face from the authorities and the media. For example, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0thCKVuWts">one ABC News clip</a>, one of the alleged victims&#39; mother being interviewed is with almost a 100% certainty reading from a teleprompter (run-of-the-mill crisis actor). Creepily enough, this same mother later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3o_acLkn0I">returns to do another interview</a>. If anyone here with a sane mind has the stomach to go through the entire cringe-worthy crap of an interview (feels a little less worse with the commentary in the video, then he/she will notice screen reflections on this woman&#39;s glasses, indicating usage of a green screen and a teleprompter. </p>

<p>You think that&#39;s the end of it? I&#39;m happy to prove you wrong. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA4V85qMtjk">returns AGAIN</a>, smiling and laughing, I repeat, SMILING and LAUGHING a week later about her son&#39;s alleged murder, and please do not try to convince me that people grieve differently, because no one in their right minds would be smiling and laughing the way she did, especially after losing a son(the only reason she could possibly be laughing is probably because she got a huge payout from the donation put forth by gullible Americans duped into thinking this event was real). I ask you all, where else have you seen this behavior which is completely uncharacteristic of grieving family members? Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EArjNnrpbk">Robbie Parker</a>?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owJdEsMBVHQ">Here&#39;s one video</a> allegedly showing some of the &#39;victims&#39; being carried by friends. Did you notice? They were being carried BACK TO THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB! WHY???? Didn&#39;t they just allegedly escape a massacre there? To those claiming they were heading to the Paramedics , why don&#39;t the Paramedics and Ambulances go to them like protocols dictate? There&#39;s many other problems to notice as well - none of the wounded seem to exhibit symptoms of shock or pain from a fresh bullet wound, and NONE of their carries show any bloodstains on their own clothes (COME ON, GET IT RIGHT FOR ONCE YOU RETARDED CRISIS ACTING $%<sup>&amp;).</sup></p>

<p>But I&#39;ll save the best part of that video for last, of-course. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNewsknuBw">another related video</a>, you can actually see the people carrying an alleged victim drop him, and the proceed to casually converse and joke with him!!! LMAO, HOW DO PEOPLE STILL FALL FOR THIS SHIT?!</p>

<p>Still not convinced? How about the fact that Broadcastify, the world’s largest source of public safety, aircraft, rail, and marine radio live audio streams, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqS3gEWJknI">just so happens to be &quot;missing&quot; the three hours of police scanner audio from midnight through 3 a.m. on June 12</a>, the exact window the shooting took place in?</p>

<p>We won&#39;t know for sure until it&#39;s admitted, but this was nothing more than a giant hoax. If anyone was killed, it was probably just the patsies who knew about the &quot;crisis drill&quot;.</p>

<p>Are you saying that was the intent of the alleged conspiracy?  Because DAMN if they chose the wrong community and timing.  It was Pride month, the event brought a lot of people in the community closer together, and pride parades across the country were filled to the brim because that&#39;s what the LGBT community does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off topic, but here is my theory on the whole thing:</p>

<p>Under surveillance for years, Mateen was selected for use in a Operation on U.S. soil. Over a year&#39;s work was required to convince him of the legitimacy of his role. Once on board, the operation started for him months before the actual shooting. What really happened, and why?</p>

<p>Once it was determined that his views sided with the new islamic reform that is gaining ground every day, he was contacted by agents posing as a sleeper cell in the U.S. Their actions were to be the Herald that unveiled the cleansing fire of Allah that will sweep across the country. He was told that he was to play a central role in the coming war on american soil. His celebrity in Love City Jalalabad and The Big Fix, His father&#39;s connections inside the American and Afghanistan Government, and his own inside G4S were used to make him feel too important to lose. That he would survive, the only thing he needed to do was to prove his loyalty.</p>

<p>He started visiting the pulse nightclub many months before the night of the shooting. Learn the building, build his own hate against them and most importantly become a recognizable face. Eventually, the call was made to begin preparation for the shooting. The plan given to him was simple and foolproof.</p>

<p>He was to attack the the nightclub just before closing. Open fire and create some casualties, but the primary goal was to isolate and contain a large number of survivors. A hostage situation would be needed for him to escape. He was told that ally&#39;s inside the club would be ready to help facilitate this by sealing the emergency exits from the outside. Once the situation was under his control, He was to wait.</p>

<p>The last stage, and true goal was to occur once a large enough number of first responders amassed outside, several suicide vests and one car bomb where to detonate, killing the majority of them. Once the explosions occurred, Mateen was to remove his mask and outer layer of clothing away from living eyes and cameras. Then, as a known face, he would easily escape with the crowd.</p>

<p>The explosions never came, and he was killed. Just as planned by his handlers. The cleanup was simple as there was no connection to any known group. A select few trusted actors will help display the official narrative.The rest would be speculation but nothing could ever be proven. Nothing ever WILL be proven because there is no evidence of these events in existence. He was just a confused and distraught boy who did not know if he was gay or a ISIS lone wolf.</p>

<p>Who would manipulate someone to do this? WHY? There is no one official group behind this. Individuals Inside and out of the government are using paid operatives to complete their personal goals. That goal for now is control, but that&#39;s just the first part of the plan. The influx of refugees and additional created attacks will give more power to the things you already see. Militarized police, increased surveillance, unarm the people. I have my theories, but I dont know whats coming after that.</p>

<p>Do your own research and place the pieces together. This is truth we deserve to know it even if it cannot be proven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I don&#39;t know - I don&#39;t think this is necessarily suspicious though.  Some people would speak out, other people would spiral into crippling depression and lock themselves in their house for a month.  I think in instances like this, where they media don&#39;t smell a story, they tend not to hound the shit out of people.</p>

<p>2) I actually have no idea about this one.  Maybe it was staged - to what advantage I have no idea.  The only none conspiracy answer I would be able to suggest is that it was open entry, everyone was searched on entry, and he chose to sit there.</p>

<p>3) If it went down like was said, the brutality of that would be something I don&#39;t think anyone would want to responsibility of showing.</p>
