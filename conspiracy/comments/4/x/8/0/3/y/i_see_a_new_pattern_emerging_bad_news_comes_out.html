       I'm talking about Hillary being involved with the funding and arming of ISIS because she was Secretary of State during the Iraq war and the DoD's supplies have repeatedly ended up in ISIS hands and has been documented repeatedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So wikileaks comes out with this damning claim about clinton directly funding ISIS, and the next day Trump makes the "2nd amendment people" comment and goes full bonkers, and then immediately after starts talking about the ISIS being funded by Hillary stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same as this sub, where the truths are mixed with crazy derailing comments, so that people throw the baby out with the bathwater because they want to avoid the crazy. Trump is the IRL version of that, they allowed him through because he speaks the truth, but he's a wannabe dictator crazy guy. It's like you can't say anything bad about Clinton, because the rebuttal is always an enraged "Do you want Trump to win, asshole!?" Trump has been an amazing boon to the Democratic Party. As long as he says something, it's automatically untrue. So any inconvenient truths can be filtered through him by the media focusing on HIM saying it, as if he were the only one saying it, and then the message is lost because people reject the messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I say yesterday "Hillary played a big role in funding and supporting ISIS" because the wikileaks info comes out, and then today Trump says the same, and now I look like a crazypants Trump supporter and everyone is trying their best to ignore what I'm saying, for the good of the country as they see it. Because Trump must lose, so Hillary must win, so this Hillary-ISIS connection must be ignored at all costs. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It's been organized as a two party system to funnel people in to making "obvious" moral choices, a system which is exploited by Hillary and many other elected leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will ignore true information if you make the source of that information look bad. So if any true info goes through Trump, and the media focuses on him saying it over anyone else, most people will ignore the info. Amazingly advanced PR/propaganda tactics that I hope everyone understands thoroughly, because we will be seeing a lot more of it.

       Along those same lines, I find it strange that every time something bad about Clinton comes up, Trump says something stupid and whatever Hillary did gets swept under the rug.  It is almost like whenever he gets a chance to surge ahead he does something stupid to fuck it up.

       You nailed it. This was even the premise of a big piece in a Norwegian MSM newspaper (the biggest one) yesterday. The MSM itself, even though it's on Hillary's side, is actually openly acknowledging this problem. It's starting to be really obvious that Trump is a Clinton plant, and that he'll crash his own campaign to make sure she wins, despite how criminal she is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When even the Clinton-friendly MSM is starting to complain about how Trump is making Hillary look good, you know something is wrong with the guy.

       Yup. Interesting that is being talked about in Norwegian MSM. And then after losing he'll probably be appointed as a cabinet member or get some super-beefy government contract or something, as a payoff, in addition to all the fame he is getting now (which he obviously craves). I could easily imagine them having this agreement, or their handlers having this agreement.

       i was a little nervous that trump was going to win because of the supreme court justices, but if it's a bunch of gun control justices coming from hillary that's just as bad as a bunch of conservative justices coming from trump.  it's like abortion and civil liberties vs. guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is definitely a plant.  there was that news story about how the clintons called him up and got him to run, they used to be friends, probably still are.  that's why all the republicans were super nervous about him getting elected in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's crazy to watch donald trump do this to his image, i guess when you're a billionaire it doesn't really matter very much, and he's used to being disliked already anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's all just an illusion of choice.  if jill stein would've been smarter and kept her opinions on wifi to herself and distanced herself from the homeopathic side of shit, she still wouldn't have won, but would have set a precedent of getting at least double digit votes in the election for a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       people go on about how great it's going to be to have the first woman president, and how it breaks the glass ceiling, but they're not seeing the other side of the precedent that it sets, which is that an ex president's significant other is going to become president.  that harks back to monarchy in britain.  king and queen shit. a terrible fucking precedent.  bloodlines and dynasties right out the open.  they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr:  no matter what everyones fucked.  we're going to lose more of our rights.  trumps a plant.  it's just an illusion of choice.  royal blood lines sucked three hundred years ago and they still fucking suck.

       , then vote 3rd party because your vote doesn't matter anyway so might as well vote what you really want and say you tried, and perhaps get the ball rolling more for a 3rd party win in future elections. Won't solve everything, but it's one potential legitimate avenue of change so it's worth trying to pull that lever at least.

       I'd rather you vote for a third party to increase the chances of them getting federal funding for the future in hopes of maybe cutting up the duopoly, but you do you I guess. I can't exactly argue with that position, I have no confidence in the system either.

       But maybe if there is still just a little bit of life left in our election process a third party vote will make it an option on the future. The only thing keeping a 3rd or 4th option down now is the fact that people think they can't win. Self fulfilling prophecy.

       I didn't intend to imply it was a bad thing to vote for third party. The person I was responding to made it out to seem like they didn't want to vote at all. I attempted to make the argument that they should cast their vote for a third party instead of not voting. If you don't think the person(s) in power aren't fit to govern (no confidence) then it's time for a regime change. Voting third party wouldn't get that (my opinion), but it'd send a message and that message carries more weight the more people participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a lot of people do, that message is that a regime change is imminent if things don't improve.

       Every time her poll numbers start to tank or she says something stupid, he says or does something stupider. My family has said from the beginning that he's a boogeyman working for her. And he does make a great boogeyman!  Sometimes my tinfoil hat turns out to be right.

       Usually people say how did they know he would win the primary. But it was gonna work out either way. Trump's original plan that he shouted out countless times was to go third party which would have split the vote. I mean look at how all the Hillary people cried about Bernie not dropping out after super Tuesday, and waiting to effect the platform to endorse. It's lose lose.

       Yeah, it's like they're in a race to be the most outlandish, only Hillary's stuff is actual important stuff she did while acting as Secretary of State, whereas Trump's day-to-day scandals are mainly personality-based and based on his mouth that is out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's interesting like you said that when Clinton makes a big fuck-up, instead of Trump standing back and letting her make a fool of herself, he seems to instantly up the ante himself! It's like he's keeping pace with her, but her email leaks are setting the pace. Which to me just reinforces the idea that he is there to ensure that Hillary wins, whether he knows it or not. Both parties are bought out by the same military-industrial and big money interests, that at least is very clear at this point.

       The pattern i've noticed is that he always slips a 'gaffe' (intentionally) into a speech around the same time as something important.  Otherwise, the media will ignore his speech, and so will a lot of people.  However, if they think Trump called for an assassination, or kicked a baby out of his rally, they might check out a clip on youtube (or it even may end up on the news) of Trump saying something important, spliced in with the 'gaffe' that drew the viewer in in the first place.  IRL click-bait, basically.

       Except his popularity is steadily falling.  It's not like calling for assassination and yelling "Get that baby out of here!" brings in people who are subsequently moved by the rest of his comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go look at the baby one.  He's stuck in the middle of a "Tooker Jerbs!" rant loaded with misinformation and empty rhetoric.  It's attention grabbing, but if you're not part of Trump's "America is falling apart and only I can save it" cult, he's not saying anything to win you over.

       Right, so look at this way.  Your Joe Blow, 43 year old factory worker who just got laid off, has never been into (or even understood) politics, and rarely watch the news.  Now suddenly, you hear about this funny politician who's "literally Hitler" and is kicking babies out of his rallies, you see the clip, and hear that China is devaluing it's currency to give it an unfair advantage in manufacturing.  You've never been into politics, but this resonates with you, and so you start watching full Trump rallies and eventually, for the first time in your life, decide you are going to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind this is what Trump has been doing, he's luring in huge numbers of people who have never voted before, and have never been into politics, in an environment where the media is against him and he has(had) limited funds to work with.  For most, this would be an impossible task, and yet through this peculiar method, we are seeing results.  I don't think it's unintentional or surprising from  a man with an IQ of 156, who has written a book that includes quite a bit of information on how to work the media, to be planning out complex moves like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think what he's doing is stupid, but you are looking at it from your politically-minded perspective, as well as with whatever ideological biases you may or may not have.  People like you only make up a certain percentage of the potential-voting population, there is huge swathes of people that will respond to different things than you.

       So what are you saying? That Trump should go hide in a hole somewhere until November instead of traveling all over the country to rally his base? I'm sorry but no what Trump is doing now gives him a lot more votes. And the MSM is just trying their hardest to sabotage him.

       Full disclosure, I am a Trump supporter.   I don't think Trump is in on it at all.   The media just manufactures a controversy where there is none to take attention away.   The baby thing was a huge farce, you have CNN with fictitious articles up when they have anchors admitting on air they are trying to help her get into office, and yet I can't find a single, actual thing that makes Trump to be the person I used to also be fooled into thinking he was.   They are doing everything they can to smear the man.   Nobody who is as crazy as they say he is can be as successful as he has been.   They can't even get his exes or former employees to say anything bad about the guy.   The fact that their most legit bad finding about him was an incident of acting up in 2nd grade while the entire globalist establishment of both parties is scared shitless of him is enough to make me think he is genuine.

       Trump is making it too easy for them so smear him...OF freaking course the media is hugely biased, that's no secret.Whoever the GOP candidate was going to be, dealing with a biased media is just a fact of life. And I don't see any sort of evidence that these so called globalist are freaked out by him? In my honest opinion it was Cruz that really freaked them out because he is a boy scout (love it or hate it about him) that doesn't bend on principals. I clearly remember guys like Mitch McConnel and John Boehner being much more vitriolic towards Cruz than they've been to Trump...I mean doesn't Trump play golf with Boehner? And seriously, how can you ignore that Trump IS friends with the Clintons?

       That's somewhat true but no where near to the degree they have this time around. It's not even normal for the sitting President to be out campaigning for his successor let alone trash talking their opponent. An while the MSM always has a Liberal soft bias the level of bias we are seeing this time is unbelievable. What were seeing her is similar to what we saw with Brexit. Like Brexit a Trump presidency threatens the globalist gameplan.

       Trump was a huge celebrity and businessman for years.  He tried his hand in politics with the reform party years ago, until it got taken over by people he didn't want to associate with.  I don't think he wanted to be involved, but he can see the writing on the wall now with what the globalists are really trying to do in destabilizing the U.S. to the point of no return.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has never gone after a single candidate like they have with Trump.  This isn't normal liberal media shilling.  This is an insane amount of word twisting and flat out making shit up.  They are going after Trump at a level that far surpasses what they did to Romney and McCain.

       They don't need to manufacture anything. Trump really just is that outlandish. On being interviewed on his whole "Obama founded ISIS" remarks, while on a conservative talkshow, he
       <em>
        doubled down
       </em>
       and said he meant them
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       while the host pitched him every conceivable out. He actively and consistently made his words seem worse to the general public and got a conservative pundit to have to defend Obama by saying that he didn't think he founded or supported ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a good Occam's Razor explanation is that Trump actively doesn't want to be president but wants all the attention that comes with it. He'll milk this for what it's worth since he knows he's never going to have a better time in the spot like while simultaneously guaranteeing he'll never have any actual real responsibilities post election.

       Exactly this. The premise of the thread is that Trump is doing this on purpose to take the heat off Clinton. It's actually the MSM that is doing this on purpose to take the heat off Clinton. We know how corrupt the fucking MSM is. They create race riots for god sakes by taking things out of context. If they are evil enough to do that you don't think they will grab a sound byte from a Trump rally, and make him look like Hitler to distract from a skeleton falling out of Hillary's closet?

       I want to add that despite Trumps crazy antics, I guess that it will still remain a 49/51 race until the last second, so people are scared enough of Trump actually winning to make them relieved when Hillary wins. Also record numbers of people will vote 3rd party, and those people will be blamed for the loser not winning, of course. That's kind of how I see this going.

       When Trump announced his candidacy by copying the Simpsons bit frame for frame I knew the whole thing was a sham. Apart from the temporary irritation of Bernie's candidacy it's all gone according to plan. And the entire establishment is in on the joke - the media, both parties, the donors, and so on. That's why Trump isn't fundraising- he doesn't need to, and donors know the role he's playing. It actually works out better for donors as they can give to only one candidate instead of hedging with donations to both.

       Spot on. This actually has been his pattern since last fall.  I have friends who are very passionate about voting Trump.  They don't see this pattern.  I dislike Hillary's ways and could not vote for her.  It baffles me how people are so blinded by both candidates that they refuse to see the faults in both.  And when Trump acts this way after a Clinton scandal, Clinton's faults appear smaller than they actually are.  I have Dem friends who still believe she has never done anything wrong because she has not been attacked in the media or arrested.

       The entire show is produced behind the scenes. You need look no further than Trumps latest comment about the 2nd amendment taking all focus away from the Hillary /ISIS weapons sales to see the distraction.

       The architect of this strategy (which is very well described by you) is Prof. Cass R. Sunstein of Harvard. Author of the Orwellian work 'Conspiracy Theories,' and a principal Democratic strategist. "Guided free will" (technically termed "nudging and choice architecture") is the theoretical basis of the mass political control being employed here.

       I've been watching elections since 1976 and this is the most obvious cycle of news misdirection I have ever seen. However, I have to go back to last summer when it was suggested Trump was a plant for Clinton, which would explain a lot of why he can't just shut up and let her self-explode. He is giving her cover.

       I was reading a thread yesterday, people were saying how remarkably similar the RNC was to a WWE show, of which Trump was in many. Especially the part where Trump stormed out of the room while the guy he didn't like gave a speech, apparently.

       Yep. Wrestling isn't wrestling, it's a "reality" TV show about a "wrestling" competitions and the goings on therein. Trump's a reality TV star at his core, and this is just more of the same for him.

       There was that time he said he'd build a wall along the Mexican border and get Mexico to pay for it.  Then there's his budget proposal which involves, in no particular order, increased spending, lower taxes, and a surplus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he tried to win Kasich as his VP by promising to make him "The most powerful Vice President in history" in charge of both foreign and domestic policy.  That sort of raises the question... why would you want Trump as your President if he tacitly admits he won't actually be in charge of any actual policy.

       But a potentially unworkable idea isn't "crazy". At least not the "insane, this guy belongs in an institution" kind of crazy. And besides, the Great Wall of China is about 5000+ miles long. A US-Mexico wall would need to be around 1000-2000 miles long. A wall of that magnitude is definitely workable. The ancient Chinese did it.

       If you have the time, could you link that Kasich confirmation? Was it a confirmation that the conversation occurred or was it a confirmation that the actual reported words (e.g. you'll handle all domestic and foreign affairs) were said? I'm only seeing that NY Times Magazine report which cites an unnamed source.

       Ok, I can understand that people would think Trump's plans are crazy, but he's often spoken of as a "crazy" person. Those are two different things but easily confused in offhand comments.

       I meant the Great Wall as an example that such a dividing wall is actually "workable", although through great effort. The ancient Chinese were working with primarily manpower. Modern tech has excavators, diesel engines, concrete, etc. It should be much more workable now compared to then.

       He only seems crazy if your perception of him comes only from the anti-Trump media. If you watch his speeches and hear what he says in the context he says it in then he does not seem crazy. He seems like any politician saying things to work the crowd.

       This. His speeches (when viewed in context, instead of sound bites) do not see, crazy or outlandish at all. I swear I heard his rally speech when he said that 2nd amendment quote and thought nothing of it. Then later in the day I see that sound bite all over the news.

       When I listen to his speeches, I can't figure out what he's trying to say. It's word salad. But in a way, that's genius - listeners hear what they want to hear. When you really read his words without your own prejudices and desires at play, they're blank.

       Neither? I'll vote third party. But if I could only choose one of the two, I'm honestly not sure, but I'm 51/49 towards Hillary because at least we wouldn't lose as much face internationally, and wouldn't be run by a hothead. But in reality the same result would come from either of them being elected, that is more war and more money for the banks and military-industrial complex.

       See that is where you lost track of the big picture. Hillary won't just be more war and more money for the banks and military-industrial complex...business as usual. It is more serious than that.  They are working towards an agenda and she is to continue that agenda. Once Hillary has the majority in the supreme court the constitution is over, meaning this country is over.  Trump and Hillary don't matter. The only thing that matters is that the supreme court opening is filled by a judge that will actually follow the constitution instead of reinterpreting it to fit the needs of the agenda.

       So you just given up and are ready to submit? That's BS the supreme court is evenly split between those that interpret the constitution mostly how it was meant to be and those willing to re-interpret it to fit the needs of their political masters. The open seat decides which side gets a majority vote. I've seen Trump's short list for judges and they all have a long history of following the constitution. We all know what Hilldog's pick will do. 2cd amendment gone.. We know that for a fact.. 4th and 1st severely chopped.. who knows what else.

       Just because I accurate date when things went bad doesn't mean I've given up. Trump would be a failure of a president because he has a history of being an actor, and a history of selling out at the first opportunity to the highest bidder, which will be the military-industrial complex.

       You've already admitted that Hillary would sell out to the military industrial complex, banks, and war. So that argument cancels it's self out. They will both sell out.  But one plans to put a constitution following supreme court judge in and the other plans to put a sell out judge in. That is the only difference. Trump is the lesser evil. Trump's judge will save what's left of the country from being dismantled until we can take it back somehow. Trump equals hope for the future. Hillary equals submission to the end of America as we know it.

       Trump is not a lesser evil. He is just a greater unknown, but judging by his past, I'd say he'll do whatever the person with the most money says. I really think it's a wash. Except Trump makes America look bonkers on the international stage, which isn't good either

       <em>
        why

       he's saying that?"  Just another crazy Trumpism, oh my, no need to dig deeper on that story, regular Americans!

       Exactly. They're too busy shooting the messenger to pay attention to the message. The top 3 levels of the pyramid of disagreement are ignored, truly avoiding enganging the actual arugment:

       I believe the high council is the committee of 13. and HRC is just another puppet of the high council.

       no I dont think HRC did all of this. I mean look at her, she is not very smart. and her health is dwindling, just like Bill's.

       I edited my post to explain a bit more. But basically I think theres a lot of people who think they're "doing the right thing" by ignoring any bad information about Clinton that might help Trump win. They feel by ignoring and shunning this information, they're doing a moral good for the nation and future generations. Especially since they see the bad news coming from Trump, a guy who is a known liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of there being a national discussion about how Hillary had a role in funding ISIS to overthrow Assad, we are instead watching a media focused on laughing at a clown saying violent nonsense, of which there are some truths thrown in there too. But everyone dismisses the truths, because it looks like Trump came up with these ideas himself, because the media frames it that way. So hundreds of millions of good-intentioned Americans are being very very quiet right now despite knowing deep down something is wrong. The willful ignorance, in the name of the good of society. Those are the well-intentioned bricks that are paving the road to hell.

       Trump may be sabotaging his own campaign, and he may be helping Clinton win.

       I noticed this too. I think it probly has more to do with the media scrambling to find any other thing to talk about than Hilary's fuck ups.

       , then vote 3rd party because your vote doesn't matter anyway so might as well vote what you really want and say you tried, and perhaps get the ball rolling more for a 3rd party win in future elections. Won't solve everything, but it's one potential legitimate avenue of change so it's worth trying to pull that lever at least.

       The pattern i've noticed is that he always slips a 'gaffe' (intentionally) into a speech around the same time as something important.  Otherwise, the media will ignore his speech, and so will a lot of people.  However, if they think Trump called for an assassination, or kicked a baby out of his rally, they might check out a clip on youtube (or it even may end up on the news) of Trump saying something important, spliced in with the 'gaffe' that drew the viewer in in the first place.  IRL click-bait, basically.

       To cause a revolution to destabilize the existing government so they can install a new one? Or just entrench the existing one even more deeply? What's the end game here, and who is benefiting and driving all this?
