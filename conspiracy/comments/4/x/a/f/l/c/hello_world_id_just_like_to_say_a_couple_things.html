        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In all honesty, I would leave if I were able.  I would happily pack up and reestablish myself somewhere else.  Living here is almost at the point of being unbearable with the constant propaganda and all out lies forced on us every day.  I try to disconnect from it all, but it just isn&#39;t possible to avoid the insanity.  As all of you know, it&#39;s not just the elections.  People have changed.  I&#39;m old enough to recall a time when it wasn&#39;t like this.  I&#39;m not seeing anything to be optimistic about, not in this country.  Nothing ever seems to improve or change for the better, it&#39;s now just a downhill slide toward oblivion, a race to the bottom.</p>

<p>Before someone accuses me of not being the change I wish to see, I cannot prove it to you, but I have been.  I&#39;ve called my senators, emailed, protested for what I believe in, even in Washington DC.  I&#39;ve attempted to change minds, to discuss important topics with people I know, and bring about awareness.  But it&#39;s not getting better, is it?  It&#39;s getting dark in America.  This empire is sinking.  We are not a bastion of freedom and liberty, we are anything but that.  </p>

<p>I just wanted to shout this feeling this one time.  I expect the trolls to have a good time attacking me on this thread even though I write this with a heavy heart.  Look what we&#39;ve become folks.  Take a good look around.  Am I the only one who does?  It really feels that way.</p>

<p>Edited to add this.  Where are the youth of today, the ones whose future is at risk?  One of my favorite quotes is: <strong>“A Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.”</strong>  So where are the old men who plant trees?  Every single day I wonder where these people have gone, and every single day I see injustice, greed, hubris, cynicism and unchecked corruption.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>I think fixing the U.S. problem is no small part of the equation - yes.  I also think that since this dynamic is indeed very much global, the diligence must be maintained <em>everywhere</em> - not just the U.S. - if the problem is to <em>remain</em> fixed after a fixing of the U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are in agreement, then, my friend. What America appears to have forgotten or at least have been pressured to forget is that Liberty is something that you must actively fight for. Liberty is a process, not a destination, it is something you must continually strive for. My fellow countrymen have forgotten this simple fact, and as a result have failed to keep the spirit of liberty alive. I&#39;m convinced we could live in a police state and idiots would still be grilling on July Fourth celebrating independence day. Now, I don&#39;t like Mark Dice, but I was watching his channel and one of his videos hit me like a sack of bricks. He was patrolling the beach on July Fourth asking people what we are celebrating. 95% knew we were celebrating &quot;liberty&quot;, but they did not know who we were liberated from, what the names of the war was, who wrote our constitution, why a constitution is important. This is why we are so pitiful today. Our education has been engineered by the Rockefellers to meld us into pliable machines, not into intelligent thinkers. And they have succeeded. </p>

<p>It requires discipline and diligence, and we have grown weak and soft in our supposed privilege - a privilege we have been fooled into thinking we have when little could be further from the actual truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad that so many people confuse a unified humanity with &quot;only&quot; being able to take place via some sort of nefarious NWO agenda.  One isn&#39;t necessarily the other by ANY stretch of the imagination.  Not everything TPTB come up with should be exclusively associated with them and them only.  They aren&#39;t the only group that propose a one world idea.  There are many others that talk about a unified planet and species (as we are and should be) WITHOUT it having to be ruled over in some evil and nefarious way.</p>

<p>It CAN be evil and nefarious IF IT&#39;S DONE WRONG; if it&#39;s given the wrong direction.</p>

<p>It, again, doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be that way, however.</p>

<p>Your implying that I am or was thinking about or trying to advocate for the type of evil NWO point of view that is negative and self-serving of only a few figures at the expense of everyone else is not only consummately wrong and the <em>exact OPPOSITE</em> of what I in fact was and am referring to, but also quite small-minded.</p>

<p>So then call it whatever you want.  I&#39;m not referring to what you&#39;re referring to here.  I think &quot;Catholicism rebooted as Scientism, with all the usual hypocrisy&quot; is most definitely <em>not</em> what the planet should move toward.  Of course not.  However, this is in no way to say that a global, unified human civilization working together as one intelligent species and that is NOT ruled over by some covert, nefarious group(s) is <em>not</em> an ideal thing to move toward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So selling your version of a Coca Cola commercial on Reddit is evangelizing the same garbage, while the elite go and covertly blow the fuck out of the next Syria and tell us how they can help us all get along...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>really</em> seems like you&#39;re coming here trying to argue just to argue - which is a really sad thing considering that you&#39;re apparently not even understanding that I&#39;m not even disagreeing with you (smh).</p>

<p>NEFARIOUSNESS is <em>not</em> what anyone should want.  By any means.  However you try to couch whatever you&#39;re trying to describe, elites trying to manipulate and take advantage of others isn&#39;t anything that the population should ever want or support, and I&#39;m not even implying anything counter to that.</p>

<p>All that said, NONE of this has <em>anything</em> to do with anything I stated above in my initial point.  I was and am referring to (again, I say) a unified humanity working together as the one species we are APART from all the underhanded machiavellian machinations that currently exist.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t wrap your mind around a planet that is unified without thinking that it can&#39;t be under anything other than some nefarious &quot;NWO&quot; rule?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I understand this sentiment in the sense that it does seem that much of humanity is quite ignorant.  However, do you think unity would be possible if everyone had the level of consciousness that, say, <em>you</em> had?  Do you think that a species with members at your level of evolution/intelligence/consciousness would be a species capable of combined unity?</p>

<p>If you don’t think that a world where everyone was as smart or evolved as you would be capable of unity, then fair enough.  If you <em>do</em> think that a world where everyone was a smart as you <em>would</em> be able to have communal cooperation and peace, then what you’re saying when you say that the human species is not capable of global cooperation and peace is that the human species, as a whole, is not as smart or evolved as <em>you</em> are.</p>

<p>I personally don’t think that the human species in general is incapable of grasping global cooperation, and a big part of the reason why I think that is because I look in the mirror and know that <em>I</em> am not incapable of it.  I can grasp it - I can understand and visualize it.  <em>I</em> can do it in may day to day activities.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, we project what we see in ourselves on to the world, and not the other way around - for after all, you are not a product of your society.  Your society is a product of <em>you</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe in several millenia what you state is possible, maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  We are currently <em>just</em> getting out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Kali Yuga</a> - also known as the Iron Age, which is the worst, most debauchery-filled age said to exist as far as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">stellar cycles are concerned.</a>  We are now just entering into the next cycle - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treta_Yuga">The Treta Yuga</a> - where things are a bit more evolved.</p>

<p>What I described initially in terms of global unity is said to be what happens during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Yuga">Satya Yuga</a>, the most evolved age in the stellar cycles that our sun takes part in.  And yes.  We are indeed millennia away from the Satya Yuga at this point.</p>

<p>I do not think it’s impossible for a species to make an effort toward greater evolution regardless of what stage of their individual or collective development they’re at, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any such notion spouted in this day from major sources is just propaganda with some agenda, the rest is naïve repetition...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you think everything I’ve stated up to this point is either “just propaganda with some agenda” or “naive repetition”?</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>You know every little indeed of what’s really going on if that’s what you think.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true, though. See ancient Greece and the City States. If  a nation was attacked in the Union, each city state had to agree it was in the best interest of their City State, then the Union to lend men/arms. Many times it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Voluntarism is more society + economics, whereas An-Cap is purely economics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can totally understand where you are coming from. I was here yesterday morning - when my wife woke up I was telling her we are moving <em>expletive x 10</em> out of this country or I am going John Galt and paying the minimum taxes possible to this corrupt government.</p>

<p>I realize this is probably one of the better places to live in the world and many would change places with us but the unreasonable people make us so angry.</p>

<p>Here I sit on social media about to say we need more PHYSICAL action. And you and I (everyone) needs to do MORE and that might mean uncomfortable things.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve promised myself that I&#39;m going to do real protest on next issue pissing me off - either making a sign and going to the first over-pass and protesting OR if severe enough I&#39;m getting in my car and driving to D.C. to protest even if it costs me my job. </p>

<p>One last note, if things get bad enough I believe it is our responsibility to &quot;take down&quot; treasonous government. When I say take-down I mean through legal means of course. </p>

<p>If I was an electronics geek and knew how to root my phone and replace the firmware - well that could be a form of protest (I think Obama made it illegal... roll eyes) or if you had a squirt gun that shot black paint and could strike CCD&#39;s (water paint of course) - well there may come a time where civil disobedience is needed. John Galt for example he knows a lot about it and I happen to know some six-figure or I should say Ex-six-figure John Galts that are hoping Trump is elected so they can try plugging back into the Matrix.</p>

<p>Feel you brother. We need to do more one-on-one communication too - if you live in North Florida contact me I&#39;d live more like minded friends. Peace to all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Civil Disobedience might be the next step if you feel that political means are exhausted. Get creative - you can cut off the enemy money supply, disrupt enemy spy network, create alternate communication channels, withdraw your talent or misdirect it, disrupt supply lines. Obviously you need to balance legality, danger to others and morally weigh these issues against the moral crimes you are fighting against. Very tough subject - but one we live with. Stay strong (physically too), Network (physically)... war is coming.. makes me think of Game of Thrones (winter is coming)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re many who have these thoughts every day. I do, however, feel that there&#39;s hope for us to rise through the ashes that might be tomorrow or break the ship before we crash. Not only does the new age technology bring medium where we can out the wrong in the world but it&#39;s also a way to communicate in a different manner.</p>

<p>We&#39;re using this new technology such as the internet to spread lies that was told to us. This is &quot;waking&quot; people up. But also do I see a trend in the whole &quot;peace and love&quot; movement which I think could be a great part in the coming years. We need people with the heart in the right place. Not to lead, give orders or be in a governing position, but just for the sheer example for the future.</p>

<p>I am absolutely convinced that love and compassion for one another is a global solution. We all are grounded in a ideology that we should help humans across the globe with food, water, shelter and medicine. Yet we&#39;re not doing this and people can see this and are not agreeing with it. We&#39;re not bound to the tunnels of media our government supply to us anymore, we&#39;re bound to our own tunnels and we&#39;re the early components to start off this new system.</p>

<p>We&#39;re the first of our kind to experience the strength of videocameras, internet, social media and other things and see how it changed the planet in just a few years. What about another 10 years?</p>

<p>I truly believe we&#39;re going to experience one of the greatest revolutions our kind will see. Hopefully will I see you all on the other side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fairly safe overall, it has good and bad places, just like anywhere else. People are usually quite friendly, the cost of living is very low, compared to America. The cities, like Bogota, are enormous, and have some of the best public transportation on the globe. They&#39;re also some of the safest cities in the world- Colombian cops are everywhere. Colombia also just legalized recreational cannabis usage, and there&#39;s going to be an insane amount of business opportunities, especially for savvy Americans. Imo, Colombia is one of the most progressive, forward thinking nations on earth, and I really like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word &quot;You&quot; is corrected to &quot;One&quot;. Sometimes when speech is free humans will refer to &quot;you&quot; as all people not an individual, however then you&#39;ve got to recognize that from the way the person says it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually the primary sense of the word in depersonalized communications. You&#39;ve likely seen it used that way 10 times already.</p>

<p>But you would agree that U.S. is the cancer that is metastasizing, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. certainly seems to be a nexus of malignancy.  I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that notion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You fix the U.S. problem, you fix the world&#39;s problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think fixing the U.S. problem is no small part of the equation - yes.  I also think that since this dynamic is indeed very much global, the diligence must be maintained <em>everywhere</em> - not just the U.S. - if the problem is to <em>remain</em> fixed after a fixing of the U.S.</p>
