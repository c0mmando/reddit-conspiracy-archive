       I'm not too sure about Hillary Clinton's campaign trying to hit R/conspiracy but I do know that the massive influx of pro trump posts over the last few months has made me even more skeptical than i already was of this sub. I guess that's my fault for assuming that most conspiracy theorists are anti fascism. If you support Trump or Hillary you're voting for the same systemic oppression that we've all seen our whole lives. Hillary is a war criminal who has put her time in to destroying foreign policy, She doesn't deserve anything but a prison sentence. That being said to the people who don't/won't support her and keep talking about how there's some massive cover up by the global elite to stop Trump from getting elected you're just tin-foiled to the fucking roof. I'll never get how people be swayed to vote against someone who has no remorse for their actions by voting for someone who has no remorse for their actions. Trump will do as much to "make america great again" as Hillary will do to take the occupied land of Palestine away from Israel. Either way your vote is for the system in place. Stop wasting my fucking time with these bullshit TRUMPS GETTING SILENCED posts.

       Your title - Anyone else thinks the number of posts here in r/conspiracy about Donald Trump and his campaign manager getting funds from Russia are being repeatedly posted by Clinton war machine?
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer in a nutshell - Sure, its 100% possible, plausible and even probable that posts that are anti trump are from the Clinton campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       explained: I do not however believe that all the posts are from her campaign directly (im including them buying bots to post, paying supporters to post and down/upvote and staffers who's job it is to sway internet discussions) I think a lot of her supporters like to try and discredit their opposition as much as trump likes to do to Hillary. The issue i have is, Trump and Clinton are the same. So as long as the discussion is still Evil Clinton is trying to use her trickery to win vs Heroic Donald or vice versa, then I think the discussion is dead before it even started, as you're still arguing for a representative for the same systemic oppression and war mongering that we've had in place.

       The basis for the assumption that because I'm pointing out potential interference by Clinton but I'm in no way endorsing Trump, too many people think that it's mutually exclusive (hatred for the candidates) I support neither.

       The bitch has people killed that oppose her. She controls the media. She supports the globalist take over.
       <strong>
        She is not a liberal or progressive. She is a wallstreet shill and neocon warmonger.
       </strong>
       She is openly going to remove parts of the constitution...  This is not just a little policy disagreement. No one with half a mind supports her. Only those that are paid.

       That's what i was trying to say. Trump and Hillary are the exact same. The only thing that makes her more dangerous (by a long shot) is she's had time to perfect her strategy. She's been playing the game way longer. But if you think by getting trump somehow anything will be different I wholeheartedly disagree.

       This is what I try telling everyone. Then I get called a shill, I must not want to make America great again, etc.

       It's so fucking funny to me how people don't see the 100 percent parallel to Obama in 08. It's straight mind boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will be a bigger warmonger in the middle east for his Israel buddies than Obama ever was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch. And the dolts will support it even though he's said he'll be a non interventionist. Just like Dubya in his run up to the white hours in 2000.

       That being said though, Hillary is more of a threat to the middle east than Trump could ever be. In my opinion, If you think we have a difference in choice between these two candidates then you're greatly mistaken.

       Exactly. Both are a threat to the middle east. Whoever wins will do what is planned. I have no idea why people think otherwise.

       People have literally said to me that Trump is just playing the game to change shit when he gets in. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaha. Yea right!

       Woah, Woah, Woah. in no way shape or form did my sentence equal what you pushed out. Fuck Hillary Clinton, Shes a career criminal and a war monger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a neofacist and a overall just piece of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is it doesn't take the "global elite" to push a conspiracy that discredits trump. People will do that on their own as not many people want a fucking fascist as their president. Don't get me wrong I think Hillary is worse than Trump by a long shot, But I don't see Trump being some champion for the people who's getting no coverage because he's actually trying to implement change. Hes not an outsider or a Third party, hes just another head for the ruling party, As is Hillary.

       With highlights missing from the entire center of the sentence. You're the worst type of person to try and speak to. I don't think you should support Hillary for a single fucking talking point. But when you use your hate for her to push a candidate like Trump. Fuck off.

       This story and the one about Trump being a Democrat plant to throw the election. Russian ties and throwing the election for Hillary seem to be the only campaign themes her paid group of trolls can come up with. 3 more months of this crap.
