<p>tptb certainly aren&#39;t, bro.  They&#39;re not mature in that sense <em>at all</em>.  It&#39;s all about guns and war and killing and violence with them.</p>

<p>The people, however, outnumber them and can show tptb that OUR level of peace can overwhelm their level of violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little troubling that you&#39;ve linked a 12 minute youtube video instead of a scholarly article. And you somehow think this will solve all our problems.</p>

<p>Gifting. Sounds nice in theory -- if everyone gave everything away for free then surely things would improve! Except that would lead to an incredibly inefficient allocation of resources. Think about demand economies where workers aren&#39;t incentivized because there efforts are rewarded proportionally with pay-out that they get i.e. no profits. It leads to workers doing the bare minimum, commune leaders lying to central authorities, nearly empty shelves and an incredibly inefficient production process all around. That&#39;s what happens when people get paid a regular wage; how do you think people will act when they aren&#39;t paid at all?</p>

<p>What incentive do I have to work if people will be gifting me stuff? You might say: &quot;sure, if people are gifting me stuff and I want to continue getting gifts, then I have work!&quot; If that&#39;s the case, then what&#39;s the difference from getting paid with money? The only thing I can think of are locally distorted prices due to inefficient liquidity and market separation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going to take an understanding of &quot;why&quot; we should work well for 4-8 hours a day (we can determine the hours as needed). </p>

<p>For one, as you work, you improve the quality of life for the whole planet including your own life. The more we output, the more we get. That alone is very motivating. </p>

<p>Second, you work only your passions and switch jobs anytime with a 2 week notice. Now, work time becomes play time. You literally play to win. This is insanely motivating. Maybe you want to build gardens for the homeless. Go for it!</p>

<p>Third, the elite are taking huge chunks of our work for themselves. You might work 8 hours a day, but the elite is leeching 4 of your hours worth of work at least. They essentially make money through your work although they are not even a part of your company!!!  Why? Because it&#39;s so easy to vacuum up money when you have enough money to build a money vacuum. This here is the major problem and why money will never work. </p>

<p>4th, your mind will be a lot more peaceful. You will depend on your comrades, and they will depend on you. Our fate will change from the choices of the elite and revert back into self responsibility. We will be responsible for ourselves and ALL of our work will be rewarded since the elite won&#39;t be able to leech off of us. </p>

<p>Is that motivation enough? Fear nothing my friend. Fear is all that holds us back. We need to move now, not 25 years from now when this place turns into a third world country. </p>

<p>That sounds terrible. I don&#39;t want you anywhere near my work or you might do some serious damage. Tell me, would you trust yourself to perform risky surgery?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Third, the elite are taking huge chunks of our work for themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me get this straight, you expect &quot;the elite&quot; to share profits on a business that you never invested into in the first place?</p>

<p>You stop working, your income stream stops. I stop working, my income stream stops AND I LOSE MONEY.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This here is the major problem and why money will never work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to say this but you&#39;re a fucking idiot. Commercialization and increasingly activist governments in monetary policy has directly lead to the liberalization of society and the uplifting of the have-nots into what we now call &quot;the middle class.&quot; Literally none of that would have been possible if not for finance and you would still be farming the same plot of land that your ancestors before you farmed instead of bitching on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our fate will change from the choices of the elite and revert back into self responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a nice, easy way to distribute responsibility, isn&#39;t it? The &quot;elites&quot; are baddies that interfere with your quality of life!</p>

<p>You are already responsible for yourself and ALL of your work. If you want to be rewarded, earn some money and invest in a business. Let&#39;s see how you handle that shit because, kid, you need some perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that motivation enough? Fear nothing my friend. Fear is all that holds us back. We need to move now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re preaching to the choir and indeed the reason you speak about fear is because your very perspective is dominated by fear.</p>

<p>Things are already moving, you&#39;re just now realizing it. Except you want everyone to give you free stuff.</p>

<p>Tell me, what happens to your system when someone understands but disagrees with your motivations and doesn&#39;t want to cooperate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no. Most of our output is going to the 1%. We barely get anything back. </p>

<p>When I say working passions, it doesn&#39;t mean doing stuff that only doctors can do. If someone&#39;s passion is surgery, they still have to go to medical school like we do now. Follow your passion but qualifications are still necessary. </p>

<p>The elite have so much wealth, it has destroyed the economy and people are suffering. I don&#39;t care if the elite own companies like Google and make 100 billion a year. This system is killing us. We don&#39;t need to take their money. They can keep it. Sacred economics doesn&#39;t use money. </p>

<p>Leave the past where it is. If capitalism worked back then, great! But it is not working right now. It&#39;s time for a change. We don&#39;t need any of the old models. We need a brand new model and sacred economics is a great one. </p>

<p>Another important point is that we are all responsible for each other. The self centered egotistical approach manufactures misery because we are in fact a social species and highly dependent on each other. Take care of yourself and take care of your people works. I am rolling in dough myself but I am trying to save the future here. I don&#39;t want to lose anything just like you don&#39;t want to lose the wealth you produce for yourself. I have determined that we are intending to navigate towards a solid economy but the path we have taken is heading into a different direction. The unintended destination is poverty for the masses which effects us all. When the people don&#39;t have purchase power, the entire economy crashes. </p>

<p>If not for your fellow Americans, what about your children and grandchildren. At the very least, think about their futures. If not, crime pays well and this country will turn into Mexico. </p>

<p>Wake up out of the insanity. You might be doing well now, but you are still in an Oligarphy that wants to suck your wealth dry and eventually will. They work every day to ensure the drainage of wealth from us. They are essentially mad and we are being now ruled by madmen. </p>

<p>What&#39;s your point? Labor is worth less and less and capital worth more and more -- this is a naturally, efficient outcome arising from increasingly better technology e.g. automation and has honestly nothing to do with your bigoted view of &quot;elites leeching off us.&quot; No what?

<p>I&#39;ve just now realized (perhaps admitted to myself) you&#39;re woefully unequipped to have this conversation. I&#39;m going to keep responding to the rest of this post but I will discontinue further contact with you because you don&#39;t understand the other side of your position well enough to debate it. &quot;Big red dogs are the fucking solution to world hunger.&quot; That&#39;s what you sound like to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s time for a change. We don&#39;t need any of the old models. We need a brand new model and sacred economics is a great one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that we need a new model but sacred economics isn&#39;t a great one, not at all, because the only thing that you&#39;ve done is transferred ALL present consumption to future consumption. If you don&#39;t have money then the only thing you have is credit. Credit is just debt from the other side and natural outcome of &quot;sacred economics&quot; will be an accumulation of debt by the best gift givers eventually reverting to a form of feudalism. In fact, that might be how feudalism came about in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another important point is that we are all responsible for each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely! That&#39;s the way you want it to be but that&#39;s not the way that all people think. What if they disagree with you? You going to force a gun to their head or eject them out of utopia? You can&#39;t force people to be a way that they don&#39;t want to be -- that&#39;s why communism failed so spectacularly. That doesn&#39;t mean communism is necessarily a bad economic model but the technology/culture of the time doesn&#39;t allow it to work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the people don&#39;t have purchase power, the entire economy crashes.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s not necessarily true because purchasing power is normalized to per unit currency. What you&#39;re really griping with is a lack of income to consume with, in which case, you should either be trying to stimulate demand or, in my opinion, trying to address the fundamental problems associated with &quot;consumption based on income&quot; in a world where income (cost from the other side) continues to decrease.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? Your emotional rhetoric underscores AND highlights your shallow thinking. If you really want to change the world, learn what the fuck you&#39;re talking about before preaching to others because I assure you, you&#39;re either going to create a deluded mass of followers or a visceral contrarian reaction to your bullshit, neither of which will help our children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Wealth isn&#39;t a zero-sum game; the only reason it appears that way is because the wealthy have more avenues of opportunity due to increasing technological vectors. As they become unburdened by labor costs, they have access to more opportunities while the working class has fewer opportunities due to lower demand for labor. They aren&#39;t stealing your money, you&#39;re giving it to them without the ability to make it back. Honestly, you are creating enemies where there need be none. In the aggregate, people are generally rational and it isn&#39;t their fault that they are pursuing the optimal path; policy just isn&#39;t catching up fast enough.</p>

<p>P.S. -- it&#39;s Oligar<strong>ch</strong>y</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxes are for the purpose of maintaining public goods -- for example, the military and/or welfare programs. Neither venture is profitable so no rational actor would invest money; without money, neither of these ventures could exist but they are arguably necessary for a well-functioning society. How do you propose to pay for &quot;public goods&quot; if not for taxes?</p>

<p>In other words, why do you think they are irrelevant?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is simply not true. taxation goes towards the interest on the national debt and nothing else (profits for banks which create it). Inflation of the entire monetary pool each year is enough to pay for any public service, such as the ones that do not get provided.</p>
