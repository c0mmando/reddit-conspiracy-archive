       America isn't gonna wake itself up man, its up to people like you and I to fight the information war and beat back the propaganda.  Start doing research into Edward Bernays, and Gustav Le Bon.  Read their books.  Look into George Soros and the Tavistock Institute.  Fill your mind with information and use it as a weapon to fight back.  The only way we're gonna take this country back is by changing the ideological paradigm.  We all know this.  No amount of violence is going to fix this problem.  A revolution wont do a thing.  All we can do is fight lies with truth.  I do what I can.  Please join me

       Thank you. This is an excellent post!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked in history and as a publicist for years. I know Bernays well.  Sharing informative posts like this is what will give people seeds and inspiration to come to their own realization.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've inspired me to get back to posting more informative comments and responses. I was getting shit on in r/politics and r/sandersforpresident before they went completely sour. I need to get back on it.

        To join you, I want to share a challenge to research revolutions.  Find the commonalities between current global political uprisings, and the revolutions that rocked the world approx 100yrs+ ago.

      <p>
       Including historical revolutions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Progressive Movement in US  (were US officials &amp;amp; elite scared of rev. similar to Bolsheviks or French?)
       </li>
       <li>
        French Revolution (
        <em>
         very
        </em>
        similar themes today, think about enlightenment = Internet)

       <li>
        Chinese Revolutions
       </li>

      <p>
       Why didn't other revolutions work? What can we learn from these?

       Brilliant, thank you for getting involved.  i will be sure to research those movements you posted.  A big part of this is we cannot let ourselves get bogged down by getting shit on by those who dont understand.  I try and make rational comments to both subs you mentioned whenever possible, and I defend my positions.  We should all do so, not only on Reddit, but across all websites, and in real life too.  We have to fight this thing on all fronts.  I for one am tired of living in a world run by the elite cabal and I'm going to do something about it or die trying.

       Heh, you must be pretty new to the internet. Welcome. But Google Reader was a feed reader... With feed readers you choose which sites you subscribe to via RSS. You had to skim a lot more, but you didn't have to deal with vote brigading, click baiting and a bunch of other shit that's ruined journalism. Google closed it down because people started flocking to twitter, reddit and fb for their news instead. And now look where we are. Sad.

       Exactly! It's good to know what messaging you're up against when trying to lead ppl to the truth. The Socratic or psychology method work best IMO, I never push or force truth onto people.

I'd just say respect people's current perspective, and current level of political awareness, and bring up issues that are important to them, and how Clinton's history may likely differ from what policies that would best serve their interests.

       Yup, because the media is complicit in the cover up and most of the mainstream media is in the tank for Hillary. That's how it is, but that doesn't mean that it's good or that this is how it should be.

       I hate both the Republican and Democratic candidates equally, but when I woke up this morning to a bunch of posts about Trump and his "assassination" comment flooding the front page I looked at who has been posting these. I found that a lot of them were from new users who joined less than a year ago and majority of their posts are anti-anyone but HRC.

       One major candidate for the United States insinuated that his opponent should be assassinated. While it shouldn't be spammed all over r/politics, it's a pretty important moment for US news.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it isn't is proof that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is being dominated (which might be true, but there are better ways to make the argument, IMO). If you think assassination comments aren't newsworthy, your own bias is hurting your critical thinking (not you, OP, speaking rhetorically).

      <p>
       EDIT: Your downvotes are pathetic when they don't come with a retort. Seems like too many people on this sub just want this place to be another r/the_donald safe space. If you were really conspiracy minded people, instead of pathetic partisans, you'd develop those critical thinking skills instead of mindlessly pushing anything you think will further your shitty candidates White Nationalist policies.

       Ok, but I wasn't trying to draw a comparison between Trump and Clinton. I said "one candidate suggested assassination of another candidate, that's newsworthy" and you say "Yeah well it happened in '08 with Hillary" - does that make the insinuated assassination of Clinton the other day any less newsworthy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure you'd be able to dig up some posts in r/politics in 2008 shitting on Clinton for the same thing.

       The hive-mind is strong with this one, it has been particularly fascinating to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has brought out the usual guns - labeling this a "bonkers" "conspiracy theory" and "baseless claim."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, we have Assange, the leader of the organization that leaked the emails - so we can have a reasonable assumption that they are fully aware of the source (unless the source did what was necessary to conceal his identity) - basically telling journalists where to look for information relating to the hack, and offering up a $20k purse for information.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is that "baseless"? How is it even a "conspiracy theory" at all? It's not, and the media attempt to negatively label it as such shows even more legitimacy to the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The robbery claim posited for Seth Rich's untimely death is just as flimsy and circumstantial as his connection to the DNC, the leaks themselves and the time of his death. It is investigating 101, and instead of doing their jobs, journalists are dividing. Speaks volumes.

       Really concerned parents would want to know the truth no matter how bizarre or how talked about their son's death is. No one is shitting on or sullying the reputation of their son.
      </p>
      <p>
       The over reaction is what's suspect here. The fact that wikileaks put out a reward for any information should have made the parents more concerned than anything.

       What I don't understand is why Assange is getting so much shit for what he said. If he knows who the source for the DNC leaks was, then he's basically telling us who it was without outright saying it (to go along with their policy of never identifying their sources), and the end result is that we know who the fuck leaked the DNC emails and why they were murdered. If he doesn't know who the source was (since he keeps claiming that all submissions are anonymous), then he's not lying that he's putting a reward out for information about the DNC staffer's death because it's highly fucking concerning to him that a huge DNC leak comes out and around the same time some DNC staffer that had his hands in DNC data systems gets gunned down in the middle of the night. If the source is truly anonymous, then I'm not sure why Assange is getting shit for trying to clear up wtf happened with that DNC staffer. There are two possibilities; either he got gunned down because he was the source, in which case the whole thing stinks and people complaining about Assange are imbeciles, or it was a random altercation and Assange gets to show that the guy didn't get murdered to calm the nerves of any potential whistleblower who'd like to submit to wikileaks in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't see any fucking scenario where what Assange is doing is evil or illogical.

       It's the DNC's attempt to delegitimize WikiLeaks. The new narrative, if you have noticed on FB, is to claim that Wikileaks is a pro-russian propaganda machine out to get Hillary and ruin America. Sounds a bit like the Cold War, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind some emails have come out showing media and party collusion but it's not a stretch to expand the idea that there is more colluding going on.

       Informants - This source is much less reliable, but you can't believe that the hacks that gave access to HRC's private email server containing thousands of emails with classified information didn't endanger any spies which may or may not have been in those emails.

       I tend to agree. Aassange said nothing directly, but he knows what he's implying.

       Either this  is legitimate, and also aassange has more claimed leaks

       Or he's full of shit and is just taking any opportunity to make headlines

       I'll side with the latter until he proves his word is "pristine" as he likes to say. I really do appreciate assange. Im just hoping he's not becoming some loud mouthed lying attention whore.

       His job was Voter Expansion Data Director in the DNC. It's assumed he could of had access to well.. data. If this was the first mysterious death surrounding Clinton then I doubt there would be much of an uproar but the fact that this is what, the fourth this month? And follows a long lists of others over the years further supports the murderous Clinton narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       These deaths are far too coincidental to be legit for me. It's fishy!

       But we need evidence here.  Yea I agree it's all very fishy, but assange saying he has evidence connecting the leak with the deceased and hard documents making the connection are 2 very separate things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, what assange is saying now amounts to speculation.  No hard data = no conviction.  We need hard data to put this bitch away for good!

       Can you all recommend a better news source (outside of Reddit) to get your news from? This is a legitimate question. I used to rely on r/politics and r/worldnews and have seen the content change over the past few months. I also look at r/POLITIC now but there are not a lot of subscribers and the content also seems one note. As of late I've relied on CounterPunch and the Young Turks, but I'd like an internet news source that also discussed world affairs and news outside of only politics. Any thoughts???

       Couldn't say anything about that. On the other hand, I suspect there have been some serious threats made against her life. Threats that haven't been reported in any of the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm basing this on something weird that I noticed in one of those "seizure" videos. This was the one where she's speaking behind a podium and freezes when a protester appears.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big black guy (her medic?) immediately steps up and says "It's OK" and she resumes speaking quickly after. The look on her face doesn't really suggest seizure imo. To me it looked a lot more like barely repressed intense
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       One very plausible explanation would be if there have been serious death threats that she is aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is speculation. But American politics and violence have gone hand in hand since forever. I can see the MSM refusing to cover serious death threats because A) They don't want to give anybody else any ideas and B) Publicized threats would serve to illustrate how much some people hate her.

       Just take a good look at the expression in her eyes (and on her face) starting at about 7 seconds into the video. Imo, this is someone that just had the shit scared out of them.

       There are techniques and methodologies to reply some of the replies at the top of each post to really destroy the zombies who are agreeing with the shillbots. Basically you appear neutral and ask questions using Socratic Method and fact checking with links/sourcing in replies.

       There are actually a bunch of threads related to wikileaks' announcement that made it pretty far on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , but the overwhelming opinion is that Assange is a mother fucker who's only looking for attention and that you have to be really into tin foil hats if you think the DNC staffer's death was odd in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's bad to the point where reading those comment threads makes me doubt my sanity. Am I really crazy for thinking that the Clintons aren't a nice old couple that have America's best interest at heart? Apparently, according to most people on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , any sort of speculation/attempt at connecting the dots is complete insanity and crazy conspiracy theories; you are expected to stick to the facts and ignore any sort of circumstantial evidence (good example would be the rhetoric that they had on there for a while where a bunch of shills were saying that the Clinton-Lynch meeting shouldn't be a big deal because we don't know what they discussed and all we can do is assume they told the truth...).

       This is so true, and yet...
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, when someone attempts a coup in Turkey... people offer up every possible conspiracy theory as to who's really behind it and what they were up to. And everyone seems to be just fine with these theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's a discrepancy here. You can look at
       <em>
        any other country
       </em>
       and be suspicious of what's going on. But everyone is expected to accept the official narrative when it's their own country. It's almost like

       If you're exposed to any other media you've undoubtedly heard Trump's most recent inflammatory remarks and have the ability to draw conclusions yourself. Maybe if he could go a day without proving himself to be a fool Reddit wouldn't be flooded with anti-trump posts. Donald Trump is imploding so r/politics must be run by CTR shills /s.

       at least that's what my filter-bubble tells me ;-)

       Yup, because the media is complicit in the cover up and most of the mainstream media is in the tank for Hillary. That's how it is, but that doesn't mean that it's good or that this is how it should be.

       Well I'll be damned... Fox news is actually covering it, no holding back.  I know they're just as much of a shill as the others but at least its getting air time.

       You're not wrong.

       Thing is it shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how you interpret what Trump said, it shouldn't be a bigger story than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't even heard of this story on the M$M.
      </p>
      <p>
       A DNC staffer was murdered, no suspects, nothing stolen.  Then you have the guy that has leaked countless important documents saying his death is "very suspicious".
      </p>
      <p>
       But they aren't bought and paid for, for nothing.

       Ok, but I wasn't trying to draw a comparison between Trump and Clinton. I said "one candidate suggested assassination of another candidate, that's newsworthy" and you say "Yeah well it happened in '08 with Hillary" - does that make the insinuated assassination of Clinton the other day any less newsworthy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure you'd be able to dig up some posts in r/politics in 2008 shitting on Clinton for the same thing.
