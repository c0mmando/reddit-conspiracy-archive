       <em>
        Disclaimer: I mention group names as shorthand here to ask questions, but I don't mean every member or most of that group is involved, it just means shorthand for the elite bankers or actors of that group who could be involved in a conspiracy. Most people of all groups I believe, whether Jews, Catholics, or any other group, are good people.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a ton of debate in the conspiracy community over certain details that make a big difference in who is behind the conspiracy. Most agree there is a group of international bankers who control world finance from behind the scenes using central banks in various countries like the Federal Reserve, or IMF globally, and control world politics through secret societies in each country such as Freemasonry. Most agree a disproportionate number of these bankers are Jewish compared to the percentage of Jewish people in the general population, especially in the west.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is great debate about whether these are just the frontmen, and if there are other interests who they answer to behind the scenes, for example the Jesuits.
       <strong>
        I would like to hear thoughts from those who have
        <em>
         really researched this fully
        </em>
        on who is really behind the conspiracy
       </strong>
       . Please post your sources so we can compare sources and see who has the most reliable information!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Debate question #1.
       </strong>
       <em>
        If the Jesuits are involved in the conspiracy, who is behind the Jesuits? The Roman Catholic Church itself started out somewhat Babylonian and Pagan, but was it infiltrated at some point by the globalist bankers and taken over through debt like many countries have been, or has it always controlled the globalist bankers?
       </em>
       <strong>
        HAS THE VATICAN BEEN INFILTRATED, AND IF SO WHEN AND BY WHOM?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance the Alumbrados of Ignatius Loyala became the Jesuits. Did the Alumbrados have a different goal than the Vatican at large and did they eventually take over power from the Pope?
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, in 1776, Adam Weishaupt, who was schooled by Jesuits, created the Bavarian Illuminati after the Jesuits were outlawed by the Pope at that time, before they were reinstated later. Weishaupt ended up getting financing from the Rothschilds. Does this mean Weishaupt and the Rothschilds eventually took over the Vatican, or that they were working FOR the Vatican?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Debate question #2.
       </strong>
       <em>
        It's very similar to the first: the Rothschilds are the guardians of the Papal treasure, according to the Jewish encyclopedia. Does this mean they own and control the Vatican through debt, or does this mean they were given an honorary type of position because they work FOR the Vatican?
       </em>
       Logically one could make the case for either in the abstract, so answering this requires sourcing and knowing the history of what exactly happened before and after the Rothschilds were given this title.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Debate question #3.
       </strong>
       <em>
        Those who believe the Jesuits are behind the conspiracy say they are using many Jewish bankers in this conspiracy on purpose so that they can then blame the Jews later for it, the way the Nazis did in WWII. Is there any proof of this and wouldn't helping so many Jewish bankers become billionaires run the risk of them eventually becoming more powerful than the Jesuits and old rich Roman families and eventually taking over the conspiracy for themselves? How do we know that hasn't happened already?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Debate question #4.
       </strong>
       *With the constant wars in the middle east and Israel playing a big role in the West's foreign policy, this would seem to indicate that either Jewish Zionists, or Roman Jesuits, or Biblically-conscious Luciferians/Gnostics are pulling the strings of the conspiracy. Someone who has a biblical interest in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Unless, could that all be an alt-media disinfo campaign, and it's really just about having a power in the region to control all the oil and prevent Muslim nations from rising up and unifying against the Western elite power structure?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But if they do have a religious interest in the region, there are a few theories. Those who say it's Jews say they want Jerusalem to be the capital of the Jewish world order. Those who say it's the Vatican say the Vatican wants Jerusalem to be the capital of a Latin Kingdom of the world, or of the old Babylon.*
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Some say the Jewish bankers want to rebuild the Temple so their Messiah can come, or something. Some say the Vatican wants the anti-Christ to come to fulfill the book of Revelations, or something.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Which is it? Is it either of these?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Ultimate Question: Who is really behind the conspiracy, at the top of it, certain Jewish Zionists, certain Jesuits, or some other group, and what is their end goal? PLEASE PROVIDE PROOF/SOURCES.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        At the end of this debate, I will nominate the three respondents who make the best case with the best, clear, to-the-point sources, and everyone can vote on who won the debate.
       </em>

       It's the Holy Roman Empire at the top of the Pyramid. These dynasties stem from the survivors of the Great Deluge, Mesopotamia, Babylon, and then Egypt. They are sons of Cain.

       Khazars or fake Jews (Zionists) are mercenaries of Rome. They have been for some time. They are also bankers, but pay homage to The Templars. Red Shield (Rothchild)

       How could the Vatican control the Rothschilds? It's an impossibility. Obviously, then, it's the Rothschilds that wield the power as "guardians" of papal treasure.

       Not true. Rothchilds are top-tier bankers, but underlings to Swiss bankers who are Templars via Venice. Swiss run the BIS, which in turn gives orders to The Crown, which in turn gives orders to the IMF, which in turn gives orders to the US Federal Reserve.

       Today's Knights Templars have nothing in common with the crusaders. The Knights Templar is a masonic degree on the York Rite. It is not recognized by the Vatican or any legitimate Catholic order. It belongs to British Freemasonry, which has been at war with the Catholic Church since Henry VIII and his wiccan, bastard daughter Elizabeth.

       It is true. The York Rite freemasons have a degree called "Order of Knights Templar Commandery", which has no association with the original Catholic Knights Templar. Many people confuse these two as being one, same with the Knights of Malta.

       Free Masonry, is Templar and vice versa. Free Masonry actually predates Templars. Read the post I made with the sources, and this will make more sense about the relationship between the two. They are one in the same. Much like the Italian mob and the Jewish Purple gang. Both syndicates. Dafuq have you researched? Methinks, not much...

       If the Vatican has way more $ than them, and the Rothschilds are lower in the secret societies than we think. They could have been brought in as lower ranking "Court Jews" with lots of money through the Knights of Malta or something, with the Jesuits or the Pope still at the top of the system, and the Rothschilds just playing a part in it.

       The Vatican does have a lot of money, but it is spread so thinly over so many parishes that is vastly insignificant next to the wealth of the Rothschild, whose money is severely more concentrated. And if the Rothschilds don't control the Vatican, what business would a bunch of wealthy Jews have with controlling the papal treasure? It stands to reason that the relationship works the other way around.

       The Vatican owns the world under Divine Domain via St. Peter's Chair. You have obviously not researched this topic. OP is asking for people who have actually researched this more than just looking at a few youtube videos talking about fake Jews who control some banks. There are higher ups, and I suggest you look into it. I've posted a comment which gives an intro. Here is a case talking about it:

       The Catholic one, not the mason degree. The RomeRules sub describes the Catholic Knights of Malta as like its own freemasonry that works the same with the Jesuit conspiracy theory as freemasonry works within the Jewish conspiracy theory, except in the Jesuit conspiracy theory freemasonry is also under the Jesuits.

       Yes, people are either ignorant or deliberately lie so that it fits their theory, but as I showed, masonic degrees borrow various Christian terms. I mean, using their argument, anyone who owns an axe is a freemason since the Scottish Rite masons have a degree called "Knight of the Royal Axe." Obviously this is absurd, but they count on people not doing any legitimate research.

       Some say they used to be the Knights Hospitaliers. And Bill Clinton did go to Georgetown, a Jesuit university. The guy who wrote Tragedy and Hope, his mentor, Carroll Quigley, went to Georgetown. The mayor of I think Dallas who was giving a speech after the Michael X police sniper shooting that some say is a false flag, went to a Jesuit university. Tim Kaine, Hillary's VP, was a Jesuit missionary or something. Hillary Clinton met with the archbishop of NY who is the head of American Knights of Malta before running.

       Before I was like you, I noticed the disproportionate number of Jews in powerful positions, but now I've noticed a disproportionate amount of people who went to Jesuit universities as well. And Boston seems to be Catholic headquarters in the US and that's where the Boston Marathon happened under their jurisdiction so to speak, in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's tenuous, but RomeRules does make some compelling arguments. The fallacy page you sent kind of builds strawmans. Yes all the "Jesuit trained" stuff is suspicious but at Rome Rules the guy there goes a lot deeper into all of it than pretty much anyone I've talked to. The article you mentioned says there's a contradiction if the Jesuits were behind Nazism because how could they also have created Zionism then, but Rome Rules has explained that as the Jesuits playing both sides, which is the same claim people say about the Zionists, so how is that a fallacious claim? It's a good enough claim to be used against Zionists, so it should also be a good enough claim to use for the Jesuit theory. What we have to determine are the facts about which is true, if either. But in the abstract both are the same theory and just as viable, so I wasn't really convinced by the link that glossed over all of that.

       The Jesuit order was absorbed into the Second Vatican Council conciliar church; proof of this being its stance in opposition to traditional Catholic teaching, whether its abortion, homosexuality, or Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus. The modern Jesuit order says nothing different than the Vatican, really. So, if the Vatican is openly advocating NWO principles, what need is there for a secretive Jesuit subversive group?
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing the Jesuit theorists cannot adequately explain is the goal or agenda of this alleged Jesuit conspiracy theory. The best they can come up with is the goal attributed to other nefarious groups, but there is nothing they can present that makes this alleged Jesuit plot unique from all the other theorists' plots. Furthermore, Jews and Protestants are over-represented in Jesuit conspiracy circles, so it can't claim to be without bias and with absolute historical objectivity.

       Yes, the Vatican has been infiltrated. Officially it began in 1958 through to 1965 with the Jewish lobby orchestrating the Second Vatican Council. Jules Isaac and the American Jewish Committee played instrumental roles in bringing about the Second Vatican Council—a council which turned traditional Catholic teaching on its head.

       The Jews involved in provoking the Second Vatican Council framed their argument in terms of calling traditional Catholic teaching "anti-Semitic". What other tactic would they use? (LOL) The Jews remedy to this alleged gross Catholic error was for the Church to loosen its teachings not only against Judaism but all other religions (see: heresy of indifferentism). There many other proscriptions the Jewish saboteurs demanded.

       OP, one word of warning is that many of the proponents of Jesuit conspiracy theories are Zionist agents (Hasbara) seeking to obfuscate the truth. Eric Jon Phelps is the prime example of this. Others are Calvinist "Christians" (Calvin was a Jew and kabbalist), or Seventh Day Adventists.

       Word of warning OP, Jesuits were the founders of intelligence and spying. They have infiltrated all levels of governments and have been banished for such behavior. There are also Zionists, who are working with Rome to continue the further conspiracy and self persecution that is Zionism and their so called stake of the Holy Land. Keep eyes on US! So we can continue the mission of Rome.... There are also useful idiots on both sides of the aisle.
