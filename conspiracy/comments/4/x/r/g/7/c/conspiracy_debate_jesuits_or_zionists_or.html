        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>Disclaimer: I mention group names as shorthand here to ask questions, but I don&#39;t mean every member or most of that group is involved, it just means shorthand for the elite bankers or actors of that group who could be involved in a conspiracy. Most people of all groups I believe, whether Jews, Catholics, or any other group, are good people.</em></p>

<p>There is a ton of debate in the conspiracy community over certain details that make a big difference in who is behind the conspiracy. Most agree there is a group of international bankers who control world finance from behind the scenes using central banks in various countries like the Federal Reserve, or IMF globally, and control world politics through secret societies in each country such as Freemasonry. Most agree a disproportionate number of these bankers are Jewish compared to the percentage of Jewish people in the general population, especially in the west. </p>

<p>However, there is great debate about whether these are just the frontmen, and if there are other interests who they answer to behind the scenes, for example the Jesuits. <strong>I would like to hear thoughts from those who have <em>really researched this fully</em> on who is really behind the conspiracy</strong>. Please post your sources so we can compare sources and see who has the most reliable information!</p>

<p><strong>Debate question #1.</strong> <em>If the Jesuits are involved in the conspiracy, who is behind the Jesuits? The Roman Catholic Church itself started out somewhat Babylonian and Pagan, but was it infiltrated at some point by the globalist bankers and taken over through debt like many countries have been, or has it always controlled the globalist bankers?</em> <strong>HAS THE VATICAN BEEN INFILTRATED, AND IF SO WHEN AND BY WHOM?</strong></p>

<p>For instance the Alumbrados of Ignatius Loyala became the Jesuits. Did the Alumbrados have a different goal than the Vatican at large and did they eventually take over power from the Pope? </p>

<p>Likewise, in 1776, Adam Weishaupt, who was schooled by Jesuits, created the Bavarian Illuminati after the Jesuits were outlawed by the Pope at that time, before they were reinstated later. Weishaupt ended up getting financing from the Rothschilds. Does this mean Weishaupt and the Rothschilds eventually took over the Vatican, or that they were working FOR the Vatican?</p>

<p><strong>Debate question #2.</strong> <em>It&#39;s very similar to the first: the Rothschilds are the guardians of the Papal treasure, according to the Jewish encyclopedia. Does this mean they own and control the Vatican through debt, or does this mean they were given an honorary type of position because they work FOR the Vatican?</em> Logically one could make the case for either in the abstract, so answering this requires sourcing and knowing the history of what exactly happened before and after the Rothschilds were given this title.</p>

<p><strong>Debate question #3.</strong> <em>Those who believe the Jesuits are behind the conspiracy say they are using many Jewish bankers in this conspiracy on purpose so that they can then blame the Jews later for it, the way the Nazis did in WWII. Is there any proof of this and wouldn&#39;t helping so many Jewish bankers become billionaires run the risk of them eventually becoming more powerful than the Jesuits and old rich Roman families and eventually taking over the conspiracy for themselves? How do we know that hasn&#39;t happened already?</em></p>

<p><strong>Debate question #4.</strong> *With the constant wars in the middle east and Israel playing a big role in the West&#39;s foreign policy, this would seem to indicate that either Jewish Zionists, or Roman Jesuits, or Biblically-conscious Luciferians/Gnostics are pulling the strings of the conspiracy. Someone who has a biblical interest in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Unless, could that all be an alt-media disinfo campaign, and it&#39;s really just about having a power in the region to control all the oil and prevent Muslim nations from rising up and unifying against the Western elite power structure?</strong> </p>

<p>But if they do have a religious interest in the region, there are a few theories. Those who say it&#39;s Jews say they want Jerusalem to be the capital of the Jewish world order. Those who say it&#39;s the Vatican say the Vatican wants Jerusalem to be the capital of a Latin Kingdom of the world, or of the old Babylon.*</p>

<p><em>Some say the Jewish bankers want to rebuild the Temple so their Messiah can come, or something. Some say the Vatican wants the anti-Christ to come to fulfill the book of Revelations, or something.</em> </p>

<p><em>Which is it? Is it either of these?</em></p>

<p><strong>The Ultimate Question: Who is really behind the conspiracy, at the top of it, certain Jewish Zionists, certain Jesuits, or some other group, and what is their end goal? PLEASE PROVIDE PROOF/SOURCES.</strong></p>

<p><em>At the end of this debate, I will nominate the three respondents who make the best case with the best, clear, to-the-point sources, and everyone can vote on who won the debate.</em></p>

<p>Some say they used to be the Knights Hospitaliers. And Bill Clinton did go to Georgetown, a Jesuit university. The guy who wrote Tragedy and Hope, his mentor, Carroll Quigley, went to Georgetown. The mayor of I think Dallas who was giving a speech after the Michael X police sniper shooting that some say is a false flag, went to a Jesuit university. Tim Kaine, Hillary&#39;s VP, was a Jesuit missionary or something. Hillary Clinton met with the archbishop of NY who is the head of American Knights of Malta before running. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/20/hillary-clinton-reaching-out-to-catholics/?_r=2">http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/20/hillary-clinton-reaching-out-to-catholics/?_r=2</a></p>

<p>Before I was like you, I noticed the disproportionate number of Jews in powerful positions, but now I&#39;ve noticed a disproportionate amount of people who went to Jesuit universities as well. And Boston seems to be Catholic headquarters in the US and that&#39;s where the Boston Marathon happened under their jurisdiction so to speak, in a way.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s tenuous, but RomeRules does make some compelling arguments. The fallacy page you sent kind of builds strawmans. Yes all the &quot;Jesuit trained&quot; stuff is suspicious but at Rome Rules the guy there goes a lot deeper into all of it than pretty much anyone I&#39;ve talked to. The article you mentioned says there&#39;s a contradiction if the Jesuits were behind Nazism because how could they also have created Zionism then, but Rome Rules has explained that as the Jesuits playing both sides, which is the same claim people say about the Zionists, so how is that a fallacious claim? It&#39;s a good enough claim to be used against Zionists, so it should also be a good enough claim to use for the Jesuit theory. What we have to determine are the facts about which is true, if either. But in the abstract both are the same theory and just as viable, so I wasn&#39;t really convinced by the link that glossed over all of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jesuit order was absorbed into the Second Vatican Council conciliar church; proof of this being its stance in opposition to traditional Catholic teaching, whether its abortion, homosexuality, or Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus. The modern Jesuit order says nothing different than the Vatican, really. So, if the Vatican is openly advocating NWO principles, what need is there for a secretive Jesuit subversive group?</p>

<p>The one thing the Jesuit theorists cannot adequately explain is the goal or agenda of this alleged Jesuit conspiracy theory. The best they can come up with is the goal attributed to other nefarious groups, but there is nothing they can present that makes this alleged Jesuit plot unique from all the other theorists&#39; plots. Furthermore, Jews and Protestants are over-represented in Jesuit conspiracy circles, so it can&#39;t claim to be without bias and with absolute historical objectivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Vatican has been infiltrated. Officially it began in 1958 through to 1965 with the Jewish lobby orchestrating the Second Vatican Council. Jules Isaac and the American Jewish Committee played instrumental roles in bringing about the Second Vatican Council—a council which turned traditional Catholic teaching on its head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews involved in provoking the Second Vatican Council framed their argument in terms of calling traditional Catholic teaching &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;. What other tactic would they use? (LOL) The Jews remedy to this alleged gross Catholic error was for the Church to loosen its teachings not only against Judaism but all other religions (see: heresy of indifferentism). There many other proscriptions the Jewish saboteurs demanded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing but this could be lower level &quot;satanists,&quot; it could be Satanic Jewish apostates / Catholic apostates / Protestant apostates / atheists / etc. This doesn&#39;t look like it would really answer the central questions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, one word of warning is that many of the proponents of Jesuit conspiracy theories are Zionist agents (Hasbara) seeking to obfuscate the truth. Eric Jon Phelps is the prime example of this. Others are Calvinist &quot;Christians&quot; (Calvin was a Jew and kabbalist), or Seventh Day Adventists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word of warning OP, Jesuits were the founders of intelligence and spying. They have infiltrated all levels of governments and have been banished for such behavior. There are also Zionists, who are working with Rome to continue the further conspiracy and self persecution that is Zionism and their so called stake of the Holy Land. Keep eyes on US! So we can continue the mission of Rome.... There are also useful idiots on both sides of the aisle. </p>
