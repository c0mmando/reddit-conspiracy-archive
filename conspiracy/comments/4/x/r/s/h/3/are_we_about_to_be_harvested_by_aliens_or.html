<p>They of course released them under the guise that this was a Zika cure. Ya see, Zika has been around for a while and it didn&#39;t become a big deal until MSM ( liars ) made it seem like a big deal. So big they had to release unnatural Mosquitos into the habitat. The people of America didn&#39;t even have a choice in the matter.  </p>

<p>They always like to play both sides.</p>

<p>They will explode a few nukes on home soil while dropping all they got on Russia and China. ( Speculation based on murals from Denver Airport and Bank of America corporate murals. )</p>

<p>Meanwhile they will be held up in a save place, already vaccinated, waiting for things to play out.</p>

<p>When the survivers emerge, they will be tempted with safety due to the fear of death.</p>

<p>Now, we have seen a lot of alien shit with their messages. Many are expecting the alien psyop to get the Normies to comply. This could also just be DISINFO to make us look like lunatics when we talk about it.</p>

<p>I really want to believe in aliens. I feel like if their were , they would save us from this bullshit. Could have been a long term DISINFO op for a while.

<p>I&#39;ve been putting more thought into this lately. It&#39;s the pyramids and the star tracking that get me. The fact that they lopped the dog head off the Sphinx and replaced it with a human head is suspicious. I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really want aliens to exist but yeah perhaps that&#39;s something that&#39;s widely understood by them and their biggest exploitation of that in the end will be there hidden Ace. That would also really suck knowing those assholes ruined Aliens for me too. Dammit.</p>

<p>If the Advanced past theory holds water does that mean Aliens aren&#39;t real and were just the surviving Elites returning to Earth after the latest Mass Extinction? The surviving generations of the common man at that time eventually viewed the returning Elites as Gods or Aliens, mistaking their advanced technology as Alien. In reality the technology was once common but utterly lost during said extinction.</p>

<p>Or something. I agree the Sphinx being altered but my ignorant as to why. I&#39;ve heard it was Napoleon or some Egyptian guy but never as to why for what reason. Aliens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really would explain a lot. David Icke calls them lizard people. I always thought it&#39;s his way of saying globalist. But imagine they are keepers of earth and are humanoid and basically control shit until the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>You know they are watching and reading this. I hope they can appreciate our theorizing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is defiantly being read I just wonder if their nodding. I&#39;m pretty sure our theorizing and shots in the total fucking dark are somewhat amusing. (If not fuck you observing guy).</p>

<p>It all just leads to so many theories and possible red pills, makes my head swim. Are fallen angels the Watchers? Are the Watcher the Reptilians? Is that why there&#39;s weird shit on the TV?</p>

<p>Are the Reptilians the Illuminati? If not why not?
If the Reptilians are in control no wonder the leaders of the World don&#39;t give a flying fuck about Human life, they...are...not...human.
Which then goes full circle....are Aliens real?</p>

<p>If aliens aren&#39;t real then Satan&#39;s real right? </p>
