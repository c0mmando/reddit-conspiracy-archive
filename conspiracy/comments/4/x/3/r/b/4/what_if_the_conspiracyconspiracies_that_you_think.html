       I do believe that there are other life forms out there, aliens if you will, that we don't know yet. The universe is so vast, how could there not be!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that there is so much hidden within the government that they don't share, and won't share. I know we won't know everything, but it would be good to know what our tax money is being used for!

       This is basically my stance as well, although I do believe there is also life sharing this dimension/universe with us, just profoundly far away.  My favorite evidence to cite when discussing  this are crop circles.  Crop Circles often contain incredibly intricate sacred geometry, which is so mathematically perfect there is no way it could be done as a hoax.  To me, it seems like they are "stickers" projected from a great distance by some device beyond our comprehension of technology...like some electromagnetic 3D printer mounted on the bottom of a spacecraft or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that these inter-dimensional beings and/or ET's of this dimension have been helping humanity occasionally throughout Earth's history, during time periods of significant advancement in science and technology.

       I agree. Crop circles are definitely interesting to me, and adds to it. I base my beliefs/thinking on Faery Folklore of the past. All of a sudden, no one talks about it (mainly after the church persecuted pagans), and now people talk about "aliens". Well, I think it's the same beings, just repackaged for one reason or another by the elites.

       I think it's very likely that the US will be in another war before the end of the year. It's also very likely that the war will be taken to the US this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the last 6 months I've been tracking news within Europe, Africa, Asia and elsewhere making note of political and economic deals. Nation states are in a rush to create new alliances as if the US has lost their hold or left them dry. Turkey is only one example of this extraordinary shift in alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has been focusing on Pacific and South American nations in order to shore up holes in the mainland and oceanic defenses. China and other nations in this sphere of control are making alliances as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the world is preparing for a war. The elevated amount of military exercises and NATO buildup is the response to this action. But it's obviously not discouraging the anti US sentiment.

       This is another "crazy" thing I tend to accept at this point. Elon Musk put it in the most frank, logical terms, paraphrased:
      </p>
      <p>
       We've gone from Pong to the Oculus Rift in about 40 years. Assuming technology continues to improve anywhere near the staggering rate it has been, we will be creating and living in environments that are indistinguishable from reality before we know it. Given the billions of galaxies, billions of years, and possibility that visible light is not the only habitable dimension, the odds are literally 1 in billions that we are in "base reality", and that we are instead the result of a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, it makes sense. I think what we can see and experience is a rogue simulation, the purpose of which is beyond our comprehension.

       I believe aliens are real. We have made contact, gov't has recovered craft. I think mosts EBE's are benign, if anything it is humans who want to use this technology for weapons of war. Our leaders despise us, they will never use their knowledge/technology to help us, only further enslave us.

       I don't believe aliens are real.  I also don't believe the universe is vast.  The popular conception of outer space is a fantasy perpetuated by the CIA through sci-fi, Hollywood, and NASA.  Not to say the deception is American only.  All space agencies collude and mainstream science has been roped in as well with theoretical physics.  Planets aren't other worlds.  Man has never left "low earth orbit" if that's even a thing.  That's the big secret that NASA's hiding.  TPTB want you to believe in aliens so they can stage a fake attack and unite everyone under a common threat.  Any "alien tech" they have is man-made but kept hidden for the future deception.

       Sorry, but that's so naïve...like flat earth level crazy. You can look up and see the sun, the moon, the stars...even the wisp of the milky way if the setting is right.   You don't think those are far away?  That all the stars in the night sky are within' our "dome" of space and that's as far as it goes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the part about the whole false flag alien attack I agree with, because of project bluebeam and all that.   I personally don't see it ever working, but it does fit their agenda...and is also the final part of the list of threats according to that one guy whose name I can't remember.

       Yup.  Call me whatever you want.  I don't know whether the earth is flat but I don't think it's an "oblate spheroid".  And I don't think there are other worlds floating around in a vacuum populated by greys or Pleiadians.  I was really into alien theory when I first started looking at conspiracies, then I moved more towards inter-dimensionals.  Eventually I've come to believe they're demons.  I'm not surprised when people think it's crazy but others have come to the same conclusion.

       <em>
        here
       </em>
       , existing inter-dimensionally, probably disqualifies me from saying this, but I think this belief is in ignorance of what we can actually see and observe, which I don't understand. I don't think anyone can truly debate the shape of the earth. Wouldn't there be a "Pilots for Flat Earth Truth" if there were any bizarre inconsistencies between their flight times / path in their relation to the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, light-years are incomprehensible to me for the most part, so I guess I can just be happy not being sure.

       There are plenty of pilots that have come out about flat earth, but they just get dismissed as crazy like everyone else.  Mainstream science says that our relative size to the earth is so small and the curvature is so slight that pilots and sailors can treat it as a flat plane so most never question.  It's easy to demonstrate that flight paths work the same way on a circle as a ball.  For example, someone argued in a thread a while back that flat earth flight paths can't work because he flew from Hong Kong to London and passed over Russia rather than India and the Middle East.

        I plotted that one too
       </a>
       .  Flights would only be inconsistent south of the equator but there are quite a few theories on how that's hidden.  I mean, try going to

       and you won't see a flight go across the South Pacific or South Atlantic Ocean.  What's up with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many holes in the ball earth theory but there are a few things I'm not sure of with flat earth too.  That's why I don't ascribe to either one at the moment.  I'm not a fan of concave earth theory either.  I don't know what shape the earth truly is but I don't believe the mainstream idea they push on us is the truth. I understand the ball model and the evidences for it.  I'm no stranger to physics and calculus. I believed it the same way that everyone else does until recently.  I only came to flat earth because I thought, "Lets see what whacky reasons these idiots have for denying the obvious truth that it's a sphere."  Wound up being humbled instead.

       I looked at flat earth with an open mind too, but unless there's something concrete that simply cannot be explained, it's just a fringe theory to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for flightradar24.com, I'm following a flight from Perth, Australia to Johannesburg, South Africa as I type (South African Airways 281). Headed over the Indian Ocean now, estimated flight time of 10:51. Logically, its initial path is southward, so it will look like the plane loops towards Antarctica and back towards South Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering these two locations would be on near-opposite ends of a flat earth, such a flight path makes that idea seem laughable. The flight would actually look like it would hook north and pass over southern India.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the flight paths on flat-earth will often look similar to how they do on a globe in the northern hemisphere, paths over the southern hemisphere just blow the theory away. Why do we see so few flights over the Indian Ocean? Well, 90% of the world's population is in the northern hemisphere, and most of those in the southern half don't have a high concentration of internationally-traveling citizenry.

       Okay, weird stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I posted this reply, I was really following this flight on its way out of Perth, Australia. Every indication is that it was live - plane was moving, altitude had climbed, and it was on its way.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I posted, I went back to flightradar24.com and the plane was gone. It now says that the flight has been delayed, and apparently, it never even took off...?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ran a search for SAA281 and although the current flight says it's been delayed, there is still a flight path for about 100 miles out. The plane, however, shows as sitting at the airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked at the historical data of this flight and also found that there is no exact tracking of the flight between takeoff and landing - there are just dashes, instead of the line containing altitude data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there simply no radar down there that would capture this? That would be my guess. Plus, the flight still lands on time, so nothing terribly suspicious there. Just wondering if I'm seeing a glitch, or if something else is responsible.

       I thought about it, but to me, it's much more likely the site doesn't perfectly handle flight status changes when the plane goes out of radar coverage than it is that the earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, when it said "Delayed", it meant that the flight was going to land shortly
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       its scheduled arrival, which it did. That did not mean, however, that the flight was still delayed on the ground. The estimated arrival had just been pushed back from what was planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I type, the same flight is about to make reach the coast of South Africa, splitting Swaziland and Lesotho on its way to Johannesburg.

But older civilizations aren't any sort of proof.  It's just an appeal to popularity and appeal to authority.  I believe the alien deception goes back to many ancient civilizations.  Humans or entities pretending to be gods from far away worlds that other people can never verify are real.  They just keep recycling the same tricks and lies generation after generation.

       Religion is definitely a means of control, giving us consequences for violating social norms. Things like saying pork is unclean to prevent folks from getting trichinosis. That's why i don't understand those who cling to these old school religious laws; they were made for a specific time and place, and in many cases are no longer relevant.

       That's all that true religion is.  Certainly 99.9% of churches and religions today are tools of control, but that doesn't change that the Bible is true.  Pork was restricted as a picture that we ought not consume that which is unclean spiritually.  Unleavened bread is frequently used as a metaphor for the word of God (the Bible) contrasted with leavened bread (religions that add to the word) and unclean beasts (religions that are totally against the Bible).  After Noah got off the ark all beasts were appropriate food and under the new testament they are as well.  I don't know why people always wanna complain about that or the "don't wear mixed fiber" laws.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Bible emphasizes liberty above all.  Someone who is saved doesn't even have to follow the commandments and they still get that free ticket into heaven. Jesus said, "If ye love me keep my commandments" but all you have to do to receive everlasting life is trust on Jesus' sacrifice rather than your own good works.  You cannot earn eternal life because you, I, and all have sinned and come short of what's expected of us.  But it is given freely as a gift to those that choose to believe on Him.  I already have everlasting life.  Where's the system of control when we're given total freedom?
