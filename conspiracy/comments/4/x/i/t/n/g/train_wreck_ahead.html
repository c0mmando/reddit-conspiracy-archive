       I remember when Ronald Reagan became President, thinking that we had reached a new low in filling the office of POTUS, and he did not disappoint.  But then Bill Clinton came along and I had to lower my expectations even further.  And then came Dubya.  Sheesh.  And Obama.  Fore.  Well, now it looks like Hillary is inevitable.  I don't even have a word for how I know this is going to turn out.  I think it's pretty damn clear that the next 8 years are going to be the USA turning, finally, into the biggest train wreck in history.  Ben Franklin was right when he opined that we would have a republic, but only if we could keep it.  And we don't have a republic.  Not any more.  We lost it.  It's gone, and it's not coming back anytime soon, if ever.   I obviously couldn't put this in /news or in /politics, so I'll put it here, because conspiracy is how this all happened, so it belongs here more than it belongs in either of those two subreddits anyway.

       The Clintons have succeeded in demolishing the Republican party.  Trump, their personal friend, has completely de-legitimized the GOP.  Wall Street is open to lobbying Democrats rather than Republicans, because Clinton-type Democrats love the money, and don't have the low public approval rating of Republicans.  They have succeeded in creating one central party with no legitimate challengers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if anyone tries to expose them or hold them accountable, they're subsequently murdered.  Journalists are afraid to investigate or ask questions, because they will be murdered too, so they just report the police line - "looks like a suicide, it was a robbery, etc."
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have a presidential hopeful that has created a central political party and murders political dissidents.  If that's not a dictatorship, I'm not sure I know what one is.

       I don't think you understand how public politics and friendships work. Just because you're brown nosing the powerful politicians doesn't make your their friend.
