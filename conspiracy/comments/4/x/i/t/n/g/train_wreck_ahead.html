        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I remember when Ronald Reagan became President, thinking that we had reached a new low in filling the office of POTUS, and he did not disappoint.  But then Bill Clinton came along and I had to lower my expectations even further.  And then came Dubya.  Sheesh.  And Obama.  Fore.  Well, now it looks like Hillary is inevitable.  I don&#39;t even have a word for how I know this is going to turn out.  I think it&#39;s pretty damn clear that the next 8 years are going to be the USA turning, finally, into the biggest train wreck in history.  Ben Franklin was right when he opined that we would have a republic, but only if we could keep it.  And we don&#39;t have a republic.  Not any more.  We lost it.  It&#39;s gone, and it&#39;s not coming back anytime soon, if ever.   I obviously couldn&#39;t put this in /news or in /politics, so I&#39;ll put it here, because conspiracy is how this all happened, so it belongs here more than it belongs in either of those two subreddits anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Clintons have succeeded in demolishing the Republican party.  Trump, their personal friend, has completely de-legitimized the GOP.  Wall Street is open to lobbying Democrats rather than Republicans, because Clinton-type Democrats love the money, and don&#39;t have the low public approval rating of Republicans.  They have succeeded in creating one central party with no legitimate challengers.</p>

<p>Also, if anyone tries to expose them or hold them accountable, they&#39;re subsequently murdered.  Journalists are afraid to investigate or ask questions, because they will be murdered too, so they just report the police line - &quot;looks like a suicide, it was a robbery, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>So we have a presidential hopeful that has created a central political party and murders political dissidents.  If that&#39;s not a dictatorship, I&#39;m not sure I know what one is.</p>
