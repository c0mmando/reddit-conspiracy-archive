<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general10/30.htm">30 Crucial OKC Bombing 
Questions Remain Unanswered</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Retired Air Force Brigadier General Benton K. Partin, former commander of the Air Force Armament Technology Laboratory, a 25-year expert in the design and development of bombs, urged Senators and Congressmen to delay the destruction of the Murrah building site. Partin stated in a news release, &quot;When I first saw the picture of the truck bomb&#39;s asymmetrical damage to the Federal building in Oklahoma, my immediate reaction was that the pattern of damage would have been technically impossible without supplementary demolition charges at some of the reinforced concrete bases inside the building, a standard demolition technique.&quot; Partin further explained that &quot;reinforced concrete targets in large buildings are hard targets to blast. I know of no way possible to reproduce the apparent building damage through simply a truck bomb effort.&quot; General Partin&#39;s request to have the bomb site preserved in order to examine the possibility of a second explosion was ignored by the government. And in fact, when the request was made by General Partin, the government moved up the demolition by two weeks! Why?</p>

<p>General Partin&#39;s press release, quoted above, was reprinted in the John Birch Society magazine New American. Based on this the news media launched an egregious and bogus smear campaign against General Benton K. Partin, claiming falsely that he was a member of the John Birch Society and therefore a &quot;right-wing extremist&quot;. [General Partin&#39;s report has been widely circulated and reproduced, including an electronic version here on ParaScope.] General Partin has been forced repeatedly to threaten lawsuits in order to obtain grudging and deliberately downplayed retractions and corrections of this allegation. His alleged JBS membership still appears in print and broadcast media today as fact, even though the media are by now perfectly well aware that the allegation is false. Why are the news media telling a deliberate lie in order to discredit a highly respected expert who questions the official government version of Oklahoma City?</p>

<p>If anyone wants to read a masterful hitpiece on the topic- check out this guardian article written by jon ronson.  he writes such an over the top caricature of the &quot;neo-nazis&quot; mcveigh was involved in.  the only way you buy the bullshit that ronson is selling is if you&#39;re already one of these authoritarian &quot;skeptoid&quot; goons who calls everyone who questions 9/11 or the jfk assassination a tinfoilhat wearing neckbeard.  But it&#39;s an interesting read, none-the-less.</p>

<p>An apocalypse (Ancient Greek: ἀποκάλυψις apokálypsis, from ἀπό and καλύπτω meaning &quot;uncovering&quot;), translated literally from Greek, is a disclosure of knowledge, i.e., a lifting of the veil or revelation. In religious contexts it is usually a disclosure of something hidden, “a vision of heavenly secrets that can make sense of earthly realities&quot;.[1]</p>

Is your tin foil hat coming loose or something?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see some &#39;empirical evidence&#39; to prove your theory that I think Hillary is great and that I receive payment for espousing these views.</p>

<p>If you can find even one mention ANYWHERE in my post history that states Hillary is great, or that I receive money for my views, I will doff my cap to you and bid you a good day.</p>

<p>You get me?
Nah, &quot;dude&quot;... I don&#39;t think you do.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re mirroring many of the descriptive words I&#39;ve already used with you.  You can see how effective they&#39;ve been, and many of lesser intelligence will often mirror just like this (falsely) believing that since my volleys were successful, yours will be as well. (It won&#39;t)</p>

<p>But it&#39;s quite clear we&#39;re dealing with a deep intellectual here.  By seeing you even attempt to use such terms as &quot;<em>conspiracy</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>tin foil hat</em>&quot; <strong>ON A CONSPIRACY FORUM</strong> as derogatory terms, you&#39;re clearly knocking this right out of the the park, bruh!  Good job!</p>

<p>Then choosing to use the far too frequently used (by a certain, well defined class of individuals) &quot;PROVE THAT I GOT PAID&quot; justification, you&#39;ve only made things easier for the outside observer to verify.   </p>

<p>A quick trending of your posting history reveals much.  It seems you cannot resist commenting any time Hillary is brought up.  Why is that?  I could use some more song and dance from you.  This is &quot;fun.&quot;</p>

I do slightly wish I could get paid to do this, but you&#39;ll just have to take my word for it. It&#39;s totally Pro Bono.
You think that by asking you to prove your assertion that I&#39;m paid, I make it easier to verify your claim?
Another interesting word choice. I think you mean speculate.
To verify something it does kinda, sorta, completely need to be proven.</p>

<p>With regard to commenting on Hillary: you are seeing what you want to see. Maybe it&#39;s down to that whole election thing that&#39;s happening, not sure if you&#39;ve heard about it.
Either way, there&#39;s clearly nothing more I can say on the matter that will change your mind.</p>

You have absolutely no clue, whatsoever.
Stating that I&#39;d quite like to get paid for posting my opinions online is not tantamount to announcing a political allegiance.
If it says anything at all, it says is that like most of the world, I wouldn&#39;t say no to some extra cash.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;ve already been perusing my comment history, why don&#39;t you use that mighty big brain of yours to look a little deeper? If you can find anything that states I support or endorse Hillary in any way - repost it right here.</p>

<p>First, the evidence for UFOs and a coverup thereof is overwhelming. </p>

<p>See for example the thousands (redacted) declassified documents, showing radar data, physical trace cases etc. <a href="http://bestufoevidence.weebly.com/official-documents.html">http://bestufoevidence.weebly.com/official-documents.html</a></p>

<p>The hundreds of (high ranked) whistle blowers, the mass sightings we had had, the scientific studies done (see the website mentioned above).</p>

<p>Then there is the abduction evidence, which a Harvard psychiatry professor believed to be true when he research it before it hit the media (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb1GK87ME58">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb1GK87ME58</a>), we have analyzed implants that were send to top laboratories who believed these objects came from &#39;rare meteorites&#39; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn06v9nH_nw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn06v9nH_nw</a>) and there has been done a lot of medical research by Budd Hopkins (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A2aGy_2u8c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A2aGy_2u8c</a>).</p>

<p>These same beings were also reported in the Zimbabwe UFO sighting with the same telepathic behavior reported in abductions (the 62 children did not all had an idea about aliens before (some believed they were demons) and they reported the same story) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pKC11SDnog">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pKC11SDnog</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no beginning or end to the Larry McDonald tragedy. His right-wing fanaticism drew him to the crueler side of blackmailers, burglars, assassins, terrorists, wiretappers, and people dedicated to waging a future war with the Soviet Union.
And there he was, last August 31 and September 1, apparently sitting all alone on Flight 007. If that was by Soviet design, then all of his entourage were Communists who knew in advance.
But since the American delegation was screened and cleared for travel with a congressman, then the CIA and U.S. agents knew something they wouldn&#39;t share with him – even if it was going to save his life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Western Goals Foundation was a private intelligence dissemination network active on the right-wing in the United States. It was wound up in 1986, when the Tower Commission revealed it had been part of Oliver North&#39;s Iran–Contra funding network.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Western Goals Foundation solicited funds to create a computer database on American subversives, but was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) when it was caught attempting to computerize references to “subversive” files pilfered from the disbanded Los Angeles Police Department “Red Squad.” Allegations by the Reeses and other right-wing spies have been used by the FBI as a justification for launching massive investigative probes. These intrusive FBI investigations harassed, smeared, and disrupted groups that were not engaged in any criminal activity, but simply exercising their constitutional rights to dissent from official government policies.</p>

<p>Some posit AMI , National Enquirer etc had in its possession some extremely spicy photos of GWB in a coffin/naked/skull &amp; bones rituals &amp; this was the reasoning behind targetting that loc with anthrax.</p>

<p>People need to be ruled, controlled thats why there is society. We just have to believe that the rulers have our best interest in mind, which if they dont causes civil unrest. We just have to ask ourselfs, why does america make isis to pretend to fight war on terror like it did with war on drugs, but does nothing to actually stop it. To destabalise europe, cause inter national tention etc. Be relevent military police of the world. Who fucking knows, we the people dont have enough truth to make real judgment calls here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Guantanamo thing is sad. Most people still seem to think they house only evil terrorists there- not taking into account that 90% of the prisoners were kidnapped by warlords and SOLD to the US.</p>

<p>When the US started offering &quot;bounties&quot; on terrorists, these people would kidnap random farmers and just SAY they were terrorists.</p>

<p><a href="http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_05_18/90-of-Guantanamo-prisoners-are-innocent-people-sold-to-US-Gov-former-detainee/">http://sputniknews.com/voiceofrussia/2013_05_18/90-of-Guantanamo-prisoners-are-innocent-people-sold-to-US-Gov-former-detainee/</a></p>

<p>But it&#39;s OK to kidnap innocent people according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_theory_of_intelligence_gathering">mosaic theory of intelligence gathering</a> whose wiki page states:</p>

<p>&quot;As practiced in the CIA&#39;s black sites and the US military&#39;s interrogation centers at Guantanamo, Bagram Theater Internment Facility, and Kandahar detention facility <strong>captives who were not themselves suspected of an involvement with terrorism were nevertheless held</strong>, and interrogated, because someone they had an innocent association with was suspected of an involvement with terrorism. <strong>Interrogation of these individuals, in great detail, en masse, was believed to allow analysts to fill in the mosaic and the milieu of actual terrorists&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>If anyone wants to see the awful treatment these people receive, watch the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXCth19kwRw">The Road To Guantanamo</a> and prepare to be horrified.</p>
