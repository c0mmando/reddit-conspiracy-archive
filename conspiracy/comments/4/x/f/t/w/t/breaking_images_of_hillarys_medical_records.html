       Was leaked by @HillsMedlRecords on twitter but the account was immediately shut down. I don't know if the documents are legit or not.

       EDIT: "Debunked" by our favorite Snopes Reporter, Kim LaCapria
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kim LaCapria is a New York-based content manager and longtime snopes.com message board participant. Although she was investigated and found to be "probably false" by snopes.com in early 2002, Kim later began writing for the site due to an executive order unilaterally passed by President Obama during a secret, late-night session (without the approval of Congress). Click like and share if you think this is an egregious example of legislative overreach.

       One of the possible medications she could receive is called:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">
        Modafinil
       </a>
       <br/>
       Which could explain her strange upbeat behavior
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of epileptic seizures I have, the other medication is most likely called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levetiracetam">
        levetiracetam
       </a>
       which is known to cause movement disorders (unbalanced).
       <br/>
       Edit: and low and behold if you top levetiracetam of with
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacosamide">
        Lacosamide
       </a>
       you could be needing adult diapers. And get:
       <em>
        " false and unusual sense of well-being."
       </em>
       <br/>
       This is all speculative (fortunately I don't need diapers). But this is the medication I use (except for he Modafinil which I researched as a possible means to get me through short difficult periods like weddings)

       Modafinil is very mild for say upbeat or strange behavior. The first time I took it I went to sleep. I had a very good sleep I must say.

       Modafinil is used for narcolepsy and fatigue. It removes the feeling of being tired for 12-18 hours. Nothing special, it'd probably be useful for anyone running a campaign.

       It lasts more than several hours and has a long half life.  One doesn't just take Modafinil because they need
       <em>
        something extra for a few hours
       </em>
       .  Also, Modafinil doesn't produce an "extra" affect, it simply lessens the fatiuge feeling after not sleeping well the previous night, hence its use with narcolepsy and 3rd shift workers who have irregular sleep schedules.

       caffeine can be tricky it has heightened my seizure activity, just one cup of coffee in the morning is all I can take at the moment. I'll have to do with a benzo the night before to get a good night of sleep. Then start up with 1 coffee, and I'm good to go. Thanks for the clarification!

       Snopes is good on some topics. Complete bullshit on others. They have credibility because of the times they're correct, people ignore when they're making shit up. You know, just like how fans of CNN or Fox News don't realize they're full of shit because they both actually get some stuff right in between bullshit propaganda.

       I used to browse through the old Weekly World News rag just for giggles.  What I realized is that they artfully intermixed articles that were mostly true among the obviously made-up ones.  And even the made-up ones had a little bit of real fact included.  So if you had a low IQ, it could all appear to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that bugs me about Snopes is how many times it's cited by the supercilious college-educated, as final fact and proof.  It's not that there's anything wrong with college, but too many people come out of it thinking they know pretty much all they need to know. Challenge even one bit of that with new information, and they just gloat as they "put you in your place" by saying "Oh, please, Snopes said that was bullshit..."

       They didn't take that stance on that basis alone. If you actually read the article that was just the circumstantial cherry on top. Wrong letterhead, no signature, looks like something made in Word in 10 minutes ; actually think critically about it.

       I feel like they'd just hire a look-alike before doing that. Hire a look-alike and you can have them give a speech in front of thousands of people without question, and the only people who would know about the deception would be in the inner circle. Fake a video in front of thousands and people who appear in the audience could possibly expose the lie.

       That technology is still scary as fuck though.

       Hmm. This argument reminds me of "9/11 couldn't be an inside job, because some of the thousands involved would surely talk!".
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if they exposed the lie? Would the sheeple believe them? Would they be taken seriously by the MSM?

       Regarding the technology itself: That's the tech shown publicly. The stuff they hide in secret labs is at least ten years ahead of that. For all we know, tech like that might've been used in "Presidential debates" already.

       You're right, but it's always better to maintain control than to assume that the thousands who know the lie would just be ignored. This is why Facebook, Google, Twitter are censoring shit. Even if our knowledge ignored by most people thanks to the media running disinformation, they still want to maintain control.

       Honestly, I'm kind of surprised Clinton hasn't gotten herself a double already. All of us talking about her health problems and such, she could have avoided that pretty easily. Or maybe she does have a double, and she only uses it sometimes? Haha, there's no way to know anything for sure!!

       I don't think there is that much of a difference between a pre-written speech and a press conference before ultimately the same audience (the people of the US and beyond), with regards to political pressure and anxiety.

       People who can have stress-induced seizures can take medication to suppress the seizures, and it's not like the seizures we're talking about are necessarily full-body convulsions either. Depending on the type of seizure, the symptoms may appear completely invisible to outside observers. If you consider this and the fact that she may have been under medication, it also explains the strange behavior she exhibited at the DNC, like the balloon "surprise" that turned into a huge meme.

       While I'm also highly suspicious of this (I don't believe this a little bit): medical reports aren't necessarily what you think of when you say "official medical records" i.e. a form with plenty of checkboxes etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time these reports are there to inform other doctors about what you have done with the patient, which diagnoses you made etc. and they are in fact "whipped up in MS word" and read and look like a dog's meal. Compared to what you'd often see these are almost too nicely worded and formatted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I'd agree insofar as that a physician HRC went to would produce something a little more posh looking.

       Exactly - these are TX notes - only for MD to keep basic record of office visit (which is why no fancy letterhead and sometimes have no letterhead.)  The meds/dosages, vitals, etc are recorded elsewhere in chart - Can you imagine trying to look at a patient's Rx history and have to go through every Tx note?  Actually, these look pretty good - re: "dog' meal" above is a better descriptor of many you see - commonly don't even have complete sentences.  I believe these are legit for many reasons.

       Sorry but no, transfer notes are used for inpatient services and can be more informal.

      <p>
       Transfer of care notes notes among outpatient providers are formal.

       In any case this note is neither as its structured incorrectly and resembles no note I have ever see written by any provider.

       Moreover, medically this note is useless. There is no discussion of the actual evaluation, differential or tests that were offered. The patients past medical history is not referenced. neither are specific meds or interventions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore the interventions and symptoms vaguely noted don't match the diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       MMSE just measures a dementia patients mental function, it's a quick and dirty screening test. It won't tell you what type of dementia and it's just a primary care screening exam.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the diagnosis is vascular dementia then there would be a discussion of risk factor modification and the clinical symptoms that suggest this is vascular dementia which has a
distinct pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a concussion memory loss, confusion, blacking out sounds more like post concussive syndrome not partial seizures. If one was was worried about partial seizures one would do an 
Eeg. Also a physician would describe what these episodes looked like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any note discussing a patients status would note which anti epileptic- there are many. Also it would note which anticoagulant as some require daily monitoring, some don't. Vascular dementia is not treated with an anticoagulant. Also people with seizures are risky to put on anticoagulants. It's not clear from the note why she is on this anticoagulant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a first year medical student wrote such a note they would be a joke let alone a physician treating Hilary Clinton. There entire thing looks like someone with maybe a little medical training tried to cobble together a physician note. It would be comparable to a secretary trying to forge a legal brief. Some of the words and structure would plausible to a lay person but a lawyer would see through it instantly.

       Really? As a physician? You write episodic notes? What is that? In the US we have progress notes, admission notes, consult notes (initial and progress), icu notes (progress and admission), well visit notes, full h and p's for intake visits, telephone encounters, procedure notes... What is an episodic note?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you with a straight face tell me that a physician, particularly one who takes care of Hilary wrote a note like that? Sure people might informally note a telephone encounter, no billing there, but that's not what those are. Those purported notes are devoid of usefulness to anyone... It's a total farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a medical legal document it's useless. Billing it's useless. Medical transfer information it's useless.

       We obviously have different opinions on this issue - in my opinion the leaked records are totally legit.  Let me preface by saying I'm not trying to be "mean" about HRC's medical issues.  On the contrary, I feel for her - she is very intelligent (I'd estimate her IQ to be around 140) and also likes to be in control, so it has to be scary for her knowing that her mental acuity is slipping, and there is little she can do about it.  I would not wish that on anyone.  However, I also believe a candidate (and all of us) should be honest about any issues that could interfere with performing the full range of responsibilities a job requires - and there are legitimate reasons to question her cognitive ability to do that, particularly in the areas of memory, decision-making, judgment and planning ability.  That being said, I'll respond to your comments in the order you presented them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tx is "treatment" not "transfer."
      </p>
      <p>
       The formatting doesn't concern me - that varies between physicians, and Dr. Bardack's look as good (or better) than many I've seen (and I've reviewed thousands.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The notes are not "useless."  HRC is an established patient of Dr. Bardacks.  Therefore, the Dr. is not going to dictate a full medical history for each visit - that's why there is an "interim medical history" section - what has happened since the last visit.  Any lab work, imaging studies, psychological testing, etc. results, are elsewhere in the chart.  The February 5, 2014 note indicates Dr. Bardack is ordering an MRI, and the leaked MRI is dated February 20, 2014.  Similarly, although the medications aren't referred to by name, only as anti-coagulant and anti-seizure, that is not uncommon as detailed medication info is in another section of the chart.  Lastly, interventions ARE noted  - continue anti-coagulant, continue and increase anti-seizure and order an MRI.  There is not much more "intervention" you can do with these diagnoses - treatment is prophylactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the symptoms ARE consistent with the diagnoses:  Subcortical Vascular Dementia secondary to a cerebral venous thrombosis (blood clot) in the right transverse sinus.  There is also a history (noted in the official release letter) of deep vein thrombosis (likely in legs) in 1998 and 2009. Anti-coagulants are prescribed for varying periods of time after a cerebral thrombosis, usually a few months.  However, a patient with a history of clots is at higher risk which explains the ongoing anti-coagulant prescription of Coumadin.  The Partial Complex Seizure diagnosis is supported by subjective reports of "blacking out and uncontrollable twitching" which, based on the March 20, 2015 notes, had not responded well to the increased dosage of anti-seizure medication, as there was subjective report of more frequent mini seizures accompanied by short periods of blacking out.  Both these diagnoses are supported by the imaging results which are consistent with residual damage from the cerebral venous thrombosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right - the MMSE is a "quick and dirty" SCREENING test.  It is insensitive, particularly if someone has mild symptoms.  For that reason, I wouldn't administer it without using a Canter Background Interference Procedure (BIP) for the BGT - only takes a few minutes more and increases the overall validity.  I mention this bc the February 5, 2014 note describes a "significantly lower score" on the MMSE compared to the 2013 MMSE performance.  This information is useful - as I said earlier, HRC is intelligent - Intelligence is correlated with performance on some parts of the MMSE - digits forward/backward, for example.   By mention of the 2013 MMSE, we have a baseline for comparison, and it helps weed out variables like intelligence.  There is no mention of other, more in-depth, psychological testing, such as Wechsler Memory Scales - it may be the results were omitted or, for various reasons, never ordered.   The bottom line is that the MMSE is a SCREENING tool and NOT particularly sensitive, so if someone has problems on it, there is DEFINITELY a problem.  Other than subjective complaints of memory loss which suggest their may be performance deficits in that area of the MMSE, we don't know the other cognitive areas affected. What we DO know is a diagnosis of Subcortical Vascular Dementia requires proof that the problem is related to a medical condition (proved by imaging results,) memory impairment (supported by subjective report and, I suspect, MMSE performance,) cognitive impairment in at least one other area (e.g. reasoning, ability to perform multi-step tasks, language, judgement, planning, decision-making, orientation to date, place, time,) and the cognitive problems cause significant impairment in day-to-day functioning (which is consistent with subjective report and MMSE results.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, she had a concussion in late 2012, and the symptoms you describe are characteristic of post-concussion syndrome.  What you are not taking into account, is that the concussion led to a blood clot in the brain, and the resulting infarct damaged nearby areas of the brain, most likely the temporal region.  People with temporal lobe damage may have seizures.  A few recent “seizure” videos have surfaced.  Watching this,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd4NH9jKNas">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd4NH9jKNas
       </a>
       I wasn't convinced - looked like the film was looped and hard to tell what was what.  However, another video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.comwatch?v=jtU5nMbEsQ4">
        https://www.youtube.comwatch?v=jtU5nMbEsQ4
       </a>
       taken from a different angle clearly suggests seizure-like activity. A few seconds prior to the "seizure" she appears to have difficulty finding her words - they're halted.  Temporal lobe damage can also cause problems with visual perception.  There are several videos where she requires physical assistance.  What strikes me (and there may be ones I've missed) is that the problem always seems to occur on stairs - not on even surfaces - but on planes, stage exits, etc - I wonder if this is due to visual perception problems in that she has difficulty differentiating where one surface ends and another begins.  Let me say here, that neither a seizure condition nor visual problems should preclude a person from being an effective President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporal lobe dysfunction can also cause problems filtering incoming sensory stimuli – i.e. a person could easily feel overwhelmed and may be viewed as reacting "oddly" to situations.  Does H’s team attempt to cover this by limiting access and insisting on controlled conditions?   If you compare H's past and present functioning through videos, interviews, etc. there is clearly a difference.  She needs a teleprompter - and can't even follow that, e.g. reading "sigh."  She appears to have difficulty finding words at times.  She appears to decompensate under stress which could explain the unwillingness to place herself in unpredictable situations like press conferences.  Is the collusive media scripting a strategy to avoid a public meltdown?  Is this another reason she's avoiding debates?  She can no longer keep her stories straight.  Maybe when she says "I don't remember," she really doesn't remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO, in closing, I believe these leaks are "the real deal" - and, in conjunction with her recent behavior, the American public deserves an honest assessment of her ability to effectively function as the President - Unless, of course, they have no issue with Abedin, Soros, Blumenthal or "whoever" managing this country.

       I am sorry but you regurgitated a whole lot of words that seam technical but don't make sense. Sorry there is no such thing as a treatment note. There are usually progress notes. These require certain pieces of documentation, usually for both billing and medial legal reasons. This one lacks everything one might need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your conjectures about her diagnosis is an impressive amalgam of medical terminology without real sense. Falls and concussions can be accompanied with hemorrhage of various types. Central venous thrombosis is very rare and not related to trauma. Neither of these relate to vascular dementia. There is no test that specifically diagnosis vascular dementia. An MRI might show some little infarcts, but that's what makes dementia hard. Furthermore, treatment for that is control of the same risk factors as heart disease. Finally, I have seen many patients with dementia. Hilary does not have it. Too quick with dates and facts at the Bernie debates. Also I have seen this seizure videos, no neurologist would thinks that's a seizure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I can't even begin to address your post. It's like bizarro parallel world to actual medicine. No one clinically uses BIP. Concern for partial seizures and breakthrough seizures requires an eeg. If she was max dose on an anti-epileptic they wound mention the dose and change the Ned or add another one. That's why omitting the med name is bizarre. If she was on anticoagulantion which one she is on is important. Also why is no neuro exam documented?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an example of a good neuro progress note:

       These Hilary Clinton doctors notes are also sad attempts at forgeries too. I have read many good and bad notes and they all have a certain structure and form because medical training is standardized. This was simply not written by a doctor... especially one they let near Hilary. Physicians from day one of residency learn to communicate in a certain way. This just is not a physician documenting or communicating anything. It's a useless note to anyone trying to refresh their memory about a patient, transferring care, or documenting for medical legal purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a doctor you personally know, show this to them and they will tell you it's a crock of shit.

       It is a strange one. Wouldn't they use a letterhead if it was going to be official or open letter?  Makes sense not using one if it was for private eyes. Also the mysterious death of the possible leaker adds some credibility to the story.

       Have you never worked at an office where they ran out of letterhead and occasionally used regular paper? Are you really suggesting it's impossible for an office to print on regular paper? Because I assure you, without a doubt, it happens. It's unprofessional, but it fucking happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how fucking hard is it to fake a letterhead? If the letterhead was on there, would you say "Wow this is definitely real"? It's irrelevant.

       I can assure you, doctors record information in basic text form too. They don't only use forms. Hahaha. How could they possibly contain all information about a patient's visits and problems in a simple form? What would a form document look like which would be able to accurately contain all of the information contained in these text-based reports?

       Doctors are taught to communicate info a specific way, whether a short hand note or formal progress note, this note missing info, makes no medical sense, and is missing things that doctors would expect in even a brief note. It's not a way a doctor would speak even after first year of medical school. No one would write a note in that way. It's written by a lay person.

       1) Those "text forms" still don't have a letterhead. Not absolutely necessary, of course, but still a little weird considering this is something supposedly containing pretty sensitive medical information for a high level government official.

       lmao what are you talking about medical reports are routinely missing shit that you would think is important
      </p>
      <p>
       Missing information in medical documents is a large contributor to misdiagnoses and other problems. In fact, reliance on documents which may be incomplete is the reason why doctors have to ask their patients the same exact questions over and over and over and over and over and over. They even explicitly ask patients questions for which they already know the answer or which can be easily inferred, just to ensure they're getting the correct information.

       Also, you're an empty account with only two comments despite thousands of comment karma and being a member of the 2 year club, so yeah, you're totally full of shit.

       I work in medicine and this is fake as hell. Nobody would give a MMSE to a wealthy or important person to gauge progression of their disease, they would use a more specific test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody writes notes like this. They even messed up the chief complaint field. The terminology is all wrong. An important figure like Hillary would have a note much longer than this with more specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they copied a template note from a foreign country like Britain or Australia and threw in some jargon to make it look official. Come on conspiracy, I expect a little more skepticism out of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if your doctor is using a word processor to write notes they are probably a quack. Security is the name of the game and I'm sure the Clintons can afford a doctor with an encrypted emr.

       The prevalent argument that i am seeing here for it being fake is "thats not how these things are done". There are thousands of doctors out there that run there establishments thousands of ways. So their supposed experience with a handful of doctors makes them an expert on how paperwork is done?

       I don't know maybe because they spend all day reading notes, writing notes, and knowing what has to be in a note to bill for it. Believe it or not there is a standard way of writing medical documentation and these notes are clearly fake to anybody with medical experience.

       I see you're not actually reading comments. Because if you had, you would see that i havent taken a posiiton on whether it is true or false. Only the position that you have neither the authority or experience to make a claim either way. Its also telling that you consider me to be a layman with no evidence to support that idea. The only thing that is evident in this discussion is that you are taking a page from the DNC. Sound like you know what you are talking about to plant the seed of doubt. Sorry, but that just isnt going to fly here. Either show some proof or shut the fuck up. Its that simple.

       Under medical examination there's a sentence about MMSE, which is the Mini Mental Status Exam. "Delivered MMSE" means that the MMSE was conducted yo completion. So I was conducting these tests on daily basis. Sorry for the confusion

       No problem - haven't heard that terminology before.  So you know how "sensitive" an MMSE is - What does it say to you that her performance declined from one administration to the next?  I realize you can't make comparisons between subtests since you don't know her scores, but, in general,  would you agree that someone showing deficits on that type of screening definitely has some problems?

       In general, a marked decline between testing would definitely point to cognitive decline. The mini mental is incredibly broad and serves as a very general barometer for cognitive functioning. But once again, due to the lack of actual scoring, i highly doubt the veracity of these images. Hope that helps!

My family and I have varying medical issues and I have never once sen an official medical report look like it's been types on Microsoft word by a middle schooler. Hell just google medical record and find an example of a medical chart report that looks like that.

       I'm a resident physician, and I have to call utter bullshit on these "medical records". Hopefully I didn't lose most of you with that initial statement, but let me explain:
      </p>
      <p>
       These are so vague. So vague it hurts. A complete medical record for a visit should include the chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history (which includes family history, medicines, allergies, past surgeries, etc), review of systems (which isn't here), physical exam, and your assessment/plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically, the physical exam is broken down into systems. If she is presenting with neurological symptoms, this would be the most crucial part of the exam. I would expect more detail from a medical student doing their first rotation ever. "The patient is showing signs of having more frequent complex partial seizures". What are the signs? What about your physical exam led you to this decision? Did her pupils react equally when a light is shined on them? Did both eyes move in the appropriate directions when following your finger? Were all her cranial nerves intact? How was her muscle strength? Reflexes? Did you have her stand up and close her eyes to see if she got dizzy and fell over? Did you have her walk across the room and observe her gait? What parts of the MMSE (mini mental status exam) did she fail? What medications is she on, specifically? What is the dose?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literally no questions answered from this, and it is not an appropriate record that anyone who graduated from any medical school would create.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an open minded person, which is why I visit this sub on occasion. I've read a lot of interesting stuff about 9/11 and the DNC email scandal. I just want people to look for the truth and not immediately believe something because it fits some narrative you've already created. Feel free to ask any other questions.

       This is so obviously fake. First of all, it's just a word doc. Electronic medical records aren't just paragraphs with bold headings.
      </p>
      <p>
       For billing, you need to have certain elements in a note. But here, there's no physical exam, no vitals, no medication list, no actual MMSE score (as if the MMSE is the tool of choice to characterize dementia). The text is also very fan fiction. Anyone who has written or read clinic notes would immediately recognize this as fabricated by a layperson.

       lol these papers look like an 8th graders word-document. He can use bold text, he can use times new roman (which isn't really a practical font to use in a every day context), He can center things, he can make paragraphs... great! I totally believe this is legit :)

       The burden of proof isn't on me to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's fake. The person making the claim that it's real, the leaker, has the burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the person making a positive claim, against skepticism. That's how empiricism works, buddy!
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it's an internal memo in boilerplate MS Office template that serves no purpose but to sound official while paradoxically violating HIPAA. Also, the letterhead is wrong. It suddenly "leaked" shortly after her MD was named publicly for the first time. Convenient.

       So, I am a medical professional and have to write documents like these on a regular basis. Also, I'm no fan of Killary. However, I have to admit that these don't look quite right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly, the reason we create account numbers is so that the SSN is NOT listed. It's a privacy thing. So, the likelihood of an actual medical document having an SSN is slim to none. If anything at all was listed, it might just be the last four, but even that is unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other stuff, such as it looks like it came from MS Word, that means nothing. The voice-to-text programs and transcriptionists we use DO create docs that look like these, with the typos and everything. Sometimes, they even put in "______" when they can't properly translate a word, leaving you with actual blank spaces in your notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are created by programs and NOT printed on letterhead. That would be too costly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is a type of note is called an episodic note. It covers the time from your last visit until your current visit. It doesn't contain all of the info an H&amp;P would, nor is it meant to.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are worded a little plainly for my taste. Usually they are slightly more technical sounding, but I know quite a few physicians that speak more plainly while transcribing, so it isn't unheard of.

       Not sure what the commenters who say there are no tests for vascular dementia are talking about. There are. MRI will show white matter changes, and a few other abnormalities. And a PET scan can actually show hypoperfusion and hypometabolism. Also, we DO do repeated MMSEs to gauge dementia. The reason why is because nondemented patients will score higher on the repeat test while demented patients will continue to score poorly, or even worse.

       Mmse is a screaning tool for all dementia. It can be a rough test to follow profession but is just a rough estimate. MRI, Pet, ct can show dementia associated changes and can show microstrokes but us not sensitive or specifc for any one type of dementia. That's a clinical diagnosis.

       Progress notes still require certain pieces otherwise they can't bill. You need a physical, it should list meds, it should list past medical. Also what neurologist it coo woud omit the name if the anticoagulant or anti epileptic? They are not the same, dose matters, some need levels to check efficacy...

       I think these are fake simply because the "black out" of the social security number seems too short to actually cover a social security number. It looks like they just printed it without it and made a mark with a black pen. I would expect that to be about 25% longer for an actual social security number given the font size and everything.

       While I'm also highly suspicious of this (I don't believe this a little bit): medical reports aren't necessarily what you think of when you say "official medical records" i.e. a form with plenty of checkboxes etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time these reports are there to inform other doctors about what you have done with the patient, which diagnoses you made etc. and they are in fact "whipped up in MS word" and read and look like a dog's meal. Compared to what you'd often see these are almost too nicely worded and formatted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I'd agree insofar as that a physician HRC went to would produce something a little more posh looking.

       This is the picture of the official verified letterhead. If these documents are fabricated, I wonder why they didn't bother copying it.

       It's also the same picture being use by disinfo agent Sorcha Faal. I wonder if that is where it originated from
