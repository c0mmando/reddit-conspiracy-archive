<p>I&#39;m not super familiar with the history of the region, but you shouldn&#39;t  carry political views into the olympics.  Even North Korea is allowed to compete.  Athletes are supposed to be respectful to each other no matter what their host nations&#39; relations are, and the Egyptian Judoka clearly wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>I</em> was talking about Egypt, and really only about one Egyptian.  I only mentioned Lebanon as an example of the pattern that was occurring.  I don&#39;t think this was about politics as much as that Judoka&#39;s anti-semitism.  If he were following the official policy he would have refused to compete like that Saudi Judoka.  He did compete, but didn&#39;t shake hands or bow afterwards which is very disrespectful in Judo.  </p>

<p>As to the Lebanese athletes: whatever their political views you can&#39;t expect the transportation service to spend extra money to accommodate you for something like this.  Even in ancient Greece during the games, entire wars would be stopped so everyone could get to the games safely and watch them.  This should be no different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nitpick: Judo is a martial art, not a sport.  We have this discussion on r/judo every now and again.</p>

<p>Onto your claim: This isn&#39;t inconsequential, the number of people that are interested is what gave the issue 3 spaces on r/all.  Stuff like that has a real chance of changing policy decisions among governments that actually listen to their inhabitants.  </p>

<p>And &quot;Judo&quot; aren&#39;t the people who need to &quot;get over it&quot;.  We all denounced his behavior pretty clearly since it was not in the spirit of Judo.  While I&#39;m concerned that some of the first major coverage the average person will receive is due to poor sportsmanship, I don&#39;t think that it will hurt us because people watching will know that it doesn&#39;t represent what Judo is about.  The people that need to &quot;get over it&quot; if anyone, would be the muslim countries that are bringing their politics into a sporting event.  Because remember, in the ancient games they would stop entire wars so everyone could compete in good faith because that is what sportsmanship requires, and these people aren&#39;t even willing to share a bus.  I understand that you don&#39;t like Israel, but their athletes are not the ones that have been systematically causing problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you said that they hate Israel and that I should &quot;get over it&quot;, to which I responded that people had stopped entire wars in the past in the name of sportsmanship.

You accused me of lacking empathy but didn&#39;t say why the people today couldn&#39;t do what has been done by others before them.</p>

<p>Empathy has little to do with it- if historical people can put aside their differences and compete with each other, then so can modern people. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>But the olympics is one of the few times where its required that people put aside their regional differences.  Look at the selfie with a north and south korean a few days ago as an example- that&#39;s what its supposed to be like.  I can hold it against him, since he was one of the few who failed in that regard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have no clue why it happened </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has a history of extreme anti-semitic views.  I&#39;m pretty sure that had something to do with it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and bashing the guy&#39;s character drives you farther from understanding another human being&#39;s plight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when I fail to understand this person&#39;s prejudice, I need to show  more empathy, but people hate Israel and you say I need to &quot;get over it&quot;.  That seems like a double standard.  Do you think its possible that you&#39;re own views on Israel are coloring your perception?</p>

<p>That&#39;s bullshit.  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm">Nobody owns the federal reserve.</a>  The reserve branches members have stock, but that <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/faqs/frs?WT.si_n=Search&amp;amp;WT.si_x=3">isn&#39;t the same as ownership stock in a corporation</a>.</p>

<p>The member banks receive 6% interest on the capital that they (voluntarily) keep at a local reserve branch.  If that capital wasn&#39;t held there, they could be loaning it to customers at interest.  The 6% is just to make up for their loss.  It also requires them to follow all fed rules and be subject to additional oversight.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To feed interest, they devalue the currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s by design.  Most economists whose opinions I care about would say that a low stable rate of inflation is better than no inflation at all.  If they did nothing to increase the money supply, it would cause deflation like the kind that led to the depressions of the late 1800s.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Independent &quot;within he government&quot; makes me laugh. As thrse idiots say they are accountable to no one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are required to testify to congress as well as being audited by the GAO and having their financial statements reviewed by Deloitte.  The governors are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THEY have been the source of every boom and bust. Every depression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also bullshit.  They&#39;ve caused recessions in the past, but not every recession is caused by monetary policy.  Look at the tax increase in 1937 or the three recessions in the 1950s as examples.  They&#39;ve caused recessions in the past, but some of them were because it would have been less destructive than doing nothing.  They tightened monetary policy in 1920 after WWI, in 1960 and throughout the 70s to control inflation.  </p>

<p>There were recessions before they existed, they were also more severe.  </p>

<p>Egypt&#39;s president al Sisi is a totally owned asset of USrael - he seized power from Egypt&#39;s first (and only) democratically elected president via a military coup that was fully supported by both the US and Israel.</p>

<p><strong>The pro-Israel lobby American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has begun a lobbying blitz to stop lawmakers from cutting military aid to Egypt, Al-Monitor has learned.</strong></p>

<p>P.S: It should have been put on like r/mma or r/sports, not anywhere else, as it would be taken out of context and be made political in the eyes of most people.</p>

<p>DOUBLE EDIT: I do realize the media is trying to sensationalize this as political, but it is not. I love r/conspiracy, and I like the convo&#39;s in this thread, it&#39;s just that it doesn&#39;t really need to be here, as it kinda seems like the media has forced an assumptive bias upon a sporting event, made it political, etc etc. Seems like r/conspiracy kinda got tricked, and I don&#39;t like to see you guys tricked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got so tricked, on something so &quot;irrelevant&quot; that how many attempts to &quot;correct the record&quot; have been made here.  Trying repeatedly to downplay and REPEATEDLY reinforce just how &quot;insignificant&quot; this truly is.  Your full page edited and re-edited attempt is simply choise.  Always the victim...and how they&#39;re so picked on for nothing!  The sport deserves so much better!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apart from being a conspiracy theorist, I also do Judo.  This isn&#39;t the first issue like this in the olympics.  I think the big deal was that fucking everyone was watching the olympics, so everyone saw.  Its not keeping with the olympic spirit and is disrespectful.  Its also not keeping with the spirit of Judo (look at the thread on r/judo for our take on it).  The Egyptian athlete also didn&#39;t bow until called back by the ref, which would probably be enough to disqualify him even if he had won.  </p>

<p>A lot of predominantly Muslim nations don&#39;t recognize Israel as a country and refuse to participate in international events with it.  This extends to their athletes refusing to compete with Israeli athletes, as in <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/08/09/why-a-saudi-judo-athlete-opted-not-to-compete-against-an-israeli-n2203122">this link</a>.  There were multiple instances of this going on throughout the games.  To be fair, even most of the threads in Muslim subs were quick to call out the fact that that was bullshit.</p>

<p>As to what that has to do with Palestine, I think that everything about Israel on internet comments always boils down to Israel vs. Palestine pissing match.  I don&#39;t think this is a conspiracy.  It was highly publicized, so the large amount of interest is justified.</p>

Exceeding I have read in depth on the matter leads me to believe they are just benefiting from the anti Islamic atmosphere we live in now.

<p>I&#39;m not super familiar with the history of the region, but you shouldn&#39;t  carry political views into the olympics.  Even North Korea is allowed to compete.  Athletes are supposed to be respectful to each other no matter what their host nations&#39; relations are, and the Egyptian Judoka clearly wasn&#39;t.</p>
