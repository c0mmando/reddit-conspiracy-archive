        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I use to be such a loving pot smokin eclective and eccentric all positive thoughts pot smokin social butterfly of a human. Had tons of friends, even had a facebook at one point that I used consciously and recreationally. I contained the dark world around me by being over abundant in optimism and positivity.  I made it a point to go out and explore and was so content with my circumstances. Even though I came from a shitty back ground with not alot of opportunity, and still that is the case. I found solice in society and wouldn&#39;t let the world bring me down. Now all that has changed. I have no friends, its so apparent that people are shitty, needy materialistic ass holes driven by greed. People are bafoons, drunk off the system. Women wanna use men. Men objectify women. Women back stab other women. Men abuse other men. The world is in the most weirdest state of indenial turmoil that I ever seen. Everyone is so entitled, its all about lust and fame. Taking pictures aren&#39;t too collect memories&#39; they are for 1 up status updates. People don&#39;t trust each other, and you are only good if you are capable of being vamped and sucked dry. I feel trapped and so foreign. I try so hard to stay connected with my inner self and battle the stream. But its becoming more and more difficult especially as it becomes more and more apparent that this IS the new reality. This is Sodom and gamora all over again. It is a whimsical hell. A mental institution, everyone is drugged ( and not the good kind ) and i just want out. The weight grows even heavier when you realize that there is no where to go or hide. Everywhere tainted by the agenda, everywhere infected with the influence of evil. Even if there are beautiful places, the under current that flows in the shadows has been tainted. I just dont know how much longer I can go on. I play my part everyday, to try and spread the word and energy of light and positivity. But every one is drunk. And even at times, I found myself too tipsy off of the scam. I&#39;m tired of having to play stupid just to fit in. I&#39;m really considering ending it. Please tell me i am not alone. I am so depressed and sad and with no one to turn too. I have become afraid of the world. In the back of my mind, in the depths of my soul.. I just know this isn&#39;t how it should be. Have I caved? Have i gone mad? And even worse..am I alone?</p>

<p>Edit: Guys I&#39;m not gonna commit suicide..i just feel like things are so bad I feel like I can talk myself into it.</p>

<p>Big edit: I wanna thank everyone of you ultra light beings for coming out sharing your beautiful words of wisdom and support. It means so much too me and for a moment I didn&#39;t  know if I was on reddit. It was like a beautiful dream, where everyone had a healing hand. It was a real life time out. As a token of my gratitude, I will like to share this piece of political humor with you. Some people meditate, go to their favorite podcast, but I listen to silly videos like this that cheer me up. Just so happens, one came out that fits the narrative of this community quite well. Enjoy everyone! Stay happy. Remember if you are ever in the bay area, SF dont hesitate to holla :3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not alone my friend. I&#39;ve spent a long time in that state, more than half my life at this point. I find some solace in knowing that it literally cannot go on like this forever. We might not get to see and enjoy the turnaround, but it will turn around.</p>

<p>I have a hard time remembering this often on my own, but you should feel a least a little pride in being able to see what&#39;s going on and not being able to participate. Believe it or not that is a form of strength, and I&#39;m proud of you. I wish I could say I was proud of myself for it, but I tend to be harsher on myself than to others.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not alone, and you&#39;ve not gone mad. You see a sick game and want not to play; this is healthy.</p>

<p>You can turn to me anytime, message me anytime. I think it could do us both well to, at the least, commiserate.</p>

<p>Stay strong my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I just have a stain on my past that binds my soul and my free will in shackles. I swear I was just a kid and didn&#39;t know what I was doing. And now this will haunt me for the rest of my life. All because of a sick culture that divides people and introduces them with filth at early ages to corrupt their innocence so the cycle of primitive culture will continue. I just wanna be forgiven. I am a good person and now I live in hell. I just wanna be free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgive you, for what it&#39;s worth. But I imagine you&#39;re a lot like me in that you are having a hard time forgiving yourself. I don&#39;t have any easy solutions for you, but I know it&#39;s possible. There are many choices we make that are made in part by the climate around us; sometimes we know not what we do. This is part of the design of the tragic system we find ourselves in.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find it helps to imagine my past as the actions of a different person - in many ways this is not entirely inaccurate as we tend to be different people at different times in our lives. If you think you could extend empathy or forgiveness to another person who had made the same choices, then it is not impossible to extend it to your past self. If you can extend it to your past self you can extend it to present and future selves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure one day you will find your way back to a better place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much. Like I mean it. And i hope you can come to forgive yourself as well. It&#39;ll be similar battle we fight together. I have heavy demons. But only just one really that&#39;s the darkest. Its people like you and others in this thread and community that remind me I am not the only one fighting and to continue to stay strong. Hopefully in the end it&#39;ll all make sense, and I was the only one judging me. I&#39;m just afraid of being punished physically and spiritually for my past actions. But I realized I&#39;m the only one punishing myself by holding on to said past. Kind of a tricky world eh?</p>

Smoke less weed (just gets me thinking more about all the shit going on)

    <div class="md"><p>Please my friend, consider what I, a complete stranger, have to say about your beautiful post. I attempted suicide twice in my life. The first time I woke up in the hospital, but I was fine. I walked out two days later and a few months later I was having suicidal thoughts again. About a year after my first attempt I tried again. This time I woke up paralyzed. My right arm was swollen like the Hulk, I couldn&#39;t move my legs, I pissed into a bag and my urine was brown because I had end-stage kidney failure from the drugs that I used to off myself. They said I might be on dialysis for the rest of my life. I had to learn how to walk again, and I had to learn how to live again. If there is one thing I can guarantee you, and it&#39;s the most important thing, is that the way you are feeling now, even if its been for a year straight, it&#39;s not the way you will feel forever. You won&#39;t think about the things you&#39;re thinking about now in a few years. This will be a distant memory if you hang in there. You do not want to do what I did, I have suffered so much as a result, put my family through so much hell, hundred thousand in medical costs. Even worse, if I had not woken up my family would never be the same. But it&#39;s not about that, it&#39;s about learning to live again. You have to do some real soul-searching and find out what is making you feel so poisonous. Besides all of the bullshit which pervades us, which we all discuss in this sub, it doesn&#39;t have to effect you in your mind&#39;s eye. I don&#39;t have friends either. I don&#39;t use my phone. I don&#39;t have a job yet. I&#39;m a loser. But I&#39;m not suicidal. And it&#39;s beautiful. Take it from someone who ahs been where you are that it can get better.
Thanks for writing the post btw-- you&#39;re a great writer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey how are things now with you? Did you recover? And thank you you. If you live in the bay area give me a shout. I live a pretty reckless lifestyle, but that&#39;s probably because I hang out alone these days. It works out. But my problem is, sometimes I will drink a little more than I should..and if something triggers it..i will start projecting my insecurities and reluctantly burn bridges. I dont usually share this with people. But tid for tat ? I don&#39;t mean it, it usually dosnt happen when I have loads of money in my bank ( which is never ). Loads as in a couple hundred to spend for false happiness. I&#39;ve become a loser too. You should see the way old friends, girls, people treat me now. Part of it is my fault. But if they are gonna say fuck me? Well Hey, I love you, but sorry fuck you too. I find foreigners are the best. Met some awesome people from Paris who said I will kill it In France. Said thing is, I&#39;m afraid to go to work. Havnt been in 2 weeks. I&#39;m ashamed of myself, and my recent behavior. I feel like people are judging me, and I don&#39;t want anyone too look at me or see me right now. Dont wanna run into anyone I made a fool of myself In front of recently. Also I think this guy who assaulted me has it out for me. I dont wanna face that yet, because I may snap if he pulls what I&#39;m hoping he doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeesh I am very similar to you, except maybe a few years down the line from you. I had substance abuse problem too, and that&#39;s why I attempted suicide. I couldn&#39;t clean up my act so I kept having to go to inpatient rehabs, getting clean for 4 months, then relapse for a few months. Rinse and repeat. Recovering heroin addict. It sounds to me like you first need to address your drinking too much. No matter what else is going on around you, good or bad, if you&#39;re like me then you&#39;re miserable if you&#39;re drinking too much / using. Have you ever gotten help for it? If you have then I&#39;m probably beating a dead horse so I apologize, but if not I would look into getting yourself some help. It sounds like you&#39;re at the point where if you keep going you&#39;re gonna be forced to get help by those closest to you. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible for you though, do you have insurance? </p>

<p>Yes, I recovered, thankfully. Full use of my legs, my kidneys healed. I am very lucky. I had to go through that stuff, it was my journey. I sincerely hope you can take a different route. But I hope we end up in the same place! </p>

<p>Try not to worry about being a loser or women right now, honestly. I haven&#39;t even had sex in a few years now, and I haven&#39;t been in any relationships either. If you&#39;re anything like me, women drive me fuckin mad and its better for me right now while im sorting my life out just to be single anyway. Especially for addicts man, nothing gets more people to pick up a drink like fighting or being rejected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to hear you made it through!! That&#39;s what&#39;s important here.</p>

<p>As for me, drinking. I&#39;m reaaal nice with it man. Only beer, no black outs and I don&#39;t drink everyday. Actually havnt had a beer in a week. Considering these circumstances right now, I don&#39;t quite know whether to be happy or annoyed about that, ha!
I don&#39;t have no insurance, no dental no nada. What a free country huh? All I got is my cautious. Be careful. I hate the doctors anyway. I think personally, I just mess having REAL people to talk to. Friends I think is what we use to call them. I&#39;m no longer best friend&#39;s with my best friend. His girlfriend doesn&#39;t want me around because I&#39;m not materialistic or rich enough. So I said screw them both. We were growing distance anyway. But he started picking up her symptoms of judgment. I think I just need to cool down, let the world around me cool down before I dive back in and go to work. My only vices are Cigarettes and Beer. I&#39;m not too greedy, and honestly, not that desperate. I do enjoy your sense of concern. Really do appreciate it. Dont forget to check the YouTube link I left in the op</p>

I understand the feeling, though, and as painful as that feeling is, it is there for a reason - at least that has been my own experience.  We are socialized to believe &quot;aloneness&quot; is a negative thing - it is not.  It is an opportunity.  It is God, a Higher Power, a &quot;universal connectedness&quot; in you that is making all else be still so that you will hear.  You are in a state of transformation.  Embrace it.  You are redefining yourself for a reason, although you may not yet understand why. 
I am not down-playing your depression - and, certainly, if you are thinking of harming yourself, you need to seek professional help to get over that hurdle so that you can continue to find your purpose.  But mostly what I am reading from you is that you&#39;re frustrated with the status quo and see nowhere to turn without the status quo hitting you in the face.  Go inward. Project outward.  Feel the strength in your calm.  You will find your direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hery listen.  I&#39;ll be your friend.  </p>

<p>I hear you and I&#39;ve had very similar thoughts.  I lost all my friends also.  I used to be the type of person people would gather around.  Now I&#39;m a conspiracy curmudgeon who knows too much and cascasnt seem to keep it to himself: hence the lonliness.  I&#39;ve struggled with being hasppily employed, had several failed businesses (online startups and a physical biz), that failed by external factors and bad luck/timing, and/or political factors I was not privy to at the time.  When I had good money, I could not buy a house because others ruined that dream for me, twice.</p>

<p>While I was working a regular job in co as developer for web, I contracted hiv and years later had a stroke from the medicine itself that made a hole in my brain, causing stumbling and dropping stuff (like expensive computer equipment).  Leading to memory issues and deafness in one ear, my coworkers started treating me really shittily.  I finally told them my medical situation, but they didn&#39;t treat me any better.  I thought I was getting paranoid so I tried yoga, meditation, meds, audiologist, etc. Eventually I had a breakdown, and ended up on disability in a cabin</p>

<p>This is after I desperately tried to get my dwindling circle of friends involved politically in 911truth, which made them unfriendly me.</p>

<p>I wonder what they think now?</p>

<p>Anyway, I was on the verge of suicide at a point, so I drove myself up to NYC and received a week of ketamine treatments.  Each day, I jumped into a new dimension of reality and I knew this because each day the construction on the subway was in different areas forcing me to take a new path back to the bus station each day---no one is that fast at construction, and no public system could be that damn disruptive to the whole city.  Ketamine changed me, and changed my outlook.  I validated who I was both materially and immaterially.  It did in fasct cure my lifelong, treatment resistant depression, but it also fixed my hearing.  It cured.  My hearing loss.  Cured it.  Impossible, yet here we are.  It also seems to have given me the ability to write, or at least the inspiration.   And this experience and the resulting &quot;numinous&quot; observations made me realize there was a profound spiritual war in which we are engaged whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t give up on the world.  It needs you now more than ever.  Speak the truth, as you have here in this thread, OP, and you can&#39;t possibly go wrong</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing and letting me share my story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a}  Get out of the cities, and live rurally.  That should be your first priority.</p>

<p>&quot;But what about my family?  What about my job?&quot;</p>

<p>You have a choice.  Stay in the city, which is the easy thing to do, and be miserable; or risk some <strong><em>initial</em></strong> fear and uncertainty, (most of which will be completely unjustified anyway) in order to be happy permanently.  It&#39;s up to you.  Red pill or blue pill time.</p>

<p>b}  If you are going to use mobile phones and social media, <strong><em>only</em></strong> use them to communicate with people you already know offline.  </p>

<p>Do not use the Internet to make &quot;friends,&quot; because people who you do not know face to face, can not really be your friends, by definition.  Also keep your phone turned <strong><em>off</em></strong> whenever you are not using it so that they can&#39;t use it to track you; and buy one of the simpler, older, non-flashy smartphone designs, because they produce less radiation.</p>

<p>c}  I love computer gaming as much as anyone, but it is a hobby that needs to be controlled.  </p>

<p>Make sure that all of the other shit that you need to do during the day, gets done as well; because you will not be happy otherwise.</p>

<p>d}  Don&#39;t watch the evening news.</p>

<p>The media corporations and government want to keep you permanently miserable and terrified out of your mind, because that makes controlling you <strong><em>much</em></strong> easier.  That is what they use the news for, so don&#39;t watch it.</p>

That&#39;s how it gets right before you push through to the next level.
