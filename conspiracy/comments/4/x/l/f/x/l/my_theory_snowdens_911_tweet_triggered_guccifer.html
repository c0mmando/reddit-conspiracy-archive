       They use passwords like "password4", so yeah, they're all fucking hacked.  They probably click on every phishing link, too, the morons.  Capital Hill IT security must be a fucking nightmare.

       Every congressional dick pic is probably in a file somewhere, and being used daily for blackmail purposes.  No wonder it's so easy to buy those fuckers, you just flash them thier "secret" grindr profile and they vote on any law you tell them to.

       What's the deal with so many people commenting stuff like this? "Wikileaks has to release it now, if they had anything they'd release it now,
       <em>

       Wikileaks probably keeps the really good stuff in those insurance files. I'd love to see the documents that prove the Clintons are reptillian space beings who attain immortaility by raping children to get the marlocs from their bloodstream, but those files are probably the only thing keeping Assange from getting droned.

       There's no need for you to be snarky and condescending. People should be free to share their theories without getting ridiculed, if you have supplementary info to provide (such as you did with your post) that's great, but this sub should do it's best to rise above the hate that we're trying to fight. Not to out you specifically, I know I can be rude from time to time just like everyone else, but it's very much in everybody's best interest to treat one another with respect.

       Fair enough.  Have you tried posting this sentiment in any of the pro-hysteria posts on the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       front page?  Does our culture of respect include use of the term "shill"?  Has OP ever used this term?  How does raising the temperature of the room using words like "Treason" affect our level of respect?  Has OP ever used these terms?  Have you or I?

      <p>
       You should make a discussion post about this, and for the sake of unity, maybe it should be stickied.

       Sorry for the late reply, but you're absolutely right in that this sub needs to have a serious discussion about how to properly express our ideas without harassing those who don't agree with us. It does become somewhat difficult with
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       shills and ignorant commentators muddying the waters, but as long as we make an effort to consistently supply relevant evidence to the case we're trying to make and keep our heads cool, we will come out on top. When we debase ourselves with the same low-effort attacks of our critics, that's when we lose our credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway just wanted to say thanks for being cool and for your suggestion to make a stand-alone post about this. Think I'll work on that right now. Take it easy!

       The tweet prior to the code ,if you used to work with me, it's time. I so hope whoever the former coworker was used the opportunity for the good of all. And I sure do hope that soul is already In a non expedition friendly country, that does not allow rendition.
