       I've been thinking about this recently, in a short span of time roughly 2012 - 2013 there were numerous bath salt related cannibalistic attacks made by your average person.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_cannibal_attack">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I am no detective but all of this happened in a small window in time. There has not been any such attacks with similar nature aired across the MSM since. Which leads me to believe this was a controlled and isolated event orchestrated by an unseen party (Probably government)
I am positive that this was nothing but a test of a biological weapon or virus aimed at cutting down / destroying a portion of the population of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong. But evidence suggests otherwise.

       yes, so what really happened is that cannibal guy was having drugs tested on him, which were not bath salts. Government can cover up anything.

       Look into Sasha Shulgin and his books PiHKAL and TiHKAL. Then look at the analog act and DEA scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sasha Shulgin invented hundreds of new drugs (mostly psychedelic) and published a book about his experiences with them and how to make them. He was either a DEA black ops agent that went rogue to help the psychedelic community or a DEA black ops agent that's acting against the psychedelic community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since LSD, Cocaine, Marijuana, etc.. people looked for alternatives that were legal. Shulgin's books gave a number of ideas. These were made by various chemists as hobbies at first and then commercially later.
      </p>
      <p>
       The market for these drugs became so big, that Chinese labs stepped in to make them and custom variants. Basically the Chinese government is fine with them making drugs if they are for export, selling within China is a death sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned before that Shulgin's book is a good starting spot. The DEA has been playing whack-a-mole to schedule these drugs as they come out. The labs are slightly altering them. Sometimes this works out well, sometimes this works out poorly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people on the internet are basically the first people to ever do these drugs. Some get popular and then start getting sold as fake acid or such, others have bad effects or kill people and people stop using those.
      </p>
      <p>
       With such a small number of people doing it, it's easy to have a situation where the first 100 people trying it are fine, but number 101 has an adverse reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bath Salts are named as such because they were sold as "Bath Salts." Basically you can sell these drugs as long as they are not for human consumption. So you have things like "Bath Salts," "Plant Food," "Video Head Cleaner," etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Bath Salts was basically an umbrella term for legal stimulants meant to be like cocaine, speed, or mdma. Often times they are chemically disisimilar from each other, but the effects are that of a stimulant, so who cares sell them to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       MDPV and Mephedrone were popular Bath Salt varieties. Then they got scheduled so you see alpha-MDPV or what not. Again, whack-a-mole. It's hard to tell what he took exactly, but it's basically: legal untested stimulants where you are the guinea pig.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bath Salts are also sold as "Flocka" in black neighborhoods, referring to Wocka Flocka Flame, a rapper known for his hyped up trap style.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any more questions?

       It was probably just one bad batch by a huge drug cartel, who has since improved their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done bath salts a few times (on accident) and so have some friends. No one ever bit each other's faces of, it's just a strung-out feeling like cocaine, but some people do get a little more irritable than normal

       Well I only did it three times because it didn't make me feel like it was supposed to. Molly is supposed to make you super happy and energetic and want to dance, but I was just feeling anxious, scared and paranoid. So I stopped doing it when it would come up, but my friends kept doing it. I didn't find out until about a year later, I ran into a girl who would party in the same group as well and she told me that the guy selling admitted to her it was cut with bath salts. But I still don't know if it's true, I just know it wasn't pure MDMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually ran into the guy I used to buy it off of for the first time in like two years, and of course, as soon as I saw him he told me he had good Molly for sale. I just laughed and walked away

       We all gain wisdom from those types of experiences. I thought spice was a form of safely consumed synthetic marijuana, but unfortunately was part of the early crowd who discovered otherwise. I'm glad you're here to tell your story!
      </p>

       I really think we need to regulate these things so we can get authentic experiences instead of dealing with idiots off the street.

       Yes, I remember the spice phase. I never got into it but pretty much everyone around me was smoking it. So glad it died out, that shit looked and smelled like potpourris. I'd never inhale that shit, and I've inhaled a lot of shit.

       To this day, I wonder how different my brain would be if I didn't smoke it for over a year. I thought it was the healthy alternative to weed, but I swear I almost died a few times because of how tunnely it made my vision. I had a friend who straight went nonresponsive and had to go to the hospital.

       Hahaha! So what is the likelihood of a bio-engineered virus like what we've seen in the movies actually being created? Could we have a zombie apocalypse on our hands? Because i know that the government usually passes a bill for the event of a zombie apocalypse should it happen.

       Well similar, could be an engineered virus that gives you the characteristics similar or more intense as opposed to what flakka / bath salts give.
