It&#39;s not wise, but it is definitely possible.  This whole &quot;doesn&#39;t spoil easily&quot; doesn&#39;t really sit well with me.</p>

<p>Excluding very rare instance, unless I&#39;m raising, slaughtering, and preparing the red or &quot;white&quot; meat myself, there is no way in hell you would ever catch me eating either raw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to do with the meat itself being bad.  It was given as a figure of a spiritual principle. Originally man was only given the herb of the earth to eat, but after Noah got off the ark, God proclaimed all beasts to be food for man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. (Genesis 9:3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The restrictions only came in with the law of Moses.  Unclean beasts were restricted as a picture that we ought not consume that which is unclean spiritually. Unleavened bread is frequently used as a metaphor for the word of God (the Bible) contrasted with leavened bread (religions that add to the word) and unclean beasts (ideologies that are completely against the Bible).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. (Hebrews 9:9-10)</p>

<p>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. (Colossians 2:16-17)</p>

<p>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. (Acts 10:13-15)</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. (Acts 10:28)</p>

The most prevalent being that chimps mated with pigs to create humans. Another having something to do with failed genetic experiments on humans resulting in the creation of pigs.

<p>The increase was &quot;high&quot; but the actual percentage increased from 5 to 6 percent. </p>

<p>So. Let&#39;s say 100 people eat that. If they all eat 3 servings per day, only one more will have deleterious effects occur!! </p>

<p>There&#39;s way more to human nutrition than you think. Metabolism as well. </p>

<p>Crack open a human nutrition and metabolism textbook and get back to me.</p>

<p>There is high interpersonal variability in post-meal glucose. What that means is, that between each individual in the cohort, there were different glucose spikes in each person.</p>

<p>They can accurately predict glucose response with certain tools. They devised a machine-learning algorithm that uses blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in the cohort and showed that it accurately predicted personalized postprandial (post-meal) glycemic response to real-life meals.</p>

<p>They validated the prediction using a 100 person cohort.
Personalized dietary interventions showed interventions successfully lowered post-meal glucose. (Emphasis mine). This shows that each person should be on an individual diet and not on a one-size-fits-all diet.</p>

<p><a href="https://meta.science/paper/26590418_personalized_nutrition_by_prediction_of_glycemic_responses">https://meta.science/paper/26590418_personalized_nutrition_by_prediction_of_glycemic_responses</a></p>

<p><a href="http://news.meta.com/2015/11/19/cell-nutrition-is-personal-identical-foods-produce-healthy-and-unhealthy-responses-in-different-individuals/">http://news.meta.com/2015/11/19/cell-nutrition-is-personal-identical-foods-produce-healthy-and-unhealthy-responses-in-different-individuals/</a></p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t study how people have different blood glucose spikes while eating the same macronutrient combination? Good thing you&#39;re not in this field. </p>

<p>Only dullards study nutrition and metabolism? Ha. Haha. May I ask what you do for a living? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not pseudoscience. That&#39;s fucking hilarious. There are many more things you can call pseudoscience but human nutrition and metabolism isn&#39;t one of them!</p>

<p>Show me some proof that the study of human metabolism and nutrition is pseudoscience. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what you&#39;d expect? No no. I expected a non-response from you. Because you&#39;re not educated in this field.</p>

<p>Is the study if microbiota pseudoscience? They have huge effects on our metabolism and body. </p>

<p>We have trillions of gut microbiota. That’s what really ‘makes us human&#39;.Our life how it is now wouldn’t be possible without gut microbiota. It wouldn’t be possible for cows either, since they have certain kinds of gut microbiota that helps them digest what they eat since their digestive system wouldn’t be able to do so otherwise.</p>

<p>We NEED this gut microbiota, without it life wouldn’t be possible how it is.</p>

<p>If you’re not up to speed, get on speed. Because this will revolutionize dieting (in my opinion) as well as other facets of biology and human life.</p>

<p>So is cholesterol bad or good now? Did you finally figure out that a diet without fat is bad, or do your zealots still claim bad disinformation as &quot;research?&quot;</p>

<p>You see, if L Ron Hubbard rose from the grave and told us:</p>

<p>&quot;I have been to the other side, and I have a new book that will replace Dianetics!&quot;</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t care, because whether or not he&#39;s a zombie, whether or not he actually &quot;resurrected,&quot; he&#39;s still a known liar and con man.</p>

<p>Similarly, the last 30 decades of &quot;nutrition advice&quot; has varied wildly from recommendations that aren&#39;t provably effective, to actual dangerous information that harms the populace. Mind you, no one gets punished for these mistakes of the science. After all, mistakes happen...</p>

<p>A bigger issue is the collusion that is currently occurring in the academic scientific community (some of us clean house) specifically where nutrition is concerned. That, coupled with the above history, and the current state of the scientific community (your field excluded) leads many to distrust any findings coming from specific research groups, and for good reason.</p>

<p>Now, that doesn&#39;t mean the specific research you do or cite is in error. However, you should understand the environment you are engaging in when spouting such stuff off publicly.</p>

<p>The general populace doesn&#39;t trust you. They don&#39;t trust your medical research and they don&#39;t trust your conclusions based off of that research. The reason is because you are the known con man. Your field has been caught red-handed falsifying information for their financial representatives.</p>

<p>So your biggest problem, as a field, is public relations, and it&#39;s apparent at any trade show even marginally concerned with nutrition.</p>

<p>Dietary cholesterol is mixed. For instance like with eggs. When you eat eggs your body lowers its production of natural cholesterol because your body is smarter than that. </p>

<p>Dietary fat is needed. Why do you think we have an &quot;obesity epidemic&quot;? Because we were told that fat was bad for us and carbs were good. This spiked our insulin telling our bodies to hold onto fat. That&#39;s one of the stupidest things we&#39;ve ever done, and that may be irreversible. </p>

<p>I love how you&#39;re implying there is some sort of underhanded plot with putting out bad nutrition science. Shit happens. As our technology gets better we see what we did wrong and we see how the human body and metabolism really works and we can give better individualized advice to people. Yes, mistakes happen. We are beginning to refine nutrition science and really understand nutrition science. I&#39;m sure you know all the answers though! </p>

<p>Good thing the general populace believes nutritionists, doctors and the government and not some guy on a message board. Seriously, you really think that research on human nutrition and metabolism is useless? That&#39;s one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve ever heard. So we shouldn&#39;t trust science or researchers? Where should we get out information? YouTube videos? Morons who have no idea what they&#39;re talking about? Yes, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll give you great nutrition information, way better than the general populace has been told! </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a researcher, just a lowly nutritionist with a BSc going for my Master&#39;s. The paper I cited was brand new, came out this year. Stuff like this is the new breakthroughs I&#39;m talking about. Of course we have the extremely new research on gut microbiota, which is blowing my mind actually and I can see, eventually, diets personalized for the individual based on their gut microbiota. I&#39;m pretty excited for more research into this. </p>

<p>Not at all. The last 30 years when doctors et al have given nutrition advice to the general American they have taken it. I&#39;m not a con man to be honest. I hate the diet industry. I&#39;m also a personal trainer too and I hate piranha personal trainers who pray on the low information person when it comes to dieting and fitness. </p>

<p>I also hate how people say diets work. They have absolutely no understanding of human metabolism and nutrition. They have no idea how the brain slows metabolism down to how much kcal you&#39;re currently digesting. They have no idea of the body&#39;s protective mechanism to stay at its set point whenever it gets thrown out of the range. The general public knows absolutely nothing about this new research. Because of this, piranha personal trainers, nutritionists and others can take advantage of the average person&#39;s nutritional retardation and suck them into taking their money with garbage that doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I hate the big diet industry. I hate the big training industry. Because they not work. They only exist to suck money from people. I do the opposite. Personal fitness no matter what weight you are is most important. That&#39;s what matters, not bmi or weight. An obese person with good fitness who eats well has no negative effects in comparison to a thin person who eats well.. </p>

<p>Or you can just take nutrition information from some guy who has no idea what he&#39;s talking about, that makes sense right? </p>

<p>Serious question. What do you do for a living since you denigrate research scientists?</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals with obesity typically develop type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease, gout, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. In the past years it became clear that up to 30% of obese patients are metabolically healthy with insulin sensitivity similar to healthy lean individuals, lower liver fat content, and lower intima media thickness of the carotid artery than the majority of metabolically &#39;unhealthy&#39; obese patients. Recent studies suggest that protection against development of hepatic steatosis, ectopic fat deposition, inflammation of visceral adipose tissue, and adipose tissue dysfunction contributes to healthy obesity.</p>

<p>they are a bad scientist. The problem with your example is the term &quot;wrong conclusion.&quot; We assume a hypothesis is being tested by this experiment. &quot;The strip will turn blue.&quot; Gene performs the test and the strip becomes red. Red is not defined on the testing strip box from TotallyNotMonsantoCorp so Gene writes:</p>

<p>&quot;Test results undetermined. Strip turned red after I peed on it. Unable to classify the result due to a lack of quality instructions on the box.&quot;</p>

<p>That is a &quot;correct conclusion&quot; because that is entirely factual information. That&#39;s not a &quot;wrong conclusion.&quot; Now when Gene continues on his report...</p>

<p>&quot;The color change can be attributed to the fact that I ate carrots at lunch.&quot;</p>

<p>Gene saves his ass with the phrase &quot;can be&quot; and this doesn&#39;t make his conclusion wrong...</p>

<p>&quot;The color change was caused by my color blindness.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You brought up the fda like they are saints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s debatable. I accused them of being a regulatory committee for nutrition, which is true, and I accused them of being &quot;on the take&quot; which is also provably true. In fact, we agree on the FDA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you any idea of what the fda has approved in the last 5 years that later got taken off the market? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a good idea, and many dangerous products are still on the market. They don&#39;t perform the job we&#39;ve asked them to, and it sucks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We should tell people the truth, not just suck money out of people with shit that doesn&#39;t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We agree on this, as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you any idea the regulations one has to go through to be licensed? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As what? I mention more than one profession, so I need some clarification. However, I would imagine it is a &quot;class&quot; followed by &quot;continuing education&quot; for renewal, like 90% of license programs have adopted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who should we get nutrition information from? Better science with better people who won&#39;t lie for money is what we need. Sadly, that&#39;s all the industry is now. I understand that. And I think it&#39;s bullshit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, we&#39;re on the same side of the fence. We see the same problems and have similar feelings about it. I would imagine we have more common ground, than either of us would admit to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact of the matter is, one conclusion brought up 50 years ago with the technology we had then will be different compared to the technology we have today, testing what was tested 50 years ago which reached a different conclusion. Got it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, but my concern was the &quot;wrong conclusion&quot; aspect of your example, and I think I made my point about that, well enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What did you study in college?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was an odd one. I believe I audited 26 classes, in total. I took freshman pre-med (6 classes specifically) organic chemistry, literature, computer science, physics, etc. It&#39;s been a while though, and I don&#39;t think any of those show up on a transcript.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t think insulin sensitivity has anything to do with health? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only do I recognize that it does:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by a single <strong>measure of health, their insulin sensitivity</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>But I break down the rest of the comparison to show that it is the only claim they have to being &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;obese.&quot; Hardly what I would call a &quot;healthy&quot; person.</p>

<p>If I have one symptom of Ebola, does that mean I have Ebola? Just the single symptom does not necessarily mean that I have Ebola, but I might.</p>

<p>Similarly, just because a single measure of health, <strong>approaches</strong> the same level seen in &quot;lean healthy people&quot; doesn&#39;t mean the person is &quot;healthy.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides, it&#39;s entirely subjective. Take Mr. Obese over here. He is in that 30% that have similar insulin sensitivity to &quot;lean healthy people.&quot; By your standards, Mr. Obese is &quot;healthy.&quot; Now toss him a cigarette, and suddenly, he&#39;s &quot;unhealthy.&quot; What changed?</p>

<p>The circumstances changed. He can&#39;t be healthy and be smoking a pack a day (It&#39;s technically possible, but nutrition will always jump on smoking whenever it&#39;s an available target.) So that one choice, made him &quot;unhealthy.&quot; But if we don&#39;t know about his smoking... as if by magic... he&#39;s &quot;healthy&quot; again. Seems pretty subjective to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact is, it&#39;s possible to be obese or overweight and healthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it is, then you can also be a pack-a-day smoker and be &quot;healthy.&quot; You can snort amphetamines on a daily basis, and be &quot;healthy.&quot;</p>

<p>By definition, an obese or overweight person is &quot;of a weight (it says proportion?) that has been proven, by your field, to be &quot;detrimental to their health.&quot; It&#39;s like you are claiming burn victims are &quot;healthy sun tanners.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider this an authoritative source, but just read <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obese">it</a></p>

<h1>fat in a way that is unhealthy</h1>

<p>0_0</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... bro... on my phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excuses. It was a perfect place for a semicolon. Why pass up the opportunity?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...can&#39;t tell me what you do...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would take about 15 minutes to figure that out...</p>

<p>The problem is fat digestion. It&#39;s more challenging to digest fat as its not water soluble, so it doesn&#39;t mix well the the digestive enzymes in the gut. Bile breaks down the fat allowing it to mix with water, allowing your body to absorb the nutrients. </p>

<p>Source: me, nutritionist.</p>

<p>Pork is fine. The main reason it gets a bad rep is because of diseases like trichinosis. </p>

<p>Your body processes food for a pretty long time. It&#39;s still absorbing nutrients and amino acids hours after you eat.</p>

<p>Look up casein and whey protein for absorption rates. The same shit happens with different types of food, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &quot;bad for you&quot;.</p>

<p>A statement that is true, regardless of what we are talking about, followed by a suggestion that is always a good idea. That&#39;s kwalitee.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fda is just as bad. The fda pushes bullshit too</p>

<p>Indeed they do, but that statement confirms the fact that nutritionists push bullshit, as I said. Thanks for the confirmation.</p>

<p>Then it is the &quot;underhanded plot&quot; option. More excellent PR.</p>

<p>Sadly, more than you have shown to know, and it&#39;s not even my field.</p>

<p>You&#39;re implying that it&#39;s a waste since we have been told &quot;wrong things&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m implying it&#39;s a waste when it&#39;s part of an &quot;underhanded plot&quot; to &quot;make money&quot; because that isn&#39;t real scientific research. And you agree that such &quot;research&quot; is bad for the public&#39;s health, you just believe &quot;dieticians&quot; and other labels that don&#39;t spell &quot;nutritionist&quot; are the only ones guilty... outside of your industry&#39;s regulatory body, of course.</p>

<p>I&#39;m &quot;implying&quot; that it&#39;s a waste to listen to you drone on about old research, then state that the public isn&#39;t aware of the research, after claiming that your industry does a good job informing them, to the extent that they should be the sole authority on the subject.</p>

<p>If you had the ability to reflect on the content of your own posts, you might see that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s an example. A geneticist may do a test on a sample and come to a wrong conclusion because</p>
</blockquote>

<p>they are a bad scientist. The problem with your example is the term &quot;wrong conclusion.&quot; We assume a hypothesis is being tested by this experiment. &quot;The strip will turn blue.&quot; Gene performs the test and the strip becomes red. Red is not defined on the testing strip box from TotallyNotMonsantoCorp so Gene writes:</p>

<p>&quot;Test results undetermined. Strip turned red after I peed on it. Unable to classify the result due to a lack of quality instructions on the box.&quot;</p>

<p>That is a &quot;correct conclusion&quot; because that is entirely factual information. That&#39;s not a &quot;wrong conclusion.&quot; Now when Gene continues on his report...</p>

<p>&quot;The color change can be attributed to the fact that I ate carrots at lunch.&quot;</p>

<p>Gene saves his ass with the phrase &quot;can be&quot; and this doesn&#39;t make his conclusion wrong...</p>

<p>&quot;The color change was caused by my color blindness.&quot;</p>

<p>Here Gene has made a &quot;wrong conclusion.&quot; He could do the same thing in an easier way, by just saying:</p>

<p>&quot;The strip turned blue as predicted, due to [doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s lies based on a falsified experiment.]&quot;</p>

<p>And you&#39;re the fucking undergrad studying nutrition... fails to grasp the scientific method... more kwality from academia incorporated.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s not. It might be for whatever university you&#39;re chained to, but the gut bacteria thing is at least 8 years old, and not of US origin anyways. (Not that it matters)</p>

<p>Also obese people can be healthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why are they called obese?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the <strong>past years</strong> it became clear that up to <strong>30% of obese patients</strong> are <strong>metabolically healthy</strong> with insulin sensitivity <strong>similar to healthy lean</strong> individuals, lower liver fat content, and lower intima media thickness of the carotid artery than the <strong>majority of metabolically &#39;unhealthy&#39; obese</strong> patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably think that&#39;s some sort of revelation. A maximum amount of 30% of obese people are &quot;metabolically healthy&quot; by a single measure of health, their insulin sensitivity, which approaches similar levels to that of &quot;healthy, lean individuals.&quot; <strong>Here is where sentence structure tricks most people</strong> Notice how now we are comparing &quot;lower liver fat content,&quot; &quot;lower intima media thickness of the carotid artery&quot; by the &quot;majority of metabolically unhealthy obese patients. Only insulin sensitivity is compared against actual healthy people. The others are compared against known unhealthy people. Of course the &quot;healthier obese people&quot; are &quot;healthier&quot; than the &quot;metabolically unhealthy obese people.&quot;</p>

<p>So your claim that obese people can be healthy boils down to, obese people can approach the same insulin sensitivity as healthy, lean individuals. &quot;Baby I&#39;m amazed&quot; you think that is some sort of proof of health...</p>

<p>Obesity is not healthy, it is dangerous. But you&#39;re fighting a PR battle, as I have always said. So it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; because you&#39;ve got to find a new audience to <del>lie to</del> inform.</p>
