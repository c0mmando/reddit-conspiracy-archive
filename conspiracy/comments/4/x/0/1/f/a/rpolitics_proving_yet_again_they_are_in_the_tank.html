       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       front page right now.  The majority of the posts are about Trumps statement about "2nd Amendment people".  Now remember when the DNC leaks came out and they created a megathread for the DNC leaks so the sub wouldnt be filled with a bunch of DNC leaks submissions?

       If youre an honest left leaning person and considering voting for Hillary you have to ask yourself why she has to lie, control and manipulate so much if she is good and if her ideas are good.  Why the censorship?  Why support a candidate that is so heavy handed and authoritarian?  Just think of how much worse it will be once she is elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont vote for her or Trump.  Vote for anyone else but the two actors the system says you have to vote for.

       About a month ago the pro-Trump shilling was deafening. Now the pro-Hillary shilling is deafening. I guess the "native advertising" companies got hired by different people at different times. Reddit is propaganda now, fewer and fewer actual organic comments, and more shilling and propaganda. Not even just political but pro-war pro-authority stuff in general too. Reddit is great for false consensus-building, making it look like tons of people agree unanimously when they do not at all in reality. Everything is so broken, it feels almost hard to keep an even keel at this point.

       Not a Trump guy either. The truly infuriating thing for me is that this slant is all over the airwaves as well. Hell, even the late night TV guys are making a point to talk about Trump as much as possible. There's nothing about HRC. Never. Unless they're talking about something positive for her. No mention of DNC members resigning, emails, or Clinton Foundation donations. It's like this shit (that she is accused of) only exists online and not out in the real world. A damn near blackout.

       To be fair on the Late Night guys, they make comedy, and Trump is comedic gold whereas Hillary is frankly boring from a comedic standpoint. The fact that people get political news from them is far more an indictment of our society then an indictment of them specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       As another anti-Trump guy though, I have to agree on all the other bits about the media coverage. I think what he said is absurd and dangerous but the establishment as a whole does things everyday which are far more absurd and dangerous that just fly under the radar.

       I agree that Trump is an easy target, I don't think the man can get out of bed without putting his foot in his mouth. My gripe is that the new bloods in late night TV aren't even trying to maintain the appearance of being neutral. Which is a pretty new thing as far as the broadcast stations are concerned. Those things, and the fact that people are far more persuadable when tired, makes me think this isn't an accident in the least.

       This was my biggest selling point to vote for trump. You have both DNC and RNC. All media outlets (Except OAN and RT) trashing trump 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see Trump as a guillotine from the French revolution. Everyone agrees the whole establishment is corrupt. Big pharma, government, the media are all up in arms terrified of Trump. Trying their damnest to convince us this guy is the next Hitler.

       I love how when people say stuff against Hillary they have to preface it with "I'm not pro-Trump, but..." because people are so polarized they literally think there's only 2 sides and if they don't say that people will assume.

       That's not how you take down Trump. You ignore people to take them down. Like they did Sanders and Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is controlled opposition. If they really hated him, they wouldn't talk about him. But instead it's 24/7 coverage. Any press is good press.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's yet more evidence a vote for Trump is NOT a vote against the status quo. He's just the prepackaged "rebel" option, for frustrated dumb voters.

       definitely ridiculous, but it's always nice when they openly show their colors. I mean, I'm anti-trump too, but this is supposed to be America. Freedom of speech! Open democracy with heated debates! Rhetoric and brimstone! This propaganda bullshit needs to go back to Lenin and Stalin and sit in the grave with them.

       That said, I'm just a drunkard watching from the bleachers. We need a Carlin Party, where we all just get together, get drunk, and point at all the evil people stealing our freedom.

       megathread for what comment? The khan comment? probably because it was just a mean statement. Not a batch of emails proving media collusion, DNC cheating Bernie, and evidence of perjury.

       One is massively illegal on ethics and civil grounds. The other no way compares.

       Hey! What would I do about it? I'd take a look at the users posting the material.... if they were NOTHING but anti Trump posts.... and their account history revealed non stop "correction of the record"...
      </p>
      <p>
       I would ban them. But hey that's just me right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some users on Reddit are here because they have many interests... some "users" do not. Some do absolutely nothing but derail legitimate conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yah, I'd look at those users very carefully... warn them... and ban them if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that solve anything? Not really. It wouldn't prevent the exact same users from registering new accounts and repeating their process. I realize this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it WOULD do however, is make it clear that this behaviour is unwanted.... but guess what? It's not unwanted... it's all going exactly to plan.

       I don't think it needs fixing unless you just remove the upvote/downvote system ... but that's an entirely different website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you seriously think anyone is going to upvote what Trump says?  Trump:  Lets Build a Wall along the border/Mocks a Disabled Journalist/Defiantly Rejects Calls to Release Tax Returns/Bombasts fallen soldier's family/Calls Obama and/or Hillary the MVP of ISIS/Gives Speech on Economic Reform that Benefits the Rich/Tax Cut for Nanny care for the rich ...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just not going to happen where reasonable, unbiased people congregate, so you get massive posts for the candidate that the mass crowd agrees with... Trump is the fringe and Hillary is the mass appeal.  You're going to see a massive amount of threads in her favor no matter what

       Hillary has no mass appeal friend. She really doesn't.

      <p>
       If you say so.... ok but.... she really doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       She needed Super PACs and election fraud, and corrupt superdelegates to take the primary. The DNC has never lost so many members... the seats at the convention were bloody empty.

       Trump just filled a 10,000 seat venue for his latest speech.

       I believe with everything you're saying, but I've had left leaning friends who completely support Hillary, and completely support this status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       They find it typical and probably even acceptable for a politician to use whatever means to win, even if it means being corrupt. So how are we supposed to change US politics if our own citizens don't see that there is a problem? I don't get it.

       What do you do with all those people that are, in fact, "educated, and are quite familiar with left-wing rhetoric - and STILL don't agree with you?

       You seem to have this presumption that left-wing ideas are automatically right, and anyone who doesn't agree just needs more "education."

       Hello, can anyone recommend good places on reddit for political news? apart from this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a Trump or anti-trump supporter, i used to browse
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       since it was briefly a good alternative to finding anti-clinton news considering the MSM is almost completely pro-hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now its been taking over by CTR.

       They're all a little different but it does kind suck they're low traffic. It's nice to actually interact with people. r/POLITIC is basically most in the spirit of r/politics in that you can say what you want (and bonus: no roving downvote armies). The other two are more serious places.

        If youre an honest left leaning person and considering voting for Hillary you have to ask yourself why she has to lie, control and manipulate so much if she is good and if her ideas are good. Why the censorship? Why support a candidate that is so heavy handed and authoritarian? Just think of how much worse it will be once she is elected.

       Not a Trump guy either. The truly infuriating thing for me is that this slant is all over the airwaves as well. Hell, even the late night TV guys are making a point to talk about Trump as much as possible. There's nothing about HRC. Never. Unless they're talking about something positive for her. No mention of DNC members resigning, emails, or Clinton Foundation donations. It's like this shit (that she is accused of) only exists online and not out in the real world. A damn near blackout.
