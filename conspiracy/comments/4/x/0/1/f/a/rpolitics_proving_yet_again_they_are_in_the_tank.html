The majority of the posts are about Trumps statement about &quot;2nd Amendment people&quot;.  Now remember when the DNC leaks came out and they created a megathread for the DNC leaks so the sub wouldnt be filled with a bunch of DNC leaks submissions?</p>

<p>If youre an honest left leaning person and considering voting for Hillary you have to ask yourself why she has to lie, control and manipulate so much if she is good and if her ideas are good.  Why the censorship?  Why support a candidate that is so heavy handed and authoritarian?  Just think of how much worse it will be once she is elected.</p>

<p>Dont vote for her or Trump.  Vote for anyone else but the two actors the system says you have to vote for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About a month ago the pro-Trump shilling was deafening. Now the pro-Hillary shilling is deafening. I guess the &quot;native advertising&quot; companies got hired by different people at different times. Reddit is propaganda now, fewer and fewer actual organic comments, and more shilling and propaganda. Not even just political but pro-war pro-authority stuff in general too. Reddit is great for false consensus-building, making it look like tons of people agree unanimously when they do not at all in reality. Everything is so broken, it feels almost hard to keep an even keel at this point.</p>

<p>Im not a Trump supporter but holy shit.   If people and the political parties are going this apeshit maybe he really does intend to rock the boat..</p>

<p>This is going to be the most openly corrupted and rigged election in history. Americas democracy is looking like a joke right now. These rich people, fighting and lying over power. Its fucking hillarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a Trump guy either. The truly infuriating thing for me is that this slant is all over the airwaves as well. Hell, even the late night TV guys are making a point to talk about Trump as much as possible. There&#39;s nothing about HRC. Never. Unless they&#39;re talking about something positive for her. No mention of DNC members resigning, emails, or Clinton Foundation donations. It&#39;s like this shit (that she is accused of) only exists online and not out in the real world. A damn near blackout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair on the Late Night guys, they make comedy, and Trump is comedic gold whereas Hillary is frankly boring from a comedic standpoint. The fact that people get political news from them is far more an indictment of our society then an indictment of them specifically. </p>

<p>As another anti-Trump guy though, I have to agree on all the other bits about the media coverage. I think what he said is absurd and dangerous but the establishment as a whole does things everyday which are far more absurd and dangerous that just fly under the radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Trump is an easy target, I don&#39;t think the man can get out of bed without putting his foot in his mouth. My gripe is that the new bloods in late night TV aren&#39;t even trying to maintain the appearance of being neutral. Which is a pretty new thing as far as the broadcast stations are concerned. Those things, and the fact that people are far more persuadable when tired, makes me think this isn&#39;t an accident in the least.</p>

<p>This was my biggest selling point to vote for trump. You have both DNC and RNC. All media outlets (Except OAN and RT) trashing trump 24/7.</p>

<p>I see Trump as a guillotine from the French revolution. Everyone agrees the whole establishment is corrupt. Big pharma, government, the media are all up in arms terrified of Trump. Trying their damnest to convince us this guy is the next Hitler.</p>

<p>Its the oligarchy. They cannont to have a rogue billionaire standing up for nationalist values and fighting to keep guns in the hands of the people.</p>

<p>Trump is controlled opposition. If they really hated him, they wouldn&#39;t talk about him. But instead it&#39;s 24/7 coverage. Any press is good press. </p>

<p>That&#39;s yet more evidence a vote for Trump is NOT a vote against the status quo. He&#39;s just the prepackaged &quot;rebel&quot; option, for frustrated dumb voters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>megathread for what comment? The khan comment? probably because it was just a mean statement. Not a batch of emails proving media collusion, DNC cheating Bernie, and evidence of perjury. </p>

<p>One is massively illegal on ethics and civil grounds. The other no way compares. </p>

<p>Or are you saying having the megathread to compile all the articles about his one off colored statement?</p>

<p>Some users on Reddit are here because they have many interests... some &quot;users&quot; do not. Some do absolutely nothing but derail legitimate conversation.</p>

<p>Yah, I&#39;d look at those users very carefully... warn them... and ban them if needed.</p>

<p>Would that solve anything? Not really. It wouldn&#39;t prevent the exact same users from registering new accounts and repeating their process. I realize this.</p>

<p>What it WOULD do however, is make it clear that this behaviour is unwanted.... but guess what? It&#39;s not unwanted... it&#39;s all going exactly to plan.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just not going to happen where reasonable, unbiased people congregate, so you get massive posts for the candidate that the mass crowd agrees with... Trump is the fringe and Hillary is the mass appeal.  You&#39;re going to see a massive amount of threads in her favor no matter what</p>

<p>What do you do with all those people that are, in fact, &quot;educated, and are quite familiar with left-wing rhetoric - and STILL don&#39;t agree with you?</p>

<p>You seem to have this presumption that left-wing ideas are automatically right, and anyone who doesn&#39;t agree just needs more &quot;education.&quot;</p>
