        The hack of an NSA malware staging server is not unprecedented, but the publication of the take is. Here's what you need to know: (1/x)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765513776372342784">
        1) NSA traces and targets malware C2 servers in a practice called Counter Computer Network Exploitation, or CCNE. So do our rivals.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765513915094667265">
        2) NSA is often lurking undetected for years on the C2 and ORBs (proxy hops) of state hackers. This is how we follow their operations.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514087044374529">
        3) This is how we steal their rivals' hacking tools and reverse-engineer them to create "fingerprints" to help us detect them in the future.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514215562043392">
        4) Here's where it gets interesting: the NSA is not made of magic. Our rivals do the same thing to us -- and occasionally succeed.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514347196084224">
        5) Knowing this, NSA's hackers (TAO) are told not to leave their hack tools ("binaries") on the server after an op. But people get lazy.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514477341143040">
        6) What's new? NSA malware staging servers getting hacked by a rival is not new. A rival publicly demonstrating they have done so is.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514740747669505">
        7) Why did they do it? No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765514891813945344">
        8) Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility. Here's why that is significant:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765515087062982656">
        9) This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765515289719148544">
        10) That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765515485706330113">
        11) Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765515619584311296">
        12) Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765515884647636992">
        13) TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765516071696760832">
        Bonus: When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution - it's cheap and easy. So? So...
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765516183709814784">
        The undetected hacker squatting on this NSA server lost access in June 2013. Rare public data point on the positive results of the leak.

       I too am a programmer that understands a decent amount about encryption. When guys start talking like this, it makes me very suspicious of their actual knowledge. I work with brainiacs all the time that could talk you in a circle but then you look at their code and it's shit.

       How do you know he even is who he says he is? How do you know it's not some crazy sci-op? Think about it; he exposes all these violations of privacy and the constitutional, the public hardly batts an eye. It's the perfect way to roll out these programs to the public. I'm not saying I am 100% convinced it's a government sci-op but it's really starting to look that way.

       I don't understand.  I'm really trying to grasp all of this.  Is it really that (Globalists/Elite) just want everything to be imbalanced as to profit from it?  It seems as though at some point they will be found out also.  When their actions are front and center and cannot be ignored they will lose everything.  Right?

       I know it sounds crazy but the diety they worship take human sacrifice as gifts to himself. So these people are doing this to please their god. Yes, the gov has been completed hijacked by these people, there are no checks and balances and everything you see on TV is a show to keep people placated.

       I think
       <em>
        the reality of another war with the very possible chance of nuclear attacks being exchanged, as a reason to develop a world government and central bank
       </em>
       , is more in tune to reason.

      <p>
       Though their means for such an end can be classified as evil and even satanic, I think such labeling is irrelevant and even harmful for any kind of retaliation as a citizenry.

       I made no assumption.
I just said the possibility of a nuclear attack.
That's an obvious thing to take into account betweem 2 nuclear powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as child sacrifices go, that's a rabbit hole I'm not yet ready to go down.

       Interesting, but unfortunately as someone who has followed this kind of thing for years it's too easy for people to blow off as a joke. No one will care, but to those of us paying attention it's just one more indication of what might actually be going on.

       No way we go to war with Russia, especially not over something like this. US-Russia relations have been far more tense in the past and nothing came of it. Truth is neither party wants such a thing. However, Russia would love the chance to embarrass us on the global stage.

       Most likely a ratchetting up of anti-Russian rhetoric - but mostly to create noise and to deflect the US public from scrutinising this too closely.

       Lets hope that's as far as it goes.

       The real concern is people like George Soros, and his underling Shillary Killton who are engineering this thing from the top to the bottom.

       i only want to chime in because i found a few comments saying they didn't understand what any of this meant, so i will try to summarize and/or explain as best i can,the beginning of this is fact, based on what he says and how cyberwarfare works, but the rest is speculation and i will make note of where that starts
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1)N$@ is/has a rogue group of state sponsored cyber terrorists called "Equation Group"
       </li>
       <li>
        2)they are behind many BIG hacks
       </li>
       <li>
        3)they don't hack directly from Ft Meade or anything like that, because if they did, anyone getting targeted that had similar cyber warfare abilities would find the originating IP or MAC or any sort of "digital fingerprint" and basically call out the N$@ for violating a few treaties and such by acting as a state sponsored cyber terrorist faction
       </li>
       <li>
        4)they hack from "staging" servers which is basically a "owned/pwned/RATed" terminal/server/device (basically they could be renting a server in Iran and paying in bitcoin and using that to hack so as to not get caught/traced
       </li>
       <li>
        5)the hackers that released this info, sniffed the N$@'s data based, and then took over one of the "staging" servers (speculation: i believe they did this by GIVING IN to a Tor hack just to sniff out the networks the N$@ uses often to pwn people)
       </li>
       <li>
        6)they made copies of the tools and as snowden said, even binaries, so basically it's "evidence" at this point seeing as how there are no ways for N$@ to wipe the prints off of their work since it's already been copied and released/taken over
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -------SPECULATION FROM HERE ON OUT-------
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        7)i personally believe the DNC hack was from a US involved entity with massive cyber resources, which only brings 1 to mind N$@, "why?" because they stand to gain the most, and also know about almost every vulnerability,0-day,exploit and if not they'll intercept your cisco switch and plant bugs in it before it gets to you, another "why?" because they believe they can do all of this without leaving traces and since in this case it is "partially" correct because as many security experts have noted, the DNC servers are not being hacked for the first time, it's been an ongoing thing, that being said, if smaller groups can hack into it, it should be a walk in the park for N$@
       </li>
       <li>
        8)Shillary's camp is throwing the fault at the russians but the funny part is..the russians DID hack it..yes..but they weren't the FIRST
       </li>
       <li>
        9)snowden himself is saying evidence points to russia about leaking the malware staging server info, and he also mentions "escalation", i believe this part to be true because russia is basically wanting to show the world how rigged the us elections are, and he's not doing it by focusing JUST on the elections, see last point
       </li>
       <li>
        10)russia is showing the US they are willing to blow the top open on the malware server which is bigger than the elections because it will show state sponsored cyber terrorism coming directly from a "government agency" of the US and how it's basically been targetting, EVERYONE, not just countries, corporations overseas, everyone...everything...that's bigger than just rigging elections, this also includes Stuxnet, Reign, basically anything ever tied to EQ or N$@
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       i wish you all best of luck in the future months ahead, if anyone has any more questions i will explain to the best of MY ability

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bonus is that Snowden may have inadvertently prevented future exposure, as the servers were relocated to be protected from him, but simultaneously stopped this exposure as well, in June 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rest is about the potential damage. Snowden is alluding to the possibility that the CIA (et al) has been using the tools we use to subvert foreign governments against Americans, against allies, or hacked foreign governments and issued fake attack commands from their computers as signs of aggression.
       </p>
       <p>
        99% of the public believe the government the highest chain of command, as in the US President. However, if the CIA is able to subvert American elections, then they are ranked higher than the President. Likewise, if they are able to attack allies, in violation of international treaties, then they are higher than the nation, as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, Snowden is warning that if the retribution against the DNC Leakers continue, the 'retaliatory source' may try to break the disillusion of the nation state, the idea that nations are ruled from within, rather than without. That populations are divided, that terrorism is an attack of aggression, that a nation rules a population, so on, and so on; that the public elects leadership, not management.
