<p>would things change? would the public at large change their minds about how police operate? would the BLM movement change anything about their way of thinking? would there be rampant crime and disaster?</p>

<p>i&#39;m not trying to provoke argument, but this thought occurred to me today during a discussion with some very anti-police folks on facebook. i&#39;m sure some people will have very strong feelings on this so keep it civil please and thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be a perfect time for the gov to implement federal police officers. I mean they practically already want to, so if the police were to strike, that would just be a perfect excuse to put federal officers in there place, without the hassel of trying to come up with a way to put them there. </p>

<p>Or the UN would step in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traffic violations would decrease. That&#39;s about it.   It&#39;s not like police are out stopping crime every day.   They write tickets to collect revenue.   When they get called for an actual crime, either they don&#39;t show up or they show up 2 hours later.   Why? Theres no money coming in to the department by stopping or preventing crime.   Money comes in through writing tickets to taxpayers.   </p>

<p>For that reason, nothing would change if cops went on strike. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chaos would reign as people take advantage of the lack of police.  I would expect a lot of looting and property damage and a lot of violence as people try to protect their homes and properties.</p>

<p>Cities would be calling in reserve police, temporary officers and Governors would activate the National Guard if only to work major highways.  </p>

<p>It would be a disaster, that&#39;s for sure, but I don&#39;t think every police force would participate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about the aliens in xenos, surely they would attack too. </p>

<p>Then we have the north koreans. Once the police stop killing unarmed civilians they would see us as weak, you know what happens next. </p>

<p>Now let‘s talk about those expired parking meters, they may look innocent until you remember the movie men in black, they are really very nefarious, trust me, the police force spends numerous amounts of resources controlling that threat. </p>

<p>If i were you, which by the way, i am ecstatic that i am not; but if i were you, i would buy the biggest tank on the planet and move all of my friends and family inside of it. Yes, it may sound weird but you have shown me that the boogey man is very real and he is out to get you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>meh, my premise implies that cops are human beings, which they are. i know if i were a cop right now, i&#39;d be pretty sketched out about doing my job. i know a lot of people on here are pretty anti-cop (which i don&#39;t understand, but whatever), but i&#39;m kinda in the middle of the road; i don&#39;t &#39;dislike&#39; cops, but i definitely don&#39;t like the mass anti-cop sentiments permeating the internet lately. i&#39;ve known some dickhead cops, i know some decent cops. </p>

<p>to say it would &#39;never happen&#39; is naive and short sighted, in my opinion, which is worth nothing, so i give it freely. i feel like everyone has disdain for the cops because they&#39;re portrayed so negatively by a biased media. they&#39;ve also most likely never needed one, so if they suddenly went away...i&#39;m sure most people would see just how much they&#39;re needed to keep the peace in the world at large. that&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on ride-alongs and seen for myself what the police are like.  I&#39;m not sure this is really done any longer, but prior to 9/11 it was your right, as a citizen, as long as you&#39;ve never committed a felony.  It&#39;s quite an eye opener to be with real police, doing what they do.</p>

<p>It is naive to say that the entire police force nation wide would all go on strike.  These are supposed patriots who all need a paycheck, so sorry, have to call you out on that.  The police are there to protect businesses and property, first and foremost.</p>
