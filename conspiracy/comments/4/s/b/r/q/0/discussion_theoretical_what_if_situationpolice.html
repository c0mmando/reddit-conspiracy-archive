       i know it would probably never happen, but what, in your opinion, happens if it did?
      </p>
      <p>
       would things change? would the public at large change their minds about how police operate? would the BLM movement change anything about their way of thinking? would there be rampant crime and disaster?
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm not trying to provoke argument, but this thought occurred to me today during a discussion with some very anti-police folks on facebook. i'm sure some people will have very strong feelings on this so keep it civil please and thanks.

       The blacks will get what they have always wanted.. to be able to commit crime without having to worry about getting shot when they try to kill an honest policeman doing his job. America would go up in flames, stores would be looted, our women will be raped. USA police are the only thing keeping these people from being able to expose their true nature.

       I think it would be a perfect time for the gov to implement federal police officers. I mean they practically already want to, so if the police were to strike, that would just be a perfect excuse to put federal officers in there place, without the hassel of trying to come up with a way to put them there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the UN would step in.

       Either way I think it would be a bad outcome.

       Traffic violations would decrease. That's about it.   It's not like police are out stopping crime every day.   They write tickets to collect revenue.   When they get called for an actual crime, either they don't show up or they show up 2 hours later.   Why? Theres no money coming in to the department by stopping or preventing crime.   Money comes in through writing tickets to taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that reason, nothing would change if cops went on strike.

       Chaos would reign as people take advantage of the lack of police.  I would expect a lot of looting and property damage and a lot of violence as people try to protect their homes and properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cities would be calling in reserve police, temporary officers and Governors would activate the National Guard if only to work major highways.
      </p>

       It would be a disaster, that's for sure, but I don't think every police force would participate.

       i agree on your last point. but IF it did happen, even in a few major cities, i think all those martial law posts would definitely make a lot more sense.

       it's crazy that public safety is solely in the police's collective hands; without them, it's chaos.

       But what about the aliens in xenos, surely they would attack too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have the north koreans. Once the police stop killing unarmed civilians they would see us as weak, you know what happens next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let‘s talk about those expired parking meters, they may look innocent until you remember the movie men in black, they are really very nefarious, trust me, the police force spends numerous amounts of resources controlling that threat.

       That would never happen.  Your premise implies the police work for the people.  The police work for the corporate state, the oligarchy.

       meh, my premise implies that cops are human beings, which they are. i know if i were a cop right now, i'd be pretty sketched out about doing my job. i know a lot of people on here are pretty anti-cop (which i don't understand, but whatever), but i'm kinda in the middle of the road; i don't 'dislike' cops, but i definitely don't like the mass anti-cop sentiments permeating the internet lately. i've known some dickhead cops, i know some decent cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       to say it would 'never happen' is naive and short sighted, in my opinion, which is worth nothing, so i give it freely. i feel like everyone has disdain for the cops because they're portrayed so negatively by a biased media. they've also most likely never needed one, so if they suddenly went away...i'm sure most people would see just how much they're needed to keep the peace in the world at large. that's all.

       I've been on ride-alongs and seen for myself what the police are like.  I'm not sure this is really done any longer, but prior to 9/11 it was your right, as a citizen, as long as you've never committed a felony.  It's quite an eye opener to be with real police, doing what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is naive to say that the entire police force nation wide would all go on strike.  These are supposed patriots who all need a paycheck, so sorry, have to call you out on that.  The police are there to protect businesses and property, first and foremost.

       you can't 'call someone out' on having an opinion, dummy. though i can see you have serious power or control issues. sorry to hear that.

       and i used to work in juvenille law enforcement/corrections. had plenty of interactions on a professional level with much law enforcement. i'm sure you've had plenty of 'ride alongs' in your head.

       Why would I lie?  I'm not.  You asked for a discussion here, and so I gave my opinion.  Now you seem upset and a little irrational.  Have a nice day.

       Whatever dude.  What I'm saying is, since the corporate state is who the police really protect, there is unlimited money to throw at the police.

        Yes, you are naive to think the police would ever stage a coordinated walk out

       , especially when they think they are captain america and get lots of overtime.  You asked for discussion here, and when someone doesn't stroke your ego, you get strangely defensive and childish.  I think I smell pork.

       i think i smell a SJW. for someone who's 'been on ride-alongs' you're showing a lot of cop hate. i don't love them or hate them, i just think it's dangerous when we have so many people like you around, who are probably white and privileged and would call 911 the SECOND you were in danger, though you seem pretty happy to show your rhetoric here. seems to me you're part of the problem, kid.
