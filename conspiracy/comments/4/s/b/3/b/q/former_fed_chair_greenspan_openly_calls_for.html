<p>Now if we went back on the gold standard and we adhered to the actual structure of the gold standard as it exists let’s say, prior to 1913, we’d be fine. Remember that the period 1870 to 1913 was one of the most aggressive periods economically that we’ve had in the U.S., and that was a golden period of the gold standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As many of you know, the Federal Reserve Act was enacted in 1913. And he&#39;s clearly saying that everything went wrong that same year..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, if you go back and read a lot of Greenspan writings before he was Fed chairman, he&#39;s very free market and fond of the Austrian tradition. After he became chairman, his actions and attitude towards the market did an about-face. Now, having been out of the Fed for years and on his way out health wise, he&#39;s back to being pro market. I wonder what the change was</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because like most positions of &quot;public&quot; power, the Federal Reserve Chairman is a puppet.  Alan Greenspan was most likely told what to do.  </p>

<p>Do you really think Janet Yellen is smart enough to steer the entire global economy to normalized interest rates?  I think like the President of the United States, the Fed Chair is a puppet, and has no real power, and is steered by the true powers behind the scene.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know that the Federal Reserve Act was not the first of its kind in this country, right? It had been passed multiple times under different names prior to that. Each time it was fought furiously and struck down by the signers of our Constitution, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, William Mckinley (his assassination paved the way for the Fed Res Act),  James Garfield, and JFK. All either had an assassination attempt on them or were assassinated. You should also look up Louis T. McFadden. He was one of the most adamant fighters against the Federal Reserve Act after it passed and had THREE assassination attempts on him, the third finally killing him. Hell, even a Czar in freaking Russia was assassinated after both him and Lincoln came out against central banking. A simple google search and some extensive research will open you up to a lot of what has been hidden in our histories. Even freaking Bonaparte was targeted by England after deciding he was done paying interest on top of what he was borrowing lol. That dude is NOT the first to come to the public about their crimes..</p>
