       Pokemon Go has completely taken over. People are exercising, yes, but they are also justâ€¦ completely distracted. Going wherever this app tells them too. Anyone else feel like it might be an experiment, or has this subreddit gone to my head?

       Exactly. I spun this to my husband and he replied "Why do I care if someone knows where I am?"

       Well,...
Anonymous released a video a couple of days ago saying that the government would eventually break us into three groups. (Call me crazy, fine.) Turns out that when you play this game, you have to first choice a group, 1 of 3 colors, Red, Blue, or Yellow. 
All these millions, hundreds of millions of people joining groups based psychological preference on primary colors, giving their locations and personal information away, history, bank card numbers...
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's all okay. Like, no one else seems to think this is strange, brainwashing behavior.

       Firstly, I have no doubts that the data gleaned from this "game" will be sold or given to 3rd parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, you could possibly group the people playing into social circles... I.e. everyone who is "middle class" generally hangs around with other middle class people. So chances are they will all pick the same colour around that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g.
       <br/>
       "People who live in the suburbs in the south west of so-and-so state/city/town area all red - so we know they are middleclass."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you could end up with fairly accurate polls of what income is where in what area and how big the groups are. As well as grouping by other things as well, like race, gangs, age ranges as well as phone models and a bunch of others. Excellent information for (tinfoil time) culling and controlling the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting point OP brings up.

       The government is not going to ask Pokemon to help them track you. If they were going to track your every move, they would be able to do so without the help of a children's mobile game.

       I don't think it's about tracking movements, it's more of a psychological experiment. People are so wrapped up in this game, it's everywhere. It's mind control, of the worst kind. Think about it.

       People are wrapped up in it because it's a cool way to play Pokemon. It's Pokemon, brought to the real world! There's no "mind control", people just like playing VR games on their phones.

       Exactly this. I've been playing the game frequently upon release. I am no less involved in this community as I was before it's release and I am no less involved in any current events happening in America since release. I will admit I have been using this game as a distraction for a few hours a day because the past few days have been filled with awful news.

       It isnt mind control to simply put out a game that humans enjoy. We are still animals that evolved a desire to experience pleasure. Is every pleasure seeking behavior now just a form of mind control.

       Sounds like an intelligence wet dream to have people walking around taking pictures wherever they spawn these things. Sure, a smart phone is already capable, but this gives incentive to take it out and aim the camera at random objects/rooms/buildings/etc.

       We've been saying forever how the cameras can be activated whenever, but now this encourages people to aim them at obscure shit all over the place rather than keeping the phone in their pockets unless they need it.

       I was a bit surprised to find out how many people I work with are into this shit, it is really weird.  I remember when I was about 11 (mid 90s) hanging out with a two new friends that were on my baseball team for the first time outside of baseball practice.  I went to one of their house and one of them had pokemon cards, the other kid saw that and freaked out and called his mom and MADE her bring his pokemon cards over.  I lost all respect for both of them at that exact moment, never hung out with them outside of practice again.  I was ~11 and thought we were too old for that shit and was embarrassed for them.  Now I am ~30 and find out that people STILL haven't gotten too old for that shit.  Forget any conspiracies, why are adults downloading and playing with something called pokemon?  All I can think of is that South Park episode from way back: Chinpokomon haha.

       It is kinda of crazy and weird but it's a new style of games coming out called augmented reality, so it is sort of a test to see how these games are perceived  by the public. Whereas virtual reality you were have a screen in front of your face.

       I think the subreddit has gotten to your head. Its like if we can never acknowledge that there is a separate force than that of government or population. Private interprise has a constant will and pull to make profit. Un politically motivated, un opinionated un biased profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A company simply wants to create a game that will make an astounding amount of profit, pushed by it's self advertising qualities. People love to post about the game because of this unique feature, and this unique feature makes people curious to try it. Nothing more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now is the government paying attention to the results, or maybe being inspired by this... maybe, I don't think this is too far fetched to believe. But I don't believe they are pulling as many strings as people seem to believe!

       because one involves a joint coordination and massive cover up to hide evidence of conspiracy and the other one is the obvious function of a capitalist system. It could be both, but it's only in this forum that reality seems to always be the most far fetched scenario instead of the most obvious one. I'm all for stepping out of common thinking and not accepting what we are told, but sometimes the claims are so bold yet the evidence is.... only an idea! extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence!

       Well I said personally I find it stupid, and I did not say playing Pokemon makes you a child nor did I say adults are not allowed to seek pleasure. Don't try to put words in my mouth please.

       Of course, adults should be free to do as they will no matter how stupid I personally find their recreation (and conversely, I'll do what I like no matter what others think).
