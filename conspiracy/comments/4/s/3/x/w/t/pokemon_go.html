<p>Pokemon Go has completely taken over. People are exercising, yes, but they are also justâ€¦ completely distracted. Going wherever this app tells them too. Anyone else feel like it might be an experiment, or has this subreddit gone to my head?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I spun this to my husband and he replied &quot;Why do I care if someone knows where I am?&quot; </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Well,...
Anonymous released a video a couple of days ago saying that the government would eventually break us into three groups. (Call me crazy, fine.) Turns out that when you play this game, you have to first choice a group, 1 of 3 colors, Red, Blue, or Yellow. 
All these millions, hundreds of millions of people joining groups based psychological preference on primary colors, giving their locations and personal information away, history, bank card numbers... </p>

<p>And it&#39;s all okay. Like, no one else seems to think this is strange, brainwashing behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I have no doubts that the data gleaned from this &quot;game&quot; will be sold or given to 3rd parties.     </p>

<p>Secondly, you could possibly group the people playing into social circles... I.e. everyone who is &quot;middle class&quot; generally hangs around with other middle class people. So chances are they will all pick the same colour around that area.          </p>

<p>e.g.<br/>
&quot;People who live in the suburbs in the south west of so-and-so state/city/town area all red - so we know they are middleclass.&quot;</p>

<p>So, you could end up with fairly accurate polls of what income is where in what area and how big the groups are. As well as grouping by other things as well, like race, gangs, age ranges as well as phone models and a bunch of others. Excellent information for (tinfoil time) culling and controlling the general public.      </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting point OP brings up.</p>

<p>Sounds like an intelligence wet dream to have people walking around taking pictures wherever they spawn these things. Sure, a smart phone is already capable, but this gives incentive to take it out and aim the camera at random objects/rooms/buildings/etc.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been saying forever how the cameras can be activated whenever, but now this encourages people to aim them at obscure shit all over the place rather than keeping the phone in their pockets unless they need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a bit surprised to find out how many people I work with are into this shit, it is really weird.  I remember when I was about 11 (mid 90s) hanging out with a two new friends that were on my baseball team for the first time outside of baseball practice.  I went to one of their house and one of them had pokemon cards, the other kid saw that and freaked out and called his mom and MADE her bring his pokemon cards over.  I lost all respect for both of them at that exact moment, never hung out with them outside of practice again.  I was ~11 and thought we were too old for that shit and was embarrassed for them.  Now I am ~30 and find out that people STILL haven&#39;t gotten too old for that shit.  Forget any conspiracies, why are adults downloading and playing with something called pokemon?  All I can think of is that South Park episode from way back: Chinpokomon haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because one involves a joint coordination and massive cover up to hide evidence of conspiracy and the other one is the obvious function of a capitalist system. It could be both, but it&#39;s only in this forum that reality seems to always be the most far fetched scenario instead of the most obvious one.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s stupid af, personally. I know grown bloody men, with children even, who won&#39;t stfu about it.</p>

<p>As for it being used for spying, I doubt they are harvesting/selling your data any more or less than is average (which is far too much, but that&#39;s not the point).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I said personally I find it stupid, and I did not say playing Pokemon makes you a child nor did I say adults are not allowed to seek pleasure. Don&#39;t try to put words in my mouth please.</p>

<p>Of course, adults should be free to do as they will no matter how stupid I personally find their recreation (and conversely, I&#39;ll do what I like no matter what others think).</p>

<p>I merely stated my opinion, and clearly stated that it was only my opinion. For the record, I also think baseball, football, soccer etc are stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would concur that those sports are stupid. The point was though that you worded it in such a way as to suggest that people who play videogames are just children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all, that wasn&#39;t my intention and I honestly don&#39;t see how I could be read to have implied that I think playing games makes an adult childish. </p>

<p>That said, most if not all the man-children I know are big video-gamers.</p>
