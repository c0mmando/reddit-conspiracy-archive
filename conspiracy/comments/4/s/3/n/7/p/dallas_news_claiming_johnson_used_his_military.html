      <p>
       First off, before I started writing this, I checked the Dallas news for any updates. There are no updates on his investigation. Nor is there any mention of Johnson's investigation anywhere on their INVESTIGATIONS page.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just my thoughts, I'm just looking for the actual truth. First time poster, long time lurker, but I would love to hear everyone's thoughts. Let me know if I've made oversights, I would 100% love to be proven wrong.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, at the bottom of the article you can see 11 staff writers are listed. That is 11 people contributing to this story. All of them sitting in a room, or having discussions over the phone with each other about EXACTLY HOW TO WORD THIS STORY. Make no mistake, journalists choose their words extremely carefully. Every sentence is crafted to make you think a certain way.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Maybe it was the run-in with police in Richardson a year ago, after someone reported that he looked suspicious sitting in a parked Chevy Tahoe at a strip mall."
:: immediately makes you think of Johnson as a criminal. First sentence is about his relationship with police. In a later paragraph when they actually explain this situation, you will see it isn't as dramatic as it is being played up here.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Maybe it was his encounter with a famous black-power activist this spring. Or his attendance at a film festival focused on Malcolm X, the charismatic black leader assassinated in 1965."
:: boom. Race. First sentence is about police. Second about race. Also throwing in buzz words, ASSASSINATION. BLACK LEADER. You can see how an image of Johnson is already being painted in your mind.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The truth is that we may never know when or why the slow burn that was Micah X. Johnson's life ignited into a plot to murder white police officers. That plot ended overnight Thursday with the shooting deaths of five Dallas officers, followed by Johnson's being killed in a downtown parking garage by a police robot bearing a bomb."
:: The truth is, we may never know. I guarantee you we will never know. Again, look at the phrases used. SLOW BURN. IGNITED. PLOT. MURDER. WHITE. Also not once mentioning the woman that was shot while shielding her children, or the other officers that were injured. More about the police using a robot bomb (wut?) later.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Forced out of the Army, Johnson used the skills he'd honed there to unleash bullets on the uniformed police officers with deadly precision."
:: UNLEASH. BULLETS. DEADLY PRECISION. HONED. Later on, the article will explain that Johnson was in the Army Reserve and was a member of the 420th engineering brigade. They do a lot of deadly close-quarter combat similar to those that we saw in the video that went viral, yeah? Then it will explain that he was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013 and was released from the military (unknown reasons) after 12 months of service. Anyone else seeing a hole or two in the story here? Let's keep going.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Friends and acquaintances described the 25-year-old as a nice guy who in recent years cared for a younger brother. But they also say he had an obsession with heavy-duty weaponry and an interest in the military that dates at least to his senior year in high school."
:: A nice guy, with a younger brother that he cared for, with an OBSESSION with HEAVY-DUTY WEAPONRY. And an interest in the military in high school. It's a stretch, but plausible.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "And as he told Dallas officers before negotiations failed, he was enraged by the police shootings of black men elsewhere in the country -- the same deaths that had brought a diverse crowd into the streets of Dallas for what began as a peaceful protest."
:: Wait a minute, he TOLD officers before 'negotiations failed' and they had to use a bomb to blow him up, that he was ENRAGED by the POLICE SHOOTINGS of BLACK MEN elsewhere. Just trying to read between the lines.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Johnson "was always very affected by the police stuff and had very strong feelings about being black," said Caitlyn Lennon, 27, a friend who worked with him at a sandwich shop years ago."I can only imagine how pissed off he would be in the past year, watching all of the shootings."
:: again; POLICE. BLACK. I can only imagine how pissed off he would be, said a "friend" who may have known him years ago while he was working at a sandwich shop. I'll say it again, someone was sitting behind a computer and CHOSE that word 'friend'. This makes us believe that this is someone that knew him well. When in reality, you will read all of these witness accounts as flimsy. Also, of course Johnson was affected by police 'stuff' as they so nicely put it. And of COURSE he had strong feelings about being black. He was black. Jesus.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Just fragments of Johnson's life have become public, and it is too soon to get a clear picture. Family members in Garland and Mesquite declined to talk to reporters. In Facebook posts that have since been deleted, Johnson's sister Nicole wrote, "The news will say what they think, but those that knew him know this wasn't like him."
:: It is too soon to get a clear picture, but here is everything you should believe. Family members declined to talk to reporters. Interesting. It also looks like Johnson's sister deleted her posts pretty much after telling us that this was out of character for her brother. This should get your brain turning. A post saying THIS WASN'T LIKE HIM was deleted shortly afterwards and the family will not talk to reporters.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The police investigation remains in its early stages. But officials said Friday that a search of his home in Mesquite had turned up "bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics." They said he was described as a loner."
:: I literally laughed when I read this. How convenient that everything the police need is right there exactly when they need it, BOMB MAKING MATERIALS. BALLISTIC VESTS. RIFLES (they won't say which kind) and a personal fucking journal of combat tactics. Come on, you really expect me to believe that shooter that outflanked that officer learned how to do that from his personal fucking journal? Maybe it was his 12-months in crazy crazy Afghanistan where every single soldier is exposed to intense firefights on a daily basis. Maybe it was all the CQDT training that he took while in the army reserve. Hell, maybe he learned it from the fucking sandwich shop he was working at. Look at the video. That is a trained, seasoned gunman. With a LOT of experience in close-quarter combat. And now that that video is out, they need an explanation. Here you go, anyone sitting on their couch, hearing this on the news or radio is completely onboard. Plus, he was a loner... But that's just how police described his apartment, not what was actually said by friends and family. A lone gunman, apartment stocked with an orgy of evidence. Sound familiar to anyone else?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Johnson told police he had been training for the deadly ambush; one neighboring family said Friday that he had been performing what looked like military training exercises in his yard."
:: ah, here we are again, while the cops were in a firefight with a seasoned, combat journal reading black man who was obsessed with artillery, he somehow let it slip that he had been TRAINING for this DEADLY AMBUSH. Even though the protest was spontaneous. And how convenient that he was doing his police-murder workout in the yard for everyone to see. I'm sure the 'neighboring family' has seen a lot of military training exercises. It's a good thing he told police that he had been training, otherwise the lone gunman story would seem a bit far-fetched, no?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Johnson's mother, Delphene, got divorced in 1996, when he was 4. She lives in Mesquite and has worked at a church in DeSoto, according to public records. Her ex-husband lives in Garland."
:: They had to let us know that his mother was divorced. When he was four. So what? That would make him murderous? Again, painting an image of a disturbed young black man.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Johnson graduated in 2009 from John Horn High School in Mesquite, where he participated in JROTC, the high school officer training program, according to the school district. Family photographs on Facebook show him posing in a red mortarboard."
:: Don't be fooled, the JROTC will not teach you to firefight like that. This is still trying to convince us that Johnson was some military nut that went crazy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "He joined the Army Reserve the same year he completed high school, serving with the 420th engineering brigade. His jobs included a stint at Jimmy John's in Richardson. Chris Jennings, who owns the sandwich shop, said in an email that Johnson went to work there in 2011 and "departed of his own accord in 2012."
:: I touched on this earlier. Engineering brigade, Army Reserve. Then after the reserve, he went to work at a Jimmy Johns sandwich shop. Then he quit in 2012.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The following year, he was deployed to Afghanistan for 12 months. Several soldiers who served with him told The Dallas Morning News that they had been ordered not to discuss him."
:: ok, so after becoming Jason Bourne in Afghanistan for one year, this guy was released from the military (the article will never explain why). And then 'several soldiers' who served with him were ORDERED NOT TO DISCUSS HIM. Red light.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "One family friend said Johnson had changed when he returned from overseas. 
"He was withdrawn, didn't want to talk to people anymore, didn't believe in God anymore," said Myrtle Booker, 62, who knew his mother through church.
His interest in guns had grown, she said.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "But all that hating white people -- no, we didn't know any of that."
      </p>
      <p>
       :: Before I go any further, PTSD is a real thing. And I know a lot of military veterans that have it. This is a church friend of his mom's. Do any of your mom's church friends know you as well as Myrtle Booker claims to know Johnson? Keep in mind this is also Dallas, throwing that bit about god in there was perfect. And at the very end, yet another person saying that they had NO KNOWLEDGE of any racism, or extremist thoughts towards WHITE PEOPLE.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Police responding to a burglary at his home in August 2014 reported two guns stolen. Jim Otwell, who lives nearby, said Johnson told him about the missing firearms.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "He seemed like a really mellow, laid-back guy," Otwell said. "I swear to God, I don't think I've ever seen him again."
      </p>
      <p>
       :: remember that bit at the beginning? 'Maybe it was the run-in with police a year ago?' At the start, the writers will have you believe that Johnson had trouble with the police, but in this part, it seems Johnson had police help in reporting two of his firearms stolen from his home. No police craziness here, just a normal day. You would think someone that had plans to murder police officers in cold blood would be a bit more resilient to police presence. ESPECIALLY cautious when having police into your home and inquiring about the weapons you own. But no mention of that, nothing to see here citizen, move along. Also, another account of Johnson not fitting the description the media is trying to fit him with.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Starting in early 2015, Johnson was an employee at Touch of Kindness, a social service agency that serves children and adults with intellectual disabilities, said Jeppi Carnegie, who owns the business with his mother. Through the job, Johnson cared for his younger brother at home.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "He never talked about anger at all -- he was a normal guy,"Carnegie said. But as a black man, he added, he understands what may have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       "When you experience things for so long, sometimes it takes a toll on you, you lash out in ways that may not be the best," he said."
      </p>
      <p>
       :: wait wait wait... This man, who supposedly flew off the deep end after his military exposure worked for a social services agency that serves children and adults with disabilities? I don't understand how point A matches up with point B here. Now, I want you to notice something... In quotes up top, his friend Carnegie explains that Johnson never talked about anger. Then in NO QUOTES (I pasted this directly from the article) it says as a BLACK MAN, he understands what may have happened. This was not in quotes. Carnegie did not say this. The writers did. Then Carnegie adds that when you are exposed to things sometimes you LASH OUT. Very true, but exposed to what things? Traumatic military happenings after only 12 months in Afghanistan? Or is he referring to the constant 'run-ins' that he supposedly had with police as a black man that led him to LASH out against white police officers? More questions than answers I'm afraid.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "At some point, Johnson appears to have worked at General Dynamics, a defense company with offices in Richardson. A woman who answered the phone there Friday said he'd been an employee. People at the business said employees had been told not to talk to the media. A spokeswoman for the parent company would not confirm or deny his employment."
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       :: The DEFENSE COMPANY that they are referring to is General Dynamics by SATCOM Technologies in Richardson. Look the business up. It doesn't look like they supply ANY defense supplies at all. In fact, their products are strictly electronics and communication based. Also, they have ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF that he even worked there. As it was said, they would not confirm nor deny his employment at all. But we are lead to believe, and an even stronger image is painted in our mind.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Pentagon records do not reveal the reason for Johnson's Army discharge in April 2015. But a military lawyer who represented him said Johnson had been accused of sexually harassing a female soldier and had to leave the service. Bradford Glendening, a military attorney who practices near Fort Hood, said that the Army sent Johnson home from Afghanistan, which was unusual. Discipline for sexual harassment is typically counseling, he said.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "He was very much disliked by his command, that was clear," Glendening said.
      </p>
      <p>
       The woman asked that Johnson receive "mental help" and asked for a protective order for herself and her family, Glendening said, adding that he wasn't sure which type of discharge Johnson ultimately received."
      </p>
      <p>
       :: So, the records do not indicate why he was discharged, or even the type of discharge he received. Interesting, is anyone asking WHY? No. No one is asking why. And as stated earlier, his 'fellow soldiers' have been ordered not to talk about him. Hmmm. Also, I would like to point out that the article NEVER CLEARLY STATES that this man, Glendening was the man that represented him. If you read carefully, you will notice that it says 'a military lawyer who represented him' then it goes on to say Glendening is a 'military attorney who practices near Fort Hood. They never state that Glendening was the man that represented Johnson. Never. But any reader would look at that sentence and automatically assume that is the case. This bit also tells us that Johnson was removed from the military for sexually assaulting a woman. Seems pretty straight forward, but again, because no one has confirmed any of this, it is ALL SPECULATION.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "The month after he was discharged, Richardson police received a "suspicious person" report near a strip mall along Greenville Avenue. The caller, whose name was redacted from police records, reported a black 2006 Tahoe with four males inside sitting behind the mall for 20 or 30 minutes before pulling up out front.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Two Richardson police officers arrived and found Johnson inside the Tahoe. He told them he'd just gotten out of a martial-arts class "and was waiting for his dad to arrive" to pick up his brother, the report says.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officers left after about 10 minutes."
      </p>
      <p>
       :: Here we go, this is the RUN-IN with police that they built up at the beginning. First, the name was redacted from police records. Why? For what reason? Do the Richardson police not keep records about stupid insignificant calls that result in the officers leaving after ten minutes? Because that's what this is. Someone called in a suspicious person, police arrived, questioned, and then left after ten minutes. Apparently he wasn't so suspicious that the police would think to stick around and see what unfolds. No, they left. Yet this was specifically described as a RUN-IN with the police. The 11 writers that wrote this story for you are clever.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Johnson's passionate interest in the black power movement began to manifest itself on his Facebook page this year. On April 30,he changed his profile picture to a shot of him with Professor Griff, a member of the hip-hop group Public Enemy known for calling out police brutality.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Formed in the early 1980s, the group has always tackled issues of political and cultural significance to the black community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Griff, whose real name is Richard Griffin, has been a particularly divisive character. At one point, he was expelled from the group after making anti-Semitic and homophobic comments;
      </p>
      <p>
       On Friday, Griff took to Twitter to say he did not know Johnson.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I will not sit back and let these people assassinate my character and tie me to the Dallas shootings," he tweeted. He later added, "'No Mr white officer I do not train snipers to kill cops.'"
      </p>
      <p>
       :: Here we go. This is my favorite part. This is where the writers will lead you to believe that his own black pride made him responsible for a coordinated attack on police officers. Johnson's PASSIONATE INTEREST in the BLACK POWER movement began to manifest itself on his Facebook page THIS YEAR... But, I thought his best friend at the sandwich shop said he had always been passionate about being black? Ridiculous. He changed his profile picture to him and Griff. Yeah, I would too. Public Enemy is awesome. I think any fan would do that. I know people that have their Facebook profile picture set as anime characters, doesn't necessarily make it so. They also make it a point to include the fact that public enemy has called out POLICE in the past. Why did they include that? To further imply that Johnson was a radical black activist. Then they go into who Griffin is. Why does it matter? By throwing words in like DIVISIVE CHARACTER and ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS, EXPELLED, the writers are trying to form a connection with the two people that just DOESN'T EXIST. If Griff did some things, and Johnson met with him, then Johnson must have done those same things. Be smarter than this my friends. Griff himself even tweeted that he never knew Johnson personally. You're telling me you trust the thought-out words of 11 professional writers over one man's claim that they are wrong. 11 writers.

The article is about how this man used his military training to execute a planned ambush on police officers. None of his connections to the BLACK POWER movement sound anything other than a 25-year-old man taking part in his own history and culture. It does NOT sound like a man that hated police officers so much to plan an attack on them at a peaceful protest. And look at that final sentence. I cried when I saw... Powerful. I'll bet she did cry. We all did. It was a sad moment. But it was not an ATTACK ON THE SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION as the article would have you believe.

       Here are some questions we should be asking:
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was only one gunman, why were there reports of multiple shooters? Even people that had been listening in on police scanners confirm that the police were talking about multiple shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       How was Johnson able to move like an advanced army ranger after only 12 months of service overseas? Furthermore, how much combat did Johnson see? If any? I know plenty of ex-military 25-year olds that admit to NEVER HAVING A SINGLE DAY OF COMBAT. Is Afghanistan really as dangerous as the media will lead us to believe? It was my understanding that not much is happening with our troops in Afghanistan. I saw the video. Anyone can watch the video. That was suppressive fire followed by an outflank, sliced the pie and double-tapped. Textbook. You don't get that from the 420 engineering brigade in the army reserve, and you don't get that from 12 months service in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did Johnson tell the police that he acted alone? According to everything I've read, the police had such a hard time pinning this one active shooter down, that they had to resort to using a robot to get to him. How in the actual fuck did they have time to chit chat with this gunman they were trying so hard to subdue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did Johnson get the gear? Rifles, ammunition, vests, ski masks, bomb equipment, this is all material that don't come cheap. I read that he worked at a sandwich shop, where was he working when he got this brilliant idea to kill several police officers? Was he just stockpiling for war? I don't buy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did one man take out 5 police officers? If you think shooting a cop is an easy task, you are horribly misinformed. These men are trained to face danger and they are trained to avoid it. They train constantly on how to take down a lone active shooter. Shit, I worked security and I got that training. Shooting that many officers with that kind of precision just doesn't add up to a SINGLE SHOOTER story. It does not. They had three other people in custody, and reports of one suspect that killed themselves in the parking garage. Where are those people, the Dallas Chief was pretty confident that they had multiple suspects. But no, the story changed, as it often does. And we won't hear anything about them ever again.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is with the bomb disposal robot? Is that police procedure? They busted several holes in the wall of the pulse club to exchange fire with Mateen, but they use an explosive device to take this guy down? What does this mean for the future? Will police start practicing this effective technique more often? This too, sets a horrible precedent. It may seem like it was justified because Johnson is being painted as something he is not by the media. But in reality, we would have had a lot more answers as to why he did what he did if the police had taken him in alive. But that's not what happened. The shooter was killed and now we will never know the truth. Make no mistake, that's the way they want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is no one saying anything? We heard from Omar Mateen's father the very next day (who is also running for president of Afghsnistan/ look it up). We also heard from several victims of the Pulse shooting within 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital. Yes, you read that right, 24 hours after being shot, victims of the pulse shooting were well enough to give a full disclosed recollection of what happened. Look up those videos, they are just as ludicrous as this story. It will be interesting to hear what the surviving officers say about this event, if we ever hear about it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note, I want people to prove me wrong on this. So if you have a theory, let's TALK ABOUT IT. Don't write me off as a "crazy conspiracy theorist" until you can provide me with some facts that support I am wrong. I welcome the very idea of being wrong about this. But the stories just don't connect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was at the grocery store last night and I had a conversation with a guy in line behind me, we were talking about how terrible the current events are, and how people need to look out for one another. And it's true. But first we have to identify the real problem. We need more answers.

       Very well written and argued analysis of some hefty spin. They are just getting so sloppy now. It seems we live in the century of false flags, and the fact that so many people are just willing to dial in to the 'news' daily for their dose of what to think seems to mean they can just be so blatant as we have seen in the last few months. It is not just that it is ramping up, but that it is happening so brazenly... it is as if they don't even have to try to get it right on the night anymore with the forth estate prepared to mop up the obvious and tie the red ribbon.

       "Wait a minute, he TOLD officers before 'negotiations failed' and they had to use a bomb to blow him up"
      </p>
      <p>
       The "negotiations failed" part, according to the police, is that he started to fire upon them. I think that really is a failure in negotiations. You can't negotiate when the other side is trying to kill you.

       "Also, of course Johnson was affected by police 'stuff' as they so nicely put it"
The "police stuff" was a quote. "They" put it there because she said it.

      <p>
       "'Johnson's mother, Delphene, got divorced in 1996, when he was 4'....They had to let us know that his mother was divorced." Ya, they did. Because he lived there with here, and her alone. Also, reporters and cops were at his father's place how has remarried. It's already a part of the narrative. It's not over-emphasized.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Afghanistan for one year, this guy was released from the military (the article will never explain why)"

       "Then Carnegie adds that when you are exposed to things sometimes you LASH OUT. Very true, but exposed to what things?"
Exposed to the media reporting on black men getting killed by cops and not one of them going to jail for it. Then the two murders only the day before his rampage ... ya, he flipped out. Not the first time and won't be the last.

       I can understand the quote. It is a quote you are right. I just find the word choice ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So police say that he was firing on them. I believe it, that is a failure of negotiations indeed. But then in what circumstance did officers hear the things they claim were said? Was there a brief pause between the firefight? To explain his motives and then it's back to shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't understand. Part of what narrative? Why does his mother and father getting divorced when he was four matter to us? No explanation of how the divorce affected him? Or lead him to the attacks? I never said that the statement was over-emphasized, my concern is why it even needed to be brought up in the first place. I understand there are other sources, and I welcome you to sight them. I am breaking down the article from DALLAS NEWS and going through it piece by piece.

       Part of the narrative because the cops were at his father's house; his father has remarried, thus it is obvious that they are divorced. They are merely stating facts about the guy.

       I can understand that completely. But this wasn't a clan rally. Nor was it a photo of him with black panthers. It was a Facebook profile pic of him wearing African garb with his fist in the air. I see what you are saying, it's interesting.

       Because he shot from multiple locations. He started from an elevated position - perhaps from the parking garage - and then went down on foot to confront them one on one. No source for this other than the cops yesterday on CNN saying this.

       You mention the word 'obsession'. No witnesses ever described him as being obsessed with black culture or black lives matter. And he wouldn't have any buddies if he were a loner. Again, if there were something like that going on, if this man was running around prepping for this random protest, someone somewhere would have something to say about it. But that's not what we are hearing. We are hearing he was a loner military freak who stockpiled ammo and guns, and set up a plan to execute these officers at the drop of a hat. Sorry, I don't buy it, no.

       You sound like a person that is passionate about this issue. But I think it is important to point out right now that my cousin was shot while on duty as a police officer by a black man. He survived, and officers shot that man. I don't know what made my cousin pull him over, but I know what made that man draw that gun. Fear. Cut and dry. The black community has had serious problems with the police all throughout out history. I am certainly not saying this didn't happen. I'm saying there is more to it than we are being told. Bottom line.

       Nope. Not passionate. You know cops don't fuck around when one of their own gets killed. Frankly I am surprised that they had the restraint to even try to negotiate.

       All poor people have problems with the police. From where I come from, the poor white people are the black people. Not too many shooting of us yet, but I know many people who've gotten the shit kicked out of them on many occasion for no reason- myself included. You don't forget things like that. My father too found himself in that situation, and when I told him about the dead cops in Dallas when it went down all he said to me was "GOOD!"

       So, if they had him cornered, why not bring in SWAT? Why resort to a bomb disposal robot? I've never heard of anything like that in the past. And if there were a phone call conversation, why haven't we heard audio? Still no audio for Mateen's 911 call.

       So they used a bomb to kill him? Sounds like that could do more harm than good. Say he did have explosives everywhere, wouldn't the more level-headed approach be to find out where they are? That's one of the first questions you are supposed to ask when faced with that kind of information. Instead, he was killed. And now we'll never know.

       Moving from location to location is surely plausible, and the flank video definitely demonstrates a person who can move quickly. However, I will say this. I know and have known many veterans. I grew up in Arizona, they are everywhere. I don't know a single veteran that can move like that, let alone a veteran with only 12 months of actual service.

       Again, how does this relate to his intent to kill police officers? It doesn't. The writers are trying to link these two people to make Johnson look a certain way. Have you seen the picture in question? I see hotel carpet pattern, I see tables, I see pamphlets, I see fold up chairs. I see another woman in the background. Looks like a picture you would take with a celebrity while at a convention. Because Griff is an outspoken conspiracy theorist against police brutality, and Johnson shot several officers, there must be a connection. No there isn't. As I stated, it looks like nothing more than a young man meeting one of his favorite celebs.

       He was the one that linked them when he put up the photo in the first place. Since the photo is now circulating, they have to identify who the man is that is with him. After identifying him, they now have to explain why Griff would be appealing to him in the first place since not everyone knows who he is.

       They took it over. Facebook does that. They comply with all law enforcement. Facebook are, after all, in the business of collecting "evidence" on all of us - all day, every day. The FBI/CIA's wet dream come true.

       welp if that's true then clearly we need to abolish military so we don't have
       <em>
        trained killers
       </em>
       anymore
      </p>
      <p>
       and yet again, the idea for a cloned army of remorseless and empathy-less soldiers is better, you can just kill them off after you're done with them instead of paying them retirements or have them be homeless killers wandering around
      </p>
      <p>
       and people still think
       <em>
        it's not worth it to clone humans
       </em>
       - i guarantee you there is at least one human being in the world who can think of at least a few scenarios where cloned army would come in handy, i know i can.

       Part of the narrative because the cops were at his father's house; his father has remarried, thus it is obvious that they are divorced. They are merely stating facts about the guy.

       The world was just introduced to this character and you would expect ever last bit of data, insignificant or not, to be included in a story. Everyone would do that if your were writing a feature where no data was know in the first place.

       So, if they had him cornered, why not bring in SWAT? Why resort to a bomb disposal robot? I've never heard of anything like that in the past. And if there were a phone call conversation, why haven't we heard audio? Still no audio for Mateen's 911 call.
