      <p>
       If you don't know Professor Griff, he's a member of Public Enemy, a politically and socially conscious rap group from the late 80s and a commentator on a fairly popular YouTube channel (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/blackmagik363">
        https://www.youtube.com/user/blackmagik363
       </a>
       ) that is all about consciousness. Professor Griff has been perpetuating conspiracy theories consistently over the past year or so. The Orlando Massacre was no exception to his criticism which he explained here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfnNzIfl0Ok">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfnNzIfl0Ok
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all of a sudden he's being portrayed as a radical black power activist advocating violence against police that has ties with the shooter of the most recent massacre in America against law enforcement. He is getting attention from every news and media outlet on the Internet when he's been entirely underground for years. He denied knowing the shooter, but this is irrelevant since it's pretty damn clear and obvious that a conspiracy theorist's character being assassinated is pretty subtle proof of a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My two theories:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The CIA set their agent up to take a picture with Professor Griff, which isn't far fetched if you look at other information on his Facebook profile such as him making a black power gesture, his name being similar to Malcom X, etc. All obvious stuff that would make you believe he's a Black Panther. By doing this they can sway potential conscious black people in the future from the largest black conscious channel on YouTube where Professor Griff is a mainstay.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This guy is 100% random but had some kind of "relationship" with a conspiracy theorist so they used him as a patsy. They changed their report from 4 shooters to 2 shooters, and now to the unbelievable 1 shooter. We already know this is impossible. There's no proof that this guy is the shooter. Who knows where this guy is in real life. He could be dead, in a clandestine prison, or paid money to live somewhere in another country. There is NO proof that this is the shooter, and there never will be. They aren't going to change anything to this "official" report. It's going to be a lone gunman just like Orlando with absolutely no proof whatsoever.

       He's more than just a conspiracy theorist. He's also a

      <p>
       All leads about Griff came from the shooters facebook page. Including the photo of them together.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for him being some extremist honestly I find the whole ideology of Afrocentrism to be quite extremist in nature. A whole allot people are going to have to die so the Kings and Queens of God the true Jews of Israel the Black Hebrews can rise again to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both your theory's are quite possible. We have no real link between the two at the moment. It's not like getting photo's with some you like is uncommon. And it still needs to be checked for photo shop work.

       Professor Griff is an enemy of the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also got a great podcast, although he has mentioned ongoing harassment. His house was recently burned down. This is nothing but a COINTELPRO trick to sully his name.

       According to this interview with the DailyMail, Professor Griff took a picture with the shooter at a meet and greet during one of his lectures in Dallas a few months ago. He was signing autographs at the time. The emotionally inflamed is just another name for the brain dead.
