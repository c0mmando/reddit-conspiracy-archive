       Edit: I posted earlier, and while I don't care about downvotes, there was absolutely no discussion. I felt discouraged, and I was told by a few others that I should try again. I'd like to try one last time to see if anybody actually wants to discuss this. Yes, I know this is long, but I swear I took time and tried to make my thoughts cohesive.

        Race, Psychological Warfare, and You: Are you being fooled?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, when we hear about inequality, why do we almost never hear about the rich and the poor? Movements to discuss class problems (Occupy Wall Street and the like) are often derailed quickly, and attention is put back on other issues, like race.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a mistake, and it works. Right now, scrolling through your social media, how many people are talking about race in some way shape or form? While you can draw your obvious conclusions, I am writing this post to break down misconceptions, myths, and other 'problematic' (haha) issues that are detracting citizens to the real problem: the class system. I am also writing this as a way to vent myself, in a world where people succumb to their initial emotions in order to justify any and every bias they have. In reality, I do not have many places I can write this because 'they' have done such a good job of silencing alternative views.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What is race? Why is it used as a tool?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate that people actually do not know what race is, and that is what leads many to confusion. It was interesting when I put 'what is race?' on google, I was led to many definitions of the word, which already, creates a lot of confusion. So, to clear things up, I am going to use the sociological definition of race.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        A race is a group of people thought to share certain distinctive physical characteristics, such as facial structure or skin color. Racial characteristics are thought to be biologically inherited (unlike ethnic characteristics, which are cultural).
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The google definitions fit this criteria; however, its definitions are confusing and can be used to manipulate modern concepts of equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       As people fight about gender being a social construct, I think they are actually missing something very important. Race is actually a social construct - let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/">
        http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this article: "More than 100 years ago, American sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois was concerned that race was being used as a biological explanation for what he understood to be social and cultural differences between different populations of people. He spoke out against the idea of "white" and "black" as discrete groups, claiming that these distinctions ignored the scope of human diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science would favor Du Bois. Today, the mainstream belief among scientists is that race is a social construct without biological meaning. And yet, you might still open a study on genetics in a major scientific journal and find categories like "white" and "black" being used as biological variables."
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened?! Why are we now using the idea of race to say there is something inherently different about a black person and a white person, when in reality, any difference is mostly sociological. This is not to say there are not differences that are inherent in different races, but these are generally physical differences (phenotypes). In other words, race is not biology (other the physical characteristics), and anything associated with race now is sociological. At this point in history, there is only one human race.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.livescience.com/47627-race-is-not-a-science-concept.html">
        http://www.livescience.com/47627-race-is-not-a-science-concept.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article, "Beyond the Ferguson, Mo., media reports on the "racial divide," the facts require some correction: Despite notions to the contrary, there is only one human race. Our single race is independent of geographic origin, ethnicity, culture, color of skin or shape of eyes â€” we all share a single phenotype, the same or similar observable anatomical features and behavior. "
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, race is about distinct physical characteristics, but over time, other elements of race have been added to its definition and they are socially constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why does this matter?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can understand that race in and of itself does not truly separate us other than physical characteristics, then we can be more compassionate to all individuals of different races - and is that not what civil rights is about?
      </p>
      <p>
       But the problem is, race, as a social construct, is different, and words like ethnicity, culture, language, etc. now all encompass that one term (even if incorrectly so). Still, if you are to look at the actual fundamental element of race, we are all truly one, and the problems associated with race have been created by society - they are not necessarily inherit to one specific group (at least now the groups being currently blamed in the media...) Instead of looking at different races, we should look at society as the root of our problems, and the people in control of that society. Because whether or not
       <em>
        white people are like this
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        black people are like that
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        this group is like this
       </em>
       it all goes back to the one question. Who is in control?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Quick anecdote:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a white person that has lived amongst Native Americans for the past 11 years. Over time, my attitudes, my demeanor, and even my taste in music have changed! This was not intentional on my part; rather, it is natural to adopt the traits of a community in which one lives. So, a person born in any community will likely adopt the traits of that community, even if they are not of the same race. It's really that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Divide and Conquer
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have been on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       long enough, you probably have heard people bring up divide and conquer strategies to pit different groups against each other and society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Malcom X said this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "So America's strategy is the same strategy as that which was used in the past by the colonial powers: divide and conquer. She plays one Negro leader against the other. She plays one Negro organization against the other. She makes us think we have different objectives, different goals. As soon as one Negro says something, she runs to this Negro and asks him, "What do you think about what he said?" Why, anybody can see through that today--except some of the Negro leaders."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/mxp/speeches/mxa32.html">
        http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/mxp/speeches/mxa32.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, this divide and conquer strategy is nothing new, and for as long as there has been distinctions of race, this has been used to set people against one another, making them believe they have different objectives and goals. Historically, we can look at nearly any civilization and see how divide and conquer has been used. It is used because it works. Even the Washington Post can see how race is used to divide and conquer. This is not new, and this is not even a conspiracy, really.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But something has shifted. The civil rights movement happened in our country, and while that DOES NOT mean problems of racial inequality are simply fixed, why has there been a recent and peculiar shift in racism? Why, when scrolling through social media, am I starting to see articles about white privilege, white people being born racist, and white guilt?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the daily mail, but this is just one example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3670918/White-babies-display-signs-racism-Elite-New-York-school-tells-white-kids-ashamed-privilege-segregates-children-race.html">
        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3670918/White-babies-display-signs-racism-Elite-New-York-school-tells-white-kids-ashamed-privilege-segregates-children-race.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the definition of racism itself shifting? While Google still says it means this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Others (SJWs) are now saying that racism has to involve some sort of oppression, and people cannot really be racist against white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you may say, "That's ridiculous! We all know white people can experience racism. These people are idiots."
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's exactly how the divide and conquer strategy works. It is not necessarily targeting me or you, it is targeting the people who do not want to think. Instead, it appeals to people's emotions, and it works. It's psychological warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "All people are equal, but some are more equal than others."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like in Animal Farm, the definition of equality is being shifted and perverted. I am not claiming that all have ever been equal in this society. I am not claiming that certain types of privilege do not exist. I am not claiming that there is not some truth in 'white privilege' even, or anything like that. However, problems in our society, caused by sociological reasons, should not be used as a justification for taking away the 'equality' of some and giving more to others. That is what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the thing, though. We could argue about the topic of race all day long. In the comments, I fully expect a few to come in an talk about the IQ tests of blacks and whites and all that nonsense. It's the perfect issue to get people fired up because it is so complex, and our society does not like complexity. Rather, it's easier to point the finger than to look more deeply at what is really going on. It's easier to see a child of a certain race suffering in school, and conclude it is about their race, when in reality, the problems associated with poverty may contribute to the problems of a specific race. That just may be too complicated for some people to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So right now, they are pitting all minorities against whites and vice versa, and it it's working. It's working really well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if it isn't race we should be concerned about, then what it is?
      </p>
      <p>
       To simplify it, class. Class trumps race in nearly every study of the impact it has on a person's experience in this world.
      </p>

      <p>
       I can go on and on. But what are these recent protests about? Are people uniting, convinced that we all have the same plight, and now they are protesting elitist groups for their use of divide and conquer strategies? Absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to make it clear that it is not that I do not think race issues are not important, but rather, if we were to choose what was most important, it would truly be class over racial inequality. I am also not claiming that racial inequality does not exist, but even that is a conspiracy itself and worthy of another post. We are all familiar with issues like the prison system, drug infiltration into ghettos, and even the music industry, which are all shown to keep blacks and other minorities down/disliked/stereotyped. I am absolutely not arguing that there are real race issues that need to be addressed. But these issues can always be linked back to the elite. Why aren't we, for example, bombarded with posts and memes about the CIA funneling drugs into poor (mostly minority) communities?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/usa-cia-drugs-poor-americas/">
        https://www.rt.com/usa/usa-cia-drugs-poor-americas/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the race issues that exist are directly caused and controlled the elite and 1% in our country. Most issues associated with specific races are symptoms of something larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that when we use race, we do not get beyond race. When we use race to divide, we will continually be divided, and we will miss the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Is there a solution?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, as corny as simple as it sounds, the solution would be unification on some level. If we could all connect on the one thing separating us (class), then perhaps we could unify and change things. Of course, any type of unification (look at unions in the workplace) is halted, often through disinformation agents and controlled opposition. So, even if people are willing to unify, there is much against them. No wonder it is easier to many to just enjoy their emotional release by venting on Facebook about whichever race they currently hate the most. It takes work. It takes change. It takes education. And of course, the best way to control opposition is to lead it, as Lenin explained. Look at Black Lives Matter, for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/black-lives-matter-sabotaging-bernie-sanders-campaign/">
        http://www.infowars.com/black-lives-matter-sabotaging-bernie-sanders-campaign/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I am not optimistic about the current state of affairs because I do not feel people are willing to look past their emotions and start searching. On top of that, I feel alone in my points of view, and even if I tried to share these views with most, I would be labeled as a 'racist' or a 'bigot' for even stating what I have stated here. In other words, people with these views are silenced for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to see a movement of people realizing 'race is really more of a social construct' and 'the American Dream is a myth', and maybe some of that exists to an extent, but in reality, many have become complacent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day, I posted something about how we have become to desensitized to the NSA spying on a popular subreddit (I rarely visit default subs), and while everybody agreed, most were completely apathetic. Most just said, "There is nothing we can do about it." Maybe that's what they want us to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope at least with this post, we can create discussion. I love hearing different points of view, and because this post is about race, I feel it will be heavily downvoted. However, I ask you, as always, to discuss before you downvote. If you like these types of posts, I also love writing about education and gender issues.

       Great post. Remember, when Martin Luther King started the Poor People's Campaign? Oh yeah, he was shot before he could lead THAT march. 
I can't add anything more to this- you nailed all the points. Cheers

       Ding-ding-ding. Someone gets it. Race is one of several, key strategies that the oligarchy uses to deliberately fragment the lower classes. There is little the wealthy fear more than a crowd of 1 million black, white, liberal, conservative, Christian, atheist, gay, and straight protesters on the Washington Mall screaming for the restoration of representative government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand what a pivotal role the US plays in maintaining the global hegemony of the wealthy, it becomes clear why they go to such lengths to control the American public.

       it might not be a million but after the last two police shootings you had crowds of black/white/male/female/asian/latino/etc people protesting in what felt like every major city in the country.......within a matter of hours of all those protests being picked up by the news shit hit the fan in Dallas and that was the end of that...now we are back to criticizing people over how much emotion they did or didn't show on facebook over recent events and arguing about if that makes them racist or not and if we should un-friend them and who needs to be apologizing to who based on how dark or light their skin is.  Sad really...

       I believe you are correct. There is a wealthy elite who assert their dominace over the rest. Then they give us reasons to fight and hate each other so that we will not see the thruth.  This isn't just the USA, but throughout tge world. Although, the USA is their "club house". Keep your eyes open amd keep up the good work.

       I think your hear is in the right place, and I think you're right - but you're right for the wrong reasons. It's simply not true that race is a social construct. That in itself is not a bad thing, but you invalidate and undermine your other points by making such a claim. To say that there are not differences that are substantial between different races is to ignore the biological component altogether. The reason that scientific journals differentiate between whites and blacks, for instance, is because there are actually significant differences in their physiology. There are drug sensitivities and genetic predispositions that are more common among certain races than others. There are behavioral differences that are not fundamentally environmental at all. When you try to create a false reality with which to base your assumptions and thoughts on, you're going to have a bad time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again: You're right, but you underlying assumptions are patently false.

       I'm not saying there is no biology to race. I'm saying it's not as important as the sociology.

       Our differences need not divide us, but to ignore them in the way that modern PC culture desires to do so is foolish too. We need to realize that we are being played off against one another and try to unite ourselves against the thousandth percenters that wish to dictate global policy and make us all slaves.

       Thanks, I have spent a lot of time on that assassination decade all part of what began with that election of 1960.  And honestly they had the money and the means and the determination and the means to continue the necessary money. I don't think it could have been stopped.

       I read first when a teenager and admired his frankness and honesty, and to me shocking I loved the later part where he recognized we are all in the same boat, the one some special few don't want us to have and keep drilling holes in and dropping economic bombs on.

       It is very easy to relate it to today, though cultural details and customs have changed the circumstances that create culture differences were being eroded and there was some blending that was stopped quite suddenly in the 80s, and a careful alternate culture was created for 
African Americans including movies, television shows etc.  So now once again we are two different cultures, but there are important differences in today's demographics that will make it easier to return to blending the cultures.

       Did you just get done with your freshman year as a psych major at a liberal arts school? I mean come on now, did you really just try and say that race is a social construct? You're posting to r/conspiracy and you seem to have no idea what cultural Marxism is. Critical theory in cultural Marxism was designed by jewish socialists from Eastern Europe that failed with creating a socialist revolution in Russia in the early 1900's. They then moved to Germany and developed their cultural Marxism at the Frankfort school. They came to the conclusion that the only way to bring socialism to the west was by destroying cultural/ethnic identity and religion. That's where this whole diversity is our strength bullshit comes from. By you being deceived into thinking race is nothing more than a social construct you're falling prey to the cultural Marxists by willfully giving up your identity/cultural heritage. Hitler kicked them out of Germany when he came to power and they came to the United States, mainly New York and California. They do what libtards do best by taking positions at universities and pushing their propaganda and brainwashing people. 15-20 years later in the 1950s the U.S saw the beatnik generation of college professors and college educated young people rejecting modern society and western values in favor of socialist values. Then ten years later in the 1960s it spread to most young people, college educated or not and the hippy generation was born. Fast forward to today and every college social science course will tell you race and gender/sex are social constructs and everyone is equal. Equality is a social construct. It's blatantly obvious to the average person and has been known by science for decades that there are racial differences in intelligence and behavior due to our genetics. Yes, all people regardless of race are about 99.7% genetically the same but that 0.3% difference does a lot more than you would think. For example, humans and bananas share about 50% of the same genes. 50 fucking percent of our genes are the same as a bananas. We share 98% of our DNA with great apes. Only 2% of our DNA separates us from from a damn gorilla. Go read the culture of critique by Kevin macdonald to get a better understanding of cultural Marxism and how it effects our modern world.

       I didn't say there wasn't any biological component to race. I claimed the sociological parts of race are more important.

       I like your posts, and I think you make great points. I also agree that the sociology makes a bigger difference than genetic differences, as was shown for example in the book,
       <em>
        Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've come to understand over the last few months and is finally penetrating my consciousness is that 'the powers that be'
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       control the opposition. If there is an opposing view or movement or leader that has gained wide attention, popularity, etc., you can pretty much bet your bottom dollar that they are controlled opposition. They have been sent to misdirect, befuddle, break up or in some way hinder the opposition. They are often sent to delegitimize the opposition. Just as race is used as a divide-and-conquer strategy, leaders are often sent to muck up genuine protest movements. When we look back in time, we see this again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The poster you answered here says: well relativism was is cultural Marxism. But
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/marx.pdf">
        Marx himself was part of the controlled opposition,
       </a>
       sent to hinder and misdirect genuine workers' movements against capitalists. Everything that has happened in the world under the banner of Marxism was meant to delegitimize "class warfare."
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lenin.pdf">
        The Russian revolution under the banner of Marxism
       </a>
       is a prime example.
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/reed.pdf">
        Socialist John Reed
       </a>
       is another example. Wherever you see a 'Marxist' or 'socialist' tag in front of someone who is getting a lot of mainstream press or academic attention, you should read that as 'agent.' And yes, what I mean by that is that the Soviet Union and the cold war was basically a big show, as both sides were funded and controlled by the wealthy bankers and industrialists, as for example shown by the work of Anthony Sutton. (He also found out the NAZIs were funded by this same group, so you can sort of conclude the same thing about them, but that's an even bigger pill to swallow.)

       Now it just so happens that many if not most of the people in the upper ranks of TPTB are Jewish, so there's also that angle. Make of it what you will, but it's not anti-semitic. Just an observation. I say it as someone who was raised Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the media (newspapers, TV, magazines) and the presses are all controlled by these extremely wealthy families who make up TPTB. So why would they allow the words of  a true revolutionary to be amplified through their media outlets? The answer is, they wouldn't. There is no freedom of the press, so to speak, and there hasn't been for a long, long time, if there ever was one.

       Thomas Jefferson,

       </a>
       wrote:  " It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it's benefits, than is done by it's abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live &amp; die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to his will, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods &amp; errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false."
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be suspicious and wary of anybody's opinions and advice. The more prominent they are, the more likely what they have to say is sprinkled with misdirection and disinformation, or that their purpose is to serve the interests of TPTB.

       As for Malcom X, my assumption is that he was also part of the controlled opposition, despite all of the things he said and stood for that I agree with.  My assumption is that he was used in part to do exactly what he says "they" do, play one "Negro" leader against another. You see, they love to tell you the truth about what they're doing while they're doing it. So he was sent to splinter the civil rights movement, a divide-and-conquer strategy within a divide-and-conquer strategy. He was also sent to add to the misdirection, pointing to 'whitey' as the source of all the blacks' misery. Well in a sense it's true, but since most 'whiteys' were also being screwed over by the wealthy 0.0001 percent (TPTB), it's still not pointing the finger in the right direction. He was also used as a foil against white America. Whereas MLK was someone that many whites found sympathetic, Malcom was the angry black leader to advocated using violence if necessary. So he was the scary face of the civil rights movement and was probably used to blackwash the movement for many. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that MLK was a genuine leader.  I assume he was also controlled opposition,

       I agree that TPTB have and are continuing to use race as a divide-and-conquer strategy. But I hope you also realize is that strategy is played out repeatedly on both large and small scales.

       I definitely agree about controlled op, which is why it's so dangerous to idealize or trust these leaders. For example, I see the dahli lama as controlled opposition as well. I even read about how they used MLK because his views were more peaceful and non violent. Thoughts?

       How can you possibly think that what I said has no truth to it? Did you not look up cultural Marxism or the Frankfort school? How do you think that the sociological idea of race is more important than the actual genetic differences between races? Sociology had and always will be a pseudo science. No shit there are rich black people, but how many of them are actually in the top 1%? I'm taking people with hundreds of millions and billions of dollars. The only wealthy black people like that are in Africa and they make money by corruption. They are leaders and they sell their countries resources to westerners and use their populations as low wage workers. What influence do they actually have? They aren't big bankers who control everyone's money or gigantic pharmaceutical companies that bride the government into letting them sell dangerous drugs and vaccines. Just because your rich doesn't automatically mean you have influence over everyone else.

       Lol fine I'll summarize. Tldr: The concept of race has been purposely misconstrued to divide and conquer people, when ultimately they (people) should be focusing on larger issues such as class and true influence of the elite in on the masses. This has been going on for centuries and will continue if people allow it to.

       That person is a 100% racist troll who's either one of various trolls employed in this sub to engender racial division...or is literally
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       stupid, ignorant, and full of racist vitriol.  Either option is ultimately extremely sad really.

       Either way, his type is definitely part of the problem - not part of the solution.

       Species unity should be the order of the day, and it's too bad more of us don't realize that togetherness is the key to combat all the massive, divisive manipulation that weakens

       Pretty sad ultimately because many or these racists don't understand just how horribly manipulated they themselves are.  They don't get that they're expendable cannon fodder that have been used by groups above them to bring
       <em>

       <em>

       If you want to help yourself, you have to help others as well.  A group is only as strong as its weakest link, and any people that seek to divide their group (in this case, the entire human family) do nothing but make themselves weaker and weaker as a result.

       See, that wasn't so hard and it piqued my interest enough to read it through.  Don't take it personally when people ask for one, people's time is just as valuable as yours and they should have the option of walking by if they're not interested or have nothing to contribute.

       You realize there are differences deeper than physical, right?  Did you know, for example, that the average IQ of African Americans is only 85?  That was the cut off for mental retardation until the early 70s.  They only changed it due to societal pressure when they realized that the ramifications of knowing that half of all blacks were mentally retarded.  Food for thought.

       You just came off as really condescending. I never claimed my time is even valuable. It probably isn't. Plus I do feel people should learn how to read and examine things without a tldr.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even mentioned the iq thing in my post and just don't think it's pertinent to the discussion. There are mentally retarded people of every race - don't really care how they are grouped. That doesn't mean they don't deserve human rights. Plus, if the iq thing is true, there is still probably something complex behind it, and nothing really anymore is purely biological.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this argument is a little emotional, but it sucks when people judge you because of your skin color. I have it happen to me a lot where I live. They make invalid assumptions and it hurts.
Even if some stereotypes are rooted in truth, it is important that we remember humans are individuals, not necessarily the group they are part of. If you can't feel for individuals on an empathetic level, well maybe that is why you have difficulty with this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying there aren't some biological elements to race, but even if so, they are minute. Second, it's more important to see others as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not completely brainwashed by propaganda. I just think they have used race as a tool for so long that it's nearly impossible for people to get past it.
