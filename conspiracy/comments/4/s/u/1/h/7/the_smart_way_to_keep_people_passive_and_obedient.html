       It's a metasystem. In the debate, it's a constant back and forth from one system to another on the ends of the spectrum of approved stances. This is the actual system itself, this back and forth, the metasystem. It's the political left and right, the Muslim and Christian, the poor and rich, the war and peace, the racism and the reverse racism, the sexism and the reverse sexism. All power struggles. The power struggle is the real system, the limited playing field of teams in perpetual conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year, I felt something. I felt that humanity as a whole was close to breaking out of this metasystem to finally evolve in some way. I felt it and so did other people. But this year, I fear that the powers that be have ramped up their global manipulation and this is where we are now. There will still be a great and huge change coming but it will simply be within the context of this back and forth system. We were close to breaking out. Maybe there is still a chance.

       "humanity" as a whole can't "break" from such metasystem. It's intrinsic to (it's) nature. You can't have the Yin without the Yang. That's why it seems humanity is always going from the brink of destruction to the heights of creation, in a seemingly perpetual cycle.

       Maybe not, maybe never but individuals
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       break out from it and that's comforting. Even if it seems everything's getting crazier there are those who will maintain their sanity and not take a side and they will provide commentary and wisdom from outside of the box (outside of the system) which will help anyone who's listening. This individual transcends the system and even in a minuscule way drags the world behind him ever so closer to edge of the system's parameters. For that reason it is my hope, with the preservation of history, knowledge and the advancement of communications technology that we may finally follow these individuals in their vehicles of transcendence. I certainly hoped this era's paradigm shift was the one to do it, but no. I still have hope for the next one.

       Yin and Yang is a made up concept used to shut up lower income societies. It is continually pushed by "spiritualists" that have a shallow understanding of the true forces at work to the point of believing that everything in the observable universe can be labeled light or dark. We constantly ridicule old religions but this shit gets pushed the most and barely catches any flak. The universe isn't black and white and to think that nature NEEDS to be parabolic is naive to say the least. One of the main reasons we can't figuratively lift ourselves from this rut is because the supposed mentors we look up to are telling us it will just return to mayhem anyway because "that's nature". Bullshit.

       Red vs blue. Black vs white. Cops vs blacks. Cops vs civilians. Team misty vs team ash. It's all so we are on different teams and therefore we obviously can't talk, we can't discuss our differences when were on different teams.

       This is why when you see a Republican or Democrat talking head speak about the presidential race, they always frame it as "Yes, our candidate isn't good, but the alternative is the ONE other person on the R/D ticket." They won't dare mention third parties, because once they do, that breaks the narrative of the "two party" system.

       nice.  similar quote from Manufacturing Consent:
      </p>
      <p>
       "“The beauty of the system, however, is that such dissent and inconvenient information are kept within bounds and at the margins, so that while their presence shows that the system is not monolithic, they are not large enough to interfere unduly with the domination of the official agenda."

       neither of us have done anything.  sitting in front of a computer screen and commenting on this weeks atrocity is just as pointless as me pointing out how pointless it is.  take some real action before you don't have a chance anymore.

       all the reading in the world isn't going to get you closer to actually taking care of things.  this isn't a new issue.  action won't be taken, regardless of what is read by a small percentage of the population.
