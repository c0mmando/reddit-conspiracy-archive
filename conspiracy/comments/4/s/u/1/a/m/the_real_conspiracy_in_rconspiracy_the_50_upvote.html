       When ever there is something original that could change the direction of the narrative, it often hovers around that 50% up/down vote number which assures that it will get the least coverage possible.

       As of this writing it is at 49% upvotes and all posts that do not support the consensus are downvoted to the point where they are hidden from most readers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this pattern with posts dealing with ---
      </p>
      <p>
       -Climate Change

       -Vaccines

       Among other topics..

      <p>
       As of this writing 12 of the posts on the front page are directly about politics..

       It's unbelievable what happens here in Reddit. It's bad out there everywhere, but this system is too easy to game. I have a very well respected YouTube channel and after one of my very first videos made Reddit's front page, everything I've ever posted since then stays at 0 without fail. Sometimes a post will get up to 3 or 4 and you can literally refresh the page and watch the numbers go down.

       Glenn Greenwald wrote about the tactics in 2014 for the Intercept in an article called "How Covert Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive &amp; Destroy Reputations".

       It isn't just humans manipulating the conversation, they are also using AI accounts &amp; chat bots extensively. They don't only spread disinfo, they will also promote legitimate dissent that has a fearful or hateful angle to it.

       The goal is division. They know that they have no power if we are united against a common enemy. Let's make that our focus.

       Can you go into this further?  This topic is my #1 interest right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the HBGary hack brought proof of this being used to light:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The hack also revealed evidence that Team Themis was developing a “persona management” system — a program, developed at the specific request of the United States Air Force, that allowed one user to control multiple online identities (“sock puppets”) for commenting in social media spaces, thus giving the appearance of grass roots support.  The contract was eventually awarded to another private intelligence firm.
        <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/the-real-war-on-reality/?_r=0">
         http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/the-real-war-on-reality/?_r=0
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have a theory which adds to what you have said about AI accounts and chat bots:
It is reasonable to assume that intelligence agencies have access to social media.  Through social media, they can run A/B testing on talking points to determine what works best at controlling discussion.  They then have sock puppets/chat bots disseminate these points widely.
      </p>
      <p>
       One area where I think this really shines is racism.  I think they are planting racist comments all over the comments sections of major media online as a way of discouraging debate.  When the average reader runs into the comments section and sees it overrun with racist drivel, they are likely to turn away and not engage in discussion.  If you go back in history, the white/black racist divide is a US invention which happened shortly after poor whites and free blacks joined in armed uprising.  Despite propaganda to the contrary, the divide still exists and the play still works.

       So, I'm not sure if its a conspiracy or just a general trend. There are, from what I perceive, two forces involved in deciding what are the main topics discussed in this sub. One force is the users, who by their own will create trends. Certain topics will tend to draw more viewers merely because the viewers sense that they are connected/knowledgable/invested in said topic. That is not a conspiracy but just a function of social-media or any group-decision making process. The second force is the more conspiratorial force, which is artificial and political and NOT exclusive to any sub or any website. Any system will be manipulated by those who can, thats my belief. And it seems to be validated by the amount of bots/shills/brigadiers/online-markerters etc etc. Some of those are created for more sinister reasons than others, but most of the time they tend to PR who just want to keep people's names clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's a good conspiracy for you. Conspiracies. Why do we spend so much time worrying about most of this dumb shit? They are interesting to read. Thats it. Its a form of entertainment, and it feeds of your primal fear and desire to survive in an environment where all natural predators are non-existent so you substitute them by adding real/perceived/delusional artificial predators.
      </p>
      <p>
       True conspiracies aren't created to keep normal people from knowing them, they are created to keep the in-crowd from realizing that they are pawns. The stronger waves you make the more a threat you are, to people who are just as scared/fearful as us. You knowing about what happens in area 51 (or any random secret conspiracy) doesn't mean shit if you're not someone people can trust. Thats why all the people whose credentials can validate their opinions get silenced. The conspiracy is that we all are children in the eyes of the people who have influence, because to them the conspiracies are real people and relate to their jobs and families and to us the conspiracies are forms of entertainment that do nothing but jab us in the soft spots.

       is there any way to see how many points a comment or post had from when it was posted to the present? if so i could use that to prove you are right.

       Any time you guys post something empirically inaccurate I down vote your post. Maybe it has something to do with those topics that have scientific consensus with repeatable experiments. Maybe half of the people here have a hard time with science.

       Also I see a strong resistance as far as mass killings denial. I got a shitpost reply the other day for saying I would appreciate someone to just send a link to one of their supposedly dead 14 friends facebook page from Orlando and I would believe them. I'm a shitty person for even asking. Also no link I think they were full of shit.

       Do you have a representation of this data? A graph or even true ratio would make it more obvious if something is going on.

       It's pretty lame to link to your own posts like that.

       Maybe people just didn't like it.
