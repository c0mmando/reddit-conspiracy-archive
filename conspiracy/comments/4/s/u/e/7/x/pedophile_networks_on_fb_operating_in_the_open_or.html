        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Take one look at the Youtube or Facebook pages for Mattybraps or Carson Luedders and you can find a whole network of pedophiles who prey on children. </p>

<p>Perusing some of these men&#39;s profiles, you&#39;ll see a network of other pedos and (hopefully) fake child role play accounts. Many of these men also complain about being scammed by Indonesian accounts looking to get paid after they catfish them as 11-13 year old boys. </p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting how the parents and managers can sexualize these kids in such a way, openly inviting these sickos, and then refuse to even moderate their cash-cow social media pages. Facebook has a responsibility to take these reports seriously, yet they never do. </p>

<p>Anyone who spends 5 seconds on these pages sees that they&#39;re a breeding/hunting ground for these sickos, yet the own dedicated full time management of these children does nothing to curb it. It&#39;s not like they aren&#39;t aware or powerless to stop it. </p>

<p>How can I bring this to light via the media? I&#39;m sickened at the thought of all of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cut off the head and 2 more spring in place.  Fmrm Reddit CEO Pao did a fine job for ousting many hate / dispicable subs and she was rewarded for her efforts by being shitcanned.  So they are probably hesitant of that.  What appears to some as protectionism appears to others as an infringement on speech.  So people here (on this sub) are more libertarian and are likely to allow immoralities in speech if the only means to control it is to completely destroy it.  Not saying I agree, but that&#39;s the consensus and since I&#39;m a democratist I have to go along with the will of the people, something we wish would happen more often in the larger context if you know what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your willing to give some info on what you have found i have recently started volentering for groups that fight against sex trafficking in the states. Stuff like this makes me sick to the core and living in a city where underage trafficking is one of the largest in the country getting this out to some of the non profit organizations could be a start. If u can please send a pm. Thanks.</p>

<p>I got about halfway and was like &#39;I&#39;m done&#39;.  It&#39;s  not just bad kid acting, it&#39;s actually painfully stupid to watch (call me maybe one). I mean, it&#39;s the very definition of dukkha (great suffering) in the buddhist tradition.</p>
