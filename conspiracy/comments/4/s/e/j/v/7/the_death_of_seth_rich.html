      <p>
       First off, R.I.P to this young and aspiring person. I do not mean to offend his legacy just by posting here. I sincerely hope he will be resting in peace and that his family will be consoled during this tough time.
      </p>
      <p>
       SETH RICH was a young Washington D.C insider, hired by the Democratic National Committee/Convention, who was assassinated early this morning, July 11th. He was hired by Democratic National Committee Chairwoman (and former co-chair of HILLARY Clinton's 2008 campaign) Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in June 2014 as the official "voter expansion data director" for this election season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I personally find suspicious about his very recent death:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Debbie Wasserman-Schultz criticized the Bernie Sanders campaign of hacking into the NGP VAN voter database back in December of last year. NGP VAN has previously contributed to
         <em>
          the Clinton campaign
         </em>
         . In addition, it could have been entirely possible, given the many scandals surrounding Clinton, that the Clinton campaign may have taken crucial information or restricted the Sanders campaign from having stronger momentum in the days leading up to the Iowa primary. This is an entirely different topic though. Certainly Mr. Rich would have been aware of the particular data hacked or taken at this time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mr. Rich was hired by the DNC in June 2014. Earlier in 2014, the Clintons announced a voter initiative project meant at counteracting voter ID laws &amp; the stripping of provisions in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Another intention of this collaboration with the DNC was to increase voter turnout. Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz at the time said she wished to make sure that "everyone who wants to vote and is eligible has an opportunity to register, has an opportunity to turnout and can have their vote accurately counted." However, it has been noted continuously by progressive media and r/sandersforpresident that Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz has deliberately done everything in her power
         <em>
          to discourage voters
         </em>
         from having their voices heard/accurately counted, thus creating another shield for Hillary Clinton from potentially losing to an "outsider" progressive.
         <em>
          Could Mr. Rich have expressed a personal conflicting opinion after the NGP VAN leak which would've made Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz more angry?
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Another Reddit user on r/politics noticed that Mr. Rich's LinkedIn Page detailed his work for a firm called Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. The CEO of this firm is a man named Stan Greenberg, a man who was a
         <em>
          leading political strategist for Bill Clinton
         </em>
         during his presidency. This man also re-branded BP as a "green" petroleum company.
         <em>
          Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public's disdain for oil industry/fracking?
         </em>
         Clearly going against the oil industry would mean a significant loss of profits. The U.S, as it is, has been oil dependent for ages, and the fight to change the climate has never been hotter than right now.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the months leading up to the BP oil spill, Mr. Rich was also a legislative affairs consultant for another firm called "Kissel E &amp; S Associates." When I happened to google "Kissel E&amp;S Associates, Clinton", one of the front page results led to a University of Nebraska paper,
         <em>
          and written during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.
         </em>
         This paper is titled "Conflicts in the Licensing Process for
TransCanada's Keystone XL Pipeline."
         <em>
          The Keystone XL Pipeline is one of the MANY positions on which Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on. Could Mr. Rich have dissented with some very powerful oil company interests who were looking to negotiate a backroom deal with the DNC?
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mr. Rich also happened to previously work for former Nebraska Senator &amp; Governor Ben Nelson. Former Senator Nelson happens to be a more conservative-leaning Democrat, but he also happened to be on the Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittees on Homeland Security/Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and was a member of the International Conservation Caucus. Senator Nelson, in 2010, was the deciding vote to help block a Wall Street reform bill.
         <em>
          He also contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009.
         </em>
         Senator Nelson also suddenly quit his position in 2013, and was at the center of the Obamacare Supreme Court ruling last year. Finally, I don't think that this is related to the conspiracy theory at hand, but last October, his daughter died from an accidental fall.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mr. Rich was murdered in the back by an unknown assailant with a gun. At 4:20 in the morning. Near Howard University. Not exactly the type of person who would be targeted in a nicer area of D.C. (I am aware D.C has lots of impoverished areas/urban decay.) The District of Columbia happens to have a ban on the sale or purchase of handguns, but nearby Virginia has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the country. And although there are many insiders who work for Washington D.C,
         <em>
          wouldn't it take someone with intelligence to know and particularly target somebody who happened to have crucial intelligence that could decide this election?
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The police, as of July 11, don't have any suspects, witnesses, or surveillance footage at this time. They also refused to comment if it was possibly related to recent robberies in the neighborhood. It can be disputed that this was but a botched robbery, however, because
         <em>
          nothing was taken
         </em>
         from Mr. Rich's dead body. One of the earliest rumored victims of the "Clinton body count" was Mary Mahoney, who died in a similar fashion as she was about to testify against Bill Clinton (and who had nothing taken from her body at the time of her death.)  (In comparison, The Manson family didn't steal anything from Sharon Tate's house when they brutally murdered her and others. The Family was also accused of killing multiple potential dissenters during and after Manson's trial, for a sickening comparison.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The TIMING
         </strong>
         of this tragedy seems too 'coincidental'/accurately timed. I think/know that:
        </p>
        <p>
         8a. Mr. Rich's sudden death comes the day before Bernie Sanders is set to endorse Hillary Clinton at a party unity rally tomorrow. Chairwoman-elect of the Nebraska Democratic Party (Rich's home state), Jane Kleeb, spoke of Rich as "a young Nebraskan who worked on campaigns and stood for
         <em>
          progressive
         </em>
         issues."
        </p>
        <p>
         8b. As of Monday the 11th, the Democratic National Convention is set to take place in exactly two weeks, and the Republican National Convention in exactly one. In addition, Bernie Sanders is set to speak at FDR Park on the 24th, about where the "political revolution" goes from here.
        </p>
        <p>
         8c. Hillary-supporting Governor of Connecticut Dan Malloy is currently under investigation over a Cigna merger. Hillary-supporting U.S Rep Corinne Brown is also currently under investigation over her super-gerrymandered Florida district (Wasserman-Schultz is from Florida).
        </p>
        <p>
         8d. There are currently RICO lawsuits investigating multiple counts of electoral fraud, and surprisingly, these lawsuits are pulling through the courts and gaining traction. Mr. Rich could have been aware of the American people actually standing a chance with these lawsuits, and given his access to crucial voter data,
         <em>
          could have decided to be a DNC defector and testify on behalf of the people in charge of these electoral fraud lawsuits.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         8e. There is still a possibility that Russia/Julian Assange has DNC information and could be planning to leak it to the public in time for the convention. Mr. Rich could have known of this.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion:
       </strong>
       If anyone could have been the one to break the news on possible election fraud, it would have been Mr. Rich. If his death somehow is confirmed as part of corrupt Clinton collusion, then it is important to know that with the major players involved, Mr. Rich would have posed the least significant threat, at least in comparison to Vladimir Putin or those high up in the Washington D.C establishment. Many questions remain on my mind that are, and will probably forever, remain unanswered. I am just what some would dismissingly label as an "armchair activist" or "Reddit lawyer." Perhaps I have an inherent bias in actual democracy, as you can see in my post history that I've been a staunch supporter of Senator Sanders. The context, but mostly imminent timing of the loss of this young insider seems to go beyond "pure coincidence", despite the number of robberies in the D.C area lately. I believe that Hillary Clinton's team or the DNC could have colluded to dispose of this young man who happened to be exposed to a little too much information.

       It gives me no joy to post this on the day he died, but given his position &amp; timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.

       I swear Bill did a double take at the camera when he mentioned someone who had died this morning (I've been watching the convention on cspan very closely). Clintons have no problems using deaths they don't care about to garner support.

       FYI, I knew seth personally, and you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       offended his legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, when you guys post this stuff, do you not stop to think, even for a second, that this is someone's son? Someone's friend? Someone's brother? And how it comes across when you try to fit their death into your conspiratorial agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if this was someone you knew, and were close with, and a bunch of strangers on the internet were trying to subvert the death of
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       friend to advance their conspiratorial agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       God, as though hearing my friend was gunned down was not bad enough, I have to contend with this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love...
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       how you bookend by saying you don't wanna offend and it "give you no joy" to post this... well if you didn't wanna offend, you failed, and if it gave you no joy, why the fuck did you post it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this is a subreddit full of conspiracy mongers, so my logic and common sense won't go very far but for fuck's sake have some empathy. Seth was not an "insider" the news stories have inflated his position because they're trying to honor his death. He was helping build a passive tool that helps voters find their polling place, not registering voters or dealing with the clintons.

       No offense, but how exactly does this offend someone's legacy? I'm not a conspiracy theorist and think it's &lt;1% an assassination, but the OPs post mostly provided factual information about Seth Rich's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my brother were murdered and there was even a 1% chance something fishy was going on, I'd sure as shit want the Internet conspiracy bros to do some research.

       It sounds like you're grieving and unfortunately I know what that's like, but try to look at this from a different perspective and you may feel differently about it. The OP really was pretty sensitive too.

       The fact that you don't realize how this offends a person's legacy, and how it offends his family and friends suggests there's very little I could say to get you to realize why that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I believe you are capable of figuring it out yourself, IF you determine that you actually want to figure it out. IF you actually want to try being empathetic, IF you actually want to try putting yourself in the shoes of his friends and family... you will understand exactly why this is so offensive and disrespectful.

         I didn't really know seth well enough to be grieving... we knew each other for 6 summers, ending in 2006 and hadn't spoken in 8-9 years... his death was impactful because its someone I knew, but this isn't an issue of lacking perspective because I'm overcome by grief or something.

       There is a ZERO percent chance though. There is actually, a ZERO percent chance this is part of some vast conspiracy with the Clintons at the center because that is just
       <em>
        fucking absurd.
       </em>
       Clinton-murder conspiracies are as absurd today as they were 20 years ago when Americans didn't take those seriously either... Like, try to put that into your head then re-calibrate. I know you're not going to like me saying that or even believe it, but try to imagine there is a 0% chance that this is anything fishy... then how would you feel?

       Not really... it makes a ton of assertions about what he was doing for the DNC, his relationship to higher ups in that organization and other democrats, where he was and why... what this mostly is, is a conspiracy theory. Admittedly, this is

       Secondly, I don't see you condemning the narrative being pushed by the Dems that the leaks were a conspiracy orchestrated by Trump and Putin, which has just as much circumstantial evidence as the theory you are critcising. You come off like a Clinton shill.

       The guy expounded like he was not a shill, but he was unreasonable , which makes him well who knows. I think anyone could appreciate Seth Rich, seemed to be a truth teller in any way you look at it. 
Hope the good guys can stay together, the 'evil forces" are always trying to get us to fight (divide and conquer, they really sound like more 'bitch argument skills, guess it may come along with the initiation panties they wear ...

       So you knew seth enough to be offended, and try to put down someone else, but not enough to actually be close to him. It's like saying I'm struck with grief that someone was shot and was reported on the news, therefore it should be taken down because this offends me. It's people like you that are helping free speech become controlled speech.

       i think regardless of what you're trying to achieve, the OP brings some interesting coincidences to the table, if you think this is the end of this then you're an idiot. people are going to keep making this conclusion regardless of who it offends or not. that being said, im really sorry for your loss, he seemed like a genuinely great person.

       Oh really? You think no room for conspiracy? Read this article from CNN yesterday. After hack of DNC, the Clinton campaign hired a private computer detective. They found a breach...one that led to the computers at the DNC....guess where that access was coming from? The department that was handling voter data analytics. Ouch...that's Seth's department. Read the article and know that the pieces are going to be put together soon. 0% chance? Read the article! He may not have been an "insider" but I guar-an-damn-tee you he was up inside their computers.

       The first element that made me suspicious of this killing was the reaction of the parents. Most people who have lost a loved one are
       <em>
        overly
       </em>

       You have yet to refute even one point of suspicion. Your whole argument is that the people you are attacking are "idiotic" and that there "is ZERO percent chance this is part of some vast conspiracy...". That's not an argument; those are just a statements floating in the air. 
Indeed, considering your position is so weak, it implies you have some ulterior motive to express it.

       Great post. The time of his death is what sets off alarm bells with me. It's a very odd hour for a working professional to be walking about DC alone. Also, he wasn't robbed, correct? Or was he?

       Since we don't have any suspects, if the motive were robbery, then it was certainly a botched robbery, as his belongings were on him at the time of his death this morning. I can't confirm this, but other people on the politics Reddit claim multiple shots were fired at him in succession. It seems that Mr. Rich fought back while he could, but I don't personally think it was a robbery.

       It was a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  Not that unusual for a 27 year old to be out partying late on the weekend.  The official police working theory is that it was a robbery gone wrong (i.e. he put up a fight, the robber ends up shooting him, and then ran when he heard sirens or someone nearby woke up and lights came on or something like that)

       I lived in the downtown D.C. area for four years. The place where he was murdered is one of the safest, nicest parts of town. This is purely circumstantial evidence, but let's hope more concrete facts are brought the table by investigators as this whole thing unfolds. I somehow doubt that the Clintons would be involved in such a brazen act, though. In the off chance that it -was- some kind of conspiracy, I would put my money on the SVR trying to make the Clintons look like murderers (not that Clinton's foreign policy hasn't made her one already).

       His first job out of college was as a research associate for the opinion research firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner.

      <p>
       In 2014, he took up his position at the DNC, which starts its all-important convention on July 25.

      <p>
       He grew up in Omaha, where his family played a strong role in the Beth El Synagogue.

       His grandfather was a founding member of the synagogue and his father was head of the congregation until recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rich studied Hebrew at the synagogue, and traveled to Israel two years ago. His teacher paid tribute to Rich on Facebook, calling him 'a dynamic young man who loved his work at the DNC.'

       It is a suspicious death, during a much suspected election with allegations of DNC tampering. Maybe it is offensive, but no more offensive than being labeled a conspiracy theorist anytime something questionable is questioned. It is after all, a deflection created by the C.I.A..

       First, I agree wholeheartedly with u/jigielnik this post is shitty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, what makes you think it's not a crime-ridden area? I can think of at least 7 shootings in the past month not to mention my friend who was attacked outside of her house and the guy who got maced and robbed while jogging at 3pm. The weekend before this someone was shot in the head in their alley. Do you even live in DC/Bloomingdale?

       Please read article from yesterday's CNN. A new hack discovered at the Hillary campaign. This is separate from the DNC hack but linked. According to the article access was gained in the department of "Voter Data Analytics" Ouch...that's the Seth Rich department. I believe this story will get bigger.

       Here's my take: Seth Rich was a linked with Wikileaks. Julianne Assagne seems to have Russia as his source. Seth Rich acted as an inside connection to Russian hacking group. Seth Rich knew too much and he was bumped off by the Russian groups that found him to be a risk. Clinton's had nothing to do with the death. There is no sense behind that. Bottom line is the Russian's seemed to have a huge invested interest in making sure Clinton lost.

       Yeah... if the Sanders camp had committed
       <em>
        election fraud
       </em>
       then they are spectacularly bad at it. So bad, in fact, that Clinton consistently outperformed exit polling well outside the margin of error in key states. States that have no paper trail and hackable voting machines.

       You misunderstood.  I'm saying that Seth Rich may have been involved in voter fraud
       <em>

       Clinton and
       <em>
        against

       to use your logic, this conspiracy requires one to believe that the most powerful political family in present day hired a hitman incapable of making a clean shot-- leaving the subject alive long enough to get the hospital and thus text/talk about what he knew (hitman would likely be then killed for such a failed operation)

       No ... it couldn't have "just as easily" been that.  - lulz - that's not enough motive to commit murder, not even for the wackadoodle Sanders' disciples and followers.

       If you don't think that the Clintons putting out some sort of hit on Seth Rich because he knew something about election fraud doesn't require a veritable truckload of hypothetical premises to somehow be proven true (not to mention how difficult it would be to pull soemthing like that off; this isn't House of Cards) and that the most obvious cause of Rich's death isn't the guys who have been parading around the neighborhood with a handgun, then I have nothing else to offer you. I mean, your basic first premise--that he knew something about election fraud, which presupposes that there was election fraud--is a complete, um, shot in the dark.

       The principle can be interpreted as stating Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)Seth Rich was killed in a hit involving a vast left-wing conspiracy
2) Seth Rich was killed by a bunch of guys who had been seen parading a gun around the neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are way more assumptions tied to the first claim than the second.

       I agree, but in my opinion you interpret Ockham's razor a bit too "hard".
      </p>
      <p>
       Ockham's razor says nothing about the "truthiness" of anything. The reason you should use Ockham's razor to choose the hypotheses with the fewest assumptions is that those are easier to test.
      </p>
      <p>
       A hypotheses with a lot of assumptions is usually quite complicated to verify, whereas one with only a few assumptions is relatively easy.

       Since we don't have any suspects, if the motive were robbery, then it was certainly a botched robbery, as his belongings were on him at the time of his death this morning. I can't confirm this, but other people on the politics Reddit claim multiple shots were fired at him in succession. It seems that Mr. Rich fought back while he could, but I don't personally think it was a robbery.

       I lived in the downtown D.C. area for four years. The place where he was murdered is one of the safest, nicest parts of town. This is purely circumstantial evidence, but let's hope more concrete facts are brought the table by investigators as this whole thing unfolds. I somehow doubt that the Clintons would be involved in such a brazen act, though. In the off chance that it -was- some kind of conspiracy, I would put my money on the SVR trying to make the Clintons look like murderers (not that Clinton's foreign policy hasn't made her one already).

       It was a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  Not that unusual for a 27 year old to be out partying late on the weekend.  The official police working theory is that it was a robbery gone wrong (i.e. he put up a fight, the robber ends up shooting him, and then ran when he heard sirens or someone nearby woke up and lights came on or something like that)
