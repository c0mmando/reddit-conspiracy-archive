        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">65</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-07-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/bubomaximus.html">bubomaximus</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Go to Google News and type <em>Oakland police department.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing headline after headline referring to recent and ongoing events in that agency as a &quot;sex scandal.&quot; The vast majority of headline writers agree that a &quot;sex scandal&quot; is what it is. Also appearing are the terms &quot;police misconduct case&quot; and simply &quot;police scandal.&quot;</p>

<p>What they&#39;re referring to is allegations of widespread police involvement in human trafficking, including underage prostitution. Over the past month or so, reports have surfaced of  multiple investigations into 4 area law enforcement agencies, and it&#39;s said that these investigations were prompted by an Oakland PD officer suicide and the accompanying confession note, back in September.</p>

<p>Multiple officers are suddenly resigning and being placed on administrative leave. A former Oakland PD captain was fired from the DA&#39;s office. The police chief resigned. 5 days later, his replacement resigned. 3 days later, HIS replacement resigned. That&#39;s 3 police chiefs in 9 days. Now a City Administrator is running the PD.</p>

<p>That&#39;s big. </p>

<p>So... the PD is being investigated for <em>running a human trafficking ring that engages in child prostitution,</em> and the press is calling that a &quot;sex scandal?&quot; Child molestation for profit is a &quot;sex scandal?&quot; When did this happen?</p>

<p>I thought a &quot;sex scandal&quot; was when a public official gets caught cheating on his wife! Not pimping minors for sex! What is wrong with the news media? Or am I crazy?</p>

<p>Social media certainly aren&#39;t blowing up with this story, and I can see why. It&#39;s just some sex scandal! Oh wait, it&#39;s major law enforcement agencies pimping out kids! What?</p>

<p>Talk about a conspiracy. </p>

<p>How long have they been doing this? Who looked the other way? And how many other law enforcement agencies across the country are involved in this sort of thing? And how many other institutions of our society? Is this the sort of thing we&#39;re meant to be distracted from? This is sickening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think that was the former Oakland PD captain who just got fired from the DA&#39;s office over this.</p>

<p>Amazing post you linked to. I was thinking along these lines. These things keep coming up again and again over the years, from Hollywood to London to the Vatican, and I guess we&#39;re supposed to just assume that none of them can be connected on a larger scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh. Yeah the press consistently downplays all these connections. The same with all the serial killers who&#39;ve mentioned connections to this kind of thing.

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of thing (serial killings, child abduction, rape rings, human sacrifice) is SO FUCKING ENTRENCHED all the way to the top of practically every political structure in the world. For one reason or another, the absolute most powerful people in the world are the main consumers of this kind of thing. They rape, they kill, they torture. It&#39;s endemic at the top levels of any power structure. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a human flaw or the surest way to initiate someone into a secret club. After you&#39;ve fucked, tortured, killed, then fucked again a CHILD (or children), then it&#39;s pretty clear you can be invited to the big boys table.</p>

<p>Name the leader of any western nation and know that they have taken part in this. That&#39;s why any hint of an investigation into the organized prostitution (rape) of children is immediately shut down.</p>

<p>Read this book, it shall help you understand:</p>

<p><a href="https://fringechan.org/library/src/1456411474807-1.pdf">https://fringechan.org/library/src/1456411474807-1.pdf</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s also probably not the whole story considering it can still be bought on Amazon. Probably because it is very careful not to name certain names? </p>

<p>Either way, there&#39;s your answer. No one in a position of authority is interested in uncovering any sort of &#39;ring&#39; involving underage prostitution because the orders from above are to ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah shit!!! That&#39;s my favorite book as of late. I&#39;ve read it like 3 times trying to memorize the info.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out a way to introduce it to r/serialkillers. They seemed to like my photo of John Wayne Gacy and First Lady Carter in the comments. Fuck it. I&#39;m making post over there about that photo. planting seeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it. Thanks. I&#39;d heard and read quite a bit about this sort of thing, but that&#39;s different from seeing it in today&#39;s news and watching the press euphemize it as a &quot;sex scandal.&quot; That blows my mind. </p>

<p>It&#39;s always just when I think I&#39;m cynical and jaded that some new, improved outrage comes along and ambushes me. Like these goddamn fake news videos lately. I mean, I knew they could just make up the news if they wanted to, and I&#39;ve known it for a long time, but come on! They&#39;re really making up the news now! And it&#39;s not even convincing! </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;ll never cease to be amazed. </p>
