       Out of control.  I get banned from subReddit after Subreddit.  If there is even a hint that you are a Trump supporter you will be banned repeatedly.  I was just banned from some su reedit for having participated in the_donald.  There are subreddits that ban you just for having participated in the_donald.

       As a Bernie supporter (so yeah, now I have nobody to vote for in the general election) I must say that all the Trump hate is pretty outrageous. Yeah I think the guy is the political definition of a ignorant and pathological-exaggerator one-upper, like if George Bush's intellect was given sentience, ambition, and a bad hairdo to walk the earth with..
      </p>
      <p>
       But the guy at least has a the balls too say how he really feels and challenge the way things are. The fact that so many are fervently supporting him seemingly out of nowhere is a testament to how fucked up our country and our government has become. We have become so fucked that Donald Trump might actually become president.  Worse off, I actually think he would be a better choice than his competition (though I don't believe in voting for the lesser of two evils.)
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, I don't agree with what you say or how you think, but you should absolutely be given the opportunity to say it.

       I think the country needed Bernie this round.  Hillary winning would be a slap in the face to everything this country is supposed to be.  I could give examples, but as a Bernie supporter you already understand.  I understand fearing Trump.  I feared Obama.  He stood for nothing, had no real background and a bit of extremist history, and ran on "hope and change."  I like the Trump of old, the pro choice, pro drug legalization, businessman.  I do like that he is Not and never was a racist as can be seen in his hiring policies and country club policies (Clintons belonged to a racist country club at the same time Donald was opening mar a lago to everyone).  He was just a shrewd businessman but not evil.  If he is becoming a republican I am really disappointed.  Hillary is a known liar, elitist, and warmonger.  Trump has some great character references.  The cartoonish portrayal is just dumb.  I can't defend him over Bernie.  I can defend him over Hillary.  Sorry for the rant.

       Despite what others on this post think, there are actually lots of shills on this sub. They're easy to spot. They defend things like Clinton and TPP (which no self-respecting researcher would ever waste time defending) and say shit like "take off the tinfoil hat" (bro why u even here then) and "this can all be easily explained" the best is "sauce I kno this guy who totally knows the NSA doesnt spy on you cause he works there"

       You get it. Some will also ironically admit they're a shill so as to make it appear they're joking... Which is almost always used as a cover/deceit tactic IRL. I think they need to go back to psywar training.

Someone who's opinion differs from yours.

       The sooner this Shill labelling BS ceases, the better.
It's not debate when you just give up and call someone a Shill.

       Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions.
My interpretation of the word 'shill' comes from the over use of it everywhere on this sub.

       Hi there, nice to meetcha.
      </p>
      <p>
       At times you bring some level headed discussion of sources to the sub, or so I've lurked... so there's that. I am often irritated by what passes for sources here. The comments that annoy me from you are the pointless diversions and semantic quibbles. This seems like a hobby for you. After all this time here, some of these ideas have to have stuck to you. May I ask which ones?

       Most of the time it's to get the person to elaborate something, or to lure them into a trap to show why their logic sucks.

       Yeah, I generally don't comment on political conspiracies because there's a lot of precedence for quite a few of them being true. So things like the war on terror, whether the government allowed something to happen or whether they took advantage of a situation for their benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally the biggest idea that has stuck with me is that there's very little we can do about the world. Want to protest? Okay go ahead, look at how much good the Occupy Wall Street protests did - What benefit arose from those protests?

       Politics is such a huge topic, it would be dumb to just pick a side and blindly apply it to everything - I shit on people all the time for doing that.

       You can't just say the government lied about a group of things over here, therefore the government lies about all things.

       Apparently "we can easily be moved". This years fee for the cool kids club was only $40 billion. I'll do my part- my uncle loves Israel. I'll send him over there to work those stolen olive trees for free. He'll love it!
