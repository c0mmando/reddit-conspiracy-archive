    <div class="md"><p>As a Bernie supporter (so yeah, now I have nobody to vote for in the general election) I must say that all the Trump hate is pretty outrageous. Yeah I think the guy is the political definition of a ignorant and pathological-exaggerator one-upper, like if George Bush&#39;s intellect was given sentience, ambition, and a bad hairdo to walk the earth with.. </p>

<p>But the guy at least has a the balls too say how he really feels and challenge the way things are. The fact that so many are fervently supporting him seemingly out of nowhere is a testament to how fucked up our country and our government has become. We have become so fucked that Donald Trump might actually become president.  Worse off, I actually think he would be a better choice than his competition (though I don&#39;t believe in voting for the lesser of two evils.)</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I don&#39;t agree with what you say or how you think, but you should absolutely be given the opportunity to say it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the country needed Bernie this round.  Hillary winning would be a slap in the face to everything this country is supposed to be.  I could give examples, but as a Bernie supporter you already understand.  I understand fearing Trump.  I feared Obama.  He stood for nothing, had no real background and a bit of extremist history, and ran on &quot;hope and change.&quot;  I like the Trump of old, the pro choice, pro drug legalization, businessman.  I do like that he is Not and never was a racist as can be seen in his hiring policies and country club policies (Clintons belonged to a racist country club at the same time Donald was opening mar a lago to everyone).  He was just a shrewd businessman but not evil.  If he is becoming a republican I am really disappointed.  Hillary is a known liar, elitist, and warmonger.  Trump has some great character references.  The cartoonish portrayal is just dumb.  I can&#39;t defend him over Bernie.  I can defend him over Hillary.  Sorry for the rant.</p>

<p>At times you bring some level headed discussion of sources to the sub, or so I&#39;ve lurked... so there&#39;s that. I am often irritated by what passes for sources here. The comments that annoy me from you are the pointless diversions and semantic quibbles. This seems like a hobby for you. After all this time here, some of these ideas have to have stuck to you. May I ask which ones?</p>

<p>Most of the time it&#39;s to get the person to elaborate something, or to lure them into a trap to show why their logic sucks. </p>

<p>I do enjoy proving people wrong. </p>

<p>Yeah, I generally don&#39;t comment on political conspiracies because there&#39;s a lot of precedence for quite a few of them being true. So things like the war on terror, whether the government allowed something to happen or whether they took advantage of a situation for their benefit. </p>

<p>Generally the biggest idea that has stuck with me is that there&#39;s very little we can do about the world. Want to protest? Okay go ahead, look at how much good the Occupy Wall Street protests did - What benefit arose from those protests? </p>

<p>Nice vague answer about your belief or nonbelief in any political conspiracy... seems like you dodged the question. You&#39;ve essentially stated nothing.</p>

<p>And no, it is worth something to disagree. Freedom is the ability to say 2 +2= 4. I believe we are winning slowly, As I&#39;ve stated earlier, revolution is a process, not an event.

<p>Politics is such a huge topic, it would be dumb to just pick a side and blindly apply it to everything - I shit on people all the time for doing that. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just say the government lied about a group of things over here, therefore the government lies about all things. </p>
