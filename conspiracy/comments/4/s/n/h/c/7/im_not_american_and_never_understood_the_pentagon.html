       Well, this might not be the right sub to post this, but oh well. Let's see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm Brazilian and the news talk way less more about 9/11 here if compared to the news in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought that much about 9/11 and after having read a few thing online I feel that I don't know the answer to a few questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       What hapenned to the pentagon that day? I mean, the official story. Was it a plane or is it classified?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember reading somewhere that the government didn't release the tapes of the accident for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw some pictures online and (I'm noo expert) it doesn't look like a 737 landed there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the actual official story on this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks.

       Your confusion is perfectly rational.  The officially accepted story is that it was a
       <del>
        747
       </del>
       757.  There were cameras pointed directly at the entry point but that footage has never been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfield, was presumably responsible for our defenses against this terrorist attack which at the time was unforeseen.  He was at the Pentagon, but he was not working or directing our defenses, he was outside the Pentagon helping victims into ambulances.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unclear what actually hit the Pentagon, but that isn't even the most important question.  The real question is why the information about what did happened is being actively obfuscated by our own agencies.

       Edit:  Model # of the fictitious plane.

       How do they react when questioned about this? What is the reason they give not to release the tapes? Maybe they are trying no to give more press to the terrorists?

       There are two basic excuses that are used in these cases of missing footage (and there are many).  "National security" and general incompetence.  Most Americans are happy to accept the incompetence theory but it's a load of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumsfeld was not standing in the front lawn of the Pentagon because he is incompetent, he was in the front lawn because he was complicit.  He had nothing to fear because these "attacks" were not unexpected, and this was a good opportunity for him to be photographed being a "hero."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that in America, demanding answers to these questions has become heavily stigmatized.  If you try to ask the relevant agencies these questions you are met with ridicule rather than information.  Americans were supposed to rally together against a common enemy.  "The inconsistencies in the story are irrelevant and unimportant as long as we face the threat of terrorism."  Anyone with basic familiarity with logic knows that this is a fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       To question these narratives is to be unpatriotic and therefore unamerican, which then makes you no better than the "terrorists."  It is an emotional rebuttal to a valid and rational inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congratulations krink0v, you have seen through the thin veil that is the US government.  You would be a minority here in the States.

       What? Not even a fallacy, straight up bullshit. If they are already admitting that the story has inconsistencies, that's it. Let's take a look at the inconsistencies for god's sake. That's how things (should) work.

       You want to know the 9/11 inconsistency that bugs me the most?
      </p>
      <p>
       The most graphic and unspeakable tragedy surrounding 9/11 is the reports of people seen jumping from the building to avoid the raging fire that weakened the structural integrity of the building causing the pancake style collapse.  Most Americans refuse to even watch the footage because it is just so disturbing and horrifying to imagine that these people preferred falling to their deaths to the hell that was inside the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you push aside this emotional barrier and actually look at the footage, you will discover that the "jumpers" are super human in size.  Some appear to be
       <a href="http://www.septclues.com/SIMCITY/KingKongMan12ftTALL.jpg">
        12 feet tall
       </a>
       based on the dimensions of the windows they are crouching down to climb through.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something that demands explanation for any sane person, but you can't even bring it up. I brought it up to my GF and she became furious that I would be so insensitive.  There is simply nowhere to discuss this discrepancy.  I couldn't even convince her to watch the footage because "I just can't do this right now."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think about it for a second, you realize that either:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) the worlds tallest humans jumped out of the world trade centers that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       b) the footage was prepared in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both possibilities have rather profound implications.  Regardless, there was an active attempt to appeal to American emotion.  Americans no longer know what reality looks like.  In fact, I think if 9/11 did actually happen the way it was described, it may appear "fake" to Americans, so they doctored it to look more in line with expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  I am not trying to draw any conclusions, I am pointing out a discrepancy specifically related to the frame linked in this post.  I do not mean to suggest that no one jumped, or that no one died.

       I read what you wrote but I am very confused. How preparing the footage in advance would render tall people jumping from the building? I don't get the connection. Can't really understand what your point is.

       The problem with conspiracy theories for me is exactly what you said below:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter if it was CGI or not. The buildings went down and it was an inside job
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm more prone to deal with the facts, not with assumptions. In this case, the fact is that the towers went down, the pentagon was hit, the government knows what hit the pentagon and the people don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the facts.

       I'm also more prone to deal with facts. My conclusions are based on facts and inferences I draw from those facts. That's not the same thing as assumptions. I take all the facts I know about what happened on 9/11 and draw inferences from those facts to reach a conclusion such as 'it was an inside job.' Meaning that people at the highest levels of the US military-security complex must have helped to enable it to occur, if they did not plan it themselves. That's not based on an assumption. That's based on drawing an inference from facts. Saying that the government knows what hit the pentagon and the people don't is true, but it's a far cry from saying it was an inside job. And I don't think you can draw an inference from that one fact and say it shows they were in on it.

       Exactly, you can't! But I think there should be an order of things. Priorities. I wouldn't create any theories before seeing the footage. In other words, seeing that footage should be the priority before especulating any further. I mean, what good has a bunch of conspiracy videos done to exposing the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, people are wasting a lot of time creating theories and inferences that aren't always that plausible. It almost looks like they create disctractions from what really matters.

       Sounds like you've never really looked at the evidence. There's lots of it. I didn't mean to imply there is not enough evidence to infer it was an inside job. I just meant the missing Pentagon video is not enough to infer

       I really do understand what you mean, and I'm not arguing that. I just think differently. I don't want to infer anything. I want answers. I won't make them up. I'll sure ask a lot. That's why I think this has to be answered.

       I've entertained the idea that some of those jumpers were dummies. Indeed, some of them looked suspect as their arms and legs just flailed about as if there was zero muscle control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't really come to the conclusion that they were actually dummies. You do see people up there waving and moving around, and they don't look fake. So why risk your life and go up into a soon-to-collapse building just to throw dummies off when there are undoubtedly real people in there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it could be true. Hard to put anything past them nowadays. Honestly, I would have thought this was completely batshit had it not been for the recent psy-ops that are using all sorts of tactics to try to fool people.

       I don't mean to suggest someone ran up there and threw dummies.  I don't even mean to suggest that no one jumped.  I am saying that the frame I linked aired on ABC and it depicts an impossibly large human.  That is a discrepancy.

       I will admit that I don't believe anyone would actually jump from that building by any means necessary. That is cowardly and disgusting.

       I believe this video is about the what you believe shows a discrepancy:

      <p>
       The only conclusion I can draw to the inhumane movements they're making is that it's just low quality footage. It's taken from a very far distance away from where the people are, zoomed in to the maximum. When you zoom it in even more with computer software, you see just how fucked up it looks. Regardless, these are real people. The 100 foot tall people all have to do with perspective.

       This has already been debunked. The people appear to be 100 feet long due to perspective. Once you take events like the Tuskegee College Syphilis experiment and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with American PoVs present (and no government liability nor announcement) you begin to realize that all human life is expansible in order to proceed with the government's goals. Those people you see flailing their arms around like noodles entirely has to do with the camera.

       There are so many better discrepancies with the official story than jumpers being dummies, stop spewing this trash, this is what makes real conspiracy theory look bad, there is plenty of video online of the splattered, liquefied bodies online, please just use your brain.

       The man who made up these theories with the giant man has down syndrome. He made a 3 hour long documentary full of 9/11 conspiracy theories that served as a huge discredit to the truther movement, as they were all debunked. The government is laughing at this guy and anyone who believes him. Using CGI to stage events is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. Why would they use CGI when they can kill real people with real sources? Airplanes are cheap in the grand scheme of things. If it involves oil for example then it's a false flag e.g. the BP Oil Spill. Besides oil, they will use real resources in psyops such as human beings. Besides that there aren't to my knowledge any false flag operations that took place outside America and Europe. In the Middle East they either lie about dropping bombs on terrorists or they actually do drop bombs, but they land on civilians to kill them. Terrorism in the Middle East and Africa is real, unless someone can prove me wrong. There's a reason why you don't have acts of terror in Asia, Central America, Australia, South America, Canada, and much of Africa. The theory that they use CGI is just retarded though.

       I am learning.  The best way to learn something on the internet is to say something incorrect.  I see now that this frame I linked could be an optical illusion.  I am going to look more closely after work.

       You should really pause and ask yourself why your comment, an innocent question, was downvoted to hell. It could be because people thought it was 'stupid' or wrong or whatever. But consider that you may have been brigaded by people who don't want the truth to get out. Here in a supposed community of conspiracy theorists and truth seekers, you are being mocked and scolded for asking legitimate questions. Does it sound to you like the people replying to you and downvoting you are as interested as you are in open debate and free inquiry? Why do they want to stop you from asking questions? Why do they want to stop people from even
       <em>
        seeing
       </em>
       your question? "You shouldn't have told anyone this." WTF? That sounds to me like they have something to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth, in my opinion, was that the imagery we saw on 9/11 was mostly CGI, including the people who allegedly jumped from the towers.  (They weren't dummies, they were CGI; notice how they immediately try to channel your question into a question about dummies.) Now, it may be that perspective does explain the giant jumpers that you mentioned. Though keep in mind that the video someone linked to "proving" that perspective explains the problem used CGI to "prove" it to you. They didn't take a picture at the same height and then from below to show you that it's all perspective. No. They used a computer simulation to show you a projection of the effect of perspective. But if a computer generated the image in the first place, why would you trust a computer to show you an
       <em>
        accurate
       </em>
       rendering of perspective? All you saw as another computer rendering the image and the alleged effect of perspective. It might have rendered correctly; it might not have. I don't have time to follow up on it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that the evidence for CGI on that day is much, much more extensive than just the mystery of the giant men. Don't get me wrong: the towers were demolished that day. But there were no planes. Many will agree that there were no planes at the Pentagon and Shanksville, yet still cling to the belief that there were planes at the WTC. It's hard to believe, indeed, since "we saw it with our own eyes." If you're interested to see how it could have been done, you should have a look at this video:

      <p>
       And don't believe anyone who comes along and tells you that this research has been debunked 100x or anything like that. I suppose a few parts of it have been debunked, but much of it remains decidedly un-debunked and arguable undebunkable. And if you can't debunk all of it, then it's not debunked, despite anyone's assertions to the contrary. It's a good trick: they forcefully assert that it has been debunked 100x or whatever and the work was done by an idiot. Why wouldn't you believe them? But don't take it on faith. Don't take what I say on faith either -- examine the evidence for yourself and use your own power of critical thinking.

      <p>
       Here is a link to the strongest "undebunkable" evidence of CGI and video fakery on 9/11:

      </p>
      <p>
       Finally I'll just point out: at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter if it was CGI or not. The buildings went down and it was an inside job. The causes and consequences of either scenario are more or less the same. When I talk to people about 9/11, I don't even get into this issue of CGI. Convincing people that 9/11 was an inside job is hard enough. First you have to open their minds so they're willing to consider this possibility. Few are, and there are many who try to keep people away from this, as you can see with your downvote brigade.. Why are people so quick to derail any discussion of video fakery and CGI? Well, it opens up a big question: if 9/11 was faked, what
       <em>
        else
       </em>
       has been faked? And the answer to that, it turns out, is a whole hell of a lot. But that's another rabbit hole entirely. If you're interested, I can point you to some links.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Don't let yourself be browbeaten by accusations of trying to divide the 9/11 truth movement. Again, if you're trying to convince people who don't believe 9/11 was an inside job using the CGI argument, it's not the best way IMO to advance the 'movement.' But if you're talking to people who already believe 9/11 was an inside job, then what's wrong with raising legitimate questions? Nothing. But you are being shamed into thinking there is. You are being shamed into not asking questions. The truth is important, and it should be important to you. At the end of the day, that's all that matters. Not the credibility of some movement, but whether you, in your heart of hearts, thinks that you know the truth about what did and did not happen. You don't even have to talk about it with people, if you're worried about damaging a truth movement. But you still might want to know the truth yourself.

       Those are some great links I appreciate your response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have watched the footage myself and it sure as hell looks like CGI was used in most of the footage if not all even if that frame I linked is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also finding that a lot of events that seem to have no reason to be faked actually appear to be CGI.  I am not quite sure why CGI is being used so often and for what purpose but whatever the reason it seems to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>

        this one.

       Are you aware of other examples of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any theory as to why?  Best I can come up with is that they are trying to blur the line between reality and CGI so that people will more readily accept future fakeries as truth.

       I think the frame you linked was CGI or used VFX, even if the specific issue of perspective is moot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, thanks for sending that link. I remembered when that happened. At that time, it never would have occurred to me that that was CGI. Yes, why in the world would they make that up? And all the other stuff, too. It boggles my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think part of it is just to keep us tuned in to the news. What's going to happen next? They have to keep the flood of fake events coming in to keep us hooked into the matrix and distracted. And also fearful. These faked events also increase our underlying sense of insecurity. Keeping us afraid is a key means of controlling us, and this never ending deluge of events helps to keep us in that state of anxiety and fear so they can manipulate us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I think your point about blurring the line between CGI and reality is a good one. At a certain point, they will be able to use CGI to create our reality for us out of whole cloth. Very matrix-y. And very, very few people can even tell the difference. I can't say I'm that good at it, though I'm getting better. When you're plugged into mass media for years and years, it really seems normal. It looks real. Then once you unplug for awhile and come back to it, it seems so much more artificial and, well, stupid. Only in the last few months, after 16+ years of not watching TV, am I only beginning to realize the extent of fakery.
      </p>
      <p>
       That forum, cluesforum.info, has a lot of threads with other examples of video fakery. But before there was video fakery, there was altering photographic evidence of all kinds, not to mention completely fabricated news stories. I am really into the work of Miles Mathis. He has uncovered a ton of fakes and hoaxes and falsehoods and manufactured events stretching way back in history, at least as far back as the Salem Witch trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to his work:

       I recommend starting with his paper in 2013 on Theosophy and the Beat Generation and then working forward through the papers in the order that he writes them, since his later research builds on and refers back to some of the earlier stuff. His writing style is pretty entertaining, and much of it is just mindblowing. In many papers he goes through old photographs and analyzes them, showing how they've been altered.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">
        I wrote a paper on Gandhi
       </a>
       that he published. I also found some weird stuff going on with the photos there. But I recommend reading that paper in order. The context is important. I'm working on a paper now showing how the Dreyfus affair was totally manufactured.

       Holy crap----this is the most dumbest conspiracy  theory I've heard about 9/11 yet. Plain and simple people. Too many people would have had to be used for an inside job of this size. Yet NOBODY has come forward to say they were involved in a cover up of any kind. You cannot keep something of this proportion quiet for too long somebody is going to talk sometime. It's been fifteen years since 9/11, give it up you asshats. Every conspiracytheory has been debunked over and over again.

       I thought your argument was OK up until this part.  That's when you went from sounding somewhat reasonable to pushing a more divisive "fringe" theory. Except Rumsfeld was in his office (I don't know what you're talking about with him being on the lawn).

       FYI, this is incorrect - the government was given specific (e.g., there will be an attack on the WTC) intelligence up to 9 months in advance, and decided not to act.

       Go look up Sibel Edmonds, for one, she was one of the (multiple) people who gave actionable intelligence about the upcoming attack, and was blacklisted for it.

       Are you suggesting that a commercial airliner

        did

       collide with the pentagon?  I don't quite see your point.  It seems a bit pedantic to concern yourself with a single digit in a Boeing model number.

        I can't make a 757 fly 510 knots at sea level (according to official radar data). The wings and tail would break off long before that ever happened.

        You can't fly a 757 at 510 knots less than 50 feet above ground, for an extended period of time, due to the "ground effect".

       They were renovating the Pentagon. So they apparently turned off ALL CAMERAS pointing in that direction. After the "airplane" hit the Pentagon they also confiscated all surveillance photos in private procession, in the area around the Pentagon, as a matter of principle. Not suspicious at all

       No; Not inside the corporate owned mass media. For every day that passes they bury the information deeper and deeper beneath a pile of deceit, lies and misinformation. They are happy to call us conspiracy theorists, fools and idiots, they would rather part with the naturals laws of physics, than admit something is terrible wrong with the official story.

       I mean, I get it that conspiracy theories sound lunatic. I'm actually on the side of the government on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question I'm trying to have an answer to, is this: "Why can't the people have access to the footage of the plane hitting the pentagon?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And my question to you was, isn't there any media looking for an answer to that question?
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't a conspiracy theory. It's not even a theory. It's just a question. I want to see the footage, why can't I?

       Because that would undermine the official narrative 100%. The Pentagon was definitely not hit by an airplane.

       It's not as mystical as you make it sound; more certainty can be acheived through deductive reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In ever war of the 20th century that the U.S. has fought, some means of deception has always been used on the public. 9/11 is no exception. To suggest that no deception was used is inconsistent with a long track record and there is evidence that the pattern has in anyway been changed - the same people are in positions of influence as the other deceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the pentagon, the footage we have is inconsistent with what we know an airplane disaster looks like. However the damage to the pentagon indicates that it was struck by a smaller flying vehicle and a turbine fan was found in the debris.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video evidence was immediately seized (from private sources) which is itself evidence of a coverup. As is the lack of investigation and the announcement of the perpetrator just minutes after the incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the above evidence the only conclusion I can come to is that an element within the government conspired against it's own citizens by firing a missile at the pentagon. It's elementary my dear Mr. krik0v.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course my explanation is simplified, but given what we do know, what other explanation do you think this video evidence might point to?

       Ok fine, don't accept that part of the argument. However, please do explain what happened to the wings when the "plane" hit the building. While you're at it please explain why all private footage was confiscated. There seemed to be no "national security threat" to us all seeing the planes hit the WTC. Also, why would the military headquarters of the United States turn off security cameras on one whole wing due to renovations?? Seems like an enemy could just dress up as a construction worker and do something naughty.

       None of the maneuvers in that video show the plane performing the same ones that are reportedly made during that attack. The biggest issue is that the plane was not close enough to the ground in the beginning. Have you looked at the 3D recreation? It was well below the height that "demonstration" flew.

       Dov Zakheim seems like a prime suspect. He was head honcho of the Pentagon when the billions $$$ went missing. He worked for the DoD. He was a defense contractor who owned the company that developed a Flight Termination System which could take control of a commercial airliner and autopilot it to a destination. He also owned the company that assessed the damages done to the World Trade Center in the 1993 bombing...

       Its notable to look into which department was hit, its the department that is directly related to the trillions missing that Rumsfeld himself proclaimed. There are theories out there that there might have been a whistleblower who had the damning evidence and was ready to release it, but all documentation was destroyed and that person is obviously not around. Dov Zakheim is also mentioned below. There was also alot of interesting tech that was "wiped" from the pentagon hit. The question is not what hit the Pentagon, but why and particular, why that section.

       As far as I know, no pilot has been able to strike the Pentagon in a flight simulator using a comparable flight path and speed of descent. A plane flying that low at 500 MPH is unlikely, and even if it did happen, good luck hitting your target dead-on.

       This was the biggest alarm bell for me on that day. I was 18 at the time. I thought it was odd that something would hit the most powerful building on the planet, yet there was no security footage, or working cameras, or jets sent to intercept anything heading towards that building. It wasn't until many years later that I discovered the reason why no jets were sent, with the whole "is this real world or exercise?" thing. For the longest time, I thought maybe I was strange for thinking it was odd and that maybe I was the only person questioning the whole day. I still don't know what to believe, but I know I don't believe the official story.

       They are afraid to release the footage. They said that they're keeping the footage from the public for "national security". Whether that's a good idea or not all depends upon how you define "national security".

       Indeed! I always worry now when they announce a drill or a police exercise. They're quite common here (UK) My feelings on 7/7 are conflicted too, as I know people affected by it. I suspect there may be more to that too, especially with the drills on the same day!

       When you do even a tiny bit of research about 9/11 you come to realize that the whole thing is so full of contradictions and inaccuracies that it's almost like they  are
       <em>
        daring
       </em>
       the people to question it. Like the schoolyard bully who is just fucking with you because he knows you will take it, or even if you stand up to him, he will still kick your ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think 9/11 was the ultimate culmination of a serious of issues that have plagued the American government and ruling class for many years. So what did 9/11 do for them, exactly? Well, wars are monkey makers for the ruling class. But the problem is that you have to keep justifying your reason for starting or entering a war. And in a world where we know all too well the crazy bullshit from things like Vietnam, the American public is far less likely to support attacking some tiny little country few people could even point out on a map. So we made a war on terror. A war on a concept, not a nation. And we can keep fighting that forever and ever and ever, because you can eventually conquer a nation. You can't conquer a notion. Might as well call it the War on Bad Shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now war never has to end! That really clears up a lot of governmental issues as far as they are concerned. They called for war, put everyone's patriotism into question, and can keep it going indefinitely because we are never fighting a specific nation and we have no real purpose other than to keep fighting. Neverending war. It's been their dream all along.

       Even years after the fact, to question the official 9/11 narrative still is professional/career suicide for any (daring) journalist.

       I, personally, think that's the bigger issue than whether or not the official 9/11 narrative was true or not.

       Sure. Lots of people have questioned it. But it always gets filed under "national security" or just a big "eh what are ya gonna do?" and that's that. There's only so much you can do when the government and the media basically go "shit happens lol" and move onto the next hot topic.

       Nothing.  They blew it up.  Everything is a distraction for the real simple fact, they blew it up and blamed it on a plane that was seen flying over the building and away.

       Who here thinks a plane can travel through that many steel columns and outer walls and still punch a almost perfectly round "exit" hole at the end?  No friggin way.

       The plane approached from the west but hit from the east, meaning it would have had to perform an impossible maneuver, while hitting the lowest floor but not touching the lawn.

       Nations are just a front for the deep state, or the cabal or whatever you want to call TPTB. Intelligence agencies are all connected and work to serve the interests of TPTB. So people in intelligence are really working for the same team. I assume few are aware of what's really going on, and most think they are advancing the "interests of national security" or whatever.

       I don't, that's right. But from your experience, would you say that complex military operations will always go as planned? I'm not talking about grunts, those can and will do whatever you tell them to do. We are comparing Intelligence Agencies from different countries working torwards one goal with Military discipline, I'm not sure how valid that comparison is.

       I didn't mean to imply that they are running these tight operations with a multinational crew of spies. I just meant that they're all working ultimately for the same people, so whether the CIA hires foreigners or not is incidental. Also, I assume that most of the people working at intelligence agencies don't realize what's really going on or aren't part of them. Most of them probably think they're patriots working for national security.

       Pretty sure the official story is that a 747 did some incredible maneuvering to basically fly at ground level into the side of the building.

       Does anybody have any clear footage of the second plane hitting the second WTC tower?
      </p>
      <p>
       The top post of
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       right now has a 9/11 video but every time I see really nice camera footage the second plane is out of sight. This is fair because nobody was expected a second plane at the time but every time I have difficulty finding up close clear footage of the second plane.
      </p>

       If anybody could link me I would be very grateful

       There is lots of clear footage. But when you break it down, you realize that it's all CGI. Even the live footage. The funny part is that many of the shots are doctored to make them appear to be filming from different angles, but they're the same shots that were just cropped and altered. Check it out here:

       Honestly, America will finally wake up when military is going door to door conficating guns. It is blatantly obvious fascism is taking over right now. Martial Law later this month. U.N. occupancy before the end of the year. Election suspended indefinitely. Americans dont see it but freedom is seriously coming to an end here.

       I don't believe it was an airplane at all. If it was wouldn't it have been shot down before it could hit? Or wouldn't they at least have told the airplane they are in restricted air space. And there would be record of them saying that if it ever happened

       So my suspitions were right. I came to this same conclusion:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The real question is why the information about what did happened is being actively obfuscated by our own agencies.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How do they react when questioned about this? What is the reason they give not to release the tapes? Maybe they are trying no to give more press to the terrorists?

       FYI, this is incorrect - the government was given specific (e.g., there will be an attack on the WTC) intelligence up to 9 months in advance, and decided not to act.

      <p>
       Go look up Sibel Edmonds, for one, she was one of the (multiple) people who gave actionable intelligence about the upcoming attack, and was blacklisted for it.
