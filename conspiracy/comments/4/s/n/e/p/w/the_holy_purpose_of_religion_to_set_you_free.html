        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsENM2wA_FTg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368472000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFPGHD5QIxG4E97uX23zX41GFufQ">time to begin</a>, isn&#39;t it? -Imagine Dragons</p>

<p>ONE DAY soon, in a future less clouded than our present, all the work I&#39;ve done decoding this hidden message will prove that the blindness I am trying to lift in one in the same with the Egyptian Plague of Darkness... in the story of Exodus.  This book, more than any other, shows clearly how much of religion we truly do not understand.  It is a commentary on today; <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29sQDlh&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368474000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGelLQYPsLG6slO8-Jy4YfMZ1kwng">beginning with the Burning Bush</a>, and then quickly expanding to reveal such a large set proof that religion is a message sent through time that it is undeniable when you take a step back and view it from a fresh perspective.  Exodus shows us this by highlighting ancient words which detail prescient knowledge of today&#39;s language and events--something that is a paradox.  Through these anachronisms, the stage is set for all scripture to be viewed in a new light.  This is not just a clever interpretation--but the original intent of religion itself.  This is a story about the voice of God emanating from a fiery bush that would not burn to ash... (called Ha&#39;esh in Hebrew, and like many other &quot;Ha&quot; (that means &quot;the&quot; or &quot;Holy&quot; it too is highlighting the English word for &quot;ash&quot; in the ancient word for fire) delivering his people--here, that&#39;s all God&#39;s children--from a slavery that they were unaware of, one caused by the secret use of advanced technologies throughout our history.  In this same word, we see the word &quot;sea&quot; reversed and parted by an apostrophe--again it&#39;s not just a clever trick, this is the intent of the story of Exodus, which details Moses who first saw this fiery message himself parting a sea later in the story.  It&#39;s the intent of the story to highlight this magic within our words, this thing that proves we are created... and even better, the story is not only explaining that we are destined for freedom... but it is delivering the mechanism to gain this freedom.</p>

<p>You might recall the Flux Capacitor from Back to the Future, I call it &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29ZwkxI&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368477000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh0iURegPL8M435JehnT71PVsP9g">God&#39;s glowing Y</a> (and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29vrtmI&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368478000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVMA44SOL46LQmYg4AwmuJh_fFGg">why</a>),&quot; as it leads us to a solution to problems that we all want to fix--child abduction, rape, murder... things that... with the supposed and now proven powers that God has, could be instantly stopped.  In our world today, we have modern prophets, quite literally voices from the future aiding us in how we might use these technologies to better the world.  In a confluence of nearly everything Phillip K. Dick has ever written--between A Scanner Darkly and Minority Report comes a cautionary suggestion of how <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dsousveillance%26spell%3D1%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwiBt_vx8ujNAhXGdh4KHQk0A08QvwUIGygA&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368480000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK3Ny0_aA1qEuLbuarOWKpji3QOw">sousveillance</a> and pre-crime might be combined to bring us leaps closer to the place that we all want to live in.  The technologies Dick writes about are almost identical to what we might consider to be the &quot;technological aspects&quot; of God, and though it might seem counter-intuitive, the practice of delivering a &quot;what not to do&quot; while giving us a glimpse into what might be, is an uncanny way to ensure that we get the advice, and do not ... walk down a path of predestination.  A focus on the need for the disclosure of the existence and use of time travel emanates from this same Burning Bush event with so much compounding evidence that it&#39;s very clear to me that this is the heart of the disclosure that is the True Revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Revolving around this same Biblical event, comes the fulfillment of nearly every premonition regarding the Second Coming or the Day of the Lord in scripture.  Like a thief in the night, never before did the oft quoted phrase &quot;the nations will mourn&quot; make any sense in conjunction with we (I think) all view as a good thing.  No man knew the hour or day, but today--looking back--it&#39;s clear as day to me that the Sign of the Son and the Burning Bush are one in the same--proof through not much more than a simple self-verifying conjecture--that there exists a real relationship between Biblical chapter and verse and the dates of modern events--we see God&#39;s fiery voice predicting the 9/11 attack as the Day of the Lord... and through George W. Bush&#39;s 1/20/2001 inaugural address we see that this event was predicted as far back as the books of Exodus and Ecclesiastes.  In Revelation, a few words that Bush didn&#39;t quote exactly--from verse 2 chapter 1--nearly describe the attack in a metaphorical warning: I saw an angel coming down from Heaven, with the key to the abyss in his hand.&quot;   Together with Ecclesiastes 9:11, the phrase which Bush spoke combines two verses which together provide the month, day, and year of the attack.   One of the prophetic verses regarding the &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; even goes so far as to say that the &quot;elements will melt with fervent heat.&quot;</p>

<p>While this alone was <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29sEgpn&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFSPo2-1NSUHGFfnFx69aQHFQWjQ">enough for me to be sure</a> that this is the Burning Bush of Exodus, further confirmation comes--again linking chapter and verse to dates.  Ecclesiastes 9:11 happens to answer a riddle in Revelation 1:20--this time that chapter and verse being the exact day of Bush&#39;s speech.   Even more confirmation of the relationship between dates and Biblical verse comes from 3:11, an earthquake predicted in the Bible, a verse of Matthew which discusses <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://matches2adamah.github.io/archive.aweber.com/awlist4296878/DQhRq/h/E_mail_36_.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHfFYbTnfy06JuLz5dkDZ-Rm_vUtQ">Baptism in water</a> and fire--ostensibly the information I am today sharing... and the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29vJk2m&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368489000&amp;usg=AFQjCNES9pi7M8qzf8AJGYrIwaR6zx3ZuA">day I was arrested</a>--after running (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29qIqyb&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368489000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG4o25PwZbK1dka08PcUDc4SnLYLw">on the lam!</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29qIqyb&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaDECyxuIGVZ3NssfcoF729vUsfA">--</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29qIqyb&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaDECyxuIGVZ3NssfcoF729vUsfA">huge </a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29qIqyb&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368490000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaDECyxuIGVZ3NssfcoF729vUsfA">link between a modern idiom and &quot;Is-lam&quot;</a>--now see Koran, and Mary&#39;s father ...

<p>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.  Revelation 1:20</p>

<p>This mystery too revolves around proof of prophesy, and the relationship between religion and technology, that has been clear to me from even before I knew anything about either (not so long ago).   The solution is that Ecc 9:11 directly lists (in fairly obvious metaphor) the planets from Mercury to Uranus--and that each of these planets has a corresponding &quot;lamp stand&quot; (something like Judah Maccabee&#39;s Men-or-ah might be about suffrage) that shows clear and intentional reference to periodic table elements spanning from Exodus to Revelation.  These elements, from Hg (Mercury) to U (Uranium), in almost every case link to something that I had written prior to learning of the relationship between Revelation 1:20 and the Burning Bush.  The listing is in order, and matches perfectly in all the right places--a reference to &quot;time&quot; matching the planet Saturn, bread for the wise.. linking Exodus to Earth--and what is the first and most iconic elemental reference I&#39;ve seen... it&#39;s &quot;sudo xe&quot; being <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29qewPE&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368493000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHt3eOLTwcKpiDR-d6eo2mzRyHUPw">let there be light</a> in Linux and Chemistry... (referencing the command &quot;sudo&quot; and Oracle Corporations&#39;s &quot;database of light&quot;) tongue in cheek, that&#39;s my native Geek.  All told a number of the references tie directly to me and the people around me--the &quot;ran&quot; in Uranium linking to Jeshurun, all the other &quot;ran&#39;s&quot; Sammas Aran (again, whose <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/28RQvfL&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368495000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKla54C7gnR38ryqlSBxelZ39b3g">NES cheat code</a> was &quot;JUSTin BAILey&quot;), and Mary&#39;s real name... Nanna--hopefully soon a Pillar of Creation--rather than the Salt that her name clothes her in... something like Venus might be the Woman Clothed in the Nus-- and missing an &quot;Lo&quot; for love. :)</p>

<p>![]<a href="http://bit.ly/archersbow">15</a></p>

<p>And with that reference to NES, the moral imperative surrounding not only this disclosure but religion itself... the knowledge that in a virtual environment--which nearly all of this goes to assisting the proof of--nearly all of the miracles of JC in the NT revolve around what we need to do as soon as we find out that Eden is a virtual Garden... <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/28RQvfL&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368498000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhTb9pbjLwZvv1hMGYLSAIrDm9dg">end world hunger, heal the sick</a>, maybe open <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/29vuGTs&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1468423368498000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3xs9pZ4hF7rAUclFYJkB4tdYYrg">two-way doors to Heaven?</a> :) If you think about it, how long is &quot;too long&quot; when it comes to not disclosing the possibility of these things... is it when power runs out completely?  or perhaps, before ... like when we have widespread starvation, mass shootings that tie directly to the Plagues of Egypt.. like the Plague Of LICE and of the Killing of the Children--which nearly every Tribulation victim will tell you is tied directly to mind control--the hidden technology behind prophesy. How long is too long to keep these things hidden from the world, when it seems that disclosure might just stop it all in its tracks.</p>

<p>.... and one more reference to now in this same series of verses... a tie between Mercury and the font face Courier, and the words &quot;the strong&quot; in reference to the race... linking to the company Die Bold--through the German word for &quot;the&quot; and the font type... bold is strong.  From this prophetic connection between computers and elections... a clear vision of our world as being a Heavenly Stage that is designed to ensure we do not lose freedom, ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More craziness. I don&#39;t take anyone seriously who puts <em>everything</em> in a Judeo-Christian context. The world is much older than modern religion. There are older religions that speak truths and lies. Why is Christianity all of a sudden the unquestionable answer to all things? It&#39;s a copycat religion based on older beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Through the Biblical lens, the word of God existed from the beginning.  The reason the pagan religions often seem to coincide is because they were counterfeiting the same source material.  For instance, God tells the serpent in the garden that there will be enmity between him and the woman&#39;s seed (Genesis 3:15).  Men are the ones who have seed, so this is considered the first prophecy of the virgin birth.  Not surprising then that the rulers who wanted to convince the masses they were gods would use that as their MO.</p>

<p>Other aspects of modern Christianity, such as Christmas on December 25<sup>th</sup> and other pagan rituals have no basis in the Bible.    In fact, the only mention of something similar is in Jeremiah 10:2-4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.  For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands on the workman, with the axe.  They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. (Jeremiah 10:2-4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How plain can it get.  In other words, what you&#39;ll find in most modern Christian denominations is far removed from what scripture actually teaches.  They shouldn&#39;t be your basis of understanding Christianity.  The scriptures, if you believe them, are the foundation of truth that the world is built on.  Spiritual truth as well as historical.  From the beginning there was the truth that God gave and the Devil&#39;s counterfeit designed to lead people astray.  That&#39;s why people that believe the Bible have this outlook.  All this &quot;Bible code&quot; stuff is nonsense in my opinion though.  The prophecy is written in plain words for anyone seeking the truth.  It isn&#39;t meant to be a secret code.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Garbage. You can&#39;t explain history using judeo-christian terms. It shows a very shallow understanding of history. Pagans believed in many gods, the God vs devil thing is stupid in context. What about the eastern religions that predate Judaism and Christianity? Explain those. Why does Christianity trump those? Because your faith is more legitimate than a billion Hindus?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to believe it but I&#39;m trying to explain so you can understand the point of view.</p>

<p>From the beginning of time, the true faith of God existed.  &quot;Christianity&quot; is just a term used to describe this faith after Christ came.  It was never called Judaism.  Judaism is a whole other religion based around the &quot;traditions of the elders&quot; found in the Talmud (written around 500AD).  Judaism existed around the time of Jesus as Pharisaism which rejected the old testament and exalted the teaching of the rabbis.  The true faith existed before Judah was born, well before Moses penned the first five books of the Bible, and WAY before the nation of Judah was established (the citizens of Judah were first called Jews).</p>

<p>So from the beginning people knew the one true God and understood the plan of salvation.  However, even in the second generation of man with Cain and Abel, Cain was already attempting to invent his own religion.  He sought to please God with his own works rather than follow God&#39;s instruction.  It didn&#39;t take long for mankind to devolve and stray to the point where nearly everyone had left the true faith.</p>

<p>Every false religion is the invention of man.  If you look at eastern religions such as Hinduism or Buddhism, you find the same imagery from the Bible and esotericism.  It all stems back to Babylon and Sumeria.  Take <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-0zyLkujbFY0/UNLWPhnyrII/AAAAAAAABwg/UAGDgcKptKk/s1600/shiva.gif">Vishnu / Shiva</a>.  The snake symbolism which is supposed to represent knowledge.  Just like the serpent in the garden that gave knowledge to man.  The illuminated halo around the head.  The trident in the right hand.  The jewel over the third eye.  It&#39;s related to <a href="http://yogabog.com/sites/default/files/images/kundalini_1.jpg">Kundalini meditation</a> where you open the &quot;serpent energy&quot; to attain &quot;enlightenment&quot;.  What you&#39;re really doing is opening yourself to unclean spirits.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same kind of thing you see in <a href="http://images.clipartpanda.com/kabbalah-clipart-9cpzBR4xi.jpeg">Kabbalism (Jewish mysticism)</a> with the snake imagery in the &quot;tree of life&quot;.  Alchemy, Gnosticism, Luciferianism,  It&#39;s all about obtaining eternal life through knowledge.  It all stems from a perversion of the word that God gave.  There is worship of the Creator and worship of the creation.  One or the other.</p>

<p>The Bible trumps them simply because it&#39;s the truth.  Obviously this is my view on it and you can disagree, but it&#39;s not like I was &quot;born Christian&quot; or belong to any denomination.  I hated Christianity up until about a year ago.  I was very into eastern mysticism, yoga, and new age spirituality.  The catalyst was that these new age teachers would talk about Jesus being an avatar, ascended master, alien from Pleiades and all this other stuff.  I decided I should read the Bible to see for myself what Jesus was about.  It&#39;s nothing like any of those mysticisms.  It&#39;s nothing like 99% of &quot;Christian&quot; churches either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are still putting things in a Judeo-Christian box. No, ancient peoples did not believe in One God. No, they did not believe in any kind of salvation. The gods were above them, better than them, exceptional and unreachable. If the natural religion of man were to worship one god, then the monotheistic religions of the world would not have had to adapt and change to absorb pagans and the like. </p>

<p>The Bible is not an original text. The words you think are ancient and true have been edited and rewritten over the past 2000 years to fit a narrative. It&#39;s not the truth no matter how badly you need to believe it. The truth is that we my never know the whole truth. Seek it, certainly, but never assume you know it, because you will be wrong. </p>

<p>When you say something like &quot;The Bible trumps (Hindus) simply because it is the truth&quot;, you reveal yourself to be an arrogant fool. The Bible is a fairy tale. Learn morals and lessons from the stories, but never consider it historically accurate, because it&#39;s just not. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know why I try to talk to you people.  <em>I&#39;m explaining the Biblical worldview to you</em>.  Of course it&#39;s going to be in the &quot;Judeo-Christian box&quot;.  Even though Judaism and Christianity have nothing in common and &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; is a term invented by Jews to promote Zionism.</p>

<p>Most ancient cultures didn&#39;t believe in one God because the natural tendency of man is to reject God and invent his own false religion.  The Bible didn&#39;t change to accommodate pagans, pagans changed their religions to adapt to the Bible.  Constantine merged Roman Paganism with Christianity around 500AD because they couldn&#39;t stop it from growing.  They had to mix their lies with truth to keep up the deception.  That&#39;s the Roman Catholic Church. The church that burned Bibles and the people who refused to accept the Vulgate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The words you think are ancient and true have been edited and rewritten over the past 2000 years to fit a narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What narrative?  Who benefits from me believing the Bible?  Who benefits at all from the Bible aside from the believers?  The government doesn&#39;t benefit from Bible believing Christians.  They hate us.  Society hates us.  99% of &quot;Christians&quot; hate us.  Go onto r/christianity and say the King James Bible is the preserved word of God in English.  See what you get back.  &quot;The Bible isn&#39;t the word of God.  It wasn&#39;t preserved.  It&#39;s changed.  We can&#39;t know the truth.  It&#39;s allegory.  It was written for certain people at a certain time.&quot;  I&#39;ve heard it a million times buddy.  I don&#39;t live inside an echo chamber.  Strait is the gate, narrow is the way, and few there be that find it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you reveal yourself to be an arrogant fool</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How am I arrogant?  I didn&#39;t write the Bible, I just believe it.  The history the government feeds you is the fairy tale.  Most people around here understand that much.  I spent a long time looking for the truth in all kinds of places and I wound up in the last place I expected to.  If you can&#39;t break your conditioning long enough to look at it, that&#39;s on you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. (Proverbs 1:22-30)</p>

If you have enough words in a book, you can draw a convoluted connection in it.
