        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m finally understanding banking. </p>

<p>Federal reserve is a private company who prints money and loans it to the government with interest. Our tax dollars pay the interest. Why doesn&#39;t the gov print money itself? We are paying billions in Interest per year to this company. No company should be printing money. </p>

<p>Then, local banks store your money and then loans it back to the people for interest except that it can loan up to 10x the amount they hold. So, if they have 100 in bank, they send you a credit card for 1000 and you pay back 1500 with all the interest build up. </p>

<p>Basically, these entities give you 10 dollars and take back 15 thereby removing money from the economic pipeline into tax free havens. </p>

<p>Well, of course this will eventually ruin the economy. Remember when only one parent would work, the other parent would watch the kids? We can&#39;t do that now because they jacked all the money over the past 100 years. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t make due with the scraps, you go to jail and/or become homeless. That&#39;s right people, they punish you when you can&#39;t keep up with their demands. </p>

<p>Welcome to the United Slaves of America! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born in the 1940s and I can tell you that life used to be so much easier and everyone was so much happier.  Feminism is a crock, it&#39;s just a way to hide the fact that one income no longer supports a family.  </p>

<p>If I told you what life was like in the US in the 50s and 60s you would weep with despair over what we&#39;ve lost.  There was so much fun!  So many parties, and get-togethers of various kinds.  Technology was extremely limited so people got together in person, face to face.  People were not struggling to survive, so there was time and money and energy for the good things in life.  Very few people were fat, and it wasn&#39;t because we spent long hours at the gym.  People were happy and not seeking gratification from food, since they already had pleasure in their lives.</p>

<p>My dad had only a high school education but supported a wife who didn&#39;t work and 5 kids.  He bought his first house (single family) at age 28.  He came home to a home cooked meal every night, a clean house, the laundry done, the car serviced, etc.  Mom didn&#39;t work and handled all that stuff.  A life like that for a high school graduate -- or even a college graduate -- in 2016 is only a dream.  </p>

<p>Whoa I have never thought of it in that way. That makes total sense. Both people have to work now because they want to drive down the cost of labor, and they frame it like a womens&#39; empowerment issue. Genius marketing there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started in the 40s when all the men were gone for the war and women took up traditionally male occupations. Rosie the riveter made some women want to leave the home. When the men came back from the war they wanted their jobs back but the women didn&#39;t want to leave the workforce. Because of this there was a large surplus of labor in the workforce that made it possible to lower wages. Employers like big business loved it because they now had a large source of cheap labor so naturally they pushed for more of it. Thus modern feminism was born </p>

    <div class="md"><p>all currency is most certainly not fiat.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Fiat money is a currency established as money by government regulation or law</strong>.[1] The term derives from the Latin fiat (&quot;let it become&quot;, &quot;it will become&quot;)[2] <strong>used in the sense of an order or decree</strong>.[1] It differs from commodity money and representative money. <strong>Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver</strong>, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity), while <strong>representative money simply represents a claim on such a good</strong>.[1][3][4]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and what the hell does this accomplish? why the hard on for Gold backed currency with libertarians? How will people enjoy having 100&#39;s of thousands of dollars in paper that would have to be repaid in gold dollars?</p>

<p>What&#39;s the point? </p>

<p>Why, when libertarians say they are concerned with higher order things like peace, do libertarians spend theirs days wanking to the idea of gold money? You can&#39;t get 9/11 prosecuted, you can&#39;t get any false flag prosecuted, your only good presidents get killed without a finger getting lifted, yet you want to change the money? Why? for What purpose? Why the obsession with gold when it&#39;s literally the last of anyone&#39;s troubles?

<p>Most Americans can not wrap their simple minds around this notion and that is the problem.    If it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it mentality but the whole reason the &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve was enacted was to counter a Depression which hasn&#39;t happened ever because Recessions/Depression happen every 7 years or so.   PLUS   the Federal Reserve actually caused the last recession by turning a blind eye to the Big Banks rigging the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was the 1907 Panic that caused a big upset. Then the makers of the central bank came along to the government saying they could prevent any more recessions by enacting this central bank system. The day before Christmas, 1913, The Federal Reserve Act was passed. Then there was the great depression of the 1930s, but the Fed got to stay despite the obvious evidence it didn&#39;t work. Then we got stuck in this status quo, and anyone who opposed it was eliminated from any position of power. And here we are today, with every modern nation in debt to these central banks. So many governments are on the hook, so the banks can basically run the governments. </p>

<p>More money is owed than exists in the first place. That&#39;s the basis of the entire system. It should really be no surprise when no debt is ever forgiven and we just get more and more in debt. It&#39;s a mathematical certainty, regardless of how fiscally responsible a nation is. Then nations seriously in debt can be brought to war to reorganize the world pecking order, if the bankers feel like doing so.</p>

<p>I really wish people would wake up to this game that&#39;s being played on all of us. It&#39;s so obvious and in our faces, but it seems like only 10% of people really have any damn clue</p>

<p>Dude, no.  I like the way this sub looks at things with an open mind, but there is nothing here.  The Board of Governors, the part of it that actually creates money in Washington, DC is a part of the government.  The Reserve Banks that don&#39;t print money are not even owned by their members.  They&#39;re required to have a certain portion of reserves at the regional bank and to have stock, but that isn&#39;t even ownership stock like with a corporation.  </p>

<p>Implying that its done nothing to reduce recessions is unfair.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States">Here</a> is a list of recessions in the US.  Count the total time in the period 1814-1914 and then 1915-2015.  The first period had 37 years, 2 months of recessions while the second had 21 years, 9 months.  A clear improvement, even considering that the second period included the early era before the economic science was fully understood.  </p>

<p>The point stands that the Federal Reserve Open-window lending rate is what determines the rate of creation of new money, and this is set by unelected officials. It largely determines if we have a recession or not, especially as the economy relies on it more and more. Bailouts are money creation. There is plenty here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/recessions-and-the-gold-standard-2010-9">Here</a> is an article that has historical data on recessions in the 1800s.

Actual sources for data in that period are scarce, so if you have your own I&#39;m completely open.  </p>

<p>Money growth and interest rates should be set by unelected officials.  Its a completely technical position that shouldn&#39;t have ties to politics.  Allowing the Board of Governors to be elected would give them an incentive to lower interest rates before elections to give them an advantage at great cost to the economy.  </p>

<p>The last bailout created a lot of new money, but didn&#39;t cause inflation.  Even if it did, inflation at a low level isn&#39;t really a big deal. A small amount of inflation can even be beneficial, and its certainly better to run a small amount of inflation than run an increased risk of deflation.</p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve Banks are not a part of the federal government, but they exist because of an act of Congress. Their purpose is to serve the public. So is the Fed private or public? </p>

<p>The answer is both. While the Board of Governors is an independent government agency, the Federal Reserve Banks are set up like private corporations. Member banks hold stock in the Federal Reserve Banks and earn dividends. Holding this stock does not carry with it the control and financial interest given to holders of common stock in for-profit organizations. The stock may not be sold or pledged as collateral for loans. Member banks also appoint six of the nine members of each Bank&#39;s board of directors. &quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason it&#39;s so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don&#39;t really understand money. Money isn&#39;t wealth. It&#39;s an accounting system to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are &quot;just data.&quot; But that&#39;s what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person&#39;s wants or needs).</p>

<p>To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We&#39;ve had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the &quot;ledger&quot; of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the &quot;accounting entries&quot; in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective.</p>

<p>Enter Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than &quot;modern&quot; digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn&#39;t, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so much that the Federal Reserve is a private company as it is that it is a state-sanctioned institution with more independence than the Treasury. They operate with a magic checkbook (this is literally how it&#39;s taught in college classes) and can alter the monetary base however they want.</p>

<p>The real thieves are the banks who, through their control of the money supply (which is different from the base), are able to charge interest, drawing money away from small businesses (whose owners can&#39;t just issue new shares) and individuals who take out loans or credit card debt. These people lower down the ranks are then forced to take more money from other countries, whose banks are doing the same exact thing, or by taking on more work than would be considered necessary in as strong an economy as the US&#39;s (should people really be working to death? This is already an issue in Japan).</p>

<p>And then, what happens when the gambles the banks take fail? Well, the Federal Reserve can pitch in a couple of trillion of dollars to prop up the banks (<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS#0">here you can see just how much banks have in excess reserves, which is more than they need to be able to give out loans</a>). All of the essentially free money the Federal Reserve is giving away is caught up in the banks, which is a big reason we haven&#39;t seen hyperinflation. If the Fed moves too quickly in raising rates, however, banks may capitalize on that movement and raise their own rates, increasing the capital they&#39;ve already built up. The other direction, negative interest rates, would either force banks to loan that money out to avoid a cost, or allow their money to depreciate. This is the direction other central banks have taken in order to force regular banks to contribute to the economy. This comes with a couple of potential negatives, however.</p>

<p>If you are trying to save money, you buy physical assets. It&#39;s a good idea to buy things that can be easily resold. In the case of loans or debts, you pay them with more or less every spare penny until they are paid. The idea though is to not take any debts at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the prevalence of prepaid cards these days, it&#39;s very easy to live without a bank account. Plenty of places cash payroll checks for a small fee, and hell there&#39;s even a few prepaid cards that offer cash back on purchases. I have quite a few prepaid cards  that I use for paying bills online, and I do keep a fair amount of cash at home. Not under my mattress, but it&#39;s in a secure location. </p>

<p>As another poster said, buying physical assets is another way. I buy quite a bit of physical gold and silver. It&#39;s easier and they fit nicely in my gun safe. </p>

<p>I buy my vehicles in cash. Naturally theyre not new right off the lot, but I generally go within 5 years old or less. There&#39;s paperwork involved when dealing with that amount of cash if you buy from a dealership, so I prefer to stick with private owners. I&#39;ve never had a car payment in my life,(Mid 30&#39;s) and I don&#39;t drive pieces of junk</p>

<p>I guess I should mention that while I don&#39;t use banks for checking or savings, I do have a Roth IRA . Since that could be considered a relationship with a &quot;bank&quot; I should&#39;ve  said I&#39;m 99.9% bank free in life.</p>

<p>I truly believe the u.s. economy cannot sustain itself for much longer, so I diversify the way I keep my &quot;money&quot;. </p>

<p>Guns, metals, and a few other things that will always be liquid , no matter what the economy does. I&#39;m not low income, but my job tends to be more cash than paycheck. I&#39;ve seen the countless number of ways banks fuck people, and long ago I decided I didn&#39;t want any part of that .</p>

<p>If going bank free is something anyone might be considering, please feel free to message me any questions . </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Federal reserve is a private company who prints money and loans it to the government with interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Federal Reserve system includes a federal agency and 12 regional banks, each of which is a separate corporation. There&#39;s a mixture of public and private control.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bonds, so it does indirectly lend money to the federal government, but it&#39;s pre-existing debt. It doesn&#39;t increase the amount that the government owes. Usually the Federal Reserve owns 10-15% of the federal debt. The rest is owned by other parties and individuals.</p>

<p>Since the Federal Reserve owns 10 to 15% of the debt, it gets about 10 to 15% of the interest on the debt. However, it gives almost all its profits to the federal government, so the Fed only received about 2% of net interest on the debt from 1947 to 2007. The other 98% went to the other owners of federal debt.</p>

<p>Since 2007, it has given the government far more than the interest it has received. These are profits from its emergency loan programs and the mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t the gov print money itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main reason is as a guard against devaluation of the money. Independent central banks have a better track record on inflation. The strength of the dollar and the nation&#39;s excellent history in repaying debt has made the United States dollar the leading reserve currency and the US Treasury bond the safest investment in the world. As a result, the US can borrow money at the lowest interest rates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are paying billions in Interest per year to this company. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the Federal Reserve is paying the government tens of billions of dollars. There are billions paid in interest on the federal debt, but that goes overwhelmingly to the <em>other</em> owners of the debt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then, local banks store your money and then loans it back to the people for interest except that it can loan up to 10x the amount they hold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not correct. Banks can loan out about 90% of their deposits. If an extra 100 dollars is added to the money supply, the banks can lend out $90. If that gets redeposited, they can loan up $81 of that. If that continues and you add up all the amounts, it comes to $1000, but that&#39;s not something that any bank sees. To every bank, they always only lend out less than their deposits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, these entities give you 10 dollars and take back 15 thereby removing money from the economic pipeline into tax free havens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, their profits are not that high and I don&#39;t know why you think any significant amount of money goes to tax free havens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, of course this will eventually ruin the economy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that doesn&#39;t follow.</p>
