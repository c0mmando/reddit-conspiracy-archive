       Actually between 2010 and 2014 Chicago's draconian gun laws were one by one found unconstitutional and taken down....Just wanted to preserve accuracy and truth even though I hate Chicago and it's politicians.

       I'm not really sure of the whole reason tbh but I assume the city just stopped giving a fuck about them and assumed gunshot=gang member so it doesn't matter if they die. Vice did a doc about it.

       They are probably breaking several laws by not treating emergency gunshot victims, but given Chicago is a corrupt shithole, they can get away with it. That most of the gunshot victims don't have money or insurance, and the hospital makes no money treating them, is probably closer to the truth as to why these victims don't get treated.

       To be honest, most of them don't care. They're competing within their own gangs to see who can kill the most people and then stunt about it on Instagram. They even do this oblivious to the fact that the feds watch their phones 24/7 and have a database of information they send to each other, ready to incarcerate them with smoking gun evidence as soon as they take action. Most of them don't think they'll make it past 25.

       I'm thankful to God I moved out of that city when I did. I live close enough where when Cabrini Green shutdown, our city got inundated with the folks who lived there. They of course brought their crime and culture with them, and our crime rate skyrocketed. It's a disgusting virus, this mentality, this lifestyle.

       I have been to India, and they are poor as fuck. BUT, they still welcome you into their home for a cup of tea. Not threat to gun you down, no pressure of what I owe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them being poor isn't helping, but it sure isn't the main reason.

       Thanks to rap music, it's releasing negative energy, and influencing these young minds to lead them to the privatized jails.

       I agree that violent rap ( which was engineered to be entertainment for middle class children ) contributes to the problem, but India also uses the hollowed out remains of their caste system &amp; those in the bottom rungs of Indian society have less of a problem with their plight in life than an American who inherited some type of personal liberty &amp; individuality at birth. 
Also I meant poverty not simply being poor, as poverty includes other aspects like violence &amp; mental illness. 
I'd also argue that India doesn't have the gun issues ( sensationalism in film &amp; music &amp; video games) like America, but good luck not getting raped there.

       I would compare Chicago (obviously uptown Chicago with the black population) to Mexico. No business is conducted there unless it's a drug deal. Just walking outside you take a risk with your life. Gangs tote AK47s, AR15s, and pistols with infrared beams. There are no police responding to 911 calls, just like in Mexico. Bodies are left scattered all bloodied up in the street like when a drug syndicate slaughters a whole town in Mexico. Cable companies don't even bother coming to neighborhoods because the police tell them they will get shot at. Police actually drop guns and ammo crates in the streets for gang members to shoot each other and also as a setup so they can arrest them for illegal possession of an unauthorized firearm. Nothing is being done in Chicago and the way their city intends to deal with them is by making them kill each other off in turf war and then incarcerate the ones left that haven't been murdered with multiple life sentences. There are only two destinations for people living in that sector of the city; a prison or a cemetery.

       Not every hospital in Chicago treats trauma patients such as gunshot victims. Particularly in the south side:

       Came here to say this.  Also, I think very very few people who actually live in Chicago really think that "not enough guns" is even in the top three serious problems that the city has.

       To be honest, most of them don't care. They're competing within their own gangs to see who can kill the most people and then stunt about it on Instagram. They even do this oblivious to the fact that the feds watch their phones 24/7 and have a database of information they send to each other, ready to incarcerate them with smoking gun evidence as soon as they take action. Most of them don't think they'll make it past 25.

       I'm thankful to God I moved out of that city when I did. I live close enough where when Cabrini Green shutdown, our city got inundated with the folks who lived there. They of course brought their crime and culture with them, and our crime rate skyrocketed. It's a disgusting virus, this mentality, this lifestyle.
