        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The psy-ops have been plentiful lately, but in earlier manufactured terror events it was clear that no one died. The media just said people died. However, many researchers believe that gays actually got shot up by piggies in Orlando, and that cops really got shot up by angry blacks in Dallas. Any thoughts on whether it was acting or carnage???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very obvious that no one died in Orlando. The story that the media told us was pure fiction and fantasy. Despite there being no footage or pictures of any shooting to this day, I still say that one man could NEVER kill 50 people in a club full of 300 people where theoretically, they would be stacked up like cockroaches. People have said 300 people wouldn&#39;t even fit in a club of that size, but I digress. He shot a grand total of over 100 people. There are 30 rounds in one clip, unless you use a drum clip or an extended magazine. Nothing in the official story indicated he did. It&#39;s not like he managed to shoot 100 people with 4 clips, it&#39;s more likely that he had 6-7. What this means is that he would have to reload 5-6 times. Between this time I honestly think that people could have easily attacked him, if they aren&#39;t that god damn cowardly. I think people could have easily escaped in that time as well, but I guess since they&#39;re gay they&#39;re too scared to fight for their lives (sarcasm)? Whatever, I hope you see why the story of one shooter would never be possible. There is zero proof that any of this happened at all and it&#39;s extremely obvious.</p>

<p>Before I talk about Dallas, notice how with Orlando the media had to interview a plethora of &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; yet with Dallas they haven&#39;t interviewed more than 1 or 2? They had to have countless &quot;eyewitness testimonies&quot; because of the inconceivable lack of any footage that would prove a massacre transpired. </p>

<p>Now as for Dallas, people actually died. It&#39;s still a false flag regardless of people actually dying. Media reports throughout the whole night consistently informed us that there were two shooters. Then the next morning, that number magically drops to one lone gunman. You mean to tell me ONE LONE GUNMAN was sniping police officers from god knows where over a large perimeter, walked all the way downstairs to shoot a police officer with a pistol, and ran into a garage (to get trapped) with his rifle magically materializing after he clearly lost it in the footage of him headshotting the police officer to then be blown up by a robot/drone? Several Dallas police officers have been saying there&#39;s a conspiracy to conceal other shooters and I&#39;ve noticed not a single one of them have been interviewed by the media besides that brainless police chief. There is a blackout of eyewitness testimonies, especially police officers, unlike Orlando. This proves that the event actually happened. The only thing that&#39;s questionable about it is the media&#39;s official story. </p>

<p>So I think I have found an interesting antipode with these two events that also serves as a correlation that proves both events are psyops. There was no footage or live coverage of the event at Orlando, but there were countless eyewitness testimonies. In Dallas there was footage and live coverage of the event, but there are practically no eyewitness testimonies. No footage in Orlando proves that event was a psyop and a blackout of eyewitnesses all stating that there were multiple gunmen  proves Dallas was a psyop. They actually acted out their story this time in an attempt to make it believable, but duped themselves into a paradox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they have died, here in Orlando, I assure you. But you guys will never believe it. I am nothing more than a fellow redditor who lives in Orlando( I know many involved, cops, people who work there, people who buried the dead, friends of friend who were killed, the stockboy at my local Publix who was killed). There may be something larger at work, but whatever it is has no regard for actual human life, and we are all peons at the mercy of that force. I won&#39;t deny that that there may be more to this, but we are meaningless collateral damage to the perpetrator(s), and they actually killed. Who knows what kind of show is put on for the public, but were are hurting here in O-town, for real people that are now gone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha, how poetic. No one died. Prove that someone died. I believe Spongebob made up the same logic once when he said &quot;I knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy, that knew this guy&#39;s cousin&quot;. Well in this case, I&#39;m sure everyone in the country knows people who died.</p>

<p>Gimme a fucking break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without doxxing myself , I cannot give you hard evidence. Sorry, but  people died. What is going on beyond that, I have no clue. These are people who I can drive 5-10 minutes to talk to though, nothing like your horrible spongebob story. One of my friends buried some of these people, as in prepped the bodies. My brother is OPD, I have several friends that worked at Pulse. My friend&#39;s stepbrother died, as well as the kid from Publix who graduated from the high school down the street. It is a shame that you are so jaded, because there are things that don&#39;t make sense to me about all of this, but that is not one of them, and by pushing that false narrative you are discrediting anything worthwhile we might uncover. You are seriously why people make fun of all things conspiracy or tinfoil. You are a complete living caricature of a conspiracy nut. Come to Orlando ,and I can introduce you to people who lost people, and first responders who were there. Good luck with your critical thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is NO proof that any shooting transpired, no matter what angle you look at it. I used to think that CIA just came in to kill everyone then used Omar Mateen as a patsy, but it soon became very obvious that no one died. I honestly could care less if you knew all 50 victims of the Pulse night club shooting, no one died and no shooting took place. If I am to believe what you&#39;re saying even has a shred of truth, there is at least one way you could prove it, but you can&#39;t. Coincidentally, no one else can either. Keep telling that old wive&#39;s tale you agent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brainwashed by who? By my own brain? I chose this route with common sense. Something most people in this country clearly don&#39;t have. I could care less about what you say, maybe everyone you know is lying to you because NO ONE died in this event. You are most likely lying but you know what, go ahead and dox yourself, which is what you recommend. Why the hell would I care about where you live, who you are, or anyone else for that matter? You are lying and you are an agent, you know what, you&#39;re probably one of those crisis actors. That&#39;s probably how you found this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Says the reddit user for one month. Look at my post history, I have nothing to hide. Proud Orlando resident, here, and you are full of shit. Good luck with that. The simplest answer (Occam&#39;s razor) is usually correct. MY people died, and I would love to know more about what really happened, but they really are not coming back. If this ever happens to you and your people you will understand the frustration of somebody saying nobody died. I want these people back and they aren&#39;t coming back. It hurts. Piss off douche. And good luck being that gullible the rest of your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Orlando really happened, then the crime scene and perimeter shown on all news video was not the real crime scene and perimeter. What was shown bore no resemblance to the reality of any such thing. Numerous professionals from different disciplines have pointed out lists of obvious points, any one of which might cast grave suspicion on the authenticity of the video. Taken together, these critiques show decisively that we are looking at a fake, staged crime scene, and poorly done at that. </p>

<p>This raises questions. If a real shooting happened, how would the authorities stage this fake scene while responding to the real one? And why? </p>

<p>I have no idea. But there is a lot about all this that I can&#39;t explain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you that serious? It would seem that no amount of proof is possible then. You have a presuppositional position and you can&#39;t possibly think rationally that it could be anything else to explain. That&#39;s very sad.
