        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of us are well aware of the privacy concerns associated with the new app, and the subject has been posted many times here.</p>

<p>While those clearly bother me, there is something a little more unnerving.</p>

<p>In defense of the game, I keep hearing people say, &quot;But it gets us outside. It gets kids moving!&quot;</p>

<p>Are we now at this point in society where we are so bored of reality, nature, and our surroundings? Are we now at the point that in order to enjoy the world, it must be in a form of virtual reality? </p>

<p>This disturbs me greatly. </p>

<p>I am rereading Brave New World because I want to get a sense and understanding of the people and our world today. In chapter 2, they shock the babies at the same time they expose them to flowers. It explains that this is done so that the children will intrinsically and unknowingly  detest nature.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;ll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an &#39;instinctive&#39; hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They&#39;ll be safe from books and botany all their lives.&quot; The Director turned to his nurses. &quot;Take them away again.&quot; (p. 26).</p>

<p>Ultimately, we are becoming more disconnected with nature to the point where nature itself does not feel natural. Polluted cities, muted sunsets, and toxic water sources are just glimpses into today&#39;s world. </p>

<p>I did not notice any of this until I moved to the Southwest. The untouched beauty of the landscapes is therapy in and of itself. I spend a lot of time hiking, photographing, biking, and running through the landscapes. Pokémon is no motivation for me here.</p>

<p>Yet, people now need some imaginary creature to get them out of their houses? 
What does that say about our reality?</p>

<p>It also leads to my final point. Are we being entertained to death?</p>

<p>In a reply to something I wrote on social media, my &quot;friend&quot; said, &quot;Well, is there an age limit on fun?&quot;</p>

<p>Of course not, but her question did get me thinking. When fun and entertainment become the ultimate goal of all we do, then perhaps there should be some sort of limit. I often feel my generation is constantly trying to relive their childhoods, and we have yet to accept the full reality of being adults. I don&#39;t think that means adults cannot have fun. Rather, when have other aspects of adulthood, such as seeking knowledge and meaning, become so undervalued? Why can&#39;t, at the very least, knowledge and entertainment coincide toward some type of progress in our society?</p>

<p>That&#39;s definitely not what is happening. How many hours a day do adults (not children or teens) now spend being entertained, whether that be watching Netflix, browsing meaningless Reddit posts, watching cat videos, partying, going out eat, going to the movies (if people even leave their houses anymore), or playing games on their smart phones? </p>

<p>Am I against these things? No! But where is there room for thought?</p>

<p>Have we been so disconnected from our instincts and nature that we must do anything to distract ourselves?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I blame people. A few years ago, I went back to the lake I grew up around, and the water had been poisoned.
Perhaps a Pokémon chase might have distracted me from the sad reality, even if for a moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like a lot of people can&#39;t afford the time and energy to devote to seeking, &quot;knowledge and meaning.&quot; Working 9-5 and having weekends off means you spend the peak hours of your days and the majority of your week at work. People try to cram all of the &quot;fun,&quot; they can on the weekends, and binge on entertainment when they&#39;re at home. It&#39;s even worse if you don&#39;t have a routine schedule to rely on. Also consider many don&#39;t make a living wage and are up to their eyeballs in debt.</p>

<p>Our lifestyle, our culture, and our society is killing us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long ago it was learned that you can put up a wall for your enemies, but they will plan and undermine you and eventually make it past that barrier.</p>

<p>What better than to take what you know will become your enemy and enslave it? The kicker is, if you go around to all the slaves and call it slavery, the majority of them will mock you and point out all the reasons you couldn&#39;t possibly be right, all the while ignoring a few key major facts, that prove you right.</p>

<p>An enemy can plan and attack. A slave can plan and attack, but only after working all day otherwise they will be left with no position on which to bargain with the fellow slaves. Ergo, the rich and powerful Network have a much larger voice, and understandably so. All they do is sit and plan. It is in their blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why you find cheaper land, and learn to build a house from raw materials. You can even find free land if you look hard enough. </p>

<p>I can easily find land for less than 5000, but it&#39;s going to be without a road or utilities. </p>

<p>To pay the tax, you can easily make that money from selling home made stuff, or by doing gigs in town. </p>

<p>For cheap, propane could fuel the house. </p>

<p>Raising cows and some farming could easily pay for it all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but there are guideline on how to keep livestock, and farm. Which you need to pay for the feed for the animals.</p>

<p>Not unless you use crazy amounts of space for grass feeding. Keep in mind that would also cut down on the area you have for farming your own food, like beans, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe, you could do it, but Livestock isn&#39;t a gold mine, and most often the costs of raising an animal in any sort of profitable manner, have to be covered by subsidy. So you&#39;d need the state in some capacity to compete, meaning earn money.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you had more land it would be doable, if you also did some tourism thing, back to the roots nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of land in Nevada, Utah, Arizona for less than 5k. Its not hard to find something really nice, with a creek nearby and trees for less than 10k. </p>

<p>You can get free land in Alaska or Kentucky, among other places. You can see why they&#39;re free though. </p>

<p>Best way to do it, is buy a small piece of land, develop it, build a road for it, make some money farming on it, and then with the money you earn from that land, buy some better land you&#39;d set your home on. Any land above Oregon but below Canada is going to be perfect homestead land, but will cost more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nevada, Utah, and Arizona are very tough places for growing crops.. What you&#39;re describing wouldn&#39;t cost just 5k-10k. Developing said land, paying property taxes, building said road.. All the while having a reserve of money to survive on while risking it all, because crops do fail even in ideal growing climates..</p>

<p>Are you speaking from direct experience or know someone who&#39;s done this?</p>

<p>EDIT: Not to mention, if I&#39;m farming land in those states I&#39;m going to need a source of water and an irrigation system, possibly even shading hardware for heat waves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do a lot with 5k, you can find an acre of land somewhere, make a greenhouse, and make a canvas hut for yourself. It&#39;s all about being frugal, and digging for deals.  </p>

<p>With 15k for land, you can find wonderful places with roads already in place, and utilities ready to hook up. There&#39;s a bit more cost involved, but you can use that land to make money to pay for everything. It&#39;s work, lots of work. </p>

<p>All sorts of things you could do with that land to make money from. YouTube is riddled with videos of in demand crops. If you lived in a weed legal state, you could even grow weed for money. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a quick scheme by any measures, it would take the average person at least a few years of saving and investing, and then even more time developing. Real time, real money, real work to make it happen. </p>

<p>All just suggestions to have a greater amount of freedom in a system where everything is owned and taxed. More research into the matter is definitely needed if you want to do this. </p>

<p>Then get slapped with a notice of unlawful structures because your &quot;frugality,&quot; doesn&#39;t fall into the confines of legality.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, what you&#39;re saying sounds fantastic, but it&#39;s totally unrealistic and poorly thought-out. Water, irrigation, food, electricity, tools, hardware, materials, transportation, permits, insurance, taxes, healthcare, emergency funds.. Plus more considerations I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m forgetting. Even 15k would barely cut it and it&#39;s a huge risk to someone who would lose literally everything if it failed.</p>

<p>You&#39;re totally disregarding the realistic aspects I pointed out in my last post.. You also failed to answer my question, <strong>&quot;Are you speaking from direct experience or know someone who&#39;s done this?&quot;</strong></p>

I didn&#39;t do the math for it all, and yes I know someone who bought some land for 11k, developed his own road and built his cabin for all less than 2k, and I personally helped him develop it, like set up water pumps, create a root cellar, set up satellite tv. He could have easily turned his land into cash crops. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not full of shit.</p>

<p>I said it would be real work, with real time. I gave approximate estimations to get started, there are little tricks, and ways to save money.</p>

<p>No reason to be shitty with someone spitballing ideas. I was clearly nice and not combative, and told you I was just spitballing, and your shit personality shined through. </p>

<p>There have been thousands of apps to get people moving and getting out there. Technology does not have to necessarily take away from nature.</p>

<p>And while I don&#39;t really care if people play the game, it&#39;s just another phase until people get bored again.</p>

<p>Because we cannot be entertained forever at every second. Sometimes it&#39;s OK to take a walk and be bored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be fare in nature humanity lives in incest, and tribes kill each other off, and fracture over who get&#39;s to eat what/rape who.</p>

<p>In nature everyone is a whore, a thief, and the worst kind of brigand combined, because that&#39;s what it takes not just to survive, but to breed.</p>

<p>Cities are where humans become anything, but merciless animals, because we gain the genetic diversity to raise our IQ above 70 on average.</p>

<p>By the way that&#39;s why the fans of population reduction dig nature, and people being in it so much, because they consider it being a measured punishment for being human.</p>

<p>Nature which is real, as in a primordial forest, a swamp, an unexplored tundra usually kills of most of the people in it in a year unless they have been bred like dogs to subsist there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s beautiful, but any real genuine human being is a foreigner to it, and nature is xenophobic.</p>

<p>No humanity is cruel, and the argument that humans eat animals, and that it&#39;s hypocritical is insane. People cannibalize each other at opportunity. Humans will eat anything, if there is an incentive like not starving to death.</p>

<p>We ate our unwanted babies in the stone age, who eats a baby eats all. We were never &quot;in harmony&quot; with anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, kids are missing out on a lot of nature. But I feel it also has to do with the fact that they&#39;re not allowed to explore anything. Everything&#39;s mapped out, they&#39;re being told that it&#39;s dangerous to be outside, etc. I don&#39;t see many issues with the game, I keep AR off since it doesn&#39;t even work on my phone, I&#39;m still aware of my surroundings. I myself really enjoy nature, though. I can never get enough of wandering around the park exploring.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re being &quot;entertained to death&quot; I think we are being worked to death and are looking for an escape from the stresses American living presents. For a lot of people &quot;just going outside&quot; is important but it isn&#39;t something they might instinctively seek out as entertainment (I agree this is a problem). </p>

<p>But I have to say, sitting at a desk, doing a 9-5 job (which is really 7:30-6:30 with commute) is exhausting and I&#39;m just grateful to be home. I don&#39;t feel like <em>leaving</em> again. And weekends being for &quot;relaxing&quot; is a sham. Weekends are for doing all the things I can&#39;t do because I&#39;m crammed in an office most of my waking hours during the week. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m lucky enough to only need <em>one</em> job.</p>

<p>In short, we&#39;re all stressed out and over-worked. We seek escape from this, not from nature and books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, very thoughtful.  You touched on a few things I&#39;ve often wondered about before, particularly what you mentioned about the way we&#39;ve become distant, and in a weird way almost contemptuous, towards nature.  This aversion to nature as a society in general is in of itself unnatural. I don&#39;t pretend to know with absolute certainty what all the reasons for this might be, but it&#39;s likely as a result of several dynamics, some more artificial than others: </p>

<p>Some of it may extend from basic psychology, namely that we Humans often tend to take what is familiar for granted. People in Canada where I live, for example, always complain about winter and everything it brings.  The general perception being that the snow and cold make everything seem bleak and harsh, and everyone rants incessantly about how they can&#39;t wait for spring, etc.  However, whenever someone visits this country during those winter months from somewhere with a radically different climate, the first thing they typically exclaim is how beautiful and otherworldly it is to behold.  Granted, they will still find the cold to be punitive, but the beauty of the transformed landscape is not lost on them like it is for those of us that live here.  </p>

<p>Secondly, I believe some of our boredom with the natural world around us is by design.  That is to say, there are those who would have much to gain by separating us, as a society, from nature.  Our connection to the natural world, since our humble beginnings as a species, has always been at the core of our identity.  It is only in the last few hundred years that the majority of us have moved into large cities, the boundaries of which act as a sort of barrier between the urban world and nature itself.   So, who would gain from eroding our collective identity? Anyone who wanted to control and shape who we are to become in the future.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new identity, the old one must first be torn down, else the two will always conflict with one another.  A key part of this process is isolation from any connections to the past identity.  This has been used countless times on individuals/groups throughout history and is typically referred to as &#39;brainwashing&#39;; you break down the individuals belief structure and willingness to associate with their previous identity, resulting in the creation of a void which can then at a later point be filled with a new set of beliefs.  </p>

<p>A society that has lost all connection to it&#39;s past identity, left with nothing solid to anchor itself to, is going to be much easier to steer in a desired direction.   Once a new direction has been chosen, or new belief structure implanted, collectivism, i.e &quot;group think&quot; can be fostered in order to cement the recently created collective identity, preventing any possibility of dissent or introspection from manifesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say it is altogether lost as of this point, as many people still love nature and the great outdoors with a passion, and will likely pass on that love to their children.  But it&#39;s an uphill battle, as each new generation seems to be increasingly enamored with the high-tech modern lifestyle. Combine that with the continuing trend of people moving into urban settings from rural ones for the sake of convenience and it&#39;s not hard to see which way things are going.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Indigenous People&#39;s, environmental/conservation groups, and even conspiracy theorist types like you and me (who, because of our affinity for disobedience and reluctance to conform to societal trends) will always act as a type of fortified bastion against the process of separation from nature.   Because of this, the connection will probably never die completely, although it could be reduced to something almost trivial in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The disconnection from nature stems from the fact that our immediate environment serves to remind us of our existence as slaves to a capitalist system. The nature outside our door is absent of beauty because it is the nature outside our door. It&#39;s what we see on our way to work, it&#39;s the vista of our depression. This is why as tourists our appreciation of nature is actually present, a foreign location has none of the miserable baggage we have subconsciously assigned to our own surroundings. </p>

<p>The appeal of games in general is escapism. That&#39;s the appeal of nearly all entertainment. We desperately want to be removed from our current condition because it offers us nothing nurturing, and so we seek to self medicate. </p>

<p>What does almost all entertainment have in common? The theme of growth and change. In television our intrepid heroes embark on a journey where they change the world or their place in it and usually against seemingly insurmountable odds. In video games we are given a world that responds to our touch and intentions. In reality everyday is exactly the same and the biggest indicator for where we&#39;re going is where we started. No wonder we have a need to be pacified.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Great point. People also engage in &quot;mental tourism&quot; by using mind-altering substances as a way of clearing some of the miserable mental baggage that has accumulated over the years and seeing the same vistas with a fresh perspective.</p>

<p>I also appreciate how you make a contrast between the &quot;hero&#39;s adventure&quot; so common in entertainment, with the banality of modern life. Have you ever left a movie theatre thinking &quot;that&#39;s it .. I&#39;m tired of being stuck in this rut ... I&#39;m going to change my life&quot;, only to fall back into the same rut within days or weeks of leaving the theatre? I have - too many times.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so sad that we adore stories about people who take charge and change their world, yet seem so helpless in the face of what seems to be an uncaring world.</p>

<p>Yes, the siren song of VR/AR/a cyber Nirvana has again gained traction, after it imploded due it&#39;s promised and not delivered boom in the 90s. And even now the technology is still not ther yet, not really affordable, many issues regarding security and social mores.</p>

<p>But as the point you make in passing shows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I went back to the lake I grew up around, and the water had been poisoned. Perhaps a Pokémon chase might have distracted me from the sad reality, even if for a moment.</p>

<p>guess those in power will have to push for streamlined, consumer-available VR to become the new soma as the actual reality is getting quite bleak.  I take it you have seen the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror_(TV_series">Black Mirror series?</a>) It deals with many of the traps that technology/VR/the ubiquitous net will haunt us and our progeny.</p>

<p>What to do? Resist the lure for a cheap thrill that deadens us to what&#39;s in front of us. Yes it can be just another toy, but just as drugs, addictive personalities under stress from real life will fall into downward spirals. Inform those dear to us, those around us of the dangers of these fads. And this is not going even into the dodgy details about who is deploying this &#39;game&#39; and to what ends ultimately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might wish that everyone could experience those beautiful hikes, but the reality is that society is just such a massive blob of selfish desire that it ruins everything it touches. It has been that way since our ancestors spoiled their environments. Its also a recurring theme in many origin stories in the middle east, and seems to coincide with our species slow transition from &quot;paradise&quot; to the cities of today. </p>

<p>As far as Pokemon Go&#39;s concerned. Its a viral marketing scheme to get data-aggregating software into the hands of users. Unless we fight to not progress, our technology will consume us. And our technology should not be viewed as this inanimate thing, but we should consider it as part of our ecosystem.</p>

<p>Much like our ancestors changed the dynamic between humans and other animals, developing into tribal communities completely changed how our species gathered and competed for resources, AI/autonomous-technology will alter our economies and we will be like the animals of the prairies. Either you will succumb to the financial/social/physical pressures of this new age or you will either by elimated by competition/force or be driven out. Or scavange. Can&#39;t forget all the animals who&#39;ve learned to live off our shit. </p>

That someone must have been pushing it into the hands of media tycoons. And that costs big money, besides it needs connections a lot of high level connections. Which i highly doubt an gamestudio has. </p>

<p>Be honest, who told you first your friends or did the internet tell you about this game? I&#39;m pretty sure i know the answer to that who was first bringing you the &quot;news&quot; about this particular game.</p>

<p>For all i know it&#39;s a gigantic mobile surveillance camera. For now i would stay the fuck away from that cute little app</p>

<p>How much would airtime cost while super bowl?
Would an relatively small game publisher have those kind of cashflow? It&#39;s not EA /Ubisoft powerhouse league.</p>

<p>Maybe everything is legit and nothing to worry about, but for now.. I&#39;m staying on the side lines
I&#39;ll observe for a while. I myself have to admit I&#39;m curious about that game, would have tried it day 1 if my gut feeling didn&#39;t restrain me that day form downloading it. I try to always listen to my  gut feeling since often it saved me from some form of trouble</p>

I agree, the beauty of nature shouldnt be something you only experience as a byproduct of a mindless game, it&#39;s like no one even considered that they could just go outside at any time. Another thing i notice in games is that many of them are giving people validation without requiring they do any real thinking or experience difficulty. &quot;Walk over here, do this, do that...yay! You did it!&quot; While there are still games like dark souls, many have no challenge, no drawback to dying, they are movies that merely ask you to push a button or two now and again to continue the immersive experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parents have traditionally got kids outside and moving with sports like baseball and football, games which are both competitive and organized. Most games involve competition, (keeps it exciting and challenging), but not all games involve organized teams. AFAIK, Pokemon Go does not.</p>

<p>Nor is there a &quot;coach&quot; or &quot;referee&quot; present. There&#39;s no need for an enforcer of rules. The organization of the game emerges from the software running on a hunk of silicon. The software contains the rules. There&#39;s no authority figure physically present who organizes the game. The players&#39; individual actions and interactions are more the focus of the game, compared to team sports, where the focus is dominated by &quot;coaches&quot; and &quot;team&quot;.</p>

<p>Top-down social structures dividing people into &quot;teams&quot; are really easy vectors for evil to emerge into this world (ref: war, racism, genocide, police corruption, <em>conspiracies</em>, etc.). This sub is filled with people who are aware of this and thus skeptical of authority. I would think that most of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would recognize the value of a game which is active, social, individualistic, and based on rules (i.e. <em>laws</em>) which are well-nigh impossible to break.</p>

<p>You could worry about the atomizing and impersonal nature of the game structure, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem. Players report that they are meeting others. They meet each other face-to-face, and share presence, with the social awkwardness inherent in any meeting defused by their involvement in the game. That&#39;s a positive.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s true that people are entertaining themselves way beyond what&#39;s needed these days. But it&#39;s also true that healthy game play is an essential part of emotional development. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital">Here&#39;s a TED talk about this</a>. Did you know that a disproportionate amount of prisoners grew up lacking play? I wouldn&#39;t doubt that many of the evil grey suit wearing elite psychopaths who cause so much evil and suffering in the world, grew up not having satisfying interactive play. Now that they&#39;re all grown up, they&#39;re <em>serious</em>. Serious about exploiting others without conscience. Serious about putting money and power before life and human values.</p>

<p>The social aspect of Pokemon Go is net positive, IMHO. Worries about the surveillance device which people use the play the game (a.k.a. &quot;smart phone&quot;) are still valid, but those worries are <em>always</em> valid, with or without this game. </p>

<p>EDIT: for clarity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, great point!</p>

<p>I am not against play. In fact, I feel kids need more of it. I also hated team sports in school, though I was very athletic. There needs to be outlets for everybody, or every ability, of every age.</p>

<p>I think my view is that adults (not including kids and teens at all) only use their free time now for entertainment. Deep thought seems to just stop at a certain age, and I feel technology may be behind this. Because with technology, people often think they are thinking deeply, but in reality, they are just in echo chambers.</p>

<p>With that being said, I definitely agree that play is important for all, all age levels.</p>

Take kids at an age young enough where their future isn&#39;t decided yet, and then systematically take away all of their free time by putting them in schools that intentionally teach nothing followed by time filling extracurriculars (which are often mandatory) followed by repetitive homework followed by sleep and then the cycle repeats - and then it repeats for years and years.</p>

<p>When did those kids have time to themselves? Much less time to think about things free of imposed garbage that they are &quot;supposed to&quot; think about? By the time that 5 year old turns 18, it&#39;s already too late, their brains have adapted during adolescence.</p>

<p>Technology isn&#39;t behind that, and in fact I would argue that it has the exact opposite effect, because having things such as personal cell phones and widely available internet access allows those same kids to run their own parallel life simultaneous to the mind-numbing one they&#39;re forced to be a part of.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t look at the people whose lives are filled with pure entertainment, they were always going to be like that. There are also people at the opposite end of the spectrum, the innocently incorruptible ones who also don&#39;t represent the average person. The middle chunk of people is where the impact happens, though. I believe there is a substantial number of people who have been &quot;saved&quot; from this cycle due to mental stimulation they encountered on the internet. </p>

<p>People need play that isn&#39;t competitive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that only a minority of people are capable of enjoying non-competitive play.</p>

<p>A lot of what play is all about (especially evident in other animals&#39; play) is assuaging instinctual fears. Puppies and kittens play fight each other, and it&#39;s all cute and adorable, but it&#39;s also about violence - biting and scratching, hiding and pouncing, outrunning, and so on. It gives them a chance to &quot;rehearse&quot; for real challenges that they will have to face in order to survive. That makes it mutually beneficial, so simply engaging in play signals that there is good will between them. Meanwhile, the feigned violence reinforces social norms by signaling: &quot;I could hurt you, but I&#39;m not going to.&quot; All these ideas are out of that TED video about play, by the way.</p>

<p>Non-competitive play probably appeals only to deep thinkers, meditators, and spiritually-focused sorts. Or, sadly, those who have a difficult time with aggression, real or feigned.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if kids play dodgeball in school any more. When I went to a Catholic middle school way back in the 70s, I was forced to play dodgeball during gym class. There&#39;s nothing like getting hit in the face with a somewhat deflated bag of pinkish rubber, especially while wearing glasses.  I remember thinking that it was so outrageously hypocritical that a &quot;Christian&quot; organization would organize such a blatantly violent game with such a potential for serious physical expressions of hostility.</p>

<p>How you expect you need to develop in order to deal with the society you&#39;ve been fated to live within is going to have a lot to do with how you structure your play. That&#39;s why some kids like more nerdy games, while others like more &quot;primal&quot; stuff. It all depends on how they see life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I did not notice any of this until I moved to the Southwest. The untouched beauty of the landscapes is therapy in and of itself. I spend a lot of time hiking, photographing, biking, and running through the landscapes&quot;</p>

<p>To play devil&#39;s advocate, would the untouched beauty still exist if you simply increased the location population number to 10 million? </p>

<p>An aspect that many people do not consider when talking about human ancestors having strong ties with nature and being one with it was that our numbers were much much lower than they have been in the past centuries. We could use the resources of nature aware that it would be unlikely for us to deplete or destroy them. With 7+ billion humans, simple things like hunting in the forest can wreck ecosystems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Numbers are definitely lower.</p>

<p>But we&#39;ve been deceived to believe that we can not still build beautiful, resourceful places that coexist with nature.</p>

<p>Idealistic? Absolutely. Can it be done? I It could.</p>

<p>This goes into even deeper things though. If humans have no respect for nature, will they build their world in a way that respects it?</p>

<p>Out here people dump trash everywhere. It&#39;s disturbing and sad. There aren&#39;t many people, but they sure find a way not to appreciate it.</p>

<p>There are so many people on this earth that want to break everything down into a dichotomy where it&#39;s either this OR that....never AND.  We don&#39;t have to have either nature or pokemon.  We can have both.</p>

<p>Some more examples:  </p>

<ul>
<li>VHS or Betamax</li>
<li>Blu-Ray or HDDVD</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the confusion - let me clarify.</p>

<p>You said:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There should be a way for nature and technology to coexist...to not take away from one another.  </p>

<p>For example, I&#39;ve seen geologists have people post Instagram pics of locations to field their research. That&#39;s awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So at this point it appeared to me that we were in agreement on Tech and Nature co-existing.  </p>

<p>Then you said:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is I feel this type of thing is few and far between, partly because most people don&#39;t reflect on it at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I read that as what you&#39;re really opposed to is when tech doesn&#39;t directly support nature.  Which to me is just a different form of tech and nature co-existing than the form of Pokemon.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m objecting to technology overriding nature, but even that isn&#39;t the main point of my post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is YOUR interpretation and one that can be changed.  It&#39;s not an objective truth, it&#39;s not a dichotomy as you&#39;re trying to frame it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really, it&#39;s about the fact that we&#39;ve stopped thinking of the implications of technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok well I don&#39;t agree here at all.  We&#39;re constantly faced with the implications of technology.  EVERYONE talks about spending too much time on Facebook, too much time on Reddit, how we all thought computers were supposed to make life easier but now all we do is spend time on computers.  Most everyone already admits this but we&#39;re too tied in.</p>

<p>Like I said, it doesn&#39;t have to be either/or, we can be an AND society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in a more balanced view I&#39;d say if technology is going to exist, then it might as well be with nature.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&#39;s why there are societies who do not want technology at all.</p>

<p>And I guess we might have different circles. People don&#39;t talk about it much where I am. However I do see people talking about it on a larger scale, as if it&#39;s a problem. I don&#39;t see as much about long-term implications from the mass majority of citizens. I mean there&#39;s a general acceptance of all things technology.

</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s the problem, nature refers to everything that is natural <em>except for humans</em>. it implies humans aren&#39;t a part of nature, which is complete bullshit. without religious dogma people would never come to such a stupid conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that wasn&#39;t the case &quot;nature&quot; would simply refer to everything and wouldn&#39;t mean much. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>if it refers to everything it means everything, it doesn&#39;t lose any meaning and it&#39;s fundamental value stays the same.</p>

<p>nature is evolving and it&#39;s not going to stop. if you don&#39;t want to be a part of that go live in the forest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for writing that it&#39;s very insightful.
Since you&#39;re posting in conspiracy, I&#39;ll address it in that context.
Almost everything on the Internet is monetized, I don&#39;t think there are sinister forces at play unless you think converting eyeballs to money is sinister.
I think Marx said that religion is the opiate of the masses, I think that has passed and entertainment has replaced religion in that capacity, at least in developed countries.
Is that a good thing or a bad question? I don&#39;t think I&#39;m qualified enough to make that judgement.
But at least for the time being we are all free to travel any path you want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind how much entertainment we have now. It&#39;s never ending. There was never as much entertainment present as there is now. This entertainment comes at a cost. Between cell phones, Internet and cable access, Netflix accounts etc people are blowing up to 1/5 of their monthly salary on entertainment. It is a drug and I think people were at once on an incredible high from this drug but now we are bored of it but don&#39;t know how else to entertain ourselves as a society. I believe nature and fun away from technology is the key but I think most other people my age (25-30) haven&#39;t got a clue!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree that the high of the drug wears off. Even the most addicting games loss their appeal eventually.</p>

<p>I was reading chapter 3 of brave new world, and they said don&#39;t use a ball as a toy because people won&#39;t stay distracted long. The entertainment must be able to occupy people constantly. Is that now where we are?</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong that the addiction will fade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I upvoted you because although I think your theory is bad, you&#39;ve contributed a point of view which needs to be recognized by more people who frequent this sub.</p>

<p>Ignoring the facts regarding a topic and raising doubts about the mental and emotional well-being of the person you disagree with is an effective tool of persuasion.</p>

<p>That being said, the way in which you&#39;ve gone about it is flawed. Most people who fear the New World Order fear that they are <em>irrelevant</em>, with nothing that anybody would care about. To correlate fears of the NWO with &quot;meritless arrogance&quot; is way off the mark.</p>

<p>Which leaves me to believe that you may harbour have some sort of resentment against Americans and Brits, who you single out as being more concerned about the NWO than people from other countries. If you want to hurt Americans and Brits, I think you need to formulate a better attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans are absolutely arrogant. If I come off as arrogant, then I apologize.</p>

<p>At the same time, I&#39;m not blaming the whole world for America&#39;s problems. I&#39;m blaming America.</p>

<p>With that being said, to say other countries do not follow our lead (forcefully or not) is uninformed and ridiculous. </p>

<p>As for the Mandela effect, I definitely accept faulty memory as an explanation. I also enjoy exploring other explanations. I just can&#39;t get enough of the idea of parallel universes...or even some type of psychological operation.</p>

<p>I tend to take a balanced approach. I believe in God, for example, but I can&#39;t  prove that he exists. Therefore, it is possible he does not exist even if I believe in him. As for the Mandela effect, I definitely believe in it being more that faulty memories, but it&#39;s entirely possible I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>You seriously come off as angry. Perhaps we could talk about more of that. I am angry, too. I&#39;m angry at the citizens of this country. It really at times disgusts me.</p>
