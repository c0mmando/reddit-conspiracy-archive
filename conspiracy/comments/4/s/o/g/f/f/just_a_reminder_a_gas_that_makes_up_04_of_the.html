       A bucket is hanging under a tap that is flowing at 1 gallon per minute. That bucket has a hole in it that allows water to escape at a rate of 1 gallon per minute. The bucket never fills up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then along comes someone with some silicone sealant who puts it on the hole. This restricts the flow out of the bucket to 0.95 gallons per minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens? 1 gallon in, 0.95 gallons out... the bucket begins filling at the rate of 0.05 gallons per minute. A tiny amount, but inevitably, the bucket fills up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What had more effect on the bucket filling up and overflowing? The tap (which hasn't changed), or the guy who blocked the drain hole?

       I get what you're saying, but what OP is proposing is that the rate of flow from the tap DOES change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more than that, he's saying that the variation in flow rate does much more to explain the water level in the bucket than the variation in the size of the hole, or outflow rate-- so much more that we might as well not bother with the variation in the outflow rate. Just use a constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's saying that the current climate model discounts the wrong variable. Outflow does not vary significantly. Inflow does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know which model is correct, but it's a perfectly coherent idea on the face of it.

       I got another take.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a bucket. There is a hole in the bucket that allows .04% of volume of the bucket to escape every year... You have control of 3% of that .04%..
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, you have ZERO CONTROL over 97% of what is escaping out of that hole....
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you spend $7 Trillion Dollars to reduce the amount that escaped from .04% a year to .039%?
      </p>
      <p>
       How bout you take a few of those trillions.. and idk.. feed the 18,000 people that die every fucking day...

       100% correct. It would be far more cost effective to adapt to climate change than to damage our economies by struggling against it. Even if the "facts" pushed by the proven liars on the side of climate fear, are completely accurate.

       Do you understand that billions will starve if fossil fuel consumption is drastically curtailed over a relatively short timespan starting right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think of only a few contingencies that might have some chance of averting the ensuing humanitarian catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
       One, maybe there's some previously unknown, virtually free energy source waiting in the wings. By virtually free energy, I mean something with an EROEI ratio comparable to that of crude oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, it's possible that the protracted phase of economic contraction could be managed wisely enough to avert the worst consequences, but this would require a fundamental reengineering of the global economy and everything in it. This would, in turn, require a global political revolution, and it would probably have to be fundamentally democratic in nature. This seems like even more of a pipe dream than free energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any other ideas?

       "Perhaps the most alarming part is the price tag associated with attempting to reduce such a small part of the atmosphere and something we really cannot control. Our analysis shows the cumulative GDP losses for 2010 to 2029 approach
       <strong>
        $7 trillion.
       </strong>
       Single-year losses exceed $600 billion in 2029, more than $5,000 per house¬hold. Job losses are expected to exceed 800,000 in some years, and exceed at least 500,000 from 2015 through 2026. It is important to note that these are net job losses, after any jobs created by compliance with the regulations–so-called green jobs–are taken into account. In total, the “climate revenue” (read: energy tax) could approach two trillion over eight years. Keep in mind, this is all for negligible environmental benefits."

       A few questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you a working climate research scientist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do any working climate research scientists support your opinion? If so, which ones?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you explain that a seemingly overwhelming consensus of working climate research scientists around the world support the notion that anthropogenic carbon emissions are altering the Earth's climate? I don't mean this as a rhetorical question. The scientific consensus could be wrong. It has been wrong about other things. I just want to know how they came to be so mistaken about something you regard as very obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       No hard feelings if you don't want to answer any of these questions. Thanks in advance for any that you do answer. I lean toward the scientific consensus, myself, but I'm not married to it.

       I see that you put in a lot of effort into posting that comment and I'd prefer if someone answered you in earnest, so here's my thoughts on anthropogenic climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because scientists say something with any degree of certainty or have come to a consensus doesn't mean shit. Our understanding of the world around us is constantly changing and everything we now hold as true may be "proven" wrong by newly discovered facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists ought to know this and behave accordingly, which means they should always strive to prove themselves wrong, humble and ready to examine evidence that points to the contrary. But that's not how climate science works. It works by guilt tripping us, the common folk,
       <em>
        who have no power to change anything at all
       </em>
       , into feeling even more helpless than normally. Just because of this emotional assault that comes with climate science, I am extremely wary of any initiatives coming from it. Also, this same group uses demeaning and fallacious debating tactics to silence any criticism.
       <strong>
        That's not how science works, thus climate changers are not scientists
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to discuss the carbon theory itself. There is absolutely no way to correctly model even one square kilometer of the Earth's surface using the most powerful supercomputers, which means that anthropogenic climate change can never be proven. There are no direct proofs of it, only indirect, and that's not enough for such a radical claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, all climate change equations have one unknown variable: atmosphere carbon sensitivity. Our atmosphere could be super sensitive to carbon or it could be completely indifferent to it. How can we tell? Well, we'd need to
       <em>
        accurately model the entire planet and probably the solar system
       </em>
       . Until we can do that, "scientists" should stop making absurd claims.

       Thanks for a serious reply. I need to be broadly read into what's being argued as well as how you'd characterize the process. I am really on unfamiliar terrain and am thankful for the overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you know, what we hear all day every day is that AGW is a proven fact according to an overwhelming consensus of climate research scientists. 90%, 95%, 99.999%.... I guess whatever number sounds good to the writer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday, someone here told me that there is no such consensus. Instead, there's a multitude of conflicting models that someone has lumped into a pile and said, look, a consensus! I wouldn't be surprised if that's true. It's consistent with my experience of how these things work on a public policy or propaganda level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also familiar with how full of shit science and scientists can be. I've seen some mind boggling bullshit in my time. And the program of character assassination you say they carry out against critics, that's not hard to believe. I've seen that too. I've seen distinguished university professors hounded and ostracized just for asking the wrong research questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I think about it, stigmatizing dissenters with labels like
       <em>
        climate change denialists
       </em>
       is extremely suspicious in its own right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take your points about the models and the research, and I'll keep them in mind as I read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the latest guy to attack me has a point. There are people suggesting that humanity needs to abolish fossil fuels in the next few decades. Anyone who says that either hasn't thought it through, or they support genocide. I mean, beyond genocide. And in fact, I've seen people on social media own up to it. Like, "yeah, humans are bad. It's ok if billions die in misery if we save the planet." It's appalling. How did environmentalism become THIS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thanks for the cool briefing.

       Wow. Another person who thinks it's his job to punish people who ask questions. Good job. If you falsely accuse people of genocidal intentions, they will stop talking to you, and you can tell yourself you won an "argument." Then complain about how they persecute you!

       Rather than attack the messenger, let's concentrate on the world we live in..
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia gives us a useful introduction to the IPCC:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the United Nations,[1][2] set up at the request of member governments.[3] It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 43/53. Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP.[4] The IPCC produces reports that support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty on climate change.[5][6] The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system”.[5] IPCC reports cover “the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.”[6] And this: The aims of the IPCC are to assess scientific information relevant to:[6]
       <strong>
        Human-induced climate change, The impacts of human-induced climate change, Options for adaptation and mitigation.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice their brief is just to look at anthropogenic causes, implicitly ignoring such things as the sun.....
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Fucking Sun.....
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are called the terms of reference. The ole "ARE YOU SAYING EVERY SCIENTIST IS IN ON IT!!!!" is so old and tired.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do to control the framework (in this case the terms of reference) in order to control the conversation...IPCC Climate Assessments only cover man-made causes of climate change.

       No. Why would you think that?

      <p>
       You said "Notice their brief is just to look at anthropogenic causes, implicitly ignoring such things as the sun." That's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Everybody
       </strong>
       knows that the sun is a bigger factor than greenhouse gases,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       the scientists. But
       <em>
        the changes
       </em>
       in greenhouse gases are large, whereas the sun is nearly constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere has gone up 25% in the last 50 years and the Earth's temperature has gone up a small amount (about 0.25% in absolute temperature). If the sun's radiation had increased 25%, we would all be
       <em>
        dead

       I am not going to repeat myself from a few posts ago, when you can scroll up....

      <p>
       The terms of reference... well just take a read..
      </p>
      <p>
       "The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific  basis of risk of human-induced climate change."
      </p>
      <p>
       Their minds were made up before they even started their "research"...
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, you found a page that said "The estimates of long-term solar irradiance changes used in the TAR
       <strong>
        have been revised downwards"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever was included in the models, were revised downwards...That makes me feel way better, especially since 95% of climate models have been wrong..

       You're characterizing my post as an attack. It's not an attack. You'll get plenty of actual attacks if you want to compare and contrast.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I took the fact (which I'm inferring, and you can correct me if I'm wrong) that you're not a working climate research scientist as sufficient reason to dismiss your viewpoint, then yes, that would be attacking you. It would also be fallacious. And hypocritical! I have opinions about a lot of fields I don't work in. And in my own field, I have some opinions that are not supported by the current consensus. So I'm sympathetic. Please don't mischaracterize me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor am I saying anything like  "ARE YOU SAYING EVERY SCIENTIST IS IN ON IT!!!!" I'm asking if ANY working climate research scientist has produced any research supporting your opinion. That's all. It's a serious question. I suspect that somebody has, and I really expected that you'd have citations at the ready. But if you don't, that doesn't mean you're automatically wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for explaining the overwhelming scientific consensus, I think we're getting somewhere. You say "All you have to do to control the framework (in this case the terms of reference) in order to control the conversation...IPCC Climate Assessments only cover man-made causes of climate change." I agree with the general principle about controlling the terms, and will provisionally accept your claim about the IPCC for the sake of getting on with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accepting your answer raises a few more questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the specific case of the IPCC, who (generally) controlled the terms, by what means did they control it, and for what purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about climate research conducted and presented outside the auspices of the IPCC? Does the consensus look substantially  different there?
      </p>
      <p>
       To get to the meat of what you're proposing, as best I can understand it: you're saying that variation in solar energy output is not only necessary to explain and predict terrestrial climate change-- it is also sufficient, by itself. It's the only variable we need in our climate model. Its effects are so powerful as to overwhelm all other factors, including greenhouse gas emissions. Do I understand you correctly? If not then please feel free to set me straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If so then I think it's a thesis we can approach constructively without hollering "bullshit" at each other (as these things usually go).

       You will notice that as soon as these folks break dogma, they are vilified...But in a world where your entire career is based on never speaking out (too much) it is not surprising how the system can regulate itself.

       Chomsky said it way better...
      </p>
      <p>
       "You don’t have any other society where the educated classes are so effectively indoctrinated and controlled by a subtle propaganda system – a private system including media, intellectual opinion forming magazines and the participation of the most highly educated sections of the population. Such people ought to be referred to as “Commissars” – for that is what their essential function is – to set up and maintain a system of doctrines and beliefs which will undermine independent thought and prevent a proper understanding and analysis of national and global institutions, issues, and policies."

       I wouldn't say it's okay. I admit I'm frustrated. No matter how screwy I tell you the numbers are, how they're literally culled of data that doesn't support the theory, how they back estimate data for points that don't have any, how they use data from ocean vessel cooling intake, you still trust the "scientists." The problem is it's not all scientists, it's the higher ups that set the tone and expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the whole problem of not having proven the runaway hypothesis, nor accounting for past cooling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The computer models are inherently flawed due to lack of coherent modeling and insufficient computing power capable of crunching a detailed world model.

       There is no consensus, it was a fradulent number to begin with. Start here, read this if you don't believe me on any of these points. I've read this and many others and am convinced there is zero harm from current human CO2 emissions.

       Just so you know, I do not want to harm the environment and consider myself a conservationist/environmentalist when it comes to this matter. I don't even like to clear shrubs. But hoping something like global warming is real because it makes me feel good about myself re the environment and gives me something to "fight for" is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acid rain is bad, is real, and has been successfully eliminated in the U.S. NOx emissions are bad and have been successfully mitigated to the point where no more action on the subject of NOx reduction is warranted. Ammonia slip however has a potential to become a problem in the near future, I hear no one talking about it, but may contribute to greater ozone depletion.

       I'll buy that.

       I guess I do "trust the scientists" to an extent, despite having ample reason not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same deal with the news media. I've been catching the bastards lying for 30 years, basically whenever I've chosen to look. And yet I'm still shocked by all this fake footage they're broadcasting. It's gotten really really bad. I thought I had lowered my expectations to about zero, but I guess I still hoped that the news bore some sort of relationship to reality. What a disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every new thing that's revealed to be a sham, I feel like, oh no, not this too. So that's where I am with climate change. It's like, great, another damned thing I can't believe. Don't tell me it's as cheesy as the last thing I found out about. Surely there must be some substance to this one. Aaaaaaannnnd.... there's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I've just started and can already see exactly what you mean about blatantly manipulating the data. It's not even subtle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I understand your frustration and have snapped at people for exactly the same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way that anyone who understands reality at all can hope global warming is real. We can't just
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       using fossil fuels. I mean, I don't like the profligate overuse of them in our culture, and I hate that we basically steal other people's oil. But do people understand the economic consequences of vastly reduced energy consumption? I think the whole economy would have to be reengineered around a new assumption: contraction instead of growth. Not trivial!

       Anyway, I get it. Thank you for explaining. Will read the links.

       I just want to say your honest response is a great thing. That's what I value, honesty, and I appreciate it. I'm not looking to completely change minds, just share information and evaluate things with reasoning. So many people have this subconscious mental block that precludes them for comprehending things that would cause them to question their reality. I believe it's a way of the psyche protecting against emotional pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt the same as you once. Sadly, you're right. There is absolutely no value in TV, just shut it off. For every harmless thing you hear on the news, there is one misdirection and ten omissions. Literally nothing from the government is in the interest of the populace, the media is never honest, and the Internet is full of shills and disinformation (it is a light in the darkness however). It takes a lot of will power to persevere as you are, in search of truth, and thanks for that. Few people can do it, it's too damaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're right about the news media, they don't even pretend anymore.

       There's an idea out there that oil is actually abiotic and abundant. The climate change we're experiencing is half man made and half as a result of the earth moving into a region of space illuminated by more conscious awareness.

       You don't know what that term means.

      <p>
       Questions are not an appeal to anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you claim that those were rhetorical questions, you might want to notice that OP answered the second one IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. Which I said is WHAT I EXPECTED. He provided links, and I thanked him and am now reading them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all I knew, he was going to answer the first question in the affirmative also. You know, it IS possible for a research scientist to disagree with the consensus in his field. Happens all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also stressed that dismissing someone's opinion solely because of credentials or any other personal detail would be fallacious. Or did you bother to read what's in front of you before attacking?
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to understand something. A lot of non-mainstream ("fringe" is the pejorative term) views suffer from a perceived or actual lack of scientific standing. Now, just because an idea isn't widely accepted or even investigated by research scientists DOES NOT mean it's false. You and I both know that, but most people don't seem to. So it really helps in innumerable ways if the idea has been scientifically investigated by research scientists. It's not everything, but it's important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to see
       <em>
        the strongest case possible
       </em>
       for the OP's idea. So yes, I'm going to ask about the research! If it's there, great. If not, it makes the alternative theory harder to evaluate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what would be best of all is if the guy I'm talking to IS a climate research scientist whose work supports an idea that the mainstream rejects.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's OK if he's not, because neither am I! I said that. You skipped it and saw what you wanted to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, you don't have to tell me that alternative theories are worth thinking about. I follow them by the dozen.

       It's really a lot worse than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question before us is, do the carbon emissions generated by human activity (mainly, burning fossil fuels) cause dangerous changes to the climate? The penalty for answering incorrectly
       <em>
        either way
       </em>
       is enormous. I don't think that's generally understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all familiar with what they say will happen if we answer "no," and we turn out to be wrong. Hothouse Earth, desertification of formerly productive land, global famine, and all that. Oddly, there's even the prospect of a new Ice Age if thermohaline circulation shuts down. Industrial civilization would collapse, meaning billions would die. Knock-on effects from that horror could even render the planet hostile to complex multicellular life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we certainly don't want to say there's no problem and then find out we're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the kicker. People might think we have a sort of Pascal's wager here, and there's no big penalty for incorrectly answering "yes." Like, what's the problem man, stop burning that dirty fuel, and we win whether we're right about climate change or not. No more pollution and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't state too strongly how wrong that is. People may not appreciate just how dependent we are on fossil fuels. Drastically curtailing or eliminating its consumption over a relatively short timeframe isn't some kind of big win for everyone. I think it would result in a global humanitarian crisis in which billions would die. There is no alternative energy source or combination of energy sources that could possibly sustain industrial civilization
       <em>
        as we know it.
       </em>
       We should understand what that means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the penalty for "yes" is the same whether we're right or not. Abolishing fossil fuels might "save the planet," but only at the cost of billions of lives, and industrial civilization itself. So we might save the planet, but certainly not the world. And who knows what 7 billion people will do to the place on their way down the drain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of all the options considered so far, the only rational one appears to be: answer "no" to the greenhouse gas theory and just hope to God you're right, because we don't stand a chance otherwise. And that's what decision makers appear to be doing. I thought they were insane, but now that I think about it, so is the alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This state of affairs bears directly on a number of popular conspiracy theories! Population culling, secret free energy tech that the authorities are hiding, back-engineered alien tech, all that stuff. Also more mundane propositions that we know are really going on, like resource wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't mean to write a novel here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Added: it's possible human beings could intelligently manage the economic contraction resulting from curtailing fossil fuel consumption. Maybe this would minimize the damage. But it would require a revolution in which everything about the economy is totally redefined. Kind of a longshot if you ask me.

       This is not an argument. You are responsible for the greatest fucking environmental disaster in the history of the world by conflating your complete fucking bullshit with proper human behavior. When the scam comes down and the people responsible for pushing it are fucking executed (because they will be), it will be decades before people care about the actual environment again because you psychopaths have sullied stewardship so hard.
