<p>So are conspiracies only for white people or some shit? Yall make me mad as FUCK reading this sub sometimes.</p>

<p>Understand this shit affects us all. Trump and Hillary are two sides of the same coin. They are fucking FRIENDS. Obama and Bush are two sides of the same coin. Same got damn policies.</p>

<p>Police brutality pushes the NWO! If you are sitting there wondering about the fucking Bohemian Grove while defending crooked cops, then you are not into actual conspiracies, you are probably just a racist douche bag who watched too many episodes of the X Files.</p>

<p>REAL shit is going on right now, and we need your help. All of us!</p>

<p>Get off your anti BLM soap box and realize the revolution is trying to get started. Cliven Bundy and BLM SHOULD be on the same fucking side! BLM types would LOVE to side with disenfranchised white people, but disenfranchised white people tend to be racist bigots which is frustrating as FUCK. We WANT YOUR HELP.</p>

<p>We practically have begged for support. We are all fighting tyranny, so why are we letting them divide us by race and gender and sexuality? Lets fight oppression together motherfuckers. Got DAMN.</p>

<p>Everyone seems willing to work together - women, blacks, muslims, poor people, gays, latinos - everyone except a considerable block of disenfranchised poor white people. </p>

<p>Please, white people, please hop on the train and join the group. We need to do this together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem for me is that the head of the blm are paid provocateurs. the message is denegrating into violence against the establishment. This is just part of a plan made by someone long ago who is very aware of the nature of each group involved. Don&#39;t go to the protests tomorrow, they are slated to be infiltrated by paid mercenaries to turn things violent. 
I&#39;m against racism and sexism and I&#39;m a white man. 
Im just as against misinformation and division. 
Be careful letting the ideals of the leaders of blm run away with your passion for justice. Do a little more research on who the real bad guys are. I wish you peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so one person so far in this thread I can probably at least dialogue with. </p>

<p>I agree that there are paid provocateurs in ALL movements sent to cause trouble. We see it time and again. Hell, look at Lee Harvey Oswald and look at the Dallas shooter. Do we really think either of them were lone gunmen? Of course we don&#39;t, yet that is the official narrative. </p>

<p>There is something much bigger at play here. BLM is a real thing tho, based out of real fear and anger, brought to form in a time of twitter and hash tags. There are REAL issues there. </p>

<p>The ideals of BLM are simple tho man, I can tell you: equality. stop fucking with us. </p>

<p>That should be something all of us are down with, especially people that post in this sub. But I don&#39;t see any anger at cops when it comes to blacks here. I don&#39;t see any mention of conspiracies to divide and conquer us. Instead its blm is bad, fuck black people, fuck muslims, fuck gays. </p>

<p>I remember when it was about NWO. Now this movement has been co-opted by a white racist agenda. Remember when Alex Jones talked about real shit? Now he just incites white anger. There was a fundamental shift, and none of us are talking about it. </p>

<p>You tell me be careful about BLM leaders, I am telling you be careful about so called conspiracy leaders pushing white anger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This place is crawling with Stormfront trolls/JIDF, etc - all bent on Pied Pipering idiots and lost souls looking to be a part of something. And it&#39;s succeeding - look at Trump and the_donald: Pied Pipers who likely work for a certain government that wants Clinton in office started it, and willing idiots feeling sorry for themselves followed the music not realizing they&#39;ve been duped.</p>

<p>Note the racist posts here - always the same bunch of users, always posting threads in spurts, one right after another (often forum sliding) - check the way they write, what they refer to, how they format their responses, the fact that they <em>often</em> copy and paste responses. They&#39;re here in this thread in droves, it&#39;s disgusting. It makes this place look like a den of racists - another tactic.</p>

<p>I wish we could wake more people up to this <em>influence</em>, this <em>nudging</em> - they think they&#39;re part of something, not being influenced. I dunno, despite the dumb responses you&#39;re getting here, maybe this post you&#39;ve made wakes some people up, so thank you for taking the time to fight the good fight.</p>

<p>The divide and conquer shit has worked for so long, and this very specific segment of angry, poor, white males just won&#39;t let go of the racism, and they keep being nudged to it as you say.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolute fact, progressive sub-groups with large followings have been targeted and infiltrated with paid sock-puppet agents and sycophant lackeys working feverishly to incite racial animosity and prevent any kind of united front amongst common agendas. I&#39;m afraid that organised groups with central leadership structures, especially these days are largely co-opted to serve the agendas of the common enemy. I hate saying this but organised groups by now an anachronism and people need to be essentially leaderless, taking that power back and leading themselves to unite in a truly democratic, yet united direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaders of any successful movement that threatens status quo are often either turned or assassinated, so the obvious takeaway from that is a leaderless organization, an organization with many heads, and many unknown heads. But we&#39;ve seen in the past few years that <em>those</em> types of organizations are even riper for the picking than traditional ones! Because the anonymous head you&#39;re following may well be a Fed! ;)</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know what the solution is from an organizational standpoint - best thing to do is get education out there and get people thinking for themselves, educating themselves, <em>talking</em> to people (which includes talking to people in these movements) and not believing the lies they&#39;re fed by media and those in power that want to squash dissent.</p>

<p>One test is: Does my stance make me feel better about myself while hurting others? Does my stance divide me from those of other races/classes/circumstances and put me at a higher societal standing than others by default and without effort? Would, say, a Buddha or a Christ agree with my stance, my words, my behavior? Am I fighting for the powerful or for the meek? Why am I fighting for the powerful and what does it <em>really</em> gain me? And be honest with oneself about it. Then rethink it. Put yourself in the dissenters&#39; place. And rethink it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM isnt saying that only BLM. Its saying that right now, at this moment, no one is caring about black lives. </p>

<p>When you get on FB and terrorists attack france, everyone gets a france avatar. When a gunman killed cops, buildings lit up blue in support of blue lives. When a gunman killed a bunch of black church goers, no facebook avatars. No lights going up. Nothing but &quot;maybe the gunman was mentally ill&quot;</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter is a response to the sentiment that white people tend to not give a shit about black lives at all. Its screaming out that we do in fact matter in this world. </p>

<p>For you to see it and think its excluding you means that you are thinking about YOU and not about what we have to go thru as black people. Its that lack of empathy that is the problem. </p>

<p>I am not a farmer but I can have empathy for white farmers who have to fight tyranny in the government. You are not black, but you should be able to have empathy for blacks having to fight tyranny. You should support on the basis of KNOWING we are all fighting the same shit. BLM isnt a terrorist organization, its not a hate group, none of that bullshit. </p>

<p>White folks have to step out of thinking every single movement or thing has to be about them in order for them to support it. </p>

<p>I mean, Im not a woman but I understand rape is a problem. </p>

<p>Im not a muslim but I understand the hell they are going thru and I support Muslims fight. </p>

<p>Why is it hard for you to do the same? Have empathy, its what helps us all do better and become better. Just saying you understand goes a long fucking way. Standing up to the racist trolls in this very thread goes a long way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree w you guys, I just don&#39;t protest.  I would have to drive to a big city to protests.
I have been put in the hospital by a couple cops and I am a home health nurse w a fair amount of black clients.
I know how the cops are here to blacks and white trash.  They treat us the same.  Like dirt.
They know we can&#39;t afford lawyers so we can&#39;t sue them or even be taken seriously.
I just wish the drug war would end, it&#39;s what has made the problems worse.
I think many whites don&#39;t see the problem because we are so segregated.  My poor neighborhood is mixed so I would jump a cop if he was beating one of my neighbors, any color.  But to be honest, the cops don&#39;t come round my neighborhood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing. </p>

<p>BLM is now thoroughly infiltrated and disrupted. Its public image is in tatters, and its ranks have become utterly confused. In every city, the militarized &quot;police&quot; force is poised to crush it. This is all the result of a vigorous campaign of offensive counterintelligence, sometimes called psychological warfare, although it&#39;s much more than psychological. </p>

<p>Now that BLM and its program are in disarray, we know from experience what comes next. The police move in and make a whole lot of key arrests on trumped up charges. They confiscate, destroy, or cut off access to key assets and resources. The news media go along with it, and the general public just wants it to go away. The movement is broken up. Look for this &quot;action phase&quot; to start-- I&#39;m guessing-- just about immediately. There will be a sudden wave of bullshit arrests, seizures, and harassment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what agencies are involved in the offensive counterintelligence phase. The FBI&#39;s fingerprints are all over it, of course, but that can&#39;t be all. </p>

<p>Anyway, it works. They did the same thing to Occupy Wall Street. That was the last big one, but they are actually running this game all the time. They know what they&#39;re doing. </p>

<p>I stood and chanted along at the very earliest demonstrations, when Black Lives Matter was just a new slogan or catchphrase. (In my city, protests were triggered by the police shooting of a white college kid, but everyone seems to have forgotten that.) I watched the authorities surveilling us. They didn&#39;t hide it! I joined cop watch groups to watch them right back, then unjoined as their rhetoric became violent, lawless, and irrational. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ve stood with BLM and will continue to stand for universal human rights. But right now I wouldn&#39;t go to a BLM demonstration if you paid me. Counterintelligence has turned it into an enormous clusterfuck and painted a huge target on it. That fight is over, and the thugs are about to move in and mop up. I&#39;m sorry to say that. </p>

<p>Time to start the next resistance movement? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of BLM came Campaign Zero, which is actually working to encourage actionable systemic change that can help fix things (and that A LOT of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> readers would and could get behind, it&#39;s the same stuff you see on Reason). Police departments are sitting down with their communities across the country right now having conversations. It&#39;s not going to fix things overnight, but it&#39;s a start. The propaganda being circulated about BLM is just that, propaganda. If you actually look into this movement and what it wants, it&#39;s straight policy recommendations and awareness. </p>

<p>People are willfully ignoring and misrepresenting it. Some for specific malicious purpose, some because they feel like they have to choose a &quot;side&quot; and choose the side that seems &quot;closer&quot; to them, and some because they&#39;re misinformed (not their fault if they&#39;re busy, the media is very much misrepresenting).</p>

<p>Where do you see reparations being a big part of any platform by BLM? Or do you see people saying that, that are not necessarily a part of the movement?</p>

<p>Its not a part of any actual platform. Again, you are being lied to by your sources. Think about where you read this shit. Right wing nut case blogs. </p>

<p>These blogs are against you, man. They want to keep you poor as fuck. THE RICH WHITES ARE YOUR WORST ENEMIES.</p>

<p>They’d be up in arms (and with arms) if someone said something about getting rid of welfare and affirmative action.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t really think that capitalism has ensured everyone involved in the production of your lifestyle gets fair compensation? Reparations are due for the western lifestyle, forget about the history of ecocide and internment, look at the present: your license plate on your car was made by slave labor, the rubber in the sole of your shoe was stolen from indigenous forests, the burnt coals that power your electric shaver are poisoning the atmosphere that my kids have to live under.</p>

<p>Tell me how you&#39;re fighting for your descendants? Have you no sense of duty or honor? Are you not a virus ravaging this earth, with your lack of concern for the survival of your own genes and your primary concern on consuming yourself to death?</p>

<p>&quot;Get off your anti BLM soap box and realize the revolution is trying to get started. Cliven Bundy and BLM SHOULD be on the same fucking side!

    <div class="md"><p>There is an antiquated belief instilled in Americans that whiteness itself is covetable &amp; must be protected. This is a product (and the foundation) of manifest destiny, the principle on which America was founded. Poor whites, Africans, and Chinese were all used to occupy territory &amp; participate in the genocide of the indigenous population. </p>

<p><strong>It was an effective tool then, and it&#39;s effective now.</strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s a subtle tactic, insidious in nature. It&#39;s taught to us as children in school and played out in the public arena over &amp; over. </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s the long con.</strong></p>

<p>I support BLM, and want to remind people that <strong>there is No Race War.</strong> Its a lie only those who are isolated can even believe. I live in a mixed neighborhood &amp; always have. Everyone here seems to have it figured out. It&#39;s amazing to me that some people still buy into that particular brand of propaganda. </p>

<p>It will only stop when people realize it&#39;s a psychological weapon. Hopefully, as we see more &amp; more waking up, the divisive racial agenda will become obvious to them as well. When that happens, TPTB better bar their fucking doors because the <strong>United Slaves of America</strong> will be the most unstoppable force in the history of mankind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A South politician preaches to the poor white man</p>

<p>&quot;You got more than blacks, don&#39;t complain</p>

<p>You&#39;re better than them, you been born with white skin&quot; they explain</p>

<p>And the Negro&#39;s name</p>

<p>Is used it is plain</p>

<p>For the politician&#39;s gain</p>

<p>As he rises to fame</p>

<p>And the poor white remains</p>

<p>On the caboose of the train</p>

<p>But it ain&#39;t him to blame</p>

<p>He&#39;s only a pawn in their game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of the problem is the very etymology of the movement. Even if the intentions were pure and the movement really is about equality, drawing attention to any one group when all groups are affected only furthers the divide between people. </p>

<p>Of course the media plays their part in all of this. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of black people who just want equality, but all that shows up in the media seems to be sliding more towards a message of black supremacy. Anyone saying white lives or all lives matter is written off as racist and that just makes no sense when the message is supposed to be about equality. </p>

<p>Black Lives Matter needs to do a better job at marketing to their own communities. Black people kill other black people at a much higher rate than the police do which shows the lack of self awareness in the movement. Any time a black person is killed by a cop everyone goes ape shit, but when 60 of them die over the weekend in Chicago at their own hands, suddenly black lives don&#39;t matter anymore apparently. </p>

<p>The hypocrisy and lack of self awareness is creating most of the actual backlash against the movement, which I&#39;d like to point out I view as different from the manufactured rage brought to us by the media. I tend to only see negative things about BLM in the media; violent protests, blocking highways, shouting about killing white people and cops. I&#39;d like to believe this is all cherry picked and manufactured by agent provocateurs, but in order for those agents to be successful they need a decent amount of useful idiots who fall for their bullshit.</p>

<p>So again, there&#39;s plenty of black people hurting this cause more than anyone. Try actually peacefully uniting your own race for once and maybe other groups will take notice and help. As it stands now the movement is divided enough among the group that it claims to represent, and some who claim to support it are only driving others away with their actions. There needs to be a common message that appeals to all people, and the etymology of Black Lives Matter is too exclusive on the surface even if the message beneath it applies to all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of BLM came Campaign Zero, which is actually working to encourage actionable systemic change that can help fix things (and that A LOT of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> readers would and could get behind, it&#39;s the same stuff you see on Reason). Police departments are sitting down with their communities across the country right now having conversations. It&#39;s not going to fix things overnight, but it&#39;s a start. The propaganda being circulated about BLM is just that, propaganda. If you actually look into this movement and what it wants, it&#39;s straight policy recommendations and awareness. </p>

<p>People are willfully ignoring and misrepresenting it. Some for specific malicious purpose, some because they feel like they have to choose a &quot;side&quot; and choose the side that seems &quot;closer&quot; to them, and some because they&#39;re misinformed (not their fault if they&#39;re busy, the media is very much misrepresenting).</p>
