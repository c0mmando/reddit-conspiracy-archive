    <div class="md"><p>I share the views of James Corbett (<a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/">https://www.corbettreport.com/</a>). Operation Gladio is a confirmed fact and Gladio B is what we&#39;re seeing now. It&#39;s telling how this terror seems to confirm with the political agenda of the time. During the cold war, it was communists that supposedly resorted to terror and now its Muslims. Islamic terror has never been a thing historically and terror tend to turn the opinion against the group that are blamed.
So yeah I suspect most terror attacks to be false flags. When gun control was on the political agenda in US, we saw a lot of school shootings where the perpetrator was a lone gunman with no political motive, sending the message that guns in a society is dangerous because there are so many nutcases. Now we see Islamic terror when the globalists want to overthrow Islamic countries, and now they may have an ally in France. How convenient.
And just to be clear, I believe these to be false flags, not hoaxes. Sandy Hook was an exception and they have since then realized that there need to be real victims and a supposed perpetrator to make it believable.
Good analysis of the Dallas shooting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHzj8CoTlmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHzj8CoTlmo</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking that maybe some people got shot by cops responding. But there were definitely crisis actors involved too. The company CrisisCast has a website where they brag about how large-scale and realistic their crisis drills are. And here&#39;s a juicy tidbit: there&#39;s a section of their website where they list the clients that they have contracts with. One of their biggest contracts is with the company GS4, which is the private security company that Omar Mateen worked for. They&#39;re getting so sloppy and careless with this shit, leaving dots like that to be connected so easily by curious snoopers. They&#39;re cocky now because they&#39;ve gotten away with it so many times, and 9 out of 10 American citizens don&#39;t suspect a damn thing other than what they hear on CNN, MSNBC or FOX, or whatever bullshit mainstream newspaper they follow.</p>

<p>Also, there are some news clips of the &quot;survivors&quot; being carried out. In one, you can see two guys carrying a &quot;wounded&quot; guy who apparently can&#39;t walk. They carry him like 10 feet until they think they are out of view of the camera, then they set the guy down on his feet, and he miraculously can stand and walk on his own again. Then all three start joking around and laughing and stuff. So ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here seems like an inocuous place to post. </p>

<p>I&#39;m as big of a realist as the next guy truly here.</p>

<p>If this is not a hoax or a narrative creation piece, it is a sad reflection of where we are. Retaliation for decades of an economy based on war and predatory politics. It breaks my heart as I think we can be better to each other, we just need to unwind the belief that we know better and allow people the freedom to be themselves,  have the faith to stand on our own feet and not mess with other peoples stuff and like the movie beautiful mind, not aim at the hot blonde.</p>

<p>A global perception and economic cabal replaying needlessly and controlling the populations by fear based on a 5000 year old story while ignoring the older stories and other places in the space and dimensions we live in. </p>

<p>The genetic damage of war and terror will be with us for at least a generation if we stopped today, and we are so fucking removed and complacent from it we get mad when gas goes up .20 and our factory tormented food sits in our smug pudgy stomaches; we don&#39;t see the coat of nothingness tearing Eden apart. </p>

<p>Thank you to all of life and death, for neither are eternal. It is a priviledge to be here and with all open minds and openable minds. Much love.</p>

<p>We need to get off the Prescott bones track, dancing at a memorial and onto something more organic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truck might be hard to tell, or might not be covered at all but the videos on Twitter are fucked and almost wish I didn&#39;t see them but at the same time they very clearly show people, who appear to be in France, mutilated and covered in blood. It could be staged but it was more real than anything I have seen from any of the previous terror attacks in a long time.</p>

<p>What I will say is I haven&#39;t heard any reports of what the driver looked like or who it could be but no one has claimed responsibility. I am very interested in what is said about the driver. Was this person Arab or Muslim or even inspired by any of the radical terrorist groups because I would imagine that would be publicized to help confirm to everyone that terrorism is those Muslims hating our Western freedoms. It will be interesting to see.</p>

<p>The timing of this is suspicious as France announced they&#39;d lift their state of emergency and it&#39;s Bastille day. Frankly I had been worrying this year that Independence day in the US would have some incident but France seems a more primed target. </p>
