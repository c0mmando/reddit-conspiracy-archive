<p>Why would he consider Gingrich for VP?  </p>

<p>Makes no sense if he&#39;s the real deal.  If he was the real deal he wouldn&#39;t have called the Clintons before announcing his run.  and he wouldn&#39;t have been donating to the clinton foundation going back years.  His kids wouldn&#39;t be friends with Chelsea.  He wouldn&#39;t consider Gingrich, who said &quot;he isn&#39;t part of the secret society&quot;.  Why would Gingrich be interested in being friendly with someone who isn&#39;t part of the illuminati?  </p>

<p><strong><em>Every day until you relent.</em></strong></p>

<p>“Hey, Trump!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Shekelberg?”</p>

<p>“I know that you are an extremely successful and wealthy businessman with a wonderful family that will carry on your company’s name…”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Not to mention the star and host of a very popular reality TV show that also serves to advertise your business empire…”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And our planned matchup of Hillary vs. Bush in this upcoming election will guarantee an easy victory for Hillary…”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“But would you mind running as a candidate so that every politician in America and several of our allied nations can relentlessly attack and mock you for the next year while slander and libel are ruthlessly hurled at you from every media outlet in existence (all of which we own), thereby potentially hurting the image of your company and damaging business deals both at home and abroad?”</p>

<p>“Why the hell would I do that?”</p>

<p>“Because then you can drop out at the last minute and make Hillary’s guaranteed victory even more guaranteed!”</p>

<p>“You know what? That’s a great idea. I’ll get right on that.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your last two sentences. The rest of that shit made me bust a gut though. Rubio or Walker would&#39;ve steamrolled Clinton? When will you and the rest of America get a fucking clue? Republicans and Democrats work together to ensure the establishment is not threatened. Trump is an outsider to this network and compared to the money backing Clinton, he&#39;s actually a little guy (as hilarious as it is for me to get to say that, compared to the Clintons, it&#39;s true).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so though? Without proof you are just spewing speculation. It&#39;s plausible, no doubt, but so are many things that are either A incorrect or B unproven. I look at Trumps top campaign donors and it looks vastly different from Bush&#39;s donors, Obama&#39;s donors, and Clinton&#39;s donors (hint most are the same donors). </p>

<p>How is Trump part of this network? He wasn&#39;t born into it and he hasn&#39;t weaseled his way into it. He&#39;s a big businessman and a reality tv show personality, but a member of the Network? I don&#39;t see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what woke me up to it is the idea that Gingrich was a top choice for his VP.  Gingrich went on tv months ago and said about trump </p>

<p>“Well because he’s an outsider, he’s not them, he’s not part of the club, he’s uncontrollable, he hasn’t been through the initiation rites, he didn’t belong to the secret society.”</p>

<p>Why then would Trump seriously consider Gingrich for such an important job?  And why would Gingrich agree to it?</p>

<p>Trump donated and is friends with the Clintons.  Their daughters are friends.  Trump contacted the Clintons when he first announced his presidential run.  </p>

<p>Trump as has been stated is the rights version of Obama.  He&#39;s suggesting he&#39;s untethered and independent and can&#39;t be bought.  </p>

<p>But he&#39;s friends with Clinton.  And would possibly nominated an admitted globalist illuminati to VP.  </p>

<p>He is part of the network.  he&#39;s just the next step in the systems effort to make their candidates look like &quot;us&quot;.  </p>

<p>Just like Obama was made to look that way-end war, first black president, hope, change.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is r/conspiracy so consider this scenario.  First remember the role Trump played in 2012 Presidential election as Mr. Birther.</p>

<p>Second consider the perpetual reality that Trump is always tottering the brink of collapse and is  nowhere near worth $10B probably not even $1 Bil now that he has slimmed his own name with so many. </p>

<p>Third, understand how advertising, bankers, all media, and associations of the largest cooperation can squeeze out, or secretly support or undermine  business  according to the needs.</p>

<p>Trump was used to shame Bush out of the race via the Iraq war attack and now is being used to scare the mindless into voting for Hillary, who will carry water for the oligarchs with much greater efficiency now that most of the elected Democratic are of the same stripe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Trump was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and in 1943 the F.B.I. had enough faith in his technical ability and his discretion to call him in when Nikola Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel, in Manhattan, raising the question of whether enemy agents might have had a chance to learn some of his secrets before the body was found. (One fear was that Tesla was working on a “death ray.”) As Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth recount in “Tesla, Master of Lightning,” Professor Trump examined Tesla’s papers and equipment, and, in a written report, told the F.B.I. not to worry&quot;</p>

<p>I have read before that he was actually employed by the FBI, I can&#39;t find those sources although I didn&#39;t look very hard. Either way, he was a military man, an MIT scientist, and worked with the FBI. Seems like Donald was born into it.</p>

<p>If you read the article, and I suggest you do, Donald has repeatedly brought his uncle up as a means to prove his intelligence, saying that genes really do matter. Huh. Seig Heil Trump?</p>

Though both of them are not exactly great politicians, I think most independents + republicans would be a-ok with a 10 extra chromosome looking human being like Scott Walker sitting in the oval so long as they weren&#39;t named &quot;Clinton.&quot;</p>
