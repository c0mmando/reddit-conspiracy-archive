It has made me doubt every single headline the last couple of years, and completely eradicated my trust in any sort of government. I could go on for days on end about the horrors committed by the very people we are supposed to trust, but I have to draw a line in the sand. </p>

<p>It has gotten to the point where I feel paranoid and my family thinks I&#39;m headed straight off the deep end. Personally I think we are just a couple of years away from a huge shift in history, and it&#39;s too late for me to do anything about it without it costing me my mental wellbeing. The hopelessness of the situation has gotten to me. </p>

<p>Question everything, but don&#39;t let it kill you. That means &quot;they&quot; win. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to leave now, and I wish you all the best in the troubled times to come brothers and sisters. </p>

<p>Edit: I never expected <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be this understanding. I guess thats me selling you guys short, and for that i apologize. Thanks to the tips on subs and literature, I&#39;ll be sure to check it out. Also I want to express my compassion for those who have gotten lost in the endless conspiracies, like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That stage in the process is tough. You feel the urge to share everything you&#39;ve learned and it comes off as crazy/pushy. Pull back. People&#39;s ego&#39;s are fragile. Walls are built throughout their lifetimes. It&#39;s hard for us to break them down. Chip away. And while doing that, breathe. Relax. Its no the end of the world, maybe just the end of a social experiment. Plant a garden. Be aware. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. I look back at when I felt the need to tell everybody all the things I&#39;d learned....and I eventually learned you just can&#39;t. Also, as a veteran of the conspiracy world (16+ years down the rabbit hole), I can tell you that the world is ALWAYS about to end. What I mean by that is every generation thinks they are on the brink of the crazy shit going down, and they&#39;re right....but the shit continues to go down and what seemed crazy becomes normal. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had oh shit bags packed, months of food stored, and gas masks at the ready.....but now, I just take it easy and try to enjoy my life and help others as much as I can. If the shit hits the fan, hopefully I&#39;ll have an umbrella handy. If not, I&#39;ll wash the shit off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure when my fallopian tubes got totally fried, (requires me pulling a buncha surgical reports from outta state from the 90s and 00s and frankly, I&#39;m ok with not having a kid) but after the HPV series and H1N1 flu shot, my whole body&#39;s response to pain and my infertility is complete. If it isn&#39;t the vaccines that will sterilize this generation, it&#39;s the fuckin wifi in the schools. Bye bye, gonads and ovaries... </p>

<p>In no way shape or form will I try IVF. I&#39;ve made the decision to not carry on my genes and I sure as fuck ain&#39;t having a MiracleWhip progeny. If I adopt or foster, I&#39;m homeschooling and only going to allow supervised TV and internet usage. </p>

<p>I&#39;m about to have the convo with my boyfriend about possibly moving in together and part time custody of his kid. I&#39;m helllllla nervous about the conversation about what it will mean to share a home and Internet connection. I&#39;m gonna have to compromise, yes, but idk how I&#39;m going to keep my mouth shut about some of his viewing habits. He&#39;s semi-aware of propaganda and programming, but I don&#39;t wanna rip the bandaid off. Funny how shit that used to be &quot;dealbreakers&quot; aren&#39;t that important, but how you spend your time and dollar become powerful, almost prayful? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think your comment is a bit disrespectful to the girls who didn&#39;t die but are now in constant pain and misery for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Not dying from a vaccine is not what it&#39;s about, it&#39;s about the fact that you&#39;re not supposed to die after a vaccination, especially when you&#39;re a very fit, healthy young woman. Even worse was how they were &#39;treated&#39; by medical &#39;professionals&#39;, sent home to die in their sleep or just drop dead a few days later.</p>

<p>A point is that they cherry picked data to make it seem amazing and perfect and actually necessary. Even though there&#39;s only a chance you could get cancer from the virus (instead of the widespread lie that the virus = definitely cancer), besides that, they claimed that the vaccine reduced/prevented 70% of hpv caused cancers, for that claim they&#39;ve no proof. In fact, they&#39;ve caused more cancers of the female reproductive kind since then than they actually claimed to prevent.</p>

<p>Also, the vaccination, if you&#39;ve read the links and rest of their sites and maybe googled some yourself, has left over 3 to 400 (might actually even be 600) <a href="http://truthaboutgardasil.org/injuries/">young women severely handicapped and incapacitated, with new, horrible and painful conditions as a result from the shots, they might actually be better off dead.</a> These are just a few stories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not against vaccines or vaccinations, I&#39;m against cherry picking information detrimental to research and &#39;saving lives&#39;, I&#39;m against thinning the herd like this despite its need. I&#39;m against fast tracking any part of medical/research procedures, I&#39;m against doctors who ignore symptoms and who&#39;s lack of treatment can cause infertility, (permanent) damage of any kind and even death along the line. Many if not all of these girls can&#39;t live a quality life anymore, for me, that&#39;s enough not to get this thing. Considering I already couldn&#39;t and have no need to worsen it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you need to just take a break from all of this, like many on here have said. Cool it with the conspiracy stuff for a little. Maybe check out <a href="/r/homestead">/r/homestead</a>, <a href="/r/gardening">/r/gardening</a>, <a href="/r/vandwellers">/r/vandwellers</a>, <a href="/r/TinyHouses">/r/TinyHouses</a>. Places like that which may inspire you, to make positive changes in your life that will help you disconnect from the system in which you are learning/know about.</p>

<p>In regards to what people think/say about you. You may be coming off to strong, maybe tone it back and rather than preach, plant seeds and ask questions in a conversation.</p>

<p>Also, these two quotes really help me with all the rabbit holes I&#39;ve been down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change;
courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Serenity Prayer (If not religious (like me), just replace God with self or w/e)</p>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Jiddu Krishnamurti</p>

<p>Best of luck. Peace and love, mate.</p>

Something as simple as &quot;world war 3 is here&quot; and people call me a crazy nutjob. Like I don&#39;t know how to get through to people without them calling me crazy. People will just call me a whacko and start talking about sports without even considering just looking into it for 10 minutes. I&#39;m scared not for me but for humanity.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Fear is a negativity, an absence. This has to be understood very, very deeply. If you miss [this] you will never be able to understand the nature of fear. It is like darkness. Darkness does not exist, it only appears to be. In fact it is just an absence of light. Light exists; remove the light - there is darkness.</p>

<p>Darkness does not exist, you cannot remove darkness. Do whatsoever you want to do, you cannot remove darkness. You cannot bring it, you cannot throw it. If you have to do something with darkness, you will have to do something with light, because only something which has an existence can be related to. Put the light off, darkness is there; put the light on, darkness is not there - but you do something with LIGHT. You cannot do anything with darkness.</p>

<p>Fear is darkness. It is absence of love. You cannot do anything about it, and the more you do, the more you will become fearful because then the more you will find it impossible.</p>

<p>The problem will become more and more complicated. If you fight with darkness you will be defeated. You can bring a sword and try to kill the darkness: you will only be exhausted. And, finally, the mind will think: Darkness is so powerful, that’s why I am defeated.
This is where logic goes wrong. It is absolutely logical that if you have been struggling with darkness and you could not defeat it, could not destroy it; it is absolutely logical to come then to the conclusion that darkness is very, very powerful. I am impotent before it. But the reality is just the opposite. You are not impotent, darkness is impotent. In fact darkness is not there - that’s why you could not defeat it. How can you defeat something which is not?</p>

<p>Fear is nothing but absence of love. Do something with love, forget about fear. If you love well, fear disappears. If you love deeply, fear is not found. Whenever you have been in love with someone, ever for a single moment, was there any fear? It has never been found in any relationship - if even for a single moment two persons are in deep love and a meeting happens, they are tuned to each other, in that moment fear has never been found. Just as if the light is on and darkness has not been found There is the secret key: Love more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt very similar when I fell into the rabbit hole. Then studied the nature of my inner reality and now feel pretty indifferent to how bad or great the world is. </p>

<p>&quot;When one&#39;s intelligence leaves the forest of delusion, one becomes indifferent to all that has been said and all that is to be said.&quot;</p>

<p>The secret is cultivating, side by side, the futility of this world (conspiracies help a lot) as well as the beauty of one&#39;s inner world (reading Bhagavad-Gita is amazing for this...very philosophically straightforward). This will immensely help balance your mental state.</p>

<p>It has gotten to the point where I feel paranoid and my family thinks I&#39;m headed straight off the deep end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paranoia is tough, but not necessarily bad. If it&#39;s affecting your daily life, then you might need to take a few walks through the wilderness or something.</p>

<p>Similarly, some peers and family of mine genuinely question my mental state and show concern for me. Which I think is crazy - worry about the world, not me! I&#39;m fine (for the most part).</p>

<p>Thing is though, you&#39;ll never be able to un-know everything you&#39;ve learned up to this point. And you won&#39;t ever go back to being an ignorant sheeple (sheeperson?) because everything that happens <em>is consistent with the rabbit hole</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good call man. I ended up right where you are just under a year ago and made the same decision. I have since taken the occasional dive into the conspiracy news sources, forums etc, just for quick updates here and there, but the sense of overwhelming distrust, paranoia, and frustration with the general public was too much to handle and I found myself thinking about pretty dark shit on a regular basis. Luckily I feel much better now. Ignorance is bliss?</p>

<p>Your statement regarding your belief in a soon-to-occur &quot;major-shift&quot; is what caught my attention though. That feeling is something that I don&#39;t dwell on nearly as much as I used to when I was deep into this stuff, but havent been able to shake. Sometimes I wake up at like 4AM with a sense of overwhelming dread, and a feeling that there are just way too many people on this planet and that we are all headed for catastrophe. Cant say specifically why, could be any number of things. But I feel it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this^ was my answer. (but I was going to scream it as loud as I could)</p>

<p>Bitcoin allows you to free yourself from our monetary system. It is simple enough to understand in an afternoon, but will give you an outlet where you can spend all of your time focusing on the great possibilities that you will no longer have time to focus on the bad things going on elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you dedicate yourself to bitcoin, you can use it as an employable skill. </p>

<p>People in the bitcoin community are very positive, and are excited about the future, and how to profit from it (not at anyone&#39;s expense). </p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist can be depressing at times, part of which is our own fault, we focus on all that is wrong with the world. Bitcoin will allow you focus on the good.</p>

<p>In short, don&#39;t try to bring down the system, something i think you (OP) realized you couldn&#39;t do, which is why you wrote this post.  Find and support its replacement. Bitcoin is that replacement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to be blunt, but if conspiracy makes you paranoid, you are doing something wrong. Conformists should fear - it is them who will be the most vulnerable, if something major goes wrong...</p>

<p>Not to mention - conspiracy theories are not the end or final truth. It is just one of the stepping stones on the road to... Well, let&#39;s just say conspiracies are not your final destination. There are way too many things beyond, and stopping at this point may be a big mistake (in my opinion). Because no matter what you think you know for sure - the next turn may blow your mind...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question your own thoughts most of all, as cognitive dissonance is your greatest foe. It will drive you to cling to complex theories long beyond their obvious expiration, to seek to rationalize ever more convoluted and implausible explanations when the reality is surprisingly simple. It will back you into a corner and leave you lashing out at those who challenge your preconceived notions.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to reject the narratives of the mainstream media, or to speculate on the truth using the information available to you - but always remember that you are speculating. Do not get too caught up in your own certainty or you will appear to others as those who fall pray to obvious propaganda seem to you; deluded, misinformed, blinded to the obvious and unwilling to consider alternatives. When everyone around you sees you like this it will have a serious effect on you.</p>

<p>I love coming up with conspiracy theories, I love speculating about the course of events to come, but at the end of the day I know little more than your average TV news junkie and I recognize that.</p>

<p>Well, maybe quite a bit more, given that I enjoy reading.</p>
