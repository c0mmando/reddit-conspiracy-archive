       They've decided to define for us what's "safe" to see and what isn't. All these shitty videos of the events that are released to the MSM are hyped-up click bait with falsely advertised warnings. For example, "WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT: Dallas protest shooting" .. nothing but a blurred potato video with maybe a lone body lying on the pavement 75 yards away, and that's it. So what they're doing is making 75% of the people avoid even looking at
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       - a scam video that has nothing, and would be literally rated G. But the boomer types can knit-n-bitch about "all the violence that's in the news" and "they're sick of it all". Even though there's never a single shot of anything on video or pic, ever. LEL

       I'm also curious to learn more about this guy's military record. Apparently there were some strange circumstances around his release and the charges he faced which resulted in his discharge.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c729e6812af54ace96fc8927a7204bf0/dallas-sniper-was-loner-army-sent-him-home-afghanistan">
        From this article:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For six years starting in 2009, Johnson served in the Army Reserve as a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry, the military said.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May 2014, six months into his Afghanistan tour, he was accused of sexual harassment by a female soldier. The Army sent him stateside, recommending an "other than honorable discharge," said Bradford Glendening, the military lawyer who represented him.
       </p>
       <p>
        That recommendation was "highly unusual," Bradford said, since counseling is usually ordered before more drastic steps are taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        "In his case, it was apparently so egregious, it was not just the act itself," Glendening told The Associated Press. "I'm sure that this guy was the black sheep of his unit."
       </p>
       <p>
        According to a court filing Glendening read over the phone Friday, the victim said she wanted Johnson to "receive mental help," while also seeking a protective order to keep him away from her and her family, wherever they went. Johnson was ordered to avoid all contact with her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glendening said Johnson was set to be removed from the Army in September 2014 because of the incident, but instead got an honorable discharge months later — for reasons he can't understand.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Someone really screwed up," he said. "But to my client's benefit."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How often does the military just forget they're disciplining a soldier?

       Paperwork for a fuckup doesn't go "missing". Too many people have honor at stake (at least they did when I was in) to let a shitbag like that go with an honorable discharge. Cases like these often pick up high-ranking champions that chaperone the entire process.

       Explosions could be heard from the news crew that was filming from the 7-11 at around 3:30am-ish. It sounded like it could have been a flash bang, but I suppose you don't need too much explosive to execute one guy.

       this cannot be legal, siege and water cannon/hoses would be more humane and legal.
