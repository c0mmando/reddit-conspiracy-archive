    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve decided to define for us what&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; to see and what isn&#39;t. All these shitty videos of the events that are released to the MSM are hyped-up click bait with falsely advertised warnings. For example, &quot;WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT: Dallas protest shooting&quot; .. nothing but a blurred potato video with maybe a lone body lying on the pavement 75 yards away, and that&#39;s it. So what they&#39;re doing is making 75% of the people avoid even looking at <em>that</em> - a scam video that has nothing, and would be literally rated G. But the boomer types can knit-n-bitch about &quot;all the violence that&#39;s in the news&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re sick of it all&quot;. Even though there&#39;s never a single shot of anything on video or pic, ever. LEL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also curious to learn more about this guy&#39;s military record. Apparently there were some strange circumstances around his release and the charges he faced which resulted in his discharge. </p>

<p><a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c729e6812af54ace96fc8927a7204bf0/dallas-sniper-was-loner-army-sent-him-home-afghanistan">From this article:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For six years starting in 2009, Johnson served in the Army Reserve as a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry, the military said.</p>

<p>In May 2014, six months into his Afghanistan tour, he was accused of sexual harassment by a female soldier. The Army sent him stateside, recommending an &quot;other than honorable discharge,&quot; said Bradford Glendening, the military lawyer who represented him.</p>

<p>That recommendation was &quot;highly unusual,&quot; Bradford said, since counseling is usually ordered before more drastic steps are taken.</p>

<p>&quot;In his case, it was apparently so egregious, it was not just the act itself,&quot; Glendening told The Associated Press. &quot;I&#39;m sure that this guy was the black sheep of his unit.&quot;</p>

<p>According to a court filing Glendening read over the phone Friday, the victim said she wanted Johnson to &quot;receive mental help,&quot; while also seeking a protective order to keep him away from her and her family, wherever they went. Johnson was ordered to avoid all contact with her.</p>

<p>Glendening said Johnson was set to be removed from the Army in September 2014 because of the incident, but instead got an honorable discharge months later â€” for reasons he can&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>&quot;Someone really screwed up,&quot; he said. &quot;But to my client&#39;s benefit.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How often does the military just forget they&#39;re disciplining a soldier? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paperwork for a fuckup doesn&#39;t go &quot;missing&quot;. Too many people have honor at stake (at least they did when I was in) to let a shitbag like that go with an honorable discharge.

<p>this cannot be legal, siege and water cannon/hoses would be more humane and legal.</p>

<p>it would be possible to temporarily incapacitate anybody with enough water directed at and around them.</p>
