<p>Obama&#39;s been a bit more careful, but the same illegal NSA and CIA practices have continued under his administration. Drone killing of US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki. Breach of Pakistani sovereignty during &quot;OBL&quot; assassination. </p>

I am sure they did not tell them beforehand and its up to Pakistan to complain and they are way too embarrassed/fearful to do any such thing.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so much misinfo and disinfo surrounding that raid it&#39;s hard to say anything for sure. I think the latest official story is that someone from ISI revealed the location of &quot;OBL&quot; to the US without the knowledge of his superiors for some million dollar reward. I somewhat doubt the real OBL was even killed in the raid, likely having died years earlier of kidney disease. </p>

<p>Even taking their story at face value, Pakistan <em>did</em> complain afterwards, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/10169655/US-raid-that-killed-bin-Laden-was-an-act-of-war-says-Pakistani-report.html">calling the raid &quot;an act of war&quot;</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The raid demonstrated Washington&#39;s &quot;contemptuous disregard of Pakistan&#39;s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity in the arrogant certainty of … unmatched military might&quot;, the report stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even if their diplomatic and foreign aid position forced them not to complain, that would not make Obama&#39;s actions any less criminal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ha ha. sorry about the off topic post. i thought you were responding to something else. as to this comment, there are stories of someone, i think it may have been vince foster, where his suicide was highly questionable, as in he managed to zip himself up in a body bag, something which took detectives like five or more times to get right, there may have been two bullets wounds, and something weird about his suicide note. i looked for the article again but couldn&#39;t find it. i&#39;m not exaggerating that i read that article. who wrote it and where it is now, i don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump rarely responds directly to Clinton on Twitter. And bringing up the CF as a retort would often be a bit of a non sequitur. He needs to use this when he&#39;s attacked for something related--e.g., something to do with Russia where he can bring up the CF bribes over uranium.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the worst thing Trump did for his poll numbers was speak about Judge Curiel. He was actually leading Clinton in some polls just before that. He&#39;s still only down 5 points though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream media still, sadly, maintains the narrative for the majority of the population. And because they are biased (and we could also say controlled by those that own networks, that want the media to work in a way that maintains their own political and economic power), this presents a very significant problem.</p>

<p>So even if &quot;we&quot; haven&#39;t forgotten it, the mainstream media will make sure the majority of the population will forget it very quickly.</p>

<p>Sadly, I would say, because something isn&#39;t on CNN or Fox News, most people do forget it fairly quickly.</p>

<p>I do hope I&#39;m wrong, but I feel like if I was and the mainstream media is not successfully controlling the minds of the masses, the US would be a very different country by now.</p>

<p>Unlikely, but assuming HRC does win the election, the Republicans would still most likely retain the house, and possibly even gain a few seats.

<p>1) Clinton gave favorable treatment as sec of state after Saudia Arabia donated ms to Clinton Foundation to name one.</p>

<p>&quot;The bureau has been reported to be pursuing an investigation related to the foundation, though it has never officially acknowledged it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/286900-fbi-wont-rule-out-probe-into-clinton-foundation">http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/286900-fbi-wont-rule-out-probe-into-clinton-foundation</a></p>

<p>2) Perjury</p>

<p>Referral for investigation already made. Lying to Congress. Video of her statement juxtaposed to Comey findings is all over net.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bPK-eRrNpls">https://youtu.be/bPK-eRrNpls</a></p>

<p>Edit add video of the perjury:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6Z8pnk2rvYo">https://youtu.be/6Z8pnk2rvYo</a></p>

<p>3) Youre behind on news. State Department reopened their investigation after Comeys report. </p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/apnewsbreak-state-department-reopens-clinton-emails-probe-40420129">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/apnewsbreak-state-department-reopens-clinton-emails-probe-40420129</a></p>

<p>4) Nauh?</p>

<p>The article i site above is Huff post discussing the legitimacy of such a movement by Congress for impeachment,  that was before Comeys statement.</p>

<p>Shes unelectable.</p>

<p>She was not charged based on her lack of sophistication that is not saying much about a secretary of state and definitely not about the president of the United States.</p>

<p>Comey amazingly allowed the idea of ignorance of the law to protect Clinton.</p>

If that were true why would they even address the scandal whatsoever and repeatedly address it? Media literally addressed it at the beginning of the week. You&#39;re just a dumbass looking for suspicion where it doesn&#39;t exist. News plays the news. Shootouts and nationwide race protests are news. Get real, please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have left reddit for <a href="https://voat.co/">Voat</a> due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  </p>

<p>The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  </p>

<p>The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  </p>

<p>As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I&#39;ve ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.  </p>

<p>If you would like to do the same, install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">TamperMonkey</a> for Chrome, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">GreaseMonkey</a> for Firefox, <a href="https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit">NinjaKit</a> for Safari, <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/">Violent Monkey</a> for Opera, or <a href="http://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a> for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10905-reddit-overwrite-extended">this GreaseMonkey script</a>.   </p>

<p>Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.  </p>

<p>After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on <a href="https://voat.co/">Voat</a>!</p>

They was told that theses emails could not be viewed in an open court room and they each would have to be vetted before they could see them.

<p>She is a private citizen at this point. She used her own server for her emails (and, as noted, wasn&#39;t all that different than others like powell and such who used a private system). One person sent her three emails with a (C) in a paragraph. </p>

<p>I would bet dollars to donuts that if we did a complete investigation of everyone in government we would find problems they had with something. But congress only cares about this one person - and that is because of politics.</p>

<p>No, they didn&#39;t. They did not have an e-mail server at home where it was free from FOIA requests. They used the RNC servers. Not quite private.</p>
