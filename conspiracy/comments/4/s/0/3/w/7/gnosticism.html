    <div class="md"><p>I really enjoy the ideas of Gnosticism.  My hardest part is believing in any of the writings. As soon as you realize that the Bible isn&#39;t a factual book, I don&#39;t understand how you can take excerpts and say that proves anything.  I&#39;m taking about the Gnostic Bible and it&#39;s varied influences, I believe in the kybalion and the common rules... Just trying to fit that in my pantheistic worldview.</p>

<p>Because I read too much Philip K Dick as a kid, and I think we&#39;re probably living in a simulation.</p>

<p>Elaine Pagels is a Princeton theologian who writes a lot on the Gnostic Gospels.  I&#39;d definitely recommend her work for anyone interested in the concepts and the history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosticism has many offshoots of belief systems, some believing Lucifer to believe the God of Light, freewill and goodness. For others like the Cathars the demiurge was that of the Old Testament and the state of suffering we live in; the supernatural being that we associate with the Devil. In other words, for the Cathars, Roman Catholics were voluntarily worshipping Satan and Lucifer by loving and holding onto the materialistic world. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Personally, Cathars can be comparable to &quot;Western Buddhists&quot; in some ways because they considered that their view of the doctrine of &quot;resurrection&quot; taught by Jesus was, in fact, similar to the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation. So I think there&#39;s some objective truths among ALL of these belief systems; some overt some hidden in secret and in parabolas.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Cathars taught that to regain angelic status one had to renounce the material self completely. Until one was prepared to do so, he/she would be stuck in a cycle of reincarnation, condemned to live on the corrupt Earth among Lucifer and his demons. </p>

<hr/>

<p>While I disagree with some of the Cathars beliefs, I find them to be the purest regarding the following of the path of &#39;Jesus&#39;. For one, Killing was abhorrent to the Cathars. Consequently, abstention from all animal food was enjoined of the Perfecti. War and capital punishment were also condemnedâ€”an abnormality in Medieval Europe! In a world where few could read, their rejection of oath-taking marked them as social outcasts! Cathars saw women equally capable of being spiritual leaders, which undermined the very concept of gender held by the Catholic Church and did not go unnoticed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Hey, it&#39;s okay though becuase the Catholic crusaders and Pope Innocent III attempted to end Catharism by sending missionaries and by persuading the local authorities to act against them; inciting and committing false flags to entice and push a mass consensus towards Cathar genocide. Thousands were later burnt and tortured to death, what a peaceful religion Roman Catholicism is! </p>

<hr/>

<p>Cathers might have also been an offshoot of Bogumils, who believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body, much like the Cathars believed. They both had a dualistic approach to their belief system. But when we talk about moderate dualism: there is one good God and a fallen angel (Lucifer). </p>

<hr/>

<p>They did not use the Christian cross nor build churches because they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Interesting that they revered their gifted form and had zero statues. Seems as if this is what Jesus supposedly preached. It wasn&#39;t merely about worshiping as it was having a relationship with God and following the path towards spiritual emancipation. I personally believe Roman Catholicism, historically is an evil and manipiulative belief system that is utilized as a control system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, actually, out of the many deities this one, The One, makes some sense. I believe the Hindu faith shares a similar makeup, where there is one &quot;creator&quot; and then many gods beneath it. As described by a Hindu friend of mine, &quot;the Creator is the CEO and all the other gods are department heads and managers&quot;. It seems like a natural heirarchy. Everything comes from something... why not give it a name? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason that Catharism was a Catholic heresy (misguided acts of violence aside), is because Christian Gnosticism only makes sense if you call God described in the Old Testament &quot;evil&quot;, and seperate from the God of the New Testament. </p>

<p>Since most Christians then and now consider the God of the Old and New Testaments to be one and the same, most Christians think of Catharism as blasphemy and heresy.</p>

<p>The New Testament has several references to the Old Testament and in many times references the God of the New Testament, at least indirectly, as the same God as the God of the Old Testament. It&#39;s honestly very difficult to twist the New Testament into describing a different God from the Old Testament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have answers this in your own mind already. </p>

<p>In the case your question was real, I would say no. I am by no means anti Christian, but I really want to know what I believe in is as close to the source. I went back and read everything I could about the time The church was formed. I read various bibles, the apocrypha, Dead Sea scrolls etc.. I found my self looking into the cult of mythra and Zoroastrianism along with a few other pre Christian belief systems. I came to the point that I believe the Christian faith is much older than what modern doctrine. At first this seemed like everything I was told was a lie, but then I realized that dates are not what make a religion, it is the fundamental teachings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I belong to God only. Oral tradition makes proper dating impossible so yeah. There were &quot;watchers&quot; cast out of heaven before the flood. Plenty of humans worshipped these beings as gods, as well as the offspring of these fallen angels (popular nephilim). Of course there is massive overlap in all religions, God affected the world with his blessings and punishments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosticism has many offshoots of belief systems, some believing Lucifer to believe the God of Light, freewill and goodness. For others like the Cathars the demiurge was that of the Old Testament and the state of suffering we live in; the supernatural being that we associate with the Devil. In other words, for the Cathars, Roman Catholics were voluntarily worshipping Satan and Lucifer by loving and holding onto the materialistic world.</p>

<p>Personally, Cathars can be comparable to &quot;Western Buddhists&quot; in some ways because they considered that their view of the doctrine of &quot;resurrection&quot; taught by Jesus was, in fact, similar to the Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation. So I think there&#39;s some objective truths among ALL of these belief systems; some overt some hidden in secret and in parabolas.</p>

<p>The Cathars taught that to regain angelic status one had to renounce the material self completely. Until one was prepared to do so, he/she would be stuck in a cycle of reincarnation, condemned to live on the corrupt Earth among Lucifer and his demons.</p>

<p>While I disagree with some of the Cathars beliefs, I find them to be the purest regarding the following of the path of &#39;Jesus&#39;. For one, Killing was abhorrent to the Cathars. Consequently, abstention from all animal food was enjoined of the Perfecti. War and capital punishment were also condemnedâ€”an abnormality in Medieval Europe! In a world where few could read, their rejection of oath-taking marked them as social outcasts! Cathars saw women equally capable of being spiritual leaders, which undermined the very concept of gender held by the Catholic Church and did not go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Hey, it&#39;s okay though becuase the Catholic crusaders and Pope Innocent III attempted to end Catharism by sending missionaries and by persuading the local authorities to act against them; inciting and committing false flags to entice and push a mass consensus towards Cathar genocide. Thousands were later burnt and tortured to death, what a peaceful religion Roman Catholicism is! __ Cathers might have also been an offshoot of Bogumils, who believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body, much like the Cathars believed. They both had a dualistic approach to their belief system. But when we talk about moderate dualism: there is one good God and a fallen angel (Lucifer).</p>

<p>They did not use the Christian cross nor build churches because they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing.</p>

<p>Interesting that they revered their gifted form and had zero statues. Seems as if this is what Jesus supposedly preached. It wasn&#39;t merely about worshiping as it was having a relationship with God and following the path towards spiritual emancipation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a person that almost got fell into the New Age Philosophy and then started studying the occult, I know that you are spot on. I recently purchased a first edition copy of morals and dogma for research, and it definitely puts Lucifer on a pedestal. The Freemasons will be judged. Ba&#39;al is the pretender god of 1,000 faces, and we must not fall for the rebel and trickster. You&#39;re spreading the Good Word inside Lucifer&#39;s spider web of lies. Don&#39;t be discouraged. Forever praise Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, he who was the true martyr for our worldly sin. God bless!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the first discovered writings on Gnosticism were done be early Christans who were demonizing them for their unorthodox beliefs. When you mention things like &quot;traps of Satan&quot; this is one of the primary reasons people start exploring the Gnostic school of thought as it breaks away from the fettering dogma of organized religion.</p>
