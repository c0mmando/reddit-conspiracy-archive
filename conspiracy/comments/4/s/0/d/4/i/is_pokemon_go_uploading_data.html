<p>If I ran a company which had a product like that, I&#39;d be logging GPS coordinates and associating them within the exif data of the photos themselves, and having them &quot;upload&quot; by default to the  cloud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear this in response towards a hell of a lot of conspiracies. But the thing is, not everybody involved actually has to be in the know. Most involved people are just doing their job, they may or may not know exactly what they are doing. They may not know what the other people working around them are doing, they may not know why they are doing what they are doing. People involved may have security clearances and other career related things being held at risk, which would easily be lost forever if you blabbed. </p>

<p>Basically, to have a good solid conspiracy, there needs to be very few people who actually know what is going on, and a lot of people who are just doing their job, unaware that they are contributing towards the larger conspiracy. They also may think they are part of the conspiracy but not know the true details. There are so many more ways I could continue going about this, but hopefully I have made my point.</p>

<p>people say phones have been reversed engineered an all, but not really. the firmware for the carrier level stuff is super hidden and untouchable...otherwise people would hack it to have free phone service. why pay if you can just bypass billing by hopping on the airwaves. the hidden data could be sent through this layer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no and just no. </p>

<p>The carrier stuff has been reverse engineered many years ago by people looking for information on how to scrub a imei from a phone.. </p>

<p>The free phone calls and data thing just is not possible, billing is handled on the carriers side and not in the phone, and a third party app has no way of accessing this on the last 3 generations of iPhone,
Neither phone has anything being transmitted which can&#39;t be captured via a hacked up version of wire shark if you are willing to root your own phone via usb to install it. 
 ( android on the other hand. That thing is so poorly designed that I surprised anyone who cares about security is willing to even let one of those things into their house. ) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but come on. Android and Apple phones are reverse engineered constantly due to millions of third party developers. Clandestine uploading of terabytes of data daily right out in the open with not one of them noticing their phone is just flinging private information to the ether is on such a scale as to be absurd.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to steal millions of people&#39;s private data - they willingly upload it every day to servers. PokÃ©mon Go doesn&#39;t have to be anything more than what it already is to trawl data. It&#39;s an unnecessary risk with a very high chance of detection.</p>

<p>But on that note this game has only been around for a few days, it&#39;s rather unlikely that anybody has been playing around with the game at the exact same time to actually see what it&#39;s sending.. </p>

<p>Honestly if you are paranoid enough all it takes to figure this out is about 1/8th of a brain and $100 to buy a developer account. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a mobile app game based on the series. You are essentially roaming your city and searching for pokemon. 
The app uses google maps to create a virtual map on your phone and pokemon spawn at different locations around you. 
When you are near one, your phone alerts you and you can catch em all. There are other things like gym battles and ingame stores to pick up items and you go around searching for these in real life.
When you are about to capture a pokemon, you point your camera at it and the pokemon is in the picture with realworld backgrounds(i.e. a pokemon in your bathroom would appear in the tub on your screen)
This is what I have gathered about it so far. No plans on dowloading</p>

<p>But on that note this game has only been around for a few days, it&#39;s rather unlikely that anybody has been playing around with the game at the exact same time to actually see what it&#39;s sending.. </p>

<p>Honestly if you are paranoid enough all it takes to figure this out is about 1/8th of a brain and $100 to buy a developer account. </p>
