        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From <a href="https://archive.is/X3wbq">Wikipedia</a>, although it&#39;s been <em>scrubbed</em>, this is the archived version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently released documents show that although the horrors and atrocities of MKULTRA received most of the attention and public outrage over CIA mind control programs, the tortures earliest, deepest and most influential roots in fact found in the CIA&#39;s Project Artichoke.
This was the outcome planned by the CIA when it created Operation Dormouse. It operated out of the CIA&#39;s Security Research branch, and was launched as the 1975 Rockefeller Commission report and the subsequent Congressional hearings into CIA illegal activities chaired by Senators Frank Church and Teddy Kennedy started.</p>

<p>The idea was that by exposing the MKULTRA program by essentially offering it to the press, any investigative attempts into the Project Artichoke would be diverted.  In his 2009 book, A Terrible Mistake: The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA&#39;s Secret Cold War Experiments, H. P. Albarelli documents some of the atrocities of the project including terminal interrogations conducted in Germany under Project ARTICHOKE .  Operation Dormouse was a covert operation launched in 1975 by the CIA to divert attention from Project Artichoke.[1] Operation Dormouse was to divert attention from Project Artichoke and direct it to the infamous Project MKULTRA. [2]</p>

<p><strong>Among other participants, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld have been specifically implicated in Operation Dormouse, working with the CIA to suppress information on Artichoke from surfacing.[5][6]</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Cheney and Rumsfeld are deep shadow gov&#39;t. They scrubbed the Dormouse entry and neutered the entry on psychotronic weapons, even though the authors used solid references like the .mil paper &quot;The Mind Has no Firewall.&quot; I recommend readers here google that article and give it a read. It&#39;s still hosted on an army website and describes psychotronic weapons accurately and illustrates their terrifying nature.</p>
