       It's funny how so many people will call you nuts if you believe this kind of stuff. I guess they believe that governments would never hurt their own people, in stark contrast to historical facts that show otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, people kill each other for the most trivial reasons. What makes anyone think that people who are in power wouldn't do such a thing? (Yes I know the reasons)
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, as long as we can go to the stores and buy what we want and need, all is well. As long as were content and comfortable, nobody is going to rock the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget, we're simply livestock to the people in charge. Just cattle who need to be corralled and managed. When milk cows dry up, they go to the slaughter house.

       idk about the alien invasion thing.. but the other two options are on the table in my opinion. The elite have underground cities to run to. Do you think that a triggered yellowstone eruption is out of the question when it comes to a massive depopulation effort? it would be cheap and easy. a GMO virus designed to target specific genotypes is pretty much a reality so there is that too. I think you're insane for having such a narrow scope.

       Conspiring is literally at the heart of the human condition.  It's about everything we do from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep.  It's called 'ambition' and 'manipulation' and 'getting ahead' and 'greed' and and and.  We want and we will do anything to get what we want if that means taking a 20 out of your mom's purse to creating a planet of debt slaves.

       Oh I'm totally down with the alternative WW2 theories. I find it hard to believe Hitler was acting on his own, especially when you look at the connections with all the American companies.

      <p>
       I just meant from the "mainstream" point of view, Hitler would be the most recent that comes to mind, and it just becomes a huge list the further back you go. Now they all think that mentality has disappeared from men in power, when really they just hide under the guise of international corporations.

       I was certainly brought up to respect the powers that be. To do unto others as you want done unto you, etc. A Christian upbringing ingrains into you that people generally want to be good and strive to be good.

       No shit. Everyone in power uses something to exploit, marginalize and control everyone else in one way or another. Religion is only one paradigm to this end. Regardless of the paradigm, they exploit "weaker minded" people.

       Interesting. At first I was ready to take your statement apart, then I guess technically they could be considered the duality, poles of the same being. You either have a very deep knowledge or are just rambling off some crap you heard in church.

       I don't go to church. Churches the world over have been infiltrated.

      <p>
       I've read the bible and I've studied the workings and the behaviors of luciferians that control this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       They actually believe that lucifer will reign as king of the earth.

       You probably know what the bible has to say about that.

       I've been researching into this also, what do you think really is going on? Are they worshipping satan and/or demons? And is it working? And how is it working? Is satan real in your mind? And are they having sex rituals and stuff like in Eyes Wide Shut? Why are they doing that and what purpose does it fulfill? Are they abusing children in those sex rituals?

       Firstly, yes I believe the bible is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Satan and his angels have dominion over this earthly realm and his followers on Earth believe that he is the true God.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that through manipulation and deception he deceives humans into thinking that they have special powers through him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of his hatred for humankind, he demands obscenity and depravity for these so called gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a liar and forger, he is capable of nothing that wasn't already available to man through the grace of God his forgiveness offered through Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that's not a popular opinion these days, but it's obvious to anyone who would look, that the world is consumed by Satanic influence.

       Hmm and is Jehovah lucifer? Or satan? Because obviously jehovah is not the god jesus spoke of, because jehovah is clearly mentioned as a god of war, and acts like one Jehovah in Hebrew means god of mischief (Je: God Hovah/havah: mischief)

       I think Satan has gone to great lengths to confuse the name of the one true God and masquerades as such.

       This is why God ended the game with his Son Yeshua, the Roman, Jesus Christ.

       I remember I was about to graduate high school when boom the announcement just popped up on CNN. I was so stoked, then like 2 days later they just "threw the body overboard" and didn't take pictures because "it was so graphic". And that's when everything changed and I started questioning things and looking into 9/11 documentaries

       Yes they definitely do not want us to know much about these topics either... This kind of goes with all the different aspects of being a self-sufficient independent human being. They want us to be completely dependent on their system and never think past the entertainments they allow and the politics they dish out.

       I think the reason this isn't the most obvious is because it disregards Einstein's physics, which is admittedly physics as WE understand it. However, the fact that the universe is recordedly expanding faster than a photon can travel allows for the idea that although we aren't alone, it's damn hard to travel to and from celestial bodies if we have any sort of mass. I understand the limitations of this statement, such as Einstein's laws allowing that you can travel slower and faster than the speed of light as long as it isn't the precise value, but until we have a better understanding of the universe it's hard to justify the idea of aliens among us in my opinion.

       Do you know why they're heavily pushing Dan Brown, "The Secret" (law of attraction), New Age, spirituality, ancient aliens, Harry Potter, etc? Do you know why George Soros is funding the psychedelics legalization movement?

       They want us to wake up. Not necessarily to the "truth", but at least to something that would seem closer to the truth. That way, we will embrace the new world order when this old one has descended into chaos, mayhem, war and natural disasters -- and it's time for the new one to be introduced. Because the NWO people/beings will be the ones telling us the truth (or supposed truth) about the corrupt, horrible nature of the OWO.

       What does praying, savior religions, the law of attraction, moral relativism, the new age movement and consumerism have in common?
      </p>
      <p>
       They all displace personal responsibility, why save yourself if you have a savior? Why do any real action, if magic action is taking care of it? Why do what is right, if right and wrong are illusory? Why be in charge of your personal life, if uncle Sam has your back?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its an act of misdirection, so that we won't realize our personal responsibility, we won't realize the universal laws that dictate fate, we won't realize the sanity necessary to become anything more than consumers, and we won't save ourselves from tyranny with real action.
      </p>
      <p>
       When dealing with false ideologies, you have to be aware of what is being robbed when you accept that ideology. 
Progressively, the agenda is to get a majority of people thinking more and more pragmatic and subservient, to the point their pragmatism and subservience will endorse the agenda of genocide, one world order, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of New Age propaganda is astounding, Eckhart tolles book "New Earth", The Celestine Prophecy, all of the books written by channelled aliens which say a one world order is a prerequisite to becoming part of some universal order of enlightened beings. Its everywhere, it has tainted the minds of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether intentional or not, books like the Celesine Prophecy who say globalist agenda crap like it's the next spiritual age of the planet, are brainwashing those who don't have the intellect to see the bullshit.

       I 1000% agree with you.  If you notice my other post I go into detail about my experiences with new age.  It's a dangerous cult, and it defies God, the one who invented the entire spiritual realm that new age is based from.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing valuable to gain from the new age movement, it's all just games with evil spirits.  Accepting God and his 'archaic' philosophies is infinitely more rewarding than what you can gain from the new age movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I follow Christ, for all the reasons you listed above actually.  I don't see Jesus' savior status as a reason to be apathetic or absolve personal responsibility, but simply to save us from absolute damnation which we would be destined for no matter what.  We used to make bloody sacrifices to God to absolve ourselves, and Jesus was God returning the favor to us.  It was not an excuse to absolve responsibility.  We are still expected to accept God and his morality and hold ourselves accountable to our actions, even though God will apparently accept you into heaven even if you give yourself to him within your final hour.  God accepts people this way because after Jesus' sacrifice, he is being forgiving enough to accept us when we come to him on our own, but I don't think a person who abuses that policy by abstaining faith in God until they are conveniently on their death bed will be taken seriously by God.  I simply can't fathom that, it just doesn't make sense, they are not really giving him their faith at that point.  This seems obvious to me, but I understand that many Christians misinterpret what they're taught, and many preachers do not teach as well as they should.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot speak for Christianity as a whole, I'm not well studied on the Bible, and many followings have different perceptions of what Jesus' sacrifice meant.  I do agree with you though, that any ideology absolving you of personal responsibility is not good, and that's what brought me to my personal beliefs.

       As long as God's principles are realized and the path of personal development is taken, it's all good.

      <p>
       A lot of Christians get stunted in growth with the stamp of approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe there is a universal code, laws of the universe that god made himself manifest as. Christianity can lead to seeing that code very easily, and in following that code, they in fact follow in the steps of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those laws do get trampled on and spat on by the "antithesis and chaos movement", people who expound principles that go against what the real principles of life are, perverting everything and turning it all upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       They rely on getting in the minds of the majority, and twisting beliefs to fit agendas, twisting them to be in defiance of God's principles. Creating movements and pumping money into them. Definitely ploys of evil men.

       The Christian community has been infiltrated by false preachers for a long time and they know it.  They do speak out against it, and there are public voices.  Christian scholars on radio and podcasts etc that spread the good faith, and take calls from Christians and engage them when their beliefs are bigoted or apathetic, but it's a constant battle.  Everytime I listen to Don Gossip and John McArthur on 550am taking calls from the community there's always a dumbass with bad opinions and they challenge them vigilantly, and without being holier than thou.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it's a black Christian who really doesn't get the ideology and puts their race before their faith and ultimate wisdom, or a redneck who hates everything to do with gays, they challenge them and try to bring them to a good understanding and position that God intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's always people who either don't put their teachings first, or fixate on one lesson instead of balancing all the lessons equally for the ultimate teaching.  They let their personal life and politics overshadow their faith.  It's a constant battle with no easy answers, because the teachings are not simple, they're as complex as reality itself and full of exceptions that come off as contradictions.  But at least they acknowledge the problems within their own community and take steps against them.

       I see that all the time, it's very difficult to find someone who actually read, studied and understood the bible. That's the true difficulty, some of those believing miss the point hard, and then teach that misunderstanding to others. The bible is cryptic, and acts like a labyrinth of text you have to not only ingest, but also meditate upon for a while. Understanding the thing is a definite undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone understood the whole bible, I still feel it misdirects people, instills subservience, and rids a person of personal responsibility. That code of spiritual laws is incomplete in the bible, and it's riddled with immorality and illogical rambling, I come to feel about the bible the same way I feel about new age books, just interjecting lies with truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is based on blood sacrifice, and the god I know would condemn such a thing.

      <p>
       But that's just some guys opinion on the internet, good people will be good people no matter what religion.

       I know, it's mind boggling how even people open minded enough to recognize the many conspirators of the world still buy the big Christian lie and somehow not recognize it as another tool of control used to manipulate people. Obviously it can do some good for some but you can say that about anything. It's still a very simplified and generic version of 'spirituality' If there is anything powerful as 'God' it is contained within all of us EQUALLY, everything is relative, including time. We all are essentially 'God' but that is a pill too large for many to swallow. It is the fear of being responsible for that kind of power that prevents most people from grasping that ultimate truth.

       I agree with majority of that. I identify as Christian but feel what we have today (in all religion) is so altered, twisted and so butchered it is hard to swallow and if you manage it it can be as harmful (most often) as it is helpful. They try and get everyone to sit around idle and wait for someone to come and fix it all for them and give them their new identity and fix everything for them. No one works to better themselves or hone their discernment for what is happening in the world around them in order to wake up and put a stop to whats happening. Thats exactly how they poison us with their "illusion". I do however think a global cooperative society is highly plausible just not under the narratives we have been fed for a LONG time.

       Have you ever checked out any of these books or theories?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read countless spiritual books and thoroughly enjoy the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of those books call for a one world government because it would unite us all as humans and pave the way for no more wars, better abundance and prosperity for all, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       People automatically hear or see the word one world government and go into panic paranoid mode because of the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage you to do more research on these topics. It is powerful stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       One book I recommend that goes into a one world government is called conversations with God (all 3 books)

       I have read oodles of them, I'd say I at least have read ten books purely about channelled information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought at the time if someone was having signals from out of this world get beamed into theirs heads, that they might have something to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again it's all that interjecting truth with lies, getting people to think a line of pragmatic thinking that leads to the solution we need a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       One world government equals deprivation of personal rights for the individual world wide, and that whatever they wish to instill upon us, can be brainwashed into us through their total control of media, news, and politics. Giving a select amount of humans rule over others, leads to bad things when there is corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of the world should rule themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those books did say there would be a consciousness shift, where everyone starts experiencing the spiritual and becomes more harmonized to the point we're just one with each other. I'd say that'd be a proper time to become part of a galactic federation.

       I have noticed this idea ... a controlled induced awakening. To mitigate the impact of actual awakening. To further manipulate knowing that certain knowledge can't be hidden or locked away... so go the other way and let it all out at their own pace and agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still this growing mass of truly awake people... so it will be interesting to see how they roll out this 'forced awakening' of the NWO.

       It's not a true controlled awakening.  It's a misguided one.  The new age movement is handing people into the hands of evil spirits, feeding them to the wolves.  There are evils in the spiritual realm and the new age movement is deliberately pushing narratives that do not teach people how to protect themselves from those evil spirits, or it is teaching rituals that give them power under the guise of other forms of magik.  Those that know how to safely navigate astral projection without falling prey to the evil spirits never make into the public sphere.  The 2nd deception of the new age doctrine is that there is no God, or that you are the God of yourself.  This is bullshit.  There's a God, and the spiritual realm or 'network' is just another one of his inventions, that the souls he created can tap into.  This network is how God reaches us as well, it's the foundation of all mainstream religions.  We don't have to open up to God or accept him to access this realm, and the new age movement pays no attention to this either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found those that do, and followed their practices.  I have successfully performed past life regression and asked for healing help from the spirits, and gave specific commands to the spirits that don't have my best intentions at heart to leave me alone, and felt their presence fade.  I was helped by the good spirits and given a reality shattering spiritual awakening, including vivid visions of what I can only imagine to be the 4th dimension or spiritual realm where our souls originated from, followed by a euphoric state of mind that lasted well into the next day before our material reality brought me back down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't get back when I tried again, I guess they only visited me the one time and told me all they wanted to say.  But the new age movement definitely doesn't intend to help people reach what I did.  They want people to go out and take help from evil spirits who do the devil's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to believe my story and personal experiences, but I strongly suggest you heed my warning.  Do not take the spiritual realm lightly.  And if I were you, I'd stick to the teachings of Christianity or something.  I've been around the astral block once or twice and tapped into things most hippies only dream of being able to do, and I chose simple worship of Christ at the end of it.  I hope that says something to you about what's out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you listen to Yuri Bezmenov you'll find the Soviet Union had a special interest in the promotion of the new age movement as well.  There is a reason for that and it is not one of good intentions.

       Yea in my research and inner intuition and discernment after lengthy prayer and then meditation that it became quite obvious. There is a thin line between legit good entities and deceitful help from the outside and should never seek them outwardly. The bible is disgustingly twisted and they take the good and append lies to it and half truths or remove parts of it altogether. they try to twist Yeshua and true nature of God into what they want you to want it to be. If that discourages you or seems taxing (or you get hip to the twisting of the truth) they then want you to grasp on to some spiritual new age stuff which is fine if you got it figured out and have a B.S. filter. But that rarely happens and you get duped in to wanting to channel or listen to channelers and invite nasty deceptive spirits in. All I can say is look inside deeply and listen. We are all children and sons of God and connected to him. Seek God ask Yeshua for help and help from within with intuition and discernment. Yeshua saw the matrix and the lie and tried to show us how to end it via forgiveness and compassion and love. Don't seek out all manner of random spirits or aliens or whatever they masquerade as. There is beings on all manner of planes of existence as well as the physical Aliens/Angels/Fallen Angels/Demons or whatever name they try and use. They ensured we were lied to for 1000's of years. They play on that knowing we don't know what entities are the good side or the bad. If someone/thing contacts you pray and demand it reveal itself in the name of Yeshua and the most high Creator. Pray diligently and seek discernment and contact with God the Creator from within yourself via our Holy Spirit/Link with God is always on and always there no need to look elsewhere. You have a responsibility to also give love, forgiveness and compassion to others to develop your connection with prayer and meditation. Sitting blindly waiting for a savior doing nothing will dull your sense of discernment so when the time comes you won't be able to tell the real deal from a false teacher.

       "they" didn't 'give us the web"!  we gave it to ourselves!
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the free high speed dissemination of information via the internet is something TPTB
       <em>
        failed to account for
       </em>
       , they didn't see the 'communications revolution' coming and it has severely undermined  their ability to 'control the flow of information' which is essential for successful propaganda ,, something they know all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, many people 'believe their bullshit' ,, but those people most likely get their 'information' from the MSM which is effectively controlled worldwide by 6 'companies' ... and are completly controlled by TPTB
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had control of the Internet, we wouldn't be discussing this here now ... and they know the can't overtly take control of something 'the people created that is essentially 'free speech' BUT they can fund things like the NSA and make laws that allow them to basically hack people with impunity ,,, AFAIK the NSA has stopped SFA 'terrorist attacks' so what do you think is done with such extensive resources?
      </p>
      <p>
       They use the internet as a propaganda tool, paying shills to derail information which challenges their game plan with 'co-intel debuking' or limited hangouts, as well as convince ignorant people online, to change their views by convincing them to join their pack. Most people are easily led when they think 'everyone agrees' about something, most people don't want to be different and stand out
      </p>
      <p>
       The Internet has exposed TPTB in many ways, and they don't like it. They wish they could control it and the day they do is the day you know you're truly fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that day never comes

       If you're curious about Obama and the Bible as far as Antichrist goes, you'll be interested in the story of Akhenaten the ancient Pharaoh who invented monotheism.  Some people believe Obama is the clone of Akhenaten.  It doesn't help that Obama has actually gone to Akhenaten's tomb on video and commented on his personal likeness to the Pharaoh.

       The new age movement is a half truth movement.  Our true spiritual power is greater than they let on, and the new age movement tries to bring us into that world - but does so in a way similar to letting a kid drive and not teaching him how first.  There are evil and good spirits out there, and the new age movement makes no effort whatsoever to help people protect themselves in the spiritual realm.  If anything it is deliberately feeding them to the wolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are those in the spirituality movement who know the truth, those that know how to protect themselves when reaching into the spiritual realm, and they are never given the same coverage as the others.  They go to TED talks and get their talks added to the ban list.  Or they write their books and philosophies only to find they never get any traction in the public sphere.

       Huh, it was a different tomb, of Kar not Akhenaten.  Weird.  I never looked too closely into it and jumped from the phony conspiracy to akhenaten documentaries which were more interesting, so I think the original content I saw was a little shit, and I don't know why they used clip of this footage to connect the akhenaten conspiracy.

       Awesome list. Agree 100% on every last line. But I'm pretty sure about Osama's death. Half the SEALS that were on the raid died in a helicopter crash. Many of the others died in various ways. Osamas death was announced the same weekend Obama released his phony birth certificate (the one that says his fathers  home country was Kenya - even though Kenya wasn't a country at the time). Obama scored points for taking out Osama while distracting from the birth certificate issue. Rense has a good article about the helicopter crash.

       written by Baroness Blixen under the pen name Isak Dineson, and Kenya was most definitely referred to as a country by her during her time there, and she wrote her book in 1937.

       Trump has been a Clinton supporter
       <em>
        long before

       this election. He was never supposed to succeed, he was just there to "pretend to oppose" Shillary and take attention (and 'oppostion votes') away from Sanders ... it's all part of an elaborate ruse, there's no way TPTB would allow anyone but Shillary to become next POTUS

       I'm not sure if Trump is part of some elaborate ruse to get Hillary elected. I tend to think that this was all nothing more than a publicity stunt that went
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       out of hand. Trump, ever the flamboyant billionaire, just wanted to drum up some attention for himself, so he ran for president. He knows he is untouchable. He knows he can say outrageous things and get away with it. He knows that is a big part of his charm and lasting appeal in pop culture. It's just another extension of his persona, like his goofy hair and overbearing New Yorker tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that Trump never expected to make it this far, nor did he ever want to. He wanted someone else in his party to win really badly, but he underestimated the anger and stupidity of the American public and they just kept pushing him along. You really think he wants to give up his empire to get into the office and start aging in dog years after they take him into the back room and show him the JFK "This could be you if you don't play ball" video? Come on, America. Don't be so dense.

       We are on the same page brotha. I woke up in 2007, literally right before Ron Paul stepped on stage. Been reading books and doing internet research ever since. I just about agree with 99% with everything you said, and I only say that cuz saying 100% just feels weird. The truth is universal and seeing posts like this reinforces that to me. Cheers

       Great list, you're on the right path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd argue that the Israel / Zionism and Illuminati / TPTB are in some way strongly related. Check out the board of directors for
       <strong>
        Genie Energy
       </strong>
       , then check out the members of Bush Jr's foreign policy cabinet aka
       <strong>
        "The Vulcans"
       </strong>
       (specifically Rabbi Dov Zakheim, comptroller of the Pentagon during 9/11, just type this guy's name into Google and see what comes up). Most of these people have serious ties and allegiance to Israel and they've been in high positions of wealth, power, and the US government. None of their interests seem to be for the greater good of Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much money have we given Israel? And now it's illegal in some places to boycott them? And there's an anti-semitism movement happening as well to prevent them from being criticized? Ummmm yeah. We clearly pander to Israel why might that be? Could Israel be a rogue nation who is owned &amp; operated by our own shadow government? Their prime minister is literally in Genie Energy's back pocket. And then there's Genel Energy with another Rothschild and the CEO of BP oil (BP used to be part of the Rockefeller Standard Oil Cartel that funneled American secrets to Nazi Germany)...hopefully someone can research stronger ties between all this stuff because I suspect it is there.

       They're not scapegoats if they're actually involved. They would be more like people lower down on the hierarchy to take the heat off of the top people.

       So why dont you have a problem with any other genocides? Like the rawadan genocide. In your link, ops main point is its impossible to kill 5000 people a day but in Rawanda, 1000000 people were killed in 90 days, averaging 11, 000 a day and that was primarily with hatchets... Not systematic killing machines like the Nazis have. Claiming that the holocaust didnt happen discredits everything youve said because... Without even asking, i know youve never visited a concentration camp and would be willing to believe youve never even left the US, you probably have never left the states bordering your home state.

       I do have a problem with all genocides (of course)! I'm not saying it didn't happen. I believe the camps were real and many many people died... I guess I am just questioning the actual amounts of people and how they were killed. It seems like disease and starvation did more damage than anything, which is still a terrible tragedy. The holocaust topic is definitely a sensitive topic... I can easily believe it happened... just not sure about the details overall.

       What I've heard, and it sounds pretty plausible, is that the global elite back then funded the Nazis (proven) so that they may create a movement to take over the world(the Nazi movement) and the holocaust is another word for burnt offering, or a human sacrifice.

       You're right, Communist Soviet union is different than Nazism.

       There was supposedly a communist conspiracy to overthrow the US government, and the elite of the day funded and directed the war to their favor, the goal being the elite takes over everything.

       OP, this is by far the single best Reddit post I've ever come across in my years of browsing. By putting all of your beliefs on the table you've enabled so many others to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read into about 80% of all the theories posted in here but I really got to patch in some spots of haziness and uncertainty.

       I want to remind everyone in here that unless a user is being foul there shouldn't be any downvotes in this thread. This is a collective and we are all benefiting from it.

       Humans are doing mind control on insects. It's really disturbing. Example from 2008 (New Scientist):

       The Flat Earth thing is just for fun. An intellectual exercise, mostly. (At least from my perspective. I'm sure people pretend to take it seriously, sometimes convincingly so, as part of the fun. But who actually does?)

      <p>
       The moon landings... well, I guess we can't expect people to take it on faith that because a book said it's true that it is true, so... there's always going to be people trying to figure out if it actually happened or not.

       RE: "No plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania" - but, did a plane exist? Did the plane which was reported as crashed, ever take off from the airport? If so, who were the passengers? Were they real people? Did any of their families or friends ever see even one of them again? What about the flight crew, the pilots?
      </p>
      <p>
       Big difference between "there was no plane" and "we don't know where it went". Whether there was a plane or not at least should be verifiable. What did you find out?

       Debt slavery is enforced by food slavery. Gotta eat to live. Also, sleep slavery - gotta lie down undisturbed for a good number of hours every night. If not animals or weather, one needs to be kept safe from other human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       You find a way for people to be able to protect themselves at night without paying rent, you find a way for people to feed themselves without paying for it, debt slavery diminishes greatly in its hold on people.

       If someone knows that they can turn down a job they don't want because they are not afraid of starving/freezing, their options open up greatly. Whether they make good use of those options, is another matter. But at least, they have options.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here: What is an option that you, personally, would consider a viable alternative to rent? Not what you'd imagine other people would like, but what you would like (feel free to think of magical as well as realistic solutions, to help get your creative juices flowing). If enough people think of what would work for themselves, we might be able to implement something using those ideas.

       I watched this when it came out. My recollection was that it's a very clever piece of propaganda, but if you strip the message down, he is suggesting that:

       In 1969, humans had the technology to launch a computer-enabled module with three men into space, land two of those men on the moon in a separate lunar module (whilst the third orbited the moon in the Command module). The two men spent 21 hours on the moon in amazing high-tech space suits designed to cope with high levels of radiation and temperatures of 120+ degrees Celsius, filming themselves and transmitting a signal powerful enough to pass through the radioctive Van Allen Belts back to NASA on Earth. They then re-launched back off the moon, somehow (aka the bit nobody talks about) reconnected with the Command module which was orbiting the moon at thousands of kilometres per hour, and changed course to complete their 1 million+ kilometre journey back to Earth where they re-entered the atmosphere and landed without a scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT....in 1969, NASA did not have the technology to either record, or transmit live, footage of actors in a studio just up the road from NASA Mission Control in Houston.

       For the record, your making it sound much more complicated then it actually was to do all that moon landing stuff, both Russia and America had done most of those things already multiple times, NASA wasn't going into the moon landing blind, they know a lot of stuff already.

       You're missing the point. The television networks' ability to re-broadcast both live and recorded material also used tried and tested technology. NASA's tehnology to send "live footage" from the moon to Earth was not.

       Why would it be harder to transmit footage from the moon than it would be to transmit footage from a soundstage? Both would probably require communication with satellites in low earth orbit to relay the signal to TV's.

       That... actually sounds pretty plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although he seems to be forgetting that the gravity on the moon is a lot lower than earth's, thus you can use less fuel. Along with the fact the the moon has no atmosphere, thus you can use WAY more efficient fuels for ascent and descent. Also that thete are different types of fuels with varying efficenncy at varying situations, for example, kerosene and liquid oxygen is primarily used for ascent from earth, while hydrogen and liquid oxygen is used for vacuum and low atmosphere maneuvers.

       y'know I'd never really thought about the physics involved in the lunar lander 'lifting off' from the moon and then not only achieving escape velocity but then getting into the same orbit as the command module and actually docking with it! Plus the fact it had to get to 4,000mph to 'catch up' with the lunar orbiter. Where was the fuel kept? They show the lunar lander lifting off with a wee explosion .... hmmm?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're to believe what we're told about the moon's gravity being 1/6 of the earths, then it would've taken a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       larger burn than that little spurt we see that looks like some explosive bolts detonating.
      </p>
      <p>
       and yeah, now I think about it, I've never seen or heard anything more detailed about this part of the mission than that one clip that shows the lunar lander 'blasting off' and nothing about how they were able to accurately rendevous with the command module!

       are not Alien/UFO believers... I just can't help it because of the simple probability of it... and I'm a massive X-files fan. I'm sure it's wrecking my credibility of the post... but I have come across some really strange stuff like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Philip Schneider was a former US Government Geologist and Engineer, who was involved in producing the underground explosions which were required to facilitate the building of various underground military bases, as well as submarine bases for the United States Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claimed to be one of only three people who survived the infamous Alien/Human War at Dulce and Los Alamos, where 66 Government Agents and Workers supposedly lost their lives in August of 1979.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the last two years of his life he gave lectures about supposed classified information, including UFO's to the media and general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philip Schneider was found dead in his apartment on January 17, 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all 20 years ago! (meaning think of what has been done since then) Phil had nothing to gain from doing his lectures on these topics and he was shot for it (though he managed to survive throughout 1995). I highly recommend watching these old videos and see what he had to say. To me, this starts to tie in all kinds of conspiracy threads into making more and more sense of what is really going on...

       Its not a question really if you ask anyone these days if we're alone in the universe, I thinks its pretty obvious its not. If they have visited us or not, thats the question. Not if "alien" life exist.

       Im a total UFO believer. Ive watched many things about and made by Phil Schneider. I do think theres a DUMB buried under DIA with a massive tunnel system. What I dont know about is how the aliens interact with humans. If they live here, visit here, live under the ground....I just dont know. But they are out there.

       He also told us in one of his videos that they wanted to kill him for leaking this information and if he were to die it would be an assassination. Sure enough, suicide under suspicious circumstances. I remember different causes of death being released, overdose as well as strangulation, not sure which one it landed on.

       If you have a chance you should look into the real x files. It started with someone involved with the JFK assassination )sorry on mobile and the name escapes me). This guy was an informant for The FBI and was sending memos back to Hoover as far back as Kenneth Arnold. The header he used for his memos was File X. I believe it was the guy in the JFK movie played by Jack Lemon. Peter Levenda goes into great detail about it. If you haven't look into Levenda's research I highly recommend it.

       Lol, it's nothing too crazy I guess. Just the weirdest thing we ever saw.
      </p>
      <p>
       So me and my wife left her parents house kinda late and we lived an hour away. And it is almost all country driving that goes thru maybe 5 small towns up and down small hills.. So about 40 minutes in I see this bright light and I pointed it out to my wife and said " look at that. Looks like a 747 flying kinda low" she looks at it and says 'no that looks more like a radio tower with bright lights." I disagree at first and we go down and up a few  small hills and it's still there like a few miles out. I than agree since we are getting fairly close now and there were 3 bright light in a triangle shape...  but man, when we got about a mile away it turned and went south at a pretty darn fast rate of speed. I pulled over and rolled the windows down and was just excited as could be. It was a decent size object with an x-pattern at the back Triangle shape and blimpish looking.. My wife was shocked that it wasn't a tower. Lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am prior air force and I want everyone to know that we all believe in conspiracy's just as much as civilians if not more so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked around 747s alot while active duty which is why I thought this UFO I saw was a 747. But it was not, clearly. Also, after I got home I stayed outside just to watch the night sky and I heard fighter jets flyover. Coincidence?

       My father served as member of the military intelligence during the Vietnam war and told me about a strange occurrence. He and his buddies were picking up weird transmissions and when they went outside, I shit you not, they saw 3 bright lights in a triangle shape about 200 feet from their location. A second later, it was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind my father told me this story in the 1990s, which is a decade before people publicly talked about tri-light alien encounters.

       This is going down the Planet X rabbit hole... and I've gone far down this hole (lol)!
      </p>
      <p>
       When I learned typical estimates often suggest that 50% or more of all star systems are binary systems, I started to somewhat see the possibility that we are also in a binary star system and we do have another star that we spin around with that has some planets too.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where the Annunaki come in... They are possibly from this Planet X system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's believable in some cases and yet it's really hard to find anything credible or anyone doing anything serious about researching it.

       When you realize that the people in power and their employers are not quite human like the rest of us(autism spectrum, sociopaths/psychopaths) the evil behind the scenes becomes a lot more believable and unsurprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alien thing is really tough. We take life on earth for granted imo, its beyond a miracle that everything works. I don't believe whatever process which spawned the perfect blueprint for life as we know it could replicate itself again. If we were designed though, who knows. Whats stopping the designer from creating other experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I believe in the God of the Bible theory, it makes just as much sense as any origin of the universe theory; as in, none of them make sense. FYI the big bang theory is literally derived from the creation story in the book of genesis. It is simply an unoffensive and "scientific" approach to interpreting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I choose to believe that the angels and the earth were Gods sole experiments, and I choose to believe in good and evil. Life is simple for me this way and I don't get scared.

       Why though? If it happened once it will happen again and again no matter how rare will it not?

       When I was in Sunday school, this question was brought up. The Catholic explanation is that there really isn't an answer that we can comprehend. Kindasounds like copping out, but I realize now it's just the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, nothing tangible can exist forever. Everything real has to have some beginning. The universe started when God made it right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you get into abstracts, intangibles. For one, what was there before the universe? Just absolute nothingness? Is that possible? And two, how can we comprehend that God's existed forever? Did someone make him? Who made that guy? And so on and so on and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's literally either accepting that God existed forever, made himself out of nothing, or that the universe existed forever until random manifestation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a brain racker. Us Catholics consider this one of the "Great" or "Holy" mysteries, meaning that it can never make sense until we reach the next, higher plane of existence, enlightened as higher beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helped.

       god is 'energy' ... Energy is everywhere all the time, it cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another, "reality" is Energy vibrating space/time
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy contains All knowledge and all things contain energy, gravity is energy increasing the density of spacetime, electromagnetism is energy. Everything you are aware of is a manifestation of Energy in one form or another that our senses pick up on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the physical realm is not the only form of energy, there's 'spiritual energy' as well
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is the second highest manifestation of Energy in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentient life is the highest form as it's a sophisticated mix of many types of Energy's with physical and spiritual apects working together .. but what makes 'sentient Life' so special is 'consciousness',, it's awareness of itself and its surroundings and the fact it 'acts consciously'.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Consciousness is the highest representation of Energy on this plane/univerese. Conscious beings are the way Energy can be 'self aware' ,, and it's this 'self aware energy' which is God. That's why it's taught we a the children of God, we are!
      </p>
      <p>
       Conscious Life manipulation of Energy is the basis of much creation on this level
      </p>
      <p>
       it was, is and always has been, it has no beginning or end,
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is a representation of Energy in one form or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy is our father and we are it's children and the Life Force is our special gift as we are one of the few forms of Energy on this plane that can manipulate other forms of energy to do things they desire, and we don't just manipulate 'things', we manipulate other Life forms which are
       <em>
        really high
       </em>
       representations of the Life Force, which is like a really huge bandwidth of Energy that connects All living things

       thanks for the thanks bro, it's not the easiet thing to explain, which is why I guess those who did understand this 2-3000yrs ago had trouble explaining it to the 'average guy' and so the story of 'gods' were created as an explantion they could grasp ...
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the first time I've ever tried to write it down and I wasn't sure it was 'clear' enough so I appreciate your comment
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it wasn't too bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with this pov it 'makes sense' how 'we' are all connected and how
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       we do affects the rest of 'reality' ,, and so
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       we do which 'negatively impacts' upon another will in some way 'negatively impact' ourselves .. and vice versa
      </p>
      <p>
       "we get what we give, just not necessarily where we gave it' ,, that's why "as you sow, so shall you reap" but if we
       <em>
        expect
       </em>
       a return will will discover "expectations are the basis of disappointment" ,, so the smart move is to
       <em>
        only expect
       </em>
       the
       <em>
        un
       </em>
       expected!
      </p>
      <p>
       The word 'karma' literally means 'action' ... and most actions begin with a thought (the 'seed' so to speak) and we 'create' our reality with our 'thoughts'. And while a 'seed' you plant today might flower in a few moths, it also
       <em>
        may not
       </em>
       flower or 'bear fruit' for many years, but that shouldn't stop you from planting them! This metaphor relates to how you treat other sentient beings and the planet that's your mother
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look back on your life and consider all the things that you've done that 'began with a thought which became a desire to act which then became a 'reality'
      </p>
      <p>
       The more you think about something the more likely it is to happen to you! We have All had experiences where something we thought/said
       <em>
        has happened
       </em>
       in such a surprising way that most people simply write it of as "what a coincidence" ... it wasn't!
      </p>
      <p>
       From now on,
       <em>
        everytime
       </em>
       a 'coincidence' happens, give it some thought, ask yourself "what are the factors connected with this event that are the same as the last 'coincidence' I had?" -- and you will begin to notice a number of 'common factors' that occur every time you experience a 'coincidence',, and chances are, it was something you had thought about in a certain way/s ... which you will begin to notice once you
       <em>
        choose to
       </em>
       question "coincidences"
      </p>
      <p>
       "prayers" are just repetitive thoughts -- y'know the saying "be careful what you pray for (think about) you just might get it!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how we've come to say to people "don't even go there" when they talk about something we don't want to happen? That's becoz, in our 'sub-conscious' we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       how our 'thoughts
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       reality'!
      </p>
      <p>
       We are only just beginning to realize the power of the mind ... which is like a tool which 'focuses' 'thought energy' into matter!
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the older Eastern belief systems like Hinduism and Buddhism are well aware of this ... but it's impossile to make someone 'understand' it ... only when the student is ready will the answers come, as 'you can lead a horse to water But you can't make it drink!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad this helped you friend, if you'd like to ask any questions feel free to pm me

       I would say God created god, emphasis on the capitalization. Who created God you may ask. As human we have this idea that time is something everything must be measured by. Everything has a beginning and end. It is how we see life on our planet. I would argue that it is purely a human construct, that there are things that have been and will be. Things that escape our understanding of creation and end. Just my 2cents.

       Heres my take on the moon landings. I got very into this a while ago. I do think that we landed on the moon, for about 10 minutes and then left....theres 2 minutes (I think its 2 minutes) of what I beleive is real NASA tape that is missing. In that 2 minutes, the astronauts saw alien spaceships and the aliens told us to back the fuck off the moon because it is theirs. All the tape you see of moon walks is completely staged because I dont think we ever actually set foot on the moon. We may have put our wheels down, but we took off quickly. I dont think the rest of the missions ever actually reached the moon, but merely orbited the Earth until coming back home. Space belongs to the aliens, they told us to fuck off. I think the moon is being mined for rare metals by aliens. And if you want to go down this road, I think Mars is a completely habitual planet with life living on the backside. NASA has all these photos but wont share them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as crop circles....I dont know. It could something totally sinister, and it could be something as easily explained as the alien for of graffiti.

       Nah, completely made up fantasy, humans have never even left low earth orbit, read the PDF below, it puts in to perspective how utterly ridiculous the moon story that was told nearly 50 years ago is.

       Nearly every claim made by NASA regarding the apollo program is mostly bullshit, there is not just one or two things that make no sense, the vast majority of the claims are so far fetched and absurd, even today nearly 50 down the line with all the advancements in technology and science.

       Again, you're just saying their claims are bullshit just because. There are plenty of solid arguments in favor, backed by clear evidence and science, while most if not all hoax-arguments have been debunked.

       Aliens/UFO. Aliens are demonic entities. There is a spirit world we are not privy to, but technology like CERN and the quantum D-wave computer is going to away the veil. Disclosure will occur at some point, but they will be revealing entities or some type of hybrid/human.

       Aye, this. There are spiritual worlds, many of which people tap into when listening to music, watching films (new Ghostbusters is fucking riddled with it!), Pokémon Go and the like are blending our ability to perceive the world around us with augmented realities, until we cannot comprehend (nor care to) feel a spiritual world.

       I saw my Uncle who is a high ranking member in the Pentagon, well was, a few months after 9/11. I do recall him saying "coincidentally" his "branch" or whatever you wanna ca it, were all out on some sort of golf trip, the day 9/11 happened. I do believe some interns and low "priority" people were inside the building. He was just being suspicious about it all. I asked him about why he quit, he said he was given the option to retire early, right after 9/11 happened. But he just seemed odd about it all... I tried to follow up with him about it recently.. But he has been kind of ignoring me, especially when I messaged him about if he could provide more insight into 9/11. and the days surronding it... Hes too busy living in a multi-million dollar "mansion" in a gated off community in FLa, with w bunch of other ex-Pentagon officlals... Odd, forsure.

       If by 2020 the IMF/UN crew have looped in the US under the guise of being our economic "saviors" after a market collapse/martial law declaration... then the biggest conspiracy I have come across is likely true (as this potential event was written about in the 1990's in the Fed's book "Creature From Jekyll Island"):
      </p>
      <p>
       That the US we know today is a foreign corporation owned by globalist bankers, who have systematically subverted every citizen under their control since the civil war.

       Agree on all points (excepting Illuminati/Chem trails where I don't disagree). For the not sures:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Huge elaborate crop circles - also not sure, but suspect they are not all hoaxes
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moon Landings - lot of things seem to have been faked, and there was reason (risk of failure) and motive (cold war) to 'look good', but they still might have gone, or perhaps only to lunar orbit. I dont think they landed (too tricky to succeed, no marks in the grass)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vaccination safety - complex. Safety is the wrong question. There are always risks, and costs/benefits vary depending on the specifics. Too often, the science is twisted, inadequate, partisan and misreported - tread with care
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Osama Bin Ladens death - probably faked
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Eugenics movement - dont know
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The truth about "The Holocaust" - the numbers affected were probably exaggerated, just divide 6 million by the number of minutes in WW2. The policies of the Nazis probably misrepresented by the victors to suit their purposes. Whatever the details, numbers - it was still a crime against humanity.

       thanks, good video, but overall doesn't convince. his main argument is that it was not possible to fake slow motion back then and tricks done in celluloid could easily give the game away when e.g. if a speck of dust is spotted. He doesn't mention that NASA projected onto a screen that was filmed by TV cameras- one reason for the poor image quality. Then he makes too many assertions without backing them up, expecting the viewer to believe him based on the tone of his voice, then finally providing some cod psychology explanation why people want to believe in conspiracies - which I see as a poor substitute for detailed reasoning around the viability of the mission, the motive for avoiding any chance of failure and then all the stuff about shadows and lack of any dust crater under the lunar lander.

       I was mostly with you until the alien shit.  Obviously there is life in other parts of the galaxy, but I see no logical reason to think they are visiting us.  But that's just IMHO, certainly, anything's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the false flag events you mentioned were probably mostly not hoaxes (meaning people really died in a lot of those events), but crisis actors were still in play in the media framing of the aftermath and the "official stories" are full of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, this is a solid summary of some of the most important and clear historical conspiracy stuff. Well done!

       After 911 I was disappointed no one even asked the question that if the attack was a legitimate attack on USA, what is happening with the American foreign policy that would make someone fly planes into buildings? And they fall in a controlled demo fashion. Why not start a controlled demo company with old planes if this worked. Why take so much time and effort to rig a building to collapse on itself it works the same way with plane crashes?

       One night I went camping with my wife and I took a massive dose synthetic psilocybin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rarely dabble in recreational drug use of any kind but the occasion called for it... Anyways didn't take too long till everything was moving wildly. The camp fire was making the trees next to me melt in fantastic colors, all the while every star in the sky was swirling with great viger. Everything in my field of vision was moving except for a single object in the sky. My sober sitter and wifey pooh had to use a star charting app on her phone to see what it was, sure enough it was Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried everything to make Saturn budge. I stared at It for well over an hour and it was completely stationary. Even tried using my perifual vision but nothing worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta disclose that I'm not really into astronomy so going into that experience I had no idea where Saturn was. I did however have somewhat of an idea as to its importance to our ecsistance. Still not 100% sure about it but after that night I'm not 100% sure about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess is that we are all in a projection from a higher single consciousness, stepped down from one dimension to the next. That for our little corner of creation, Saturn is our lense into a reality.

       What convinces you to put your faith in this article? The person who they were interviewing that claimed to be part of some ruling bloodline was asked to provide some concrete major events that would happen in order to prove they were who they said they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person said San Francisco and Damascus would be uninhabitable by 2010, if not sooner. That definitely didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said there would be a new currency by 2009, if not sooner, as well as a new union of nations. That didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claimed there would be massive storms with wind speeds surpassing 300 mph. Totally didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claimed that ice caps would melt and totally submerge metropolitan cities. That didn't happen, but I'd be wrong in saying that it's certainly in the process of happening. It's just not to the drastic extent claimed by whomever the troll they interviewed was.
      </p>

       I'd never heard of the "Black cube of saturn" before so I had to look into it. Here's my unsolicited opinion.
It's a great example of looking for a conspiracy. Children fucking love drawing cubes because it's the easiest 3D shape to draw. So naturally it shows up everywhere. It's used in art because it looks so unnatural in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everything else looks like pure coincidence or un-provable 'facts.'
And I have a hunch worshiping a god involves a lot more than wearing robes on graduation day or wearing a ring.

       i wont explain any of this clearly but you get the point. theres black cube statues in important buildings and places around the world. islam has that thing where everyone walks around a black cube. there's no such thing as a coincidence. not every thing has a big meaning, ignore tons of stuff myself, but there are no coincidences in this universe. to learn about all this stuff, you need to step out of the "truth movement" bullshit bubble. i like to call it "waste of time movement". i half ass on my research and i know more then they ever will. most of them are getting their info from shills. tons upon tons of shills. from professionals like jones, maxwell, bonacci to youtubers like groxt, dahboo, nichoson1968. im not certain of this but it seems like most of the info out there is from shills. thats one of the reason why i half ass my research, its a bitch to do this. you cant just "look it up" unless you're really good at this stuff, which im not.

       you need to dig deep for this - the literal black cube that the ruling class worships hit the twin towers at least once. if you look at one of the holes its a literal square. btw the towers weren't demolished. they fucked with time to bring them down, thats why the debris is powder. i think its called "time shifting". i dont know much about 9/11 cuz i dont care and i already know enough of it. i just happened to stumble upon this gem.

       illuminat is crap, just a cover. the all seeing eye isnt an eye at all, its the bottom of a bell. the mason symbol is really the seal of saturn and the cube, in the middle where it makes a square. the picture where you see a white light going through a triangle, but on the other end the light changes colors, the light is the creator (not god) and the other lights are them distorting all of the light. the rockefellers and rothschilds aren't even real bosses of this shit. they're just among the highest level ones we can find. hell does exist but not the one in the bible. we're living in a section of hell. this part is a farming area where they take our energy. been going on for a long ass fuckin time you wont believe if i tell you. the bible does have some truth in it, but its been heavily tampered with, the best version we can get is king james, who was an open freemason, and most of the bible is coded stories. the adam and eve story wasnt about a guy named adam and a girl named eve, eating from the forbidden tree of knowledge. the old testament was never supposed to be released to the public. i think there's 3 or 4 main factions in the ruling class and they're fighting each other - masons, zionists and/or nazis, and the vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       you'll be lucky to find any of this stuff, or any real truth in the "truth movement". they just scatch the surface. a lot of this stuff they cant even see. the rulers communicate with each other through code in plain view. they use colors, numbers, symbols etc. they use red and blue, purple and yellow, black, green. the phrase "going green" isnt about eating healthy, its about them steering this world into the 5th age.
      </p>
      <p>
       back to saturn, they shove this shit in our faces literally everywhere. a cube in 2d has 6 sides. saturns pole has a hexagon shape on it. no coincidence. jewish star of david 6 sides. jade helm symbol has 6 sides when you draw it out. vatican symbol has 6 sies when draw it out. the christian cross is really a cube, the longer end of it goes on top. swastika is also a cube. the peace sign is looking at the cube at an angle. mercedes same thing, at an angle. the seal of saturn is an "x", you'll also see this everywhere in different forms. another saturn symbol is of the planet itself but i wont get into that. this stuff becomes easy once u know what to look for. they dont really hide, they just fool everyone to believe some other shit. btw u know about the number 6, no coincidence all these symbols are hexagons. this shit goes way back, it snothing new, just different times. there's like a ton of different worlds here at the same time. first the sheep and their dreamworld, then the "truth movement" who think they figured it out but not even close, then what i showed you where we dont know shit but trying to figure something out, then the ruling class, then their bosses. crazy fuckin shit. u can do all the research you want but you'll still know next to nothing cuz they have all the true knowledge hidden from us. all it does it help you understand more wtf is going on. it helps me
      </p>
      <p>
       here's 3 vids from one of the best saturn researches you'll find, ocs101 or occultscience101. no longer on youtube cuz they kept banning him and fucking with him. stay away from queenycameron the demonic whore from hell, she did a lot of damage to his channels. if u do get interested, just watch a bunch of this guys vids. most of them are short and easy to follow. he has his own site now where no one can fuck with him.

       who is the powerful governments of the world, they signed a treaty that essentially bans any private citizen or organization from going to Antarctica (Antarctica in the flat earth theory is not a continent but the mass of land/ ice that is the border around our world) then they use things like space programs give us "proof" that the earth is round. you can even look at the pictures of our earth from nasa and see that they used a different scale, yep the continents are bigger on one photo of the earth than another.
      </p>
      <p>
       why? we don't know. i think it's to have absolute power of us and control us.
      </p>
      <p>
       how so? by brainwashing us from a young age that it is round, anything else will seem absurd and anyone claiming otherwise is seen as crazy right away

       I find it much easier to swallow thinking that we are currently harvesting the earth on the behalf of a higher entity/call it alien.  Say you are an alien, you are here for a reason, you want something from this planet. What is the best way if I'm not in a hurry to harvest this planet ? Control the system = control everything. There could be invisible ships full of ore/water/wtvTheyNeed going in and out of our atmosphere without us even realising. I see humans as an animal just like cows don't understand a single thing about humans, we could also have no clue about the whole thing and live an happy life for the rest of our days. Who knows. I just hope when my last heart beat kicks I get to know what the fuck we are doing here.

       Osama Bin Laden is alive, in a palace smoking a cigar with his CIA friends. He wasn't even connected to 9/11. Americans are just about as brainwashed as those radical muslims, they are just so fucking happy about being ignorant it hurts. Their quality of life is too high for them to bother, maybe once they meet the true face of the devil who's running their ship they will see it like we do. It will be too late but hey, the system is made tgis way anyway, it was designed exactly this way .

       Have you stumbled onto Nassim haramein's holofractal theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       It brought together 9 years of conspiracy research from a negative line of rhinking into one big positive "eureka!" moment for me. Combines alternative history, distrust of established systems, old symbology and numerology, secret societies protecting ancient knowledge, similarities between ancient religions, etc. Check out black whole, its his documentary on it.

       Now if only the masses would pull their head out of their asses and phones and open their eyes and see this stuff as well.... If we can get of one mind and organize we can effectively end this shit.... Not enough military in the world to hinder that many waking up all at once.... They would have to nuke EVERTHING and go under ground or just gtfo.... they could not contain the sheer numbers of the masses.... Time will tell

       Nice post OP. I think you left out a few things but I would like to set you straight on the moon landings, they happened.

       how do you debunk the claims of no stars on any moon images, same background used in 2 different shots, and no explanation for how they got past the radiation?

       If you take a picture of a bright surface, smaller or dimmer lights will not show up. Its a basic fundamental of photography, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have to see what you're talking about on the same background thing, I haven't seen that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The radiation will kill you if you stay in it for awhile. It's not deadly for short periods. You're familiar with the concept of safe/allowable dosages? If you stand in an x-Ray machine for month you'll probably die, a couple shots and you'll live to see the film developed.

       your explanation for the stars makes sense. this is what i was referring to, they seemingly used the same backdrop for two photos of different events.

       This is a great way to research conspiracy theories. Start with what the debunkers say first. Then try to debunk the debunkers. Your case has to be sound enough to answer the skeptics. When you have a question such as "Why are there no stars in any of the moon photos", actually search for an answer to that. Don't just throw out a question. That's not research. Good questions are good. But research doesn't end there.

       I have shot thousands of medium format film. I know how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know about radiation and the Van Allen belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon landing happened. I have photos from almost every Apollo launch as well as many from the missions (not the film of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that the Saturn V produced over 1 billion horse power? Do you know how much it weighed? Or how much fuel it consumed? Have you ever built a rocket engine? I do and have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't dismiss anything without extensive research. I've learned my lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never seen the mountain thing he asked, but the explanation makes sense. The shear amount of actual film recovered from these missions should make you believe they're real. It's impressive they did this and it's sad we haven't gone back.

       I'd like to discuss the jfk video you linked to your post. What motivation do the shadowy figures behind the abc coverage of the jfk assassination have to reinforce a scenario that has already been widely accepted by the public and further more is not even up for more analytical discussion as of when the newest abc jfk assassination conspiracy hoax video was shot. I'm not doubting the government is covering this up either. It makes sense that they would. I'm curious as to why they even brought the discussion back up years and years after it happened and supposedly got away with it.

       Exellent summary. Chemtrails I've been skeptical to. It didn't seem feasable/believable, but now im not sure. It's interesting to see how "global warming" went to "climate change". They want to blame carbon dioxide for the changes made by chemtrails. Like the drought in California perhaps?

       You're right not to believe in the flat Earth.  I have taken it seriously as an alternative world theory, and investigated it throughly and found it to have just as many holes in the theory as the round earth theory it claims to debunk.

       The whole thing is actually a psy op.  It's a psy op cleverly designed to not be outright disprovable, and that centres around lack of publicly available information.  Specifically circulating around the north pole.  There is something in the Arctic that we are being kept from, and the flat Earth theory is a distraction.  Flat Earth exists because of this, but the real secret there is probably something to do with the aliens instead.

       The Holocaust is definitely not what it seems, I'm 100% certain about that, but the true nature of the event, and how much Hitler was even responsible or aware of in regards to it, is where the lines start to blur.  And we will never know the exact truth.  It has been buried deep and will never fully come to light.

       And I don't particularly think Osama's death matters, because he's probably just CIA anyways.

       There are a lot of lies and half-truths regarding the mainstream holocaust narrative. Most of the people in the camps died do to perhaps starvation, but definitely disease as supplies became scarce because of the Allies bombing critical infrastructure (roads, railroads, vehicles, production buildings), farmland etc.. I have a bunch of good resources regarding this - which you can find in

       The 'logical paradigm' split is all part of the charade as well. The game that's being played is a spiritual game, and even the 'non-religious/spiritual' players are playing it (Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Carl Sagan, Huxley, Orwell, Disney, Lucas, Spielberg) they're creating this idea that we're worthless. That's part of the game.

       We do not live on a globe. Don't know exactly what it is. But look at the feed. Look at the 59,000 images from NASA, every one a composite.

       One thing I don't understand is why people think mass shootings are totally faked.  That would be SO MUCH harder to cover up.  Much easier to actually commit the massacres, either by brainwashing or by having someone else shoot and then kill the patsy so they can't talk.  Maybe extra actors to hammer things home but--the best way to make the media show a rampage is to just go ahead and do it.

Osama Bin Ladens death,

       Outside the frame of reference is key to mind control as you said. Lively debate within the confines is OK. What a better way to keep the other world powers at bay why orchestrating a false flag than showing off our greatest weapon of all on live TV.

       Some individuals that post here seem to be victims of the “dumbing down” of our culture and why it's so easy for “the crew” to pull off a psyop of this magnitude. A hallmark characteristic of the dumbed down is a confusion between “evidence” and “theory.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Another characteristic of the dumbed down is the belief they can evaluate a book they have never read. They also fail to question why they have been convinced by someone else not to read it. Instead, they just memorize the list of talking points they were given and strongly urged not to think independently. So of course they don’t realize just how easy it is to control and entire population by discouraging independent thought. When belief is preferred over fact, anything can be covered up. And all that is needed is a community organizer to issue people their opinions and a conditioned response. Another name for this is brainwashing. How else can someone be so convinced that “the answer is 27” when they don’t even know what the question is?

       Subversive agent meat_for_the_beast demonstrates that problem solving abilities are almost non-existent. The powers of suggestion have made this individual a believer, not a thinker. I wonder why agent meat_for_the_beast thinks that the 14+ people emerging from Stairway B forgot they were crushed and forgot they were blown up and forgot they were cooked to death. I wonder why he thinks that Bible artifact doesn’t have burned pages even though it has solidified former “molten metal” on it.  That is, the molten metal that flowed across the pages of the Bible artifact had to be cold (cold liquid) or else the pages would have burned or had burn marks. ;-)?

       Where's the curvature is what got me interested... the logo of un is the hidden in plain sight. Tax extortion is a great reason even to suggest spacex as back end for Tesla. The atheist mantra of insignificance and a cloak for a 'prison' is also key. That NASA spokesman is such a shill it's obvious. Constantly changing the shape of the earth.

       Unverified? They're from NASA themselves, but I guess you just call that bullshit too. Can something even be verified for you at all then?

      <p>
       You claim there are so many anomalies, but that's really not true. Read this:

       And this:

       If you're distrusting anything and comparing it to santa claus there is just no reason in it anymore. You could literally say the world is secretly controlled by lizard people, we're all in the Matrix or whatever you'd like.

       Santa claus is a more believable fantasy than the US government sending men to the moon.

      <p>
       The reason i do not believe the apollo hoax is because it is not based in reality, proven so, it is pure fantasy just like santa claus.

       Santa claus is more believing than the Apollo mission... Yeah I can't argue with someone who actually beliefs that, that's beyond reason. There is so much proof for it, while santa claus is known to be completely made up. I half believe you're trolling.

       Baffling UFOs are probably the most bold truths out there right in the open; mass sightings, thousands of declassified documents with radar data, physical trace cases, hundreds of (high ranked) whistle blowers, etc.

       Just look at John Podesta for example, ex chief of staff for Bill, ex counselor for Obama and now chairman for Hillary; openly talking about them and implying aliens:

       Start with the fact that the earth is beyond a shadow of a doubt - flat. There is no proven curvature to the earth. If you follow real science, there should be 8 inches of curvature per square mile. Yet look through binoculars or a telescope (or even your naked eye) and you'll see landmarks miles, hundreds of miles away, without curvature. Then you can watch balloons going up tens of thousands of feet and still see a flat horizon. Do some basic research, the facts are hiding in plain sight.

       The biggest issue with this is that NASA is basically the top level of science and knowledge in it's field, to think you would know better with not even a tenth of their know-how is just stupid arrogance.

       That's a silly statement. Far easier to prove a human being exists than to prove the shape of the Earth. There is no "proof" one way or another, there's only faith and what you can experience for yourself. You have faith that the state couldn't possibly lie to you about the nature of our world. I on the other hand have zero faith that they would ever tell the truth about anything. The world is run by corrupt liars and hypocrites. I believe nothing they claim unless I can verify it with my own senses, and using this logic the heliocentric model does not ring true in my reality. We're spinning how fast? Yet the Earth does not move under our feet. The Earth is a ball, yet it appears to us as a flat plane. Where does it curve? The sun is 93 million miles away, yet it appears the same size as the moon and creates hotspots on clouds and water. The moon is rotating but we can only ever see one side of it. There are thousands upon thousands of satellites in orbit yet not a single one ever passes in front of the moon not appears in any of the (doctored) photos of Earth. I have no faith in what we are TOLD to believe.

       So you are being stubborn because reasons. Obviously there is no way a human can experience everything on earth. Some things we have to take on the evidence provided by our peers. I say evidence not faith because they have to have some tangible proof to verify their claims. When you are on a plane and stand up to go to the rest room you don't "feel" the plane move under your feet. Scale that up like a billion times and that is why you don't feel the earth move (unless earthquakes). As for curvature I don't think you understand these scale that is our planet. Take a tennis ball, if you were the size of a bacteria and we're on the surface of that tennis ball you wouldn't both be able to see the curvature of the ball because it is preferred of magnitude bigger than you. There are plenty of photos of junior astronomers of satellites such as the International Space Station flying between the earth and the moon. The moon is rotating at a speed that always ensures that the same side faces us.

       With respect to 9/11...
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno.  I think that it's very likely that the passengers did intervene.  I also believe the people who heard an explosion before the plane hit the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the idiots flying lost control of the plane and the passengers fought to regain the plane, but didn't pull it off.  So, it was shot down.  How is that more outrageous than saying that no plane crashed there?

       even though you're getting downvoted... I'll respond...
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was shot down... that's still really fucked up and just as outrageous for sure. The main point about that particular plane crash is that there was just about no debris and no blood... Meanwhile you look at any other plane crash in a field... and you get all the debris and lots of blood.

       It just adds to the overall issue of visual evidence not lining up with the official story.

       How doesn't Thai prove my point?  If the plane wss blown up in the sky, lots of things would simply be vaporized.  Also, how is that more of a stretch than.... Well, what are the alternative theories?  They make little to no sense.

       No, that's not how missiles work. The aircraft would not be vaporised unless it was hit by some kind of nuclear warhead.

       Thank you for your terse response.

       While vaporized is the wrong word for those who read everything literally, I stand by what I said.  When a missile explodes and blows something up, it makes much tinier debris and spreads them farther.

       No, you are still wrong. You seem to have a cartoonish view of what a missile does to an aircraft (blow it up).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a missile hits an aircraft, its generally locked on to an engine. It hits and destroys the engine, and often the explosion will destroy part of the wing or tailplane and cause the rest of the aircraft to crash.

       Well, you must be a little blind. I'd love to know how the technology in the missile works to lock on to a wing (at least in your mind).
      </p>
      <p>
       Never the less, where it hit is irrelevant. As you can very clearly see the aircraft didnt 'blow up', but lost a section of the tail/wing while the majority of the aircraft begins falling to the ground in one piece.

       It's not a true controlled awakening.  It's a misguided one.  The new age movement is handing people into the hands of evil spirits, feeding them to the wolves.  There are evils in the spiritual realm and the new age movement is deliberately pushing narratives that do not teach people how to protect themselves from those evil spirits, or it is teaching rituals that give them power under the guise of other forms of magik.  Those that know how to safely navigate astral projection without falling prey to the evil spirits never make into the public sphere.  The 2nd deception of the new age doctrine is that there is no God, or that you are the God of yourself.  This is bullshit.  There's a God, and the spiritual realm or 'network' is just another one of his inventions, that the souls he created can tap into.  This network is how God reaches us as well, it's the foundation of all mainstream religions.  We don't have to open up to God or accept him to access this realm, and the new age movement pays no attention to this either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found those that do, and followed their practices.  I have successfully performed past life regression and asked for healing help from the spirits, and gave specific commands to the spirits that don't have my best intentions at heart to leave me alone, and felt their presence fade.  I was helped by the good spirits and given a reality shattering spiritual awakening, including vivid visions of what I can only imagine to be the 4th dimension or spiritual realm where our souls originated from, followed by a euphoric state of mind that lasted well into the next day before our material reality brought me back down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't get back when I tried again, I guess they only visited me the one time and told me all they wanted to say.  But the new age movement definitely doesn't intend to help people reach what I did.  They want people to go out and take help from evil spirits who do the devil's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to believe my story and personal experiences, but I strongly suggest you heed my warning.  Do not take the spiritual realm lightly.  And if I were you, I'd stick to the teachings of Christianity or something.  I've been around the astral block once or twice and tapped into things most hippies only dream of being able to do, and I chose simple worship of Christ at the end of it.  I hope that says something to you about what's out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you listen to Yuri Bezmenov you'll find the Soviet Union had a special interest in the promotion of the new age movement as well.  There is a reason for that and it is not one of good intentions.

       god is 'energy' ... Energy is everywhere all the time, it cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another, "reality" is Energy vibrating space/time
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy contains All knowledge and all things contain energy, gravity is energy increasing the density of spacetime, electromagnetism is energy. Everything you are aware of is a manifestation of Energy in one form or another that our senses pick up on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the physical realm is not the only form of energy, there's 'spiritual energy' as well
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is the second highest manifestation of Energy in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentient life is the highest form as it's a sophisticated mix of many types of Energy's with physical and spiritual apects working together .. but what makes 'sentient Life' so special is 'consciousness',, it's awareness of itself and its surroundings and the fact it 'acts consciously'.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Consciousness is the highest representation of Energy on this plane/univerese. Conscious beings are the way Energy can be 'self aware' ,, and it's this 'self aware energy' which is God. That's why it's taught we a the children of God, we are!
      </p>
      <p>
       Conscious Life manipulation of Energy is the basis of much creation on this level
      </p>
      <p>
       it was, is and always has been, it has no beginning or end,
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is a representation of Energy in one form or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy is our father and we are it's children and the Life Force is our special gift as we are one of the few forms of Energy on this plane that can manipulate other forms of energy to do things they desire, and we don't just manipulate 'things', we manipulate other Life forms which are
       <em>
        really high
       </em>
       representations of the Life Force, which is like a really huge bandwidth of Energy that connects All living things

       y'know I'd never really thought about the physics involved in the lunar lander 'lifting off' from the moon and then not only achieving escape velocity but then getting into the same orbit as the command module and actually docking with it! Plus the fact it had to get to 4,000mph to 'catch up' with the lunar orbiter. Where was the fuel kept? They show the lunar lander lifting off with a wee explosion .... hmmm?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're to believe what we're told about the moon's gravity being 1/6 of the earths, then it would've taken a
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       larger burn than that little spurt we see that looks like some explosive bolts detonating.
      </p>
      <p>
       and yeah, now I think about it, I've never seen or heard anything more detailed about this part of the mission than that one clip that shows the lunar lander 'blasting off' and nothing about how they were able to accurately rendevous with the command module!
