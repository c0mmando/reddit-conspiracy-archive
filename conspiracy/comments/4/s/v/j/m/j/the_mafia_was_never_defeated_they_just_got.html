<p>then you wake up and you kind of feel kinda bad for the italians because of how small of a fish they really are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s right.   reminds me of this scene from The Good Shepherd: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQMzJ5Z7zBw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQMzJ5Z7zBw</a> where the CIA is trying to get the italian mafia to cooperate on their take over of the entire island of Cuba.</p>

<p>On the US military and War, by Major General Smedley Butler (USMC, 1933)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country&#39;s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.</p>

<p>I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.</p>

<p>I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.</p>

<p>During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.</p>
