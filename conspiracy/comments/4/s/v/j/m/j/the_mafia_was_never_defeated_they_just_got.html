       that's right.   reminds me of this scene from The Good Shepherd:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQMzJ5Z7zBw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQMzJ5Z7zBw

       where the CIA is trying to get the italian mafia to cooperate on their take over of the entire island of Cuba.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the US military and War, by Major General Smedley Butler (USMC, 1933)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.
       </p>
       <p>
        I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.
       </p>
       <p>
        During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.

       Hollywood literally run by Mishpocheh gangsters is the propaganda centre which pushed the Italian Mafia angle hard. Especially throughout the 70's with the Godfather films and it continues most recently with the Sopranos. They create an Italian stereotype and make it larger than life so the real players escape out the back door unseen.

       The mafia has always been around, it was made huge, and acceptable by prohibition, after that they drifted into racketeering, prostitution, gambling, and drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today they are largely living fossils, corruption is legal, all you have to do is bribe the politicians.  They're small compared to the corporations, who do more and worse, and rake in billions for it.  Why be a mobster?

       Guiseppi Mazzini was the individual that Albert Pike corresponded with in his letters on Three World Wars that would unite the world under a Luciferian Dictatorship. Like Pike, Mazzini was Illuminati and held the rank of 33 degree Mason. He is also the founder of the MAFIA, which is named after him.

       Those letters are fake just so you know. Many of the words used like Zionism fascism and naziism weren't even used until after the letters where "written" and they defenitly weren't used in pikes lifetime .

       my dad and his family had relationships with some of the biggest New York mafia families of the last generation.... think Gotti and all those around him. I don't have any firsthand experience myself, but the consensus seems to be a lot of them get legit and the ones that don't are pretty small-time.

       No wonder as the corporate system is essentially a shield from legal consequences of criminally minded behavior.

       From what ive heard most of them have gone legit and are the financial backers for the legal weed industry. Dont you ever wonder how a bunch of stoners are setting up 50 grand grow houses, when no bank will lend to them. Also a dispensery is a brilliant way to launder money.
