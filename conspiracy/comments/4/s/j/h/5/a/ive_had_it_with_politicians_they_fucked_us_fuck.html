<p>If all the unemployed marched indefinitely, we would be on the right track. Non stop protests. Epic, lively, energized protests would be only one strategy out of many. </p>

<p>We can easily gather around a table and create endless strategies. I think 30% of us don&#39;t have jobs so these folks would be the foot soldiers for the cause. It would give them a sense of purpose and great pride.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you don&#39;t. You&#39;re not some enlightened fucking revolutionary, you&#39;re a guy who&#39;s getting fucked with the rest of us. Let&#39;s say you actually had the balls to do <em>something</em>, okay? NOTHING WOULD GET DONE. The country is too far into the deep pockets of the super-rich and all of their figurehead cronies to have anything done <em>for</em> the interest of us little people. I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, but you aren&#39;t the guy who gets things done. This is on a higher level than a guy who still says bro.</p>

<p>The only way something will get done is if someone, a real actual political figure comes in and begins a <em>real</em> revolution. So how about this, since you wanna talk like you got nuts, put your big boy pants on and become a politician and use your political leverage to work your way up to the top of the mountain, then when you&#39;re looking down at a nation of people with their hands out, then you decide whether or not you like it at the top and if you&#39;re gonna make the move that all the politicians say they will, but never do.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not gonna do shit, I&#39;m not gonna do shit, none of these other jerks are gonna do shit so the only other course of action, since we&#39;re all in perpetual fear of getting in trouble with the law, is to bend over, bite the pillow and continue to get fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;run the whole government ourselves&quot;</p>

<p>Ironically, a government by the people, for the people, is what your government was <em>supposed</em> to be, but never mind all that.  </p>

<p>As much as I agree with your disdain for the spineless politicians, remember that the groups who are <em>purchasing</em> the governments compliance are equally to blame, if not more so.  </p>

<p>They not only hijack your governments mandate to govern with your best interests in mind, but they spend billions making sure you are kept ignorant as to what your best interests ought to be, or work you so hard by constantly driving costs up and wages down that you don&#39;t even have time anymore to realize your best interests are no longer being catered to.  And if, by some happy chance, you start to figure out how you&#39;re being duped, they&#39;ll try and make you forget by dangling bright and shiny products and services in front of you to distract and mollify you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crass- Bloody Revolutions</p>

<p>You talk about your revolution, well, that&#39;s fine
But what are you going to be doing come the time?
Are you going to be the big man with the tommy-gun?
Will you talk of freedom when the blood begins to run?
Well, freedom has no value if violence is the price
Don&#39;t want your revolution, I want anarchy and peace</p>

<p>You talk of overthrowing power with violence as your tool
You speak of liberation and when the people rule
Well ain&#39;t it people rule right now, what difference would there be?
Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me</p>

<p>But what about those people who don&#39;t want your new restrictions?
Those that disagree with you and have their own convictions?
You say they&#39;ve got it wrong because they don&#39;t agree with you
So when the revolution comes you&#39;ll have to run them through
You say that revolution will bring freedom for us all
Well freedom just ain&#39;t freedom when your back&#39;s against the wall</p>

<p>You talk of overthrowing power with violence as your tool
You speak of liberation and when the people rule
Well ain&#39;t it people rule right now, what difference would there be?
Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me</p>

<p>Will you indoctrinate the masses to serve your new regime?
And simply do away with those whose views are too extreme?
Transportation details could be left to British rail
Where Zyklon B succeeded, North Sea Gas will fail
It&#39;s just the same old story of man destroying man
We&#39;ve got to look for other answers to the problems of this land</p>

<p>You talk of overthrowing power with violence as your tool
You speak of liberation and when the people rule
Well ain&#39;t it people rule right now, what difference would there be?
Just another set of bigots with their rifle-sights on me</p>

<p>Vive la revolution, people of the world unite
Stand up men of courage, it&#39;s your job to fight</p>

<p>It all seems very easy, this revolution game
But when you start to really play things won&#39;t be quite the same
Your intellectual theories on how it&#39;s going to be
Don&#39;t seem to take into account the true reality
Cos the truth of what you&#39;re saying, as you sit there sipping beer
Is pain and death and suffering, but of course you wouldn&#39;t care</p>

<p>You&#39;re far too much of a man for that, if Mao did it so can you
What&#39;s the freedom of us all against the suffering of the few?
That&#39;s the kind of self-deception that killed ten million jews
Just the same false logic that all power-mongers use
So don&#39;t think you can fool me with your political tricks
Political right, political left, you can keep your politics
Government is government and all government is force
Left or right, right or left, it takes the same old course
Oppression and restriction, regulation, rule and law
The seizure of that power is all your revolution&#39;s for
You romanticise your heroes, quote from Marx and Mao
Well their ideas of freedom are just oppression now</p>

<p>Nothing changed for all the death, that their ideas created
It&#39;s just the same fascistic games, but the rules aren&#39;t clearly stated
Nothing&#39;s really different cos all government&#39;s the same
They can call it freedom, but slavery is the game</p>

There&#39;s nothing that you offer but a dream of last years hero
The truth of revolution, brother................... Is year zero.</p>
