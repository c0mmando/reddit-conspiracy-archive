       Pokemon Go is now out for iOS and Android, and was released 7/7/16.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was created by
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niantic,_Inc.">
        Niantic, Inc.
       </a>
       , which was founded by the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc">
        Keyhole, Inc.
       </a>
       founder John Hanke. Keyhole Inc. was funded by Sony &amp; Nvidia, along with a nice chunk of money coming from the CIA's venture capital firm
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel">
        In-Q-Tel
       </a>
       , with In-Q-Tel receiving the majority of funding from the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geospatial-Intelligence_Agency">
        National Geospatial Agency
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The NGA was formerly known as NIMA, the National Imaging and Mapping Agency, until 2003. The NGA's primary focus is mapping Geospatial Intelligence, or
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_intelligence">
        GEOINT
       </a>
       . Geospatial Intelligence is intelligence about human activity on earth derived from the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes, assesses, and visually depicts physical features and geographical referenced activities on the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked out the NGA.mil website, the main page had an ad for what looked to be some type of Holo-Lens over a girl's face, advertising their magazine they publish. I'm sure they publish that for all their employees, not for general public to know (although it's free to read on their site, just not a popular publication since only NGA probably knows about it, and the few people that lurked onto the site accidentally).
      </p>
      <p>
       So Niantic/Pokemon Go is basically a front for Geospatial Intelligence gathering, just like the former Ingress from the same company (which wasn't as hugely popular as the Pokemon intellectual property, basically every 90's kid with a capable smart phone is out playing this).
      </p>
      <p>
       If they need pictures for a specific area updated, they don't have to send any agents/employees. They just spawn a rare Pokemon and someone using the app will take some pictures for them...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy/pokemongo/en/">
        The Privacy Policy for Pokemon Go
       </a>
       is a also bit Orwellian.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your guys thoughts on this application? Just a new Augmented Reality (AR) game, or GEOINT Agency wet dream?

       I found these sources (links from Wikipedia I found) and figured others may find this stuff interesting:

       What a great way to put it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I realized that and the following while playing a free app game. Your time, energy and brain power is wanted as much as your location, photo, voice etc. Free games and apps distract us from the agony caused by a corrupt government, lopsided society and the lack of undivided thought hinders personal growth.

       B.O.B puts it better, "they want cable, they want coffe, they want comedy. Anything to keep their minds off being property."

       Well, yeah, they want you to use their browser. Part of that is delivering a great experience. Having people (VOLUNTARILY) submit their hardware specs, hardware usage, plugins and settings help to find popular things that maybe they can include, or hardware that needs to be optimized, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that aside, their info gathering is completely voluntarily. If you don't want to take part, you uncheck the box, done.

       Pokémon go was clearly created with the understanding that the product itself wasn't made to turn a profit. I go to a university in the US, and it's a huge craze here. It's a marketing tool to get people to buy Pokémon sun and moon when they come out, as well as spend money on merchandise and other older games because of the nostalgia trip that 20 somethings are having playing their first Pokémon game in ten years.

       You do realize that the most valuable assets Nintendo has are their ip's right? You're proving my point, which was that Nintendo needed to A: test the waters to make sure that a mobile market was viable for full releases, and B: make everyone, and clearly I do mean pretty much everyone, remember/realize how much they like Pokémon, so nintendo can bolster their sales of X/Y, ORAS, and the upcoming sun and moon. They spent the money on this app because they understood that if it worked out, it would rake in big bucks in attention. And the market growth was largely because investors see that Nintendo has a possible expansion into mobile games, something that many Nintendo fans have been asking for and recognizing that there is a lot of money to be made by doing something like re-releasing Pokémon red, blue, and yellow on the app store.

       Your definition of slavery(hint its not voluntary) is just flat out wrong and you're so insecure about your opinions you cant handle one person disagreeing with you(I don't even have any upvotes lol) without snapping back and saying "NO YOU'RE WRONG I'M RIGHT".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also practically everything Nintendo puts out is popular enough to make shitloads of money without ads so I'm not even really sure what you're arguing.

       Ingress was bought by Google as a way to advertise and get people into stores. Not to enslave the minds of people.

       I never even replied to you pal I agreed with a point somebody else made. Also GPS was funded by the government too, does that make all GPS an enslavement tool? Fluoride in the water enslaving us too? If the CIA wanted to keep something as basic as this secret don't you think they would make sure some bumbling know it alls on Reddit couldn't stumble upon their massive global secret?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also stop trying to act so god damn intellectualy superior you aren't convincing anybody of anything ever with that attitude. You know nothing about my background just like I know nothing about yours, if you actually want people to listen to you you need to have some semblance of social skills and being able to see others as equals.

       I'm off this, theirs better things to do with my time then argue with paranoid people on the Internet.

       Sure thing. You could also identify what kinds of player styles attract certain people, what people are more motivated to trangress property lines or taboos (do they go into spooky or creepy or dangerous or seedy places when they didn't before?) or personal habits (are they waking up or staying up differently?), and how aggressive or competitive a player is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just about the images or the locations. One goal of geography is to understand the topology of the human mind as a
       <em>
        collective
       </em>
       organism shaping the physical environment around itself. The physical and cultural layers interact with each other, with individual behaviors being the medium.  Understanding how individual motivations and relationships form those higher motivations and organizations that sustain collective organic activity goes a long way towards cultivating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not entirely sinister, though. People are genuinely experiencing their world and one other in play. Every new technology and cultural formation has tradeoffs.

       Also, if one wants to have this idea sound even nuttier, note that Ingress players marked off cemeteries and churches, specifically, and these locations form centers of activity for players in Go. Churches and cemeteries themselves tend to follow natural ritual patterns in the geography of the landscape, the ley lines.

       Attracting more humans to places of psychic resonance, especially if those humans are organized according to very large shapes and configurations and those humans are mentally and intentionally focused—in the flow—doing something important to themselves, might unlock certain aspects of higher consciousnesses the average person is unaware of.

       It's an idea for those who like to speculate that the occult is just another technology, and
       <em>
        vice versa

       .

       I have no idea where the psychic stuff comes from, but Ingress did specifically pick religious sites like churches and cemeteries as portal locations, because it fit the theme of the game.  Their "submit a portal" page mentions it as one of the things they're looking for. (
       <a href="https://support.ingress.com/hc/en-us/articles/207343987-Candidate-Portal-criteria">

       Then Pokemon Go copied the data from Ingress, so Pokestops and Gyms appear at the same places.

       And there is no reason to consider that it was done because they needed as many public places for their game to actually be fun? A lot of people go to churches and cemeteries, including very disinterested young adults who would rather attack a portal than listen to sermon, aka their target audience.

       The technology has a lot of applications and is going to be used the same way Google Glass will be basically crowdsourcing geospatial analysis.  They want to map the entire planet.  Augmented reality will very quickly transition into virtual reality as it's more and more possible to simulate real space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence and security applications are huge.  But even more than tracking people in real time and space, it moves us closer that that virtual prison- the simulation within the simulation.  Very cool stuff, but also very creepy with many implications.

       The DOD is developing a parallel to Planet Earth, with billions of individual "nodes" to reflect every man, woman, and child this side of the dividing line between reality and AR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Called the Sentient World Simulation (SWS), it will be a "synthetic mirror of the real world with automated continuous calibration with respect to current real-world information", according to a concept paper for the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       "SWS provides an environment for testing Psychological Operations (PSYOP)," the paper reads, so that military leaders can "develop and test multiple courses of action to anticipate and shape behaviors of adversaries, neutrals, and partners".
      </p>
      <p>
       SWS also replicates financial institutions, utilities, media outlets, and street corner shops. By applying theories of economics and human psychology, its developers believe they can predict how individuals and mobs will respond to various stressors.

       OP, I appreciate your post, including the link to the privacy policy.  I personally do not feel that the Privacy Policy is exceptionally Orwellian in comparison to many policies maintained by other companies.  They even have provisions for removing &amp; ceasing use of PII, even if it's not otherwise covered by COPPA or GDPR.  Of course there is the convenient, explicit "loophole" that says PII may cross state &amp; country lines.  Still, they are transparent enough and the policy is pretty understandable compared to other mishmashes.  I'd give them a plus for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       On to the MONEY, because that's why they made this app.  Even if they were a non-profit they'd have to cover bills (they're not).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Real estate planning (probably mostly commercial): Which paths do people take to get to X destination?  Knowing pedestrian traffic patterns enables one to make more sound decisions when investing money in a physical business.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Consumer-come-mapping-agent: OP posted this already.  Very easy to make a Pokecenter/rare pokemon/etc. in an area to see where people go.  Probably pretty easy as well to get the information on how people get there, which leads to..
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ingress/egress paths (urban planning data): What are the actual locations and pathways people use to get to places?  If not already possible, a rich understanding of walkways and person-accessible areas could have huge implications.  If data shows that people are taking a desirepath or making a desirepath, investing in pedestrian infrastructure is possible.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As well, if a city/neighborhood needed to go on lockdown, those ingress/egress paths could be incredibly valuable.  Google Maps and the like already have rich data on automobile travel.  Pokémon Go and other applications can help develop the same for pedestrians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were in a downtown city district and we knew that say 10,000 foreign fighters/zombies/whatever were trying to invade, I would be very grateful to have detailed knowledge on EVERY ingress/egress path and get it locked down.

       No on google maps, and no on facebook (using the friendly+ without ads app).  I avoid tracking and have my geodata turned off, and further try to control what data goes out.

       Because the camera is streaming pictures of the location the person has been sent to. Want to surveil someone? Spawn Pokemon around them, and have human drones go to them gather images at their work, where they hang out. I don't necessarily buy the conspiracy aspect of this game, but I do see the internal logic of the theory.

       If you believe this, you really don't understand how the game works. Most people have the AR mode turned off anyway, so it's not even using their camera.

       See, I don't use any of that stuff on my phone, not even any google services. So I had to set up a 2nd phone with a throw-away google account in order to play; then I set up a VPN on my main phone and turn on the wifi hotspot.

       It's a matter of convenience vs security. It took me all of 1 hour and $20/yr to completely replace every google app that I use on my phone. Yes, google apps are easy to use and provide great services, but there are other services out there that provide those same features and DON'T read through your emails, serve you ads, track your location, learn your voice, view your web history, scan your texts, store your photos, read your documents, etc.

       When something is free, you are the product. For most people that's fine; I'd rather not be mined for marketing analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterthought: No, I have never had it be an issue and I doubt I ever will. It's a slippery slope though, and one day someone without our best interests at heart may decide to seize all that data and use it against us somehow.

       That's kind of how I always viewed it.  I guess I don't really mind being used for market analytics, or as you put it, 'being the product', since the product is 'free'.

       I used to think the same way. For me the turning point was when canaries started disappearing from sites that I regularly use; from reddit to a few gaming websites and even a geocaching website. From then on I've been much more security conscious.

       A lot of publicly-accessed websites add canaries to their terms of services saying they have not been served with access requests from any government agency (outside normal court-ordered requests limited to a specific user). Once they receive such a request, from the NSA for example, they remove the canary from their terms of service (or annual report, wherever they list it) and thus can communicate that they received such an order without violating the gag order that comes with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ones that were already in use on websites that I used.

       I felt the need to. Since you're the result of procreation with someone with a mental illness*, you may very well carry some of the same illnesses and not catch on to the underlying meaning.

       So to condense this for clarity, you are saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       Department of Defense's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency partially funded the CIA's company In-Q-Tel, which in turn is a large funder of Keyhole, Inc. who made Niantic, Inc. who made Pokemon Go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man that's a lot to remember. It's no wonder they use all these shell companies, it makes tracing the influences back pretty complex and leaves room for plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone could figure out exactly what data is uploaded while using the app, then that would add a lot of proof to all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Keyhole also developed google maps. This adds a lot of credence to the theory, imo.

       Don't forget Keyhole, Inc. also developed Earth Viewer which later became Google Maps, so Keyhole Inc./Google are interconnected, as is Google and Niantic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Niantic was formerly known as Niantic @ Google, they are basically another startup under Google's wing.

        After Keyhole's acquisition, Hanke spent several years as Vice President of Product Management for Google's "Geo" division

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now he is the CEO of an Augmented Reality company that tracks human interaction with geography and requires users to go out into the environment and aim the camera wherever the app tells them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure certain data can be extracted from the images as well, if location tracking is enabled you can just GPS pinpoint all the pictures and use the phone's XYZ sensors to figure out the angle for mapping purposes, intelligence gathering of human habits, etc.

       Whoa, that is pretty interesting. If the CIA had their own internal version of google maps (which I'm sure they do) then why wouldn't you work with people who actually created google maps? This makes a startling amount of sense. I'm pretty convinced now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just have to prove that it's uploading pictures (and potentially hiding it from affecting your data usage, since many people report extremely low data usage from the app) and then the cat is out of the bag. I wonder if there's a device that can intercept cell phone packets, like WireShark but for phones. That could actually prove this once and for all.

       I was thinking the same thing about packet interception, but the signals are all encrypted and would take some know how to decipher.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a program called WifiZoo that captured cookies back around 2008-2009, but it might be dead now since so many WiFi hotspots use encryption etc. The program would only work around unsecured WiFi networks, but it would basically snoop any packets sent through the air. You could apply cookies from someone else's browser (use a Yahoo email login from your neighbor's unencrypted network for example, or a Facebook login etc.) and spoof the browser into accessing their account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are more advanced versions of WiFi packet sniffers but they are probably proprietary software you'd have to pay for, or developed for Intel/Govt. use only, or network security penetration testers with a license. It'd be too stupid to just let any hacker walk around capturing wireless packets wherever he pleases.

       You may not even have to decrypt the packets. If you can just isolate what is coming from the Pokemon Go app, and keep track of the size of the uploaded packets, that should be enough to tell if pics are being uploaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just need a way to observe what packets come out of your phone, either by software on the phone (which could potentially be circumvented if they've hard-coded the packet hiding function deep enough in the hardware), or alternatively separate hardware that intercepts the cell signal itself (which would show everything in the signal and there would be no way to hide the packets). Anyone have access to either of those things?

       I don't think it would be too hard to sniff the data the app sends out. Just proxy your phone with like fiddler or burp suite and if you see any images are being sent out, that would be good evidence. I'm busy for the next few days, but I'll take a look after that and make a thread if I see anything interesting. It would be great if someone could check it out in the meantime.

       every subreddit, I concluded that someone really wanted me to put it on my phone.

       I already said this in some pro-pokemon thread. Basically this makes big brother have easier access to location data and personal data and also social interaction data. They can understand how people relate to each other through games like this and how much they can get addicted to it. This is another test to see if they can up the ante and make people get more addicted to technology than to having social justice. Nobody is talking about the Dallas shooting that I know of, or Hillary's bullshit, but everyone is talking about Pokemon go.

       Before Pokémon Go, Niantic created Ingress. I can't begin to imagine how many hours I spent hacking portals (poke spots), submitting portals and throwing fields, all in the name of data collection. Ingress players gave Google and Niantic the all information they'd ever want about the real world.

       Don't forget about Ingress. It's basically the same thing as Pokémon Go and created by Niantic. It's been around for a few years and has a huge user base. This Pokémon Go app simply targets a new audience using the same technology.

       I was thinking about this when i was flying 80something up the florida turnpike this morning. I wonder how long it will be before we get speeding tickets mailed to us because our phone gps said 80mph and our phone microphones pick up our voices talking while driving...

       That's totally ridiculous. The amount of energy required to beam energy from space through the atmosphere is prohibitive. 
Not to mention the amount of precision needed, low earth orbit satellites fly very fast, one orbit is about 45 minutes.

       You'd be better off doing it from medium altitude planes, like those used by those people:

       Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like this isn't all that terrible on the moral scale of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think It would be ironic and awesome if it turned out to be a driving force to get more people to socialize/exercise/get out doors, thereby connecting more people.  I could just be looking at it in an optimistic way, but it would be funny if it was meant for something evil and then turned out connecting a bunch of people and building stronger communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think it looks like a waste of time and I don't like even having my phone on me all the time, especially with the GPS and camera on, meh... To each their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  I guess my thinking is that there are so many other apps and ways people are being tracked.  It's good to be worried about Big Brother tracking you, but to think that this is the only way they will/can get information would be ignorant.

       I do agree that it's better than sitting in a dark room glued to a computer screen, because of the exercise and outdoor experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the bigger problem than tracking people (since that already happens anyway) is more of a social conditioning to be constantly looking at a screen and 'augmented reality'.  I personally think that our surroundings already have enough stimulus and it would be a shame if people stop taking in natural beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is paving the way for a future where its considered OK or normal to be consuming augmented reality or virtual reality (and becoming addicted to it), then that's a much bigger issue.   Just like with everything, moderation is key.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: There's a SiFi book I read a long time ago that comes to mind.  Basically everyone is addicted to virtual reality because normal reality is terrible and people have a hard time understanding the difference or just living in normal reality.  Eventually everyone becomes slaves to virtual reality and spend their time plugged into ultra pleasure inducing environments.

       nah, vr shades will improve to the point that you'll have normal glasses that fit comfortable and will also have the capability to augment the images in front of you.  To think we're gonna have big clunky vr headseats in the future is just absurd.

       Wasn't Ingress, the other game this company made, owned by Google?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked before and saw that minimal data was being sent back and figured that meant no way it was sending photos, but after seeing some of the evidence of the owners and the Ingress stat... no way.  Something is up, maybe not yet, but maybe a policy change in the future or a sudden burst of data on a "updated app bug" that needs fixed and 2 free weeks of insane data is uploaded.

        "Yep. Government sponsored intelligence gathering".
       </em>
       Sadly, it would seem that most people would not bother about the security implications at all. The lure of the Pokemon franchise is too big.

       Pokemon GO uses GPS tracking as a game feature. The companies sponsoring the game will know where you live, frequent, and commute to. The government by logic, will also have access to this information should they request for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't a issue for most people since we're not some government target. However personally, I won't want to give up my privacy so easily.

       If you think the government actually cares, I'm sure you've already given up your privacy in some way or another. I guess if you are really  worried, whatever, but for 99% of people, it makes no difference.

       My point is:
       <strong>
        Limit the amount of private information you allow others to have access to. Set YOUR OWN standards of privacy. Take personal measures to PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFO
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In today's society, you MUST expose yourself to a certain degree. You MUST have some personal information out in the open for others.
       <strong>
        If you are not plugged into the internet in some way, by societal standards: YOU DON'T EXIST.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the information you release can be kept to a need-to-know basis.
       <strong>
        <em>
         What is not necessary doesn't need to be released.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Let me give an example. In the case of Pokemon GO, if you really want to play, it doesn't necessarily have to be linked to your Google account. Create a FAKE account or a DISPOSABLE email to play it. You can still enjoy the game, whilst limiting your privacy exposure.

       You're right in that course location data is redundant if you're big brother with access to everything, but unengaged users don't point their cell phone at their surroundings for no reason.

       Maybe but I wouldn't care if they did. If they're sending people to a specific place by using exotic Pokemon then who cares imho. If it's public property who cares and if it's private property then bad on the "poke trainer" for trespassing. They already have many other tactics and fronts to collect our location data and access our cameras, so I guess I mean Pokemon go would probably be the last thing I would be worrying about. Just my two cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: this sub use to be willing to hear out other opinions, but sadly that appears to have changed. My point is we shouldn't focus on Pokemon taking pictures of public places, but rather Google for storing far more and serious info on us and handing it over to the government without our consent.

       You are correct in there being higher problems.  But this is just an obvious "pass the work onto someone else who can't be prosecuted with us getting in trouble and who can do things with an excuse and we benefit".

       Sure but I think folks forget that we live in a different world then even ten years ago. We are so connected now and I think these data mining operations are something to be expected . We need to put a stop to it but it's something that will take time. A lot of folks here see the problem and that's great, but that doesn't mean we should blame the general population for not being educated on these things. Once the "connected" generation is in power I really think we'll have these kinks worked out. I also like to think of how we are as people. I consider myself to be a good person, but that doesn't mean I haven't done shitty things. These companies are taking advantage of the lack of laws around data mining and our willingness to not read what we agree to in terms and conditions. I'd say it's shitty but it's hard to blame them when it's allowed the way it is. There will also be those entity's that will always do shitty things and I can only hope they are caught and prosecuted when applicable. I know there are murderer's out there but until they are caught and hopefully properly reprimanded, I can only live my life. It's easy to sit on a forum and point out all of the injustices in the world but there will always be bad people and good people, and it's on us to adjust over time how deal with these new obstacles. It's pokemon and folks are really enjoying it so for me it's not worth the rabbit hole of what ifs regarding pictures being taken in public.

       One of the things that stuck with me was Walt Disney, that dude thought that the TV and electricity were going to forever change man, and he was right.  But he also thought that people would be able to choose to learn spanish on their TV, or any other educational purpose, not the bastardized commercial awful shit that TV is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the heart of every technology becoming a bastardized piece of shit rather than the great savior that will finally free us all is that we are lazy and put up with shitty stuff, and we put up with shitty changes that happen without our consent and continue to give entities our business because we're too lazy to change.  No new generation is going to work out the kinks, they're going to find all the new holes and take advantage of them.  That's the cycle we perpetuate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laziness is at the heart of it all.  Truth is self-evident, lies need your permission over time and laziness and entertainment is the route most lies can slowly work their way in from.  But, what do I know, I'm just a dude on a website aimed at 18-35 year olds.

       I agree. The kinks I spoke of are the laws surrounding digital privacy, which I still believe will improve with the next generation. Please don't think I'm naive to the fact that some other problem will pop up and we'll wash and repeat this cycle. What you call laziness I call the bitch that is life. I can sit here and read all of these issues but I still have to put the phone down and figure out my own issues. Sorry to say but I feel that life is always us putting up with changes that happen without our consent , but not with the blanket statement of because we're too lazy. Life is truly a bitch and I try not to judge or blame folks who do make those decisions whether they're"good" or "bad", that's not my decision to make.

       But laws around digital privacy just close things off.  Information that's free and available to everyone, is now being closed off further and further.  You see what I'm saying?  New laws don't fix a problem who's central issue is that some people game the system for profit, or close off information by creating gatekeepers and limiting access that was available to everyone.   And most of us don't think out the long run of what that means, we just want it now and don't care what we trade for it, even if it's our own freedom in the long run.  What happens when all the information that was free is then only available to a few?  Do laws on digital privacy help perpetuate that or do they stop that?  I can tell you that in the past the laws passed had hopes that they would stop it, but they perpetuated it.  In newspapers, radio, television...  Tons of newspapers to only a few that control, tons of cable television channels down to a few that control.  How many media companies existed on the internet, compared to how many that control the main websites now (including reddit)?  Then you ask yourself why are we no longer encouraged to be anonymous online in most places, when that would solve the whole problem of digital privacy in the first place.  Why did the internet go from being boundariless to being walled off for certain places?  What direction are we going?
      </p>
      <p>
       Life isn't a bitch, it's so simple.  It's self-centeredness and laziness that are a bitch, because they perpetuate the cycle.  Life
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       figuring out how to get around the changes that occur, it's that constantly... only problem is when we take the easy way and trade in our ability to change later.  It's the equivalent of saying "give me the food that tastes good right now, I don't care if it's healthy".  We get what we deserve, not what we wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't change and figure out our own kinks, there isn't some magic entity that fixes stuff tomorrow.  We get tomorrow what we did today.  Be the change you want to see in the world.

       Be the change all you want, but that doesn't mean you actually impact anything. Laws are there to attempt to appease the majority when infraction takes place, and to hopefully deter the same thing from happening. The people in controller now don't understand the technology of now and this is an ever evolving door that's is always about 1. Changes in culture and 2. Adapting to those changes and 3. Rinse and repeat the process. Saying laws around digital privacy closes things off is narrow minded. This whole thing is about Pokemon go storing location data, which is viewed in  a negative light, there need to be better laws and in return real repercussions that allow us to not have those fears. Laws only close things off when the majority doesn't agree with them. They're needed and I think the digital age is so new and just a lot to deal with, that we're not able to stop these corporations when they have nothing to fear. Humans have always tried to make anything easier than it was before and I think you're confusing that with laziness. If we are given the choice to do something easier we will do it because it's in our nature. I don't blame someone who doesn't care about their data and go willy nilly with opening themselves up to these digital issues, they feel the risk reward is fine, and that's perfectly fine to feel that way, it's human nature. Some folks in life will make huge impact on society but most of us are just trying to get by and enjoy what's in front of us, which again to me is fine.  Also I challenge you to watch a loved one rot away due to an illness and tell me life isn't a bitch, maybe you can deal with it the "correct" way but that shouldn't devalue how someone else deals with the same thing . We're all just people in a world we never asked to be in.

       While I appreciate your willingness to open your self up like that, I feel you've proved my point. Blanket statements that were just lazy are just incorrect imo. I'm not going through any specific shit atm but the point was that we shouldn't judge others for how they deal with their life, or their willingness to accept the lazy way out. As you said, we're all on the Titanic and while I'd rather be the band, I would never devalue the emotions that cause the others to panic and cry. We all experience life differently and we all handle it differently,l and I find real beauty in that. I just really think folks should be able to enjoy Pokemon and not be called lazy shills that are perpetuating what's wrong with society. Thanks for the civil conversation, sometimes we'll have to agree to disagree.

       Ok. So if I proved your point, how do digital privacy laws fix everything?  I guess I don't get what you're saying, and I'd really wonder how would you turn around the locking down of information and the control of the internet?   If we can't judge something that's causing a direction to continue to be pushed forward, then what's the answer?  Pretend it isn't happening?  Pretend we aren't all part of that same issue going on as we contribute to it bit by bit??

       If we could talk I would be more than happy to continue our conversation, but we aren't going to convince the other of anything so I'm going to politely withdraw from this exchange. Again I appreciate the civil back and forth and hope you  all the best to you. We may not agree but I appreciate anyone who is a critical thinker.

       I absolutely agree, but being critical vs "calling a spade a spade" are two different things. This is why I said in the future when people are educated we will see change. Everyone who downloaded that app gave the developers permission to all of the data you speak of. They either know the risks and don't care or they are uneducated to the possible risks and as much as someone can say that's wrong, it's still the individuals responsibility to know what info they might be putting out there.

       I agree with all of that up until you start assuming. I'm on board with a lot on this sub but I personally need sufficient evidence before I start accusing anyone of anything, and in my opinion who the owners of the company are isn't it.

       In fact, it would be naïve to assume that a popular, free, closed-source geocaching app

       stealing your data.

       Never said Ops speculation was off base. I said imo there were bigger things I was worried about.If you're going to assume they are stealing your data, you're doing so out of your own self-interest, which is great as we should all do with all personal data, but that doesn't mean they are. As I said earlier  we're still responsible for the decisions we make. If you install the app and you hit allow on those permissions then that's the risk you take. I'm not saying they're not data mining but if they are I give zero fucks about pictures from my local park or neighborhood, as they already have access to these things. If they are data mining  they shouldn't be but this is the real world and people need to except that the world will never be perfect and if we say we really care about something that we need stop talking about making a change and do whatever you can to make a positive impact on it, and imo Pokemon go isn't something that I think is negatively impacting society. Sorry for rambling, I just feel that almost anything can be linked to a conspiracy and sometimes people should be able to enjoy what they enjoy. If we can't do that, then we all should just be Amish and attempt to remove all traces of corporate America. The world is what it is, attempt to do our part to make a positive impact, appreciate our lives and hope to die peacefully.

       This is the false binary that corporate America wants you to believe in. We can have all kinds of wonderful technology that doesn't steal our data, or build evidence against us, or pilfer from us. The current status quo isn't the only way for a technologically advanced society to operate.

       We're still allowed to enjoy something that's bad for ourselves, and we're talking about Pokemon not heroin. If I apply your opinion to the Google Street view car, which has far exceeded anything thing Pokemon go would ever compile, then I would say your one hundred percent right, but this app imo is truly made for enjoyment and I just don't think there's a legit conspiracy atm for it to carry any weight.

       We're going to disagree on the "false binary that corporate America wants you to believe in", but I would rather worry about my data in todays world than live before modern technology and worry about being drowned for being a witch. Again we like to think we're special but forget that we will always have to deal with shitty things, no matter at  what point in time you're living in.

       Good post.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 3D model of the United States would allow drones to navigate at levels never before seen without having to understand the environment and/or without the need for an operator behind the joystick. We've seen it in video games with the opponent AI knowing
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       about the world he's in, where he can go, what shortcuts he can take to get there, where the death traps are, and even a human player might not know this without exploring, mapping, memorizing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pokemon is gathering data that would allow an AI to navigate almost anywhere on Earth that a human could go without even having to think. Extremely valuable data for the military to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny story, I actually invented the concept for Pokemon Go a long time ago, but the idea was packaged as a different franchise, same idea where you'd trek across the real planet Earth to find treasure, battle monsters and vanquish evil, through an augmented reality. Nintendo-CIA saw my idea on Reddit and stole it, that's the real conspiracy! But being an idea man where ideas are abundant, it doesn't bother me.

       So now you're starting to see why Pokemon Go is a big deal. And it's kind of strange how
       <em>
        child labor

       , packaged as a rewarding experience, is being harnessed to gather the data. And it's not just children playing it. It's the perfect crowdsourced geospatial program.

       I was thinking about that too (mapping for drones etc.), since Google acquired Boston Dynamics a few years ago.

      <p>
       Maybe they are using it as a mapping for their AI's future deployment, I'm sure AI from Boston Dynamics could use some better terrain models for navigation. The prototypes are working in parking lots and trails, now they just need to make some fine tune adjustments.

       Seriously! I warned colleagues about Google a very long time ago. All they could do was look at me like I had a tinfoil hat on backwards. Their response is "but Google's motto is do no evil" or "but Google CEO's only make $1 per year" or "but Google's software is FREE tell me another service as reliable and great as that". That's all ignorance. Google does have great software and smart engineers, but it comes at a price which isn't FREE and isn't making the elites who spy on us all only $1/year...

       Hmm. Well those AI attack dogs Boston Dynamics is working on could potentially use this information to determine where they are based on landscapes. Or a program could scan your photographs and now know where you are by matching landmarks. One big flaw with this geolocation system is that is really only useful in urban and developed areas. Only about 3-5% of the entire United States is actually developed. The rest of the land is undeveloped. Nobody is playing Poke'Mon Go in the middle of the remote forest and plains of the United States so it's useless around there.

       80.7% of the US Population lives in cities, and I'm sure they can easily deploy drones to map the country areas with people not even realizing it.

       This could be an incredible coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But did anyone else first hear about Pokemon Go as news of the Dallas sniper attacks was breaking?
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, I seriously considered whether this app could possibly serve as some sort of a distraction from police brutality. But then, I noticed that this also seemed to be bringing a bunch of politically pissed off total strangers together in American streets!

       If the CIA is really behind this app, then their plan for social control seems to be completely back firing!
Maybe this could mark the start of some sort of #AmericanSpring?

       So here goes. I love Pokemon Go. From all aspects. One I have fully accepted the government uses technology to track people and I had accepted that a long long time ago. Next the whole making people become accustom to VR or AR  in this case is not a bid deal because we already are.... COD simulates war, sims simulate life it's a similar concept only this game is forcing people to go outside and they can't escape life's natural beauty. Three I have seen more people walking and socializing since this game came out than I ever have in my years as a resident in my town. My boyfriend who never wants to do anything but binge watch Netflix has in the last week walked on trail with me, walked three miles around a lake, went to the zoo, went fishing, and begged me to walk to a restaurant instead of driving. That's amazing I haven't seen him work out this much since I've known him. Not to mention he has severe social anxiety and I've seen him comfortably talk to strangers about Pokemon. He loves Pokemon and this game is literally changing his life it's amazing. Normally I'm all about down with the government and big brother and I see that with this game but I also see that with Facebook and Twitter and snapchat. The difference is this game is making people explore, socialize and bringing back my generations sense of wanderlust which has been lost on video games played inside and Netflix and Hulu and separating themeselves from the shitty world by living in a reality of various binge watched television, and video games. While this gives them an opportunity to go out and explore all the while making it even more enjoyable by bringing out the softer childlike wonder in all our hearts

       You can have an active lifestyle without revolving it around the use of an AR application, I was relatively sedentary for awhile but started skateboarding &amp; go outside a lot more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you guys just need to pick up bicycling, longboarding, anything that gets you outdoors, and enjoy riding around exploring &amp; enjoying the scenery. I don't need to bury my face in an application to get enjoyment from going for a cruise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree though that there are both positive and negative effects from this app, I was happy to see a relatively overweight guy riding a bicycle around catching Pokemon, I was thinking in my head "maybe this will be his motivation to get his brain firing differently, and he will stick with it" (when I was being sedentary for a brief moment in my life I realized it's harder to stop the longer you live like that, but once you start getting up and doing stuff everyday your whole outlook will change &amp; you start to have a better mood etc.)

       I totally agree it isn't needed to indulge in a more active and healthy lifestyle and I wish people from my generation would have more incentives than a Pokemon app to go outside but unfortunately that is not the case, and that's where I see the positive outweighing the negative here. Like you said I've seen many overweight people out and about and it's amazing. I myself love to be outside doing things and enjoy an active life, I do yoga every morning and prefer to ride the bus so I can walk at least to the bus stops from destination a to b. My boyfriend however before this did not he is slightly overweight and eats very unhealthy so this may just be the perfect thing for him to get active. :)

       i don't know if it is a conspiracy or not, but i'm damn sure it's being promoted extra-ordinarily, making more people jump on bandwagon because suddenly "everyone is doing it". Everyone is not doing it, it is being made to look like everyone is doing it, and soon because of this unnatural promotion, everyone will be doing it.

       So if this is true it should be easy to test. Just look at the amount of data being sent from this app while it's in use. If it just updates pokemon locations and item locations, that shouldn't be much data. If it's sending streaming video or tons of pictures, that would be a ton of data.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone using pokemon go notices that their data usage has gone through the roof, this would be a good piece of evidence to support this theory.

       People take a picture where the Pokemon spawn from what I've gathered, so I'm not sure about a live video feed.

       I don't think it'd be going towards your data cap or data plan, I'm sure there are ways to hide certain processes and filter out certain data so it doesn't apply to your cap (we're talking alphabet soup agencies working with Google).

       Yeah perhaps it is just uploading that picture that you take where the pokemon is. So you just upload an image or two for every pokemon you catch, perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be surprised though if they were actually hiding data so it doesn't affect people's data plans, that's pretty committed and there would have to be a lot of cooperation between vendors. It's possible, but unlikely I think. Especially if it's just a pic or two. If it's like a pic every second, then maybe the data is being hidden, but that seems pretty unlikely to me.

       I'm not sure what the frequency is of Pokemon caught, I don't play the game. But yeah they wouldn't really even need to hide the data if it's just a picture here &amp; there...

       And the hype will probably die down eventually. It's only been out 4 days, give it a few months and I'm sure only the hardcore players will stick around.

       When you install the application it requests full access to your Camera, Location, Files, Identity, etc. - if you're talking about disabling AR mode I'm sure it's just a layer that can be easily removed with the right tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       The application has access to your camera anyways, so even if you're playing in AR mode, the app can still snap a picture whenever. Your phone's screen might show that virtual world, but the camera is still being accessed by the application...

       Because an application that has access to the camera &amp; all device files etc. cannot take a picture, save it to temporary files, upload to a remote server, and automatically delete it?

       We form a suprabiological beast. Our law enforcement and national securities might as well be the immune system. Read about the invention of the police, their job is law-enforcement, not protecting the innocent: only sometimes are those mutually inclusive. This isn't Athenian democracy, and we're told it failed. What a joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       The best I think we can do is to create a society that doesn't feed on itself. Through social engineering and resource allocation we can probably create the most stable, harmonious society possible until the higher classes inevitably evolve beyond recognition...but it's interesting to consider how ai and more will work in this mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, we could have a decentralized system that was uniformly adaptive. That would be interesting...but man people are kinda stupid sometimes. We could possibly pull that off with AI, but I feel like stratification will emerge through resource allocation and context.
      </p>
      <p>
       What to do?
...I could try to move on up and become one with the military-industrial complex...
      </p>
      <p>
       Or? Is there even another, viable choice? I'm not super intelligent, so that's nixxed. The only concern is what other beasts I'd fine in the brain of it all. I've never knowingly met a Myercroft or a Moriarty. Well, there are a few candidates, but he knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society doesn't have the intellectual resources to pull off a distrbitued utopia...actually we do, but our economics and greed get in the way.

       100% true that this is for farming location data. This AR game design has had at least 3 iterations now.  Started with Field Trip about 4 years ago, then Ingress,  now Pokémon Go. It's all the same,  and they use the same locations. I'm sure they even share the same databases to some extent.

       if you have the patience.

       I'm theorizing here, not making any leaps or conclusions.

       John Hanke ran Keyhole, Inc. which developed EarthViewer, which later became Google Earth. John Hanke was the product manager for Google Earth &amp; google's Geo products, and is now the CEO of Niantic @ Google, which is responsible for the development of augmented reality games like Ingress and Pokemon Go.

       Here is a wordy definition on Geospatial Intelligence:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        GEOINT encompasses all aspects of imagery (including capabilities formerly referred to as Advanced Geospatial Intelligence and imagery-derived MASINT) and geospatial information and services (GI&amp;S); formerly referred to as mapping, charting, and geodesy). It includes, but is not limited to, data ranging from the ultraviolet through the microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as information derived from the analysis of literal imagery; geospatial data; georeferenced social media; and information technically derived from the processing, exploitation, literal, and non-literal analysis of spectral, spatial, temporal, radiometric, phase history, polarimetric data, fused products (products created out of two or more data sources), and the ancillary data needed for data processing and exploitation, and signature information (to include development, validation, simulation, data archival, and dissemination). These types of data can be collected on stationary and moving targets by electro-optical (to include IR, MWIR, SWIR TIR, Spectral, MSI, HSI, HD), SAR (to include MTI), related sensor programs (both active and passive) and non-technical means (to include geospatial information acquired by personnel in the field)

       Smart phones nowadays are packed with sensors / cameras, now people just walk around wherever the app tells them to go with their phones out buried into them, or walk for however many miles they need to walk to hatch eggs etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh a Pokemon spawned, better aim my smart phone camera at that geographic feature and swipe some Pokeballs at it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone is playing with the Augmented Reality version, but I'm sure the images can all be filtered easily to remove the game layer.

       I don't think pokemon go is an effective GEOint tool by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, think about the angle of all the photos that people take showing off their new pokemon, all those angles point downwards on very mundane things, such as grass, park benches, empty tables.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, the resources necessary process this huge amount could probably be used elsewhere.

       Location data on cellphones has been tracked by apple/google etc for years now.

       The NGA is always looking for ways to expand the gathering of GIS information but I doubt that the data from pokemon GO would be useful.

       Now instead of trying to pick my points apart by referencing a game I have no intentions or desire to play why don't you come back to the point about why privacy isn't important and why we shouldn't care who has access to any data stored about us?
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to my comment above about "everything to hide", I agree with you. I'm not sure what relevance that has to either of our points on privacy.

       Agreed. Idgaf if the NSA wants to read my boring ass emails or geo-locate me. I doubt im that exciting when they have isis and terror cells to find.

       Because you're doing nothing wrong, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you sure about that? There are more than 10 THOUSAND federal laws...do you know every single one of them? No?
      </p>
      <p>
       THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT BREAKING ABOUT 500 OF THEM AT THIS MOMENT, and that your texts, emails, metadata, and geolocation data will not be used as evidence to prove said crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask any lawyer, NO ONE is innocent today if you look at them. It's the people who think they are innocent that are the easiest criminals to catch, the low-hanging fruit. It's why a great lawyer once said "Never talk to police if you're guilty, but ESPECIALLY never talk to police if you're INNOCENT. As soon as you open your mouth, they will get you to commit a crime"

       Well fine, I'm guilty of crimes, that's nice. And some day they might round me up and put me in a detention center for whatever crime de jour they decide I'm guilty of, that's nice. Do you really think playing this Pokemon app over the weekend makes it any more likely that will happen?

       Exactly. I think they have bigger fish to fry than the people playing a pokemon game. If this was truly their motive, couldn't they have created an app more geared towards people working in the fields that may offer secrets? And not, you know, people playing pokemon.

       It's a matter of convenience vs security. It took me all of 1 hour and $20/yr to completely replace every google app that I use on my phone. Yes, google apps are easy to use and provide great services, but there are other services out there that provide those same features and DON'T read through your emails, serve you ads, track your location, learn your voice, view your web history, scan your texts, store your photos, read your documents, etc.
      </p>

       When something is free, you are the product. For most people that's fine; I'd rather not be mined for marketing analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterthought: No, I have never had it be an issue and I doubt I ever will. It's a slippery slope though, and one day someone without our best interests at heart may decide to seize all that data and use it against us somehow.

       People take a picture where the Pokemon spawn from what I've gathered, so I'm not sure about a live video feed.

       I don't think it'd be going towards your data cap or data plan, I'm sure there are ways to hide certain processes and filter out certain data so it doesn't apply to your cap (we're talking alphabet soup agencies working with Google).

       It's still surreptitious. When you sign up for these services, they don't elaborate on why they're "free", and your personal data is something that you can't put an accurate value on.

       Your data could be much more valuable in the future if you or a neighbor became a target for any reason, or when data analysis advances allow us to get more out of it.
