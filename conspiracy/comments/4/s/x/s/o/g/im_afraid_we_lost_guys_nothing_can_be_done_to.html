       So... I'm french and I've been following all the discussions after each events... It's over. You can't reason anyone anymore, people lost their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general consensus in these threads is that muslims, all of them, 1,7 billions of human beings are inherently evil and are at war with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys are all ready to go at war against the
       <strong>
        large majority of muslims populations
       </strong>
       I shit you not.. I'm not paraphrasing but directly quoting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they realize that the last guy who wanted to kill an entire population solely based on their religious beliefs was Hitler ? Except that the potential death count is 1,7 billions of human beings this time ?  They completly lost their minds...
      </p>
      <p>
       This other guy tells me "I'm against war but sometimes there's no choice, and when it all blow up
       <strong>
        you'll have to chose a side, with us or with them
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       What the flying fuck I dont want to chose any fucking side you retarded psycho.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all these sick comments are higly upvoted, dozens if not hundreds of comment agreeing with them
      </p>
      <p>
       We lost guys, it's too late. I checked their comment history a bit, none of them are shills, they are just people so brainwashed that they came to believe 1,7 billions of people are at war with us, yet their only weapons, their only means to attack us are... trucks ? Who can believe this nonsense ??
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all over, run for your life

       The world is fucked up because NORMAL people are fucked up, not the psychos or the fanatics or the losers who want revenge. No, it's the Tom, Dick and Jane walking down the street, going to work, supporting their families and all the while rotting inside. That's extreme but when you look around you, you see the spiritually dead, the weak and the blind, seeking false identities to hide behind and refusing to accept our shared humanity. When these tragedies happen they always look outward and they say the world is insane, people are insane. But they don't realize that one nasty look, like the butterfly effect, builds up in a person and gradually strips away their goodness. Look online, youtube comments, comments every where, it's all filth, horrible words against others. Words that sting deep. Who are these commenters? Losers? Psychos? Fanatics? No, they're normal people. All of this builds up, this nastiness, and creates the world we are living in today.

       It is not to late...I have plenty of wonderful people who surround me each day and we talk often of the state of the world and America not with hate but with concern. We are the farmers and rural folks who are hard working, and faithful.  Our focus is on helping one another, waving and smiling to others as we pass, bartering between our farms.  We see our lost brothers and sisters struggling and our hearts reach out to them.  We get up early in the morning and go to bed early at night.  We give thanks for each and every day we are given for the gift that it is and I know for a fact that there are more people than not just like we are!  We will be here when and if things break down and hopefully we can help ease the hardships.  I don't wear Prada, buy into the latest trends or live my life vicariously through celebrities and I haven't been more than 100 miles from my farm in at least three years.  My idea of fun is a day on the lake fishing (yes I am a woman and I love to fish) and a BBQ with friends and family.  We are the normal people so please don't give up hope....we are here and we are all in this together!

       This might be unpopular with some of you, but I think the problem is made a lot worse by the internet.  Seeing members of the other side put their hate on display makes individuals more radicalized.

       There are good people out there. Few and far between.
But in far greater number there are evil people.
People are nasty.  If you could read the minds of the all the people as you walk down the sidewalk in a city street you would know how nasty and evil they truly are.

       The facade of civility that people show is paper thin. When shit hits the fan the true nature will emerge. It won't be pretty.

       All economic theories rely on one basic principle. Infinite supply and demand. No economic model recognises finite resources. Initially this wasn't a problem. When these theories were made we hadn't reached peak oil, we didn't fully understand the consequences to our planet. Now we do. Nothing changed. They still push their stupid products wrapped up in layers of plastic made from oil. They lobby Incessantly against any form of green policy. They refuse to acknowledge finite resources. As far as I'm concerned there can only be two reasons for this;
A) they have a power source that they are keeping under wraps. They intend to make as much money from our dwindling reserves as possible (at a higher price) before revealing their miracle energy source before it's too late (highly unlikely)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or more likely,
      </p>
      <p>
       B) they plan to have a population cull. They will be able to start all over while maintaining all human advancements and build on top of them. (Extremely likely)

       So sharia law isn't a problem? Talmudic Jews practicing orthodox beliefs aren't a problem? Christian bigotry isn't a problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       See, I disagree because it's the belief in these archaic and dated systems that is the problem.  Yes, Islam literally allows most of these things. Does it mean that 100% of believers will follow to the letter? No. But it's dangerous nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ignore the fundamental problem and run away/give up is also part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up. Grow some courage. Be a human and love each other. Plant the seeds for the next generation lest some fundamental religious idiots do it on your behalf.

       living in and visiting France. Yes, the fucking Muslims are your enemies, and they will destroy you if you continue to be the cucks you have shown yourselves to be over the past couple of years. It's time to get angry, and it's time to kill your enemies. If the people of France can't understand that they are already fucked and the Muslims have already won.

        Simple chaos strategy.

       <p>
        If you think about it, what made us the dominant species on earth ? It's our superior capacity to form highly organized groups working together to reach a common goal,
        <strong>
         it's our main strength...
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course governments want adversity and chaos in the population because if we were grouped and organized we would overthrow all these greedy corrupted fuckers in no time. They feed this hatred constantly, black/white, men/womens, young/old, gay/heteros, religious/secular you name it...
       </p>
       <p>
        People need to stop falling in this trap and start to work together to make things better.

       Please understand:

      <p>
       They are not all hoaxed. Some are false flags, and others are hoaxes. Still, both are engineered by the governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In false flags, innocent people do die. (9/11)
      </p>
      <p>
       In hoaxes, no one dies, and it's the medias job to perpetuate the story worldwide, as if it were real. (Sandy hook)
      </p>
      <p>
       Please spread this knowledge so we can end the argument of "people died" or "people didn't die".
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, they are fucking with our heads, and in some cases, innocent people are losing their lives in these operations. Learn the difference.

       No, it doesn't. It simply means it's inaccurate to characterize both sides at psychopathic killers. It also means that as long as you don't live in a country that is going to be on the receiving end of Western military might, you don't really have to worry for your personal safety. Sanity, maybe. But you're safe. Don't panic. Don't be afraid. That's what they want. Don't give them the satisfaction.

       Why would people staging an event specifically so that they can go and kill thousands of men, women, and children, give one short fuck about the lives of Jim Bob and Mary Sue? Stop drinking the Kool-Aid.

PROBLEM - REACTION - SOLUTION
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem: cave dwelling terrorists hijacked a plane and flew it into 2 towers, collapsing them and killing over 3000 people on our homeland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaction: All of America becomes super upset, ultra patriotic, and hungry for blood. The problem instilled a revenge plot in all of our minds to invade the attacking country and stop their terror organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: The Iraq war begins. We invade Iraq. George and Dick establish bases in the Middle East, all the while, securing oil drilling sights as their own, killing the innocent populations and profiting off of a war that would never end.

       I didn't say they give a short fuck about them. I honestly don't know why they hoax all this stuff instead of actually killing people. I guess there's less fallout to deal with.

       Funny... the worst destruction ever wrought on France happened during two world wars fought by white Christians.
