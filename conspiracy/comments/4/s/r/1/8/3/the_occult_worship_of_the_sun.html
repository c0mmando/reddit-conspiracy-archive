       <strong>
        ANCIENT RELIGION AND THE SUN
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        WHY THE SUN IS OBVIOUSLY THE ONE AND ONLY THING WE REALLY WORSHIP
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mans first enemy was darkness. The terror of the night. The uncertainty of tomorrow.
When the sun rose, mankind cheered with the joy of sight and safety. 
Without the sun, there would be no life, therefor the sun is the bringer of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        THE THREE STAGES OF THE SUN AND THE ORIGIN OF TRINITY
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun would rise, it would be born.
It would be around midday, it would be alive/mature.
It would be evening, it would be dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trinity is a often reoccuring term in theology, see here
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity#Other_views">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity#Other_views
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After this time, nighttime comes, and here the same trinity applies to Darkness.
At the start of the evening, when the sun was at its most high and dying, mankind would give offerings to 'the most high'.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the sun dies, you can see the rays of the sun. The oldest symbol for this is the Crown of Thorns.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_thorns">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_thorns
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ONE OF THE OLDEST KNOWN RELIGIONS, THE ANCIENT RELIGION OF THE EGYPTIANS, IS SUN WORSHIP
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis is the mother of Horus, and Osiris was the father of Horus. 
Horus is the son of Isis/Osiris. Or rather, the Sun of Isis/Osiris.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis is a symbol for the Sky. She is the Throne for the Sun.
Osiris is a symbol for the afterlife, regeneration, and ressurection.
Seth, the brother of Osiris, the prince of Darkness, kills Osiris.
      </p>
      <p>
       From wiki: As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently reincarnated every morning, Osiris was identified as both Creator god, king of the underworld, god of the afterlife, reincarnation, life, death, and resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
       His body/life was divided in 12 parts/hours/months/signs of the zodiac.
Only his penis was left 'undivided'. This is the obelisk, the phallus. Now you know whats with the obelisk/phallus at the Vatican / White House. Its a penis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis then gives birth to Horus. Isis is depicted holding a baby, the baby is Horus.
Horus is also symbolized as a hawk, eagle, and a dove. Now you know whats with the doves and eagles at your local church and government.
      </p>

       <strong>
        HOW CHRISTIANITY IS A COPY OF THE EGYPTIAN SUN WORSHIP RELIGION
       </strong>
       AND
       <strong>
        WORDS, TERMS, PRACTICES AND BUILDINGS THAT ARE SUN WORSHIP
       </strong>
       I assume the reader has some basic knowledge of Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, spoiler alert,
       <em>
        Jesus dies
       </em>
       , and he is ressurected.
       <em>
        Every day.
       </em>
       Jesus has 12 disciples, divided by the 4 seasons of 3 on the famous last meal painting. Jesus, the Sun, is in the middle.
Jesus is the light of the world. And his return is promised.
When Jesus dies he wears a
       <em>
        Crown of Thorns
       </em>
       . Now you know whats with the crown of thorns on the statue of liberty.
In most paintings about religious events, the characters are portraied with a disk behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This disk not only represents the Sun, it comes from the ancient Winged Sun / Winged Disk. 
It symbolises divinity and royalty.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_sun">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_sun
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Left wing and Right Wing are terms that symbolize the wings of this disc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hal El Lu Jah, (note El and Jah) Hallelujah, means Horus is risen. (Study the etymology Jehovah and you will find the name Jehova (YHWH) is a translation from the more ancient name ISIS)
Amen comes from Amun-Ra. Ra symbolises the noon sun. Amun-Ra was his new name after a narcistic ruler named Amun changed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       From wiki: Ra is the ancient Egyptian sun god. By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th centuries bc, he had become a major god in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun.
In later Egyptian dynastic times, Ra was merged with the god Horus, as Ra-Horakhty ("Ra, who is Horus of the Two Horizons"). He was believed to rule in all parts of the created world: the sky, the earth, and the underworld. He was associated with the falcon or hawk. When in the New Kingdom the god Amun rose to prominence he was fused with Ra as Amun-Ra.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra">

      <p>
       We have a Moonday, Tuesday (Venusday), Wetnessday, Thorsday (Thunderday) Freeday, Saturnday and the holy day: Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hours = Horus. Horizon. Sun-Seth. If you dont get this, dont bother.
What do you call your male baby? A Sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       When one is smart he is bright. He is enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our most famous people, we call them stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there is major trouble, we speak of a dis-a-star.
Or a cat-astro-phe. I hope you SEA what I mean by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL:DR
       </strong>
       Mankind worships the sun/astronomy/nature,
       <em>
        some know that they do
       </em>
       , 
Most of them have no clue, this is part one
       <em>

       There's one problem with this. Ancient Egyptians didn't speak English, and neither did the people that created Christianity. The words they had for the big ball of fire in the sky did not rhyme with the words they had for male children.

       It's merely coincidence that sun and son sound alike, truth is our sun is called Sol. Hence Sol-stice, referring to the position of the sun (sol) throughout the year. Offer than that the guys correct, Christianity and all other religions, whether monotheistic or polytheistic are adaptations of sun worship, and the anthropomorphism of heavenly bodies (other planets and constellations) into a fabricated religion. Christianity is entirely fictional.

       Ancient Egyptians certainly didnt speak English. Neither did the people that created Christianity. But what you do not seem to grasp is that there is no difference between Sun and Son except the way it is written. The definition of either came long before the symbols used to write it down...

      </p>
      <p>
       PIE root *dʰeh₁(y)-
From Old Latin fīlios, from Proto-Indo-European *dʰeh₁y-li-os ‎(“sucker”) (compare Faliscan hileo ‎(“son”)), a derivation from the verbal root *dʰeh₁(y)- ‎(“to suck”). Related to fēmina, fellō, fētus, Old English delu ‎(“nipple, teat”), dēon ‎(“to suck, suckle”), Old Armenian դալ ‎(dal).

       Yes, in
       <em>
        Latin
       </em>
       . Not in the languages
       <em>

       <strong>

       Wrong the etymology of sun does not come from sun. it comes from "giving birth".

       There are so many similarities between this story and other stories that I got curious and looked for more information. In case anyone is interested, William Cooper (deceased) had a fascinating series of radio shows entitled 'Mystery Babylon' back in the 90s. Lots of controversy surrounding this series; there are claims that Bill was assassinated by the system. Anyway, in case anyone is interested, the entire series can be heard at

       the sun is used as a spiritual/philosophical symbol of life/light/etc. - it's literally the life-giver, life-bringer, creator, father of everything on earth - it  has been so since the beginning, it said (metaphorically) "let there be light", and there was light, and 'it was good'. It's "sol", the external world force where your "soul" comes from - the energy that you are came from the sun, sol, so your soul is called 'sol' with a u.
      </p>
      <p>
       the words you're typing and reading about are symbols that represent ideas and explanations for the world we live in, it's the ideas exemplified by "the sun" that are being admired, and the sun is a real-world representation of the highest things we can imagine, hence all the words.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's not
       <em>
        literal
       </em>
       worship of "the sun", this is esoteric philosophy.

       First of all, why are you on this sub if you are just going to be an asshole when people put in work? What a revolutionary act. Go you!
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I saw Zeitgeist when it was just released. That must have been like 9 years ago, or longer. I never claimed to be an expert. I wrote this up and researched this using sources that go beyond watching youtube compilations. Sources that any university would have to take serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont you just hate it when you put in work and some coffeeshop revolutionary starts taking a dump on it?

       So did TPTB create Christianity and other religions to mask the ancient sun worship so they could practice it themselves alone?

       They never really hid it, it is staring in your face (unless its nighttime). Sun and Son mean the same things, hence its not hidden anywhere, the only difference really is how it is written.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the holy books have multiple purposes, among them historical documentation, controlling the masses, and enlightening individuals. The people who wrote these books are geniuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to understand that spirituality, deity, worship, rituals, these are personal things. There is no ritual that fits you better than the ritual you created to fit. Some people actually feel good after gathering with the SpaghettiMonster Church.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB certainly have a lot of language and rituals devoted to the sun and astronomy. They created these rituals and practice them, because they agree on the rituals and practices. Just like any other cult does. Your question eventually becomes:
       <em>
        'Do TPTB know about arcane methods to empower themselves?'
       </em>
       Who knows? Aboriginals claim they did, Indians claim they did. I will dedicate a thread about the subject of magic/the arcane and their supposed powers later.

       Hey mate, I do have clues, why is everyone such an asshole about this subject? Let me explain the differences in our ''clues''. Heres the names of the days and related words in my language, and in English:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        English
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       wedness = wetness
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dutch (Germanic)
       </strong>
       woensdag = wednesday
      </p>
      <p>
       woens = regen
      </p>
      <p>
       regen = rain
      </p>
      <p>
       rain = wetness
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dutch (Germanic)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Donder = Thunder
      </p>
      <p>
       Donderdag = Thursday 
became Thors (Scandinavian dude, you probably know him)day
      </p>
      <p>
       Vrij = Free
      </p>
      <p>
       Fri = Free
      </p>
      <p>
       Vrijdag = Friday
      </p>
      <p>
       Free day
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I am wrong about, but certainly not clueless, is Tuesday being Venusday. The other differences are different entitlements but certainly not
       <em>
        false
       </em>
       . Not to mention that your correction only strengthens the hold of my argument that sun (or astronomical) worship is a thing that influences our daily habits.

       I liked the document you sent me. I assume you are familiar with the 'Mystery Babylon' series, a series in which the radio host narrates all kinds of old and rare books on the subject of the occult and alternative history. But just in case you aren't:
