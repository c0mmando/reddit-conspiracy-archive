    <div class="md"><p>Clintons are the puppets and Soros is the puppeteer. </p>

<p>I have wondered for a long time what Soros&#39;s objectives were. He doesn&#39;t support neocon or GOP politicians, but rather, funds lots of leftist liberal progressive causes. See for example the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/grants/soros-justice-fellowships">Soros Justice Fellows that he funds</a> and note the purpose of those fellowships:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Soros Justice Fellowships Program’s Advocacy Fellowships fund lawyers, advocates, grassroots organizers, researchers, and others with unique perspectives to undertake full-time criminal justice reform projects at the local, state, and national levels. Projects may range from litigation to public education to coalition-building to grassroots mobilization to policy-driven research. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet Soros made big donations to Hillary Clinton but not to Bernie Sanders. Sanders actually cared about labor unions, so I don&#39;t understand Soros&#39;s allegiance to Hillary, but it is certainly there.</p>

<p>Soros is no friend of Israel or of Jews, insofar as I can tell. His current wife is not Jewish. Soros charities and foundations do not make donations to typically Jewish causes. Soros could not be more different than someone like Sheldon Adelson, who is a staunch backer the GOP, of Donald Trump in particular, and of Israel. </p>

<p>My only guess about Soros&#39;s objectives is that he wants to fan the flames of social and political unrest. Why? Well, he is long gold now, and gold mining stocks. Gold and mining stocks often do well in times of great uncertainty and market volatility. That seems kind of simplistic though, as he already has more money than he knows what to do with. Also, if he wrecks the global economy or causes social instability globally, his holdings of precious metals and mining stock won&#39;t do him much good.</p>

<p>Soros is definitely a globalist elitist pushing for mass migration and supranational banking entities. In his own words, see what he wrote about the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-promise-of-regrexit-by-george-soros-2016-07">UK leaving the EU</a> and the huge amounts of money that <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rebuilding-refugee-asylum-system-by-george-soros-2015-09">he wants European countries to spend on refugees</a>. That seems destabilizing to me, right there.</p>

<p>My best friend on Twitter thinks that that is Soros&#39;s ultimate objective too.  My friend is former US military now studying for a graduate degree; he is quite conservative. For years, he wanted to think of Soros in positive terms, but based on Soros&#39;s recent actions (e.g. funding a strange amalgam of causes from democracy in the Ukraine to anti-Trump protests in the USA), he finally concedes that Soros is an elitist with a will to power, and quite dangerous to the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>That is  not evidence:  </p>

<p>They claim Soros funded the Ferguson protests, then offer as evidence a story that he has supported similar organizations in the past.   That is not evidence, it is speculative but presented as factual.  There is  no link to an IRS filing.</p>

<p>In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the other linked article, Deray one of the leaders of BLM, lives a $600k house owned by Soros Open Society Foundation members.  There are many other links from his organization to organized leftist protest movements</p>

<p>&quot;Liberal billionaire George Soros donated $33million to social justice organizations which helped turn events in Ferguson from a local protest into a national flashpoint.</p>

<p>The handouts, revealed in tax filings from Soros&#39;s private foundation, were given to dozens of different groups which weighed in on the crisis.</p>

<p>Organizers from professional groups in Washington, D.C., and New York were bussed into the Missouri town to co-ordinate messaging and lobby to news media to cover events using the billionaire&#39;s funding.</p>

<p>The flood of donations were uncovered in an analysis of the latest tax return by Soros&#39;s Open Society Foundations by the Washington Times. </p>

<p>The cash was reportedly funneled into keeping up numbers of protesters in the community over a period of months by bringing in outside activists.</p>

<p>Meanwhile papers from think tanks were disseminated to bring in extra coverage of the civil unrest, also linked to the police killings of Eric Garner in Staten Island and Tamir Rice, 12, in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

<p>Outlets which covered the research, and the movements themselves, included one, Colorlines, which Soros himself has funded. </p>

<p>The slew of organizations reportedly created their own online &#39;echo chamber&#39;, by using their extensive social media presences to &#39;like&#39;, repost and comment on articles putting across their point of view.&quot;</p>
