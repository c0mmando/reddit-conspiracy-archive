    <div class="md"><p>9/11 - At the very least, Bush and his administration knew there was a credible threat from someone to attack the US using hijacked planes. Regardless whether you believe it was the CIA, holographic planes or missles, the US Government under Bush allowed the attack to happen to further plans to invade the Middle East.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook - After watching the &quot;We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook&quot; video I am convinced something isn&#39;t right with the &quot;official&quot; explanation. Not only were websites asking for donations and advising &quot;how to talk to children about Sandy Hook&quot; were put online a day before the event took place but there&#39;s issues with Lanza&#39;s DNA not being present on any of the weapons and Conneticut has sealed all crime scene photographs and records of autopsies of the victims. </p>

<p>Gus Grissom -  Virgil Grissom was an astronaut who died in a fire during 27 January 1967 pre-launch test inside the command module of the Apollo 1 rocket. Ed White and Roger Chaffee, the other two members of the crew, also burned to death. The ignition source was never determined, but there were over a dozen fire hazards in the module, and the module’s design was grossly flawed in terms of safety.  The ignition source was never determined, but there were over a dozen fire hazards in the module, and the module’s design was grossly flawed in terms of safety.. The theory states that these safety flaws and flammable materials were so grossly negligent that NASA could not possibly have overlooked them all, but instead deliberately provided them, and then sabotaged the equipment in some way as to ensure an electrical spark once the cabin was sealed and pressurized.</p>

<p>However I do think many of the mass shooters were brainwashed somehow. So many of the backgrounds and stories just do not add up when you look at the details of these shooters&#39; lives.</p>

<p>Pause at 1:18 and watch at 1/4 speed.</p>

<p>Even official documentation supports my view that nobody dies in wars.</p>

<p>The US defense casualty analysis unit lists 456 deaths due to ‘hostile action’ in 2010. </p>

<p>And yet the CDC attributes only 9 (yes NINE) deaths to ‘operations of war and their sequelae’ for the same year. </p>

<p>So why is there such a disparity between the two datasets? Perhaps there is some fakery going on?</p>

<p>Or perhaps they look at data in different ways than you do? Not every situation in the world has a &quot;fakery&quot; explanation. </p>

<p>There have been thousands killed just in the past decade and a half. Are you honestly trying to claim that all of them (and the thousands of family members of them) are all in on this &quot;fakery&quot;? All the friends who no longer see these individuals are in on it? Does your lunacy really extend that far?</p>

<p>No, but if you were actually interested in the real world rather than your theories you would at least consider the feasibility of how such a secret would be kept. </p>

<p>They could be. However, this doesn&#39;t automatically prove that they are. </p>
