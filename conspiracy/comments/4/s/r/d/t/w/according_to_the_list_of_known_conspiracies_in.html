       I don't understand how this is at all believable. Communism is the antithesis to a banker dominated world. The claim that this is the end goal of evil secret societies is absurd. If we ever get anywhere close to a truly free society it's going to be very close to communism. It's the only sustainable way to have a society without exploitation. So can someone please explain this theory to me and why I shouldn't dismiss it as bullshit.

       Well, [Marx himself was controlled opposition,](mileswmathis.com/marx.pdf) so any political system growing out of his beliefs is problematic. But it was all part of the plan. Communism is a smokescreen. And not only was the creation of the Soviet Union funded by them, it was financed by them all along. Look up the work of Anthony Sutton on the Soviets and the NAZIs.

       Edit 2: keep in mind that Sutton worked for awhile at the Hoover Institute, a spook hangout. So there is bound to be some misdirection in his research. He wants to lead you to certain conclusions about who exactly was involved that might not be accurate. But a lot of good info nonetheless.

       Our earnest OP is inquiring about Communism as its publicised ideal – y'know, common ownership of property and resources, working for the common good a few hours/week, everyone eating bacon and having lots of sex – not what the West has deemed "Communist Regimes" that have nothing to do with the associated economic theory and are really just totalitarian, bloodthirsty oligarchies like the U.S. Take it easy.

       So you don’t get it. Okay.

       These are the 10 planks of the communist manifesto.
      </p>
      <pre><code>1. Abolition of private property and the application of all rents of land to public purposes
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels 
5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly
6. Centralization of the means of communications and transportation in the hands of the state
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state, the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan
8. Equal liability of all to labor. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries, gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equitable distribution of population over the country
10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Soviet Union enacted 10 out of 10 planks of the communist manifesto.
       </strong>
       Commies say they did not live to Marx’s ideals. Let’s assume they’re right and that the tenants were implemented poorly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine for a moment that you design cars for a car company. You’ve finally designed the perfect car: Excellent fuel economy, safety, handling, etc. Theoretically speaking, it’s flawless, and you’re sure it’ll earn the company billions and net you several promotions. The entire company is impressed and has the utmost faith in your project.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a prototype of your car is built and tested. During testing, the first few miles go well. But the car suddenly breaks down and bursts into flames after that. When the company hires some expert R&amp;D guys from somewhere else, they look at your design and what happened and tell you that while your design works theoretically, it does not work practically because of x (x being some metric that is not a problem theoretically but must be taken into account in practical application). But instead of scrapping the design–or at least
reworking it–you say, “Nah, you guys simply didn‘t implement my design properly.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So the team tests your design again and again, with the same result every time. Some variables may be different, and some cases end up better than others, but it always fails, costing the company tons of money. But rather than thinking that there is something fundamentally flawed with the design that makes practical application an impossibility, your obsession with this ‘perfect’ car and how it could (theoretically) work if it wasn‘t for [insert scapegoat here] simply makes you insist, “But you guys didn‘t make it right!” It doesn‘t matter that tons of prototypes have been wrecked and the rest of the company hates you for costing them millions; you just need some reason why the design failed other than the design itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, replace car design with communism, the failed prototypes with countries, the company with the world, money with human lives, and the designer with your typical communist. Are you starting to see the flaw in their logic?

       You have citations that are interesting to read though hardly prove anything, Sutton is suspect. I'm open to considering the idea put forth, but it's not indisputable by any means. Furthermore your analogy is terribly flawed and shows that you have little understanding of what communism actually is, and more importantly why it has failed in the past. Even if all sutton says is true it does little to discredit the ideology of socialism/communism. After all if bankers really did finance these movements then perhaps you should consider it was done to control the largest threat to their pyramid scheme they call capitalism. I am curious, if you express such vehement hatred at anything or anyone you perceive to be a "commie" how do you feel about capitalism? Because I can tell you right now that sustainable capitalism does not exist and never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comments drip with derision and an air of superiority and that is not the way to handle discourse, not that I think you care, I suspect you're perfectly happy in your delusional little bubble where communism is the root of all evil.

       You've demonstrated yourself to be a fool at every turn. First you assume I'm a communist because I can acknowledge the truths in its ideology. After all, what is the point of a society if not to come together and make a better world? The alternative is a psychopath's playground, such as our current situation. That being said I wouldn't call myself a communist, I don't ascribe myself to anything. But it gets so much worse because not only do you assume I'm a communist but essentially tell me I deserve to be shot for it... what are you from the 50's? To top it all off I came here with an open mind to see if there was anything to learn but rather than try and communicate in an intelligent manner you've decided to treat me with dismissive derision and make an ass out of yourself. Now good day sir!
