        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The world you perceive is nothing but an illusion, woven and interpreted by your brain as a neural-interactive waveform simulation we call The Matrix.
Everything is Energy.</p>

<p>What we perceive is no different than the Internet when accessed through a computer. We sense and experience mostly the same and different things, at both the same and different times.</p>

<p>Many people before me, have come to this conclusion, I do not need to name names, because it will be apparent to anybody who has decided to humor &quot;the nutters.&quot;</p>

<p>Consider if you will, what I will call, the Sword Art Online Theory, named such because <em>If you die in the &quot;game,&quot; you die for real.</em></p>

<p>&quot;The Sword Art Online (SAO) Theory&quot;</p>

<p>•01: Much like the World of Warcraft, none of us are here by choice anymore. Unlike WoW, however, we are no longer here of our own free will or to escape our empty fucking lives and are being held here by an insane Dungeon Master or Masters [DM(s)] with the express purpose of us being raised as cattle to sustain these cretins as a source of energetic &quot;food.&quot;</p>

<p>•02: We are given an illusion of choice to keep us contented and controlled. Religion, Creed, Politics, Societies, Establishments. Nothing more than the same shit with a different brand.</p>

<p>•03: We are given an illusion of free will to assist in these false concepts of choice. When all the options are the same with a different name, there is no choice to make except COMPLIANCE or DISOBEDIENCE.</p>

<p>•04: We are given a basic template -- Male or Female -- and a limited selection of avatars with nigh-limitless customization capacity. Anything beyond the &quot;gender binary&quot; is manufactured dissent and disinfo by the DMs to keep us locked in the ME ME ME cycle, to fall out of the possibility of UNITY and to instill and incite CHAOS. It does not matter if a man has sex with a man, or a woman having sex with a woman, or a man and a woman going at it. That is natural. Love is natural. These other inclinations.. towards children, towards objects, towards creatures, they are the tools of the DMs to sow CHAOS and FEAR. And similarly, all this SJW/Political Correctness/Safe Space/MUH TRIGGERS/MUH FEELINGS are nothing more than these assholes just trying to shoehorn more people into CHAOS and FEAR by dividing and conquering. Fuck you, if you can&#39;t handle TRUTH, open a fucking vein already, stop fucking hogging bandwidth. You&#39;re no better than a <em>torrent leech.</em></p>

<p>•05: We are given a basic goal -- Survive and Thrive. To this end we are given and taken from, comforts of the physical and emotional in order to keep us from burning out entirely from the forced farming of our primal gut-reactive emotional states in the lower three chakras: Root, Sacral, and S. Plexus; which are these DMs&#39;s food source.</p>

<p>•06: We are kept from ascending, with various degrees of difficulty in regards to the locks, access to the higher chakras and thus breaking the cycle of negativity which nourishes these entities. You could potentially call this act of breaking into a new state of consciousness or perception as <em>levelling up</em> and guess what, unlike the bounds of a hard machine system, <em>there is no level cap.</em></p>

<p>•07: As we continue to feed the dragon its bounty of yummy fear, we lose ourselves more and more into a system of Action-Reaction and begin to lose more and more of Observe-Investigate-Consider-React mind. We are like those poor, innocent n00bs who mindlessly rush the instance boss and get wiped, who didn&#39;t listen to the experienced <em>raid leader</em> who facerolled the prodigal Archimonde with a fucking Disc Pally and left us all in awe in &quot;HOW THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT? HAX!&quot; Stop being a fucking newfag at this shit, there&#39;s people out here who UNDERSTAND the &quot;raid mechanics&quot; of this &quot;instance&quot; who are trying to get us the &quot;epic loots&quot; of FREEDOM.</p>

<p>•08: If our HP hit Zero, we lose our existence in the &quot;physical&quot; realm, which is nothing more than voxels of light interpreted by our brains, which are the result of live-streaming downloaded data via energy waves of all kinds through our senses. If our &quot;MP&quot; hit zero - let&#39;s call this a metaphor for our willpower -- guess what! You die <strong>inside</strong> until you get a recharge from whatever the fuck it is that gives you your will to live again!</p>

<p>•09: We are not our avatars, or &quot;shells.&quot; We are Infinite Awareness, Infinite Consciousness. We are Light. We are the life-force of God itself. We are all one, manifesting itself as an infinite fractal of experiences simultaneously existing in a nebulous cloud-computed server which hosts the VRMMORPG known as &quot;Earth.&quot; Which, in itself, is an <strong>INFINTESIMALLY</strong> smaller VRMMORPG contained within the even larger one known as The Aleph Hypercluster, or the Known Observable Universe, aka &quot;Creation.&quot;</p>

<p>•10: We are slaves. We exist so these cretins can turn us into batteries. They cannot create, only distort. They have no innovation, only revision. They have no originality, only imitation. This is why a lot of people keep saying SAME SHIT, DIFFERENT DAY. Wake the fuck up and pull the plug out of your damn heads already, you&#39;re just another fucking cog in the machine with no purpose other than a transmission gear chain piece! The more of us that &quot;opt-out&quot; of this inane shit, the more power they lose, and the more we gain as a collective to TEAR THIS DEATH MACHINE APART.</p>

<p>•11: It does not matter what we do in this experience we call life, because it is simply that. An experience. It has no true, final effect on our lives. It only affects what we currently experience. We are not our shells. This is fleeting. This is temporary. This does not matter. None of this &quot;physical reality&quot; truly matters in the end, because the true us, is Light. Light has no needs. It simply seeks to experience and/or amuse itself. It doesn&#39;t need to eat, sleep, shit, bathe, work, acquire wealth, acquire tangible goods, or acquire intangible goods. Even <strong>reddit karma</strong> is worthless. Light simply Is... as far as we (and by we I mean those who bother with this sort of thing) can tell. Darkness is the absence of Light, and thus apart from it. Duality vs Unity. Good vs Evil. Holy and Unholy. Sacred and Secular.</p>

<p>•12: And the great part about this? <strong>You have the choice to believe or disbelieve whatever you want.</strong> <em>That is your right.</em> Whatever we choose to do or be, sustains us all in the end. We, as in you the reader, and I the writer, are both equally and irrevocably full of bullshit, because of one (not so) simple truth...</p>

<p>Lies tell the Truth, Truth tells Lies. War is Peace, Peace begets War. Love is hate, and hatred is Love. We both exist and do not exist. We are we who aren&#39;t and who aren&#39;t are. We are the living paradox, and the dead certainty. We are one and divided, we are uniquely different, we are that which is both extant and extinct, whole and voided, visible and invisible.</p>

<p>We both exist, and do not exist. We are, and are not. We think and do not think, simultaneously and out of synch.</p>

<p>We are Humans. We are the Blessed Undead. We are, because we will it so.</p>

<p><strong>Take back your Willpower, Humanity.</strong></p>

<p>I will not be cowed by fear of the unknown any further. I will not allow myself to be silenced by silence itself. I will not allow myself to be fearful of speaking of what I hold in my heart of hearts to be true. I will be called crazy, a nutter, a conformist, a nonconformist, I will be given many labels, and <strong>I will not give a company fuck about your moral conundrums</strong> because this is <em>my</em> Truth, <em>my</em> Ethos, and <em>my</em> right to expression.</p>

<p>Your downvotes are like delicious tears, and I will drink them. Your non-participation will be noted. Your upvotes ultimately meaningless beyond visibility, because I will have already done what I feel I must, and put this out there. And I will keep putting this out there, until it gets into your ravaged minds and replaces the splinter that was once there driving you mad -- now driving you to start giving a fuck about yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have many, and will gladly share them. I find it disexcellent to not share the wealth of a freed mind, be it through sobriety or inebriation. I strive to be Excellent to all I meet, and it is tasking. It is not a path to walk down lightly, it is not easy, and the reward is well worth the toil.</p>

<p>Afterthought: For the record I have consumed cannabis with regularity, have often taken deleriants and hypnotics, and with even less regularity have consumed hallucinogens and psychedelics. Being in a nigh-constant state of insomnia also tends to wear at the body-mind, allowing for &quot;unhinging.&quot; I at most ever get about a maximum of 5 hours of sleep in a day, and it takes a <strong>considerable</strong> dose of &quot;medicative chemicals&quot; i.e. Morphine et.al. to bring about an effect upon my person that could be seen as a desirable influence against the energy waveform that is known to us all as <strong>pain.</strong> Whether or not this has any kind of actual influence on my thought processes, is a grenade of another sort, and I ain&#39;t pullin&#39; the pin on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have my upvote for this truth. Though I wouldn&#39;t say it was a 10 minute high. Oh fuck no. The amount of shit I took before getting in that tank, i was not in this plane of reality for about a half hour, actually. That 30 minutes I had during the DMT running through my veins was indeed a lifetime to me. In fact, I felt as if I had experienced the entirety of a Creation&#39;s lifespan in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Aside from that I would agree with most everything that remains, to varying degrees. We are indeed creatures of duality, and this is indeed a test or experiment upon those extremes, but the idea that the extremes conflate is part of the deception. The polarity is real. The extremes of such polarities are not the same, they merely inform each other. There is no point on a thermometer where it becomes &#39;hot.&#39; <em>Hot</em> exists only in contrast, and on a scale, degrees of freedom, as degrees of Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin. </p>

<p>That said, degrees of difference (or freedom) do not equate to a scale of weight, or temperature, but one of subjective relativity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of get what he is saying with the mixing of extremes. And some things do become more similar at their extremes. Look at the political spectrum, in many cases the extreme left and extreme right have more in common with each other than they do with moderates: suspicious of government, homeschooling, self-sufficiency, etc. </p>

<p>Often when there are two extreme answers competing it creates a paradox.  God exist (God is everywhere) vs God doesn&#39;t exist (God is nowhere). Reality is objective vs reality is subjective. With these opposing views, the truth lies at a level above the two. Think of a triangle where each corner of its base is an opposing reality and its apex is the truth that ties them together on a higher level. It&#39;s hard to talk about such abstract things and find examples but if you apply this to situations, you may find that this is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the book there is a Ministry of Truth, which does propaganda,  a ministry of peace, which does war, and a ministry of love, which interrogates and tortures Cia style. A recurring theme is also double speak where they say things just like love is hate, peace is far, freedom is slavery. Highly recommend checking out the book if you haven&#39;t it&#39;s quite prophetic.</p>

<p>If you want to live in a loving, kind, and creative world then act that way. You make the world you live in. You get what you focus on, and what you act upon.</p>

<p>I guess those starving kids just aren&#39;t focusing on food enough, or that guy in a wheelchair just isn&#39;t focusing on walking enough.  </p>

<p>There is a such thing as the objective reality, and some subjective experiences are closer to it than others.  You cannot &quot;manifest&quot; a god damn thing into objective reality just by thinking about it.  Results take real world work, and sometimes no matter how hard you work you will not get the results, because they just aren&#39;t in the cards.  You can only make your reality to a certain extent. There are parts of life that are forced upon us and we are stuck with them whether we like it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to downvote you because I thought you were going to go into a rant about how we&#39;re in the matrix, and how nothing is real and everything could be run on computers, which is what hoaxers in the physics community are trying to push these days. Which of course is hilarious because modern physics is just about everything but actual physics. You will find no discussion of actual physical mechanics in physics anymore, only metaphysical discussion of virtual messenger particles and parallel universes down wormholes and yadda, yadda. But you did not go down that route, so thank you. I enjoyed your post, I agree to an extent, with the premise that we have the freedom to change but we choose not to. We choose to be slaves by believing in our slavery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time I see and hear somebody say around me, that they are helpless, they have no power, they have no influence, and that they ultimately can do nothing your sentiment is expressed. Chosen slavery.</p>

<p>It is by consent we allow these DMs/Reptilians/Archons/Illuminati/TPTB/Shadow Gov&#39;t/THE DARK ONES/Etc. to rule us, to do as they will, to control and manipulate us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion that as long as we continue to let these fools run our lives, our beliefs, our opinions, and everything we think is &quot;unique&quot; to us, the longer we as a species will languish under their oppressive hands.</p>

<p>Forget race. Forget &quot;gender.&quot; Forget creed. Forget politics. Forget belief systems.</p>

<p>All of it in the end is another means of control within the system and as long as we continue to abide by these laws and rules of theirs, and not the laws of nature, that we will feed the dragon.</p>

<p>We constantly demand proof and evidence from others on a constant basis. So why is it we never ask for proof for things everybody is experiencing all at once? Why are we demanding evidence for something that&#39;s right in front of us?</p>

<p>We give Blizzard our money, they jerk us off for a bit and never let us blow, we beg and beg Blizzard to fix this, change that, rebalance the mechanics, they do so in ways that are panderish and ultimately undermine the entire metagame.</p>

<p>I see suicide as the ultimate form of ragequitting.</p>

<p>Kill yourself, go back to the great LFG lobby in the god-knows-where, perhaps the Character Creation screen.</p>

<p>Reroll your shit. Try again. Try a new build.</p>

<p>Yeah, it hurts everybody around you when you go and off yourself, but what about the feelings and rationale of the one doing the suicide? Why do people always seem to ignore that person&#39;s reasons for doing it? Why are people so fucking selfish about suicide?</p>

<p>It&#39;s your existence, your soul, your essence. not theirs. Nobody has the fucking right to demand that you stay here and keep putting up with shit you can&#39;t handle anymore and can find no way to escape from other than ALT+F4ing this shit and starting over in a new existence.</p>

<p>Yeah, it sucks that somebody&#39;s gone and killed themselves, but like I said waaaay up there in my initial post, <em>this is temporary, this is fleeting.</em></p>

<p>Hell. call it New Game+ if you&#39;ve killed yourself/died of other reasons and came back in a new existence and can <em>remember</em> shit from your last life!</p>
