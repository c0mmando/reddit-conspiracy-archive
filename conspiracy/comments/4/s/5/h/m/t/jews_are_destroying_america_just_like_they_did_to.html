       I reiterate: I am not anti-semitic. I don't hate every Jew. I simply hate the corporate jerks who happen to have Jewish descent. They could be of any other race and it's the same for me. If they are jerks, they are jerks.

       You know, until a while ago I believed that about muslims. I now know that ISIS is a CIA-controlled US/Israeli-funded proxy army, and definitely not representative of islam. I think it's the same with jews. There's quite a few holocaust-denying anti-zionist jews out there, who are very vocal about Israels war crimes. Don't demonize them all, that's what an emotional turbopleb would do.

       I'd go about it like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Install puppets in social science faculties in Universities and global thinktanks and push the model of Progressivism/Liberalism to young people (There are more feminists and liberal thinkers in universities than there has ever been previously). Through this medium, you question and attack traditional standards that have been cornerstones of the success of Western Civilization, such as religion and family, specifically gender roles. This has the leads to a new wave of feminism (third wave we are experiencing now) which grows exponentially as well as leading males to be confused and ashamed of their role in the family. This causes less new marriages and high divorce rates as well as lower birth rates, the likes of which can be seen in white populations throughout Western Civilization, but only in white demographics. After letting that stew for several decades, the white populations start to become aged and top-heavy, making a good excuse for mass immigration from other countries that you have eroded and destabilised by interventionism and wars. Thanks to the still traditional values and cultures of the immigrants, their birth rates are still high, much higher than that of the now-broken white families. Let this stew for a couple hundred years and congratulations, you've crushed the white population under the guise of a better future.

       But no one's getting killed there.  How is that genocide?  It's not "genocide" if a "race" slowly disappears across generations, they have to be intentionally killed off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all the members of a race just opt not to reproduce for whatever reason (which isn't happening even in the scenario you're describing; their population would just diminish in this case), it's neither "forcible" nor "genocide"

       My bad, I was using the dictionary definition- the wiktionary definition is in fact broader and appears to be valid. But as for the UN definition, I would assume "destroying a group of people" would entail causing deaths, or at least some kind of
       <em>
        destruction.

       Not entirely sure what you're referring to here, but it's still definitely a choice.  We push the belief that you shouldn't smoke on kids, and smoking rates among young people have gone down, but definitely not vanished, so I think it's pretty clear people can make decisions independent of what schools tell em

       Ok, I concede there, it is a choice. However if this message is getting pushed from all kinds of sources (liberal media, books, education) and the opposing argument of traditional values is supressed and even attacked then what conclusions would people tend to draw from that? When it becomes unfashionable and even "bad" to be a tradionalist because of it's right-winged connotations then people are going to start believing the propaganda and spread it themselves.  That is to say that it is also a self-sufficient system. Echo chambers such as tumblr, feminist groups/media/chatrooms and classrooms with a liberal bias confirm what some people hae already started believing. I mean really, how often do feminists or leftists in general accept reasonable arguments that oppose their beliefs?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to add that if whoever is responsible for this (Jews might be a scapegoat, as they have often been) is playing on the political trends of the youth. Politically-speaking, if the youth were swinging more to right then this propaganda would just be coming from "right wing" sources.

       Um, hello? I'm not the one making any claims, YOU ARE. But here, I'll go ahead and prove you WRONG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are feminists not not being tried in the international criminal courts for perpetuating this "genocide" you speak of? Why are people not screaming and up in arms about this atrocity? Oh, that's right...because it's a figment of your twisted imagination. Let's consult the legal definition of genocide as you are pathetically attempting to apply it:
      </p>
      <p>
       For feminists to be committing genocide would require the existence of a
       <em>
        mental element
       </em>
       , meaning the "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such", through "(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;"
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of the required mental element IS ONLY MADE UP in the minds of extremists like you who need to find some reason to explain why you have no luck with women, rather than simply acknowledging that it's because you are an asshole. So, you spout off ridiculous hyperbole like "feminism is genocide!" to make yourself feel better. The only people who actually believe this garbage are on the fringes, right where you belong.

       Nope. The western world has had its birth rate purposely reduced for the express purpose of committing genocide on whites. Meanwhile Africa's birthrate is skyrocketing due to food aid that we are not allowed to halt.

        Food aid itself

       is responsible for Africa's increasing population? Jesus Christ. What kind of food do you think is being sent over there? How many bags of rice would be needed to sustain the current population growth? 😂 And maybe we don't stop for moral and ethical reasons?

       Oh man. Have you ever heard of something called correlation does not imply causation? If you look at graphs on African countries they appear to all have decreasing birth rates and decreasing mortality rates, and I even looked at food aid given to three random African countries and there is no correlation to what you are saying. Nigeria for example doesn't follow your point at all. (My source on this is the CIA world fact book)  Maybe I just cant find it? Link me to another credible source then. Also, you're aware that donating this food and the immense amount of clothes doesn't really help these countries, right? Maybe that's what you meant by the slaves point you made... it makes them dependent on the aid. But to my understanding most of the aid is limited and families aren't able to get unlimited food. Like I just don't think the aid being given has as much influence as you are giving it. As in there are limits to how much one can take in a day. Prove that families in "Africa" made the decision to have more kids because of food aid. My point is when major world powers flood these markets with all of these free/discounted goods it destroys the markets there and doesn't help them. Like that link said it's normal for rural families to have many children to help around the farm. Now I just referenced that link again, but feel free to google that topic and learn more. But let's get back on topic.

      <p>
       As society as a whole becomes more career focused and as women are viewed more as equals, it's natural for more woman to join the work force and not have as many children. Are you talking about wealth distribution inequality? Well that is a very real problem that makes it more difficult to afford large families as wages stagnate, but I don't think that's what you're talking about here. Are you saying there are
       <strong>
        specific
       </strong>
       policies that have been put in place for the sole purpose of decreasing western civilization's population? Or are you saying there are policies in place that indirectly influence "white" people's population?

       I don't have an opinion. I am stating fact based on statistics. HDI doesn't take into account the hundreds of millions being poisoned by industrial waste, the 60 million slaughtered by the commies, or the millions being killed by the government so that they can harvest their organs. Nor does it account for the universal poverty outside the cities–cities which are built out of fucking sand, garbage, and styrofoam. Gender equality? So the slaughter of girls because they want male children under the one child policy is ignored? Okay. Never mind the ratio of the sexes. And don't get me started on the lies about their real GDP. China remains a third world country.

       The Canadian Supreme Court takes their job description very seriously.  Their job is to interpret the law as it is written, so they had no "opportunity" to do so legally.  This is why the article describes it as pressure being put on
       <em>
        Parliament
       </em>
       to change the law.

       The title was meant to be kind of a clickbait. I'm only against corporate jerks who happen to be of Jewish descent, not all Jews. As I said, it could be any other race and it's the same to me. I don't hate Jews, I actually respect Bernie Sanders and he's a Jew as well.

       First and foremost, I'm not a Holocaust denier. I am certain it did happen and I'm against it 100%. However, I cannot let pass the fact that most of these corporate jerks are indeed of Jewish descent and that there are similarities in what happen in Germany in the 1920's and America today. But I don't hate corporate jerks because they are Jews and I don't hate Jews because of it. I only hate that selected few that are jerks and are willing to sink a country just for profit. They just happen to be Jews. I'm not over-generalizing.

       It's the same as how in Germany Jews made up roughly 1% of the population yet they were the majority in the media, in entertainment and in finance. So they basically think they are better than everyone just for being Jews. They think they can destroy a country because... Why not? Right? Jeez.

       Well, I searched for it in ourworldindata.org and the only thing I can say is that in first world countries(mainly European countries and US/Canada) there is a higher average than in most third world countries, but that's expected I guess. However, I searched Ashkenazis by world map and found out they mostly reside in first world countries so that explains why first world countries have a higher IQ average. But they also live in third world countries like Argentina, and it turns out Argentina is country with an IQ average as high as that of the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that they're smarter than other races. I get it. But that doesn't give them the right to make life a hell for others. I'm not that much of a smart guy so if there's something I'm missing here, please point it out.

       You are saying "them" as if there is some evil connection.  Correlation does not mean causation.  Just because some of the people you have pinpointed happen to be Jewish does not mean Jewishness causes x.

       You really need to develop your critical thinking abilities.  Do you actually think Jews raise the iqs of countries where they reside?  It is like a drop of water in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I have found of any critical interest in stereotyping Jews, is that one genetic line, the Ashzenazi, have an impressive lineage with the highest iq.  That's it.  Nothing else.  Are you often surprised when really smart people are uber successful?  Or just when thy happen to be Jewish?  Check out Hong Kongs average iq.  Highest by location.  Pretty cool to imagine one location full of smart people.

       Well. I did say 'them' as if there was an evil connection but check my replies to the other comments in this post. I do not mean to say that just because they are Jews, that it must cause X. I was surprised by what you said regarding the intelligence and race and I may have used the wrong words to express my opinion in the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I just hate it when corporations exploit and sink a country. Like I said. They just happen to be Jews and it's true that correlation doesn't mean causation. I just expressed myself in the wrong way since I was surprised at the statistics you told me to search. And let me reiterate once again, that I respect Bernie Sanders, and he's a Jew. But I respect him because he's against these corporate jerks.

       The "Jews" you speak of are just fall-people for the NWO. They have to renounce their belief in God to get that high up. The Jesuits hate Jews and Muslems and are happy to use them to further their goals. True Jews and Christians should not stop exposing the lie of idolatry, false prophets and messiahs, and abandoning Gods teachings.

       Not entirely sure what you're referring to here, but it's still definitely a choice.
