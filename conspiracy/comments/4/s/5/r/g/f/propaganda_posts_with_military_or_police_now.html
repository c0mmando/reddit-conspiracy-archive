        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As we can see here, this is just a single example of the myriad of pro-police, pro-military posts that reach the front-page every single week. Their propaganda value is extremely deceptive, for it is not in their content, but solely based on their association with positive things. This may seem counter-intuitive but these posts seem to be extremely effective in invoking positive, deep-seated feelings that feel as if they were self-created.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but it feels like it is occurring more often, and the examples are more blatant. For example, the post I linked has literally no content. It is to show officers in a positive light, which is in stark contrast to what we are currently seeing in real life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yeah, I&#39;m totally aware. Just figured since this was such a glaring example that it was worth mentioning with a post that Reddit is completely gamed. I know it seems obvious, but there are many newcomers who may not already be aware of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been going on for a long time, we just didn&#39;t have cameras to film them until the last 15 years or so. Even when phones had them, they sucked and took forever to turn on. Plus, no cloud or streaming to use, so if a cop wanted to, they could just kill the phone and job done, no evidence. Your word against a cop&#39;s is just another way of saying you have no say.</p>

<p>You still see cops try that same tactic, destroy the phone, but they don&#39;t know technology and forget that killing the phone doesn&#39;t kill the video all the time. I&#39;m sure their department has already instructed them on it and likely they have colluded to figure out the best way to make that problem go away too.</p>

<p>I heard one state just last year was trying to outlaw the filming of police.
Here is the search on that, apparently it&#39;s more than one state. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=state+to+outlaw+filming+police&amp;amp;t=ffsb&amp;amp;ia=web">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=state+to+outlaw+filming+police&amp;amp;t=ffsb&amp;amp;ia=web</a></p>
