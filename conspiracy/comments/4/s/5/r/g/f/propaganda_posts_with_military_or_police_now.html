       As we can see here, this is just a single example of the myriad of pro-police, pro-military posts that reach the front-page every single week. Their propaganda value is extremely deceptive, for it is not in their content, but solely based on their association with positive things. This may seem counter-intuitive but these posts seem to be extremely effective in invoking positive, deep-seated feelings that feel as if they were self-created.
      </p>

       True, but it feels like it is occurring more often, and the examples are more blatant. For example, the post I linked has literally no content. It is to show officers in a positive light, which is in stark contrast to what we are currently seeing in real life.

       My point is that this isn't anything new. There have always been forces pushing government propaganda to the front page. It's just more noticeable when it directly correlates to current events.

       Oh, yeah, I'm totally aware. Just figured since this was such a glaring example that it was worth mentioning with a post that Reddit is completely gamed. I know it seems obvious, but there are many newcomers who may not already be aware of this.

       It's been going on for a long time, we just didn't have cameras to film them until the last 15 years or so. Even when phones had them, they sucked and took forever to turn on. Plus, no cloud or streaming to use, so if a cop wanted to, they could just kill the phone and job done, no evidence. Your word against a cop's is just another way of saying you have no say.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still see cops try that same tactic, destroy the phone, but they don't know technology and forget that killing the phone doesn't kill the video all the time. I'm sure their department has already instructed them on it and likely they have colluded to figure out the best way to make that problem go away too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard one state just last year was trying to outlaw the filming of police.
Here is the search on that, apparently it's more than one state.

       It has become more pervasive. When you say "it's always been that way," you're persuading people to believe that no change is occurring, and this is not helpful.

       Yeah, as if watching a soldier embrace his family for the first time in years is supposed to absolve the fact that he was just fighting in an agression based on complete fabrications and as a result over a million innocents have died. Strange, they always forget to include that part. Just the soldier hugging his family.

       This may be propaganda, but then so are anti-cop stories.  There seems to me to be an increasing hysteria over police violence, which, as far as I know, has not increased by any significant amount.

       Where do you see anti-cop stories reaching the front page other than the in news subreddits? I don't see thinly guised anti-cop propaganda  being artificially supported by reddit into reaching the front page. I do see false opposition in the black lives matter protesters though, which is nothing more race war agitators.
