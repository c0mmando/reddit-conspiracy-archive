<p>How do you rationalize things like GPS or the grand circle route that saves planes significant flight time.. these principles seem to require a spherical globe to be valid. </p>

<p>Furthermore, with this flat earth assumption, you&#39;re claiming that every astronaut and scientist that has been into space is somehow either delusional or purposefully keeping a huge secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth IS NOT sound to the majority of Americans...can you understand the difference? If you can&#39;t...the difference being that the geometry of the earth has NOT been lied about to the people for many hundreds of years and just about everybody, for logical reasons , believe it. However, when it comes to JFK or 9/11, the people most definitely have been lied to through the MSM. Therefor, the people are already believing the lie. It is the norm...already. </p>

<p>Spherical Earth is the truth...flat earth is the lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can explain it to you OP.  Flat Earth Theorists are part of a network of establishment forum spies that came here and posted this stuff as &quot;transfer propaganda&quot; to make this sub and its adherents look unscientific, illogical and batty.</p>

<p>You see, if you want to discredit 9/11, then you go onto 9/11 truth forums and start posting about how alien spacelasers took down the towers, but they couldn&#39;t be seen</p>

<p>Or the &quot;noxious fairie&quot; theory.  Ever heard of the noxious faririe theory?  It&#39;s a theory out of Ireland that dark fairies have subverted the Order of the Fey and then caused 9/11 with magic beams.  The missing rubble is because they teleported he WTC mass to a cave in scotland where they will use it to make fairie technology.  It&#39;s an unpopular theory because I just made it up.</p>

<p>However if you replace fairies with freemasons then you&#39;d be about 10k times closer to the actual truth of 9/11.</p>

<p>If you call out one of these forum plants, he may or may not offer some token resistance, and he may even mire you in a futile &quot;discussion&quot; aimed at diverting your attention and energy from anything important while also driving you crazy. Then another plant will be along shortly to assassinate your character for seemingly no reason. </p>

<p>It works. Take the latest video &quot;evidence&quot; of certain high profile violent crimes.  People don&#39;t even want to look at it halfway critically for fear of being lumped in with flat earthers and neonazis. They just accept it as authentic a priori, and this becomes the evidence on which they form their opinions and beliefs. Worse, they insist that everyone else do the same, and they condemn anyone who rejects this evidence or even discusses its merits. We&#39;ve all experienced this treatment. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also experienced not wanting to look for fear of becoming one of those truthers. Changed my mind about that only a few weeks ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, the Flat Earth model does not work (Southern star trails, required size of Southern &#39;hemisphere&#39;, etc).  However Flat Earth theory does point out problems with the official cosmology (you can see too far over water, way too far).  This is why the Flat Earth operation has had some success.  People make the logic fail of seeing problems with one model as proof for the other.  Both models do not work and the trick is framing it as a choice between the two of them.  </p>

<p>GPS - <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29758872">http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29758872</a>  In WW2 they had a system that had these capabilities, before satellites were claimed to be launched(<a href="http://support.radioshack.com/support_tutorials/gps/gps_tmline.htm">http://support.radioshack.com/support_tutorials/gps/gps_tmline.htm</a>).  In this article they suggest it as a backup should GPS system go down.  So satellites appear to not be required in order to provide GPS service, it could all be ground based.  Have you ever seen an image of a satellite in space?  All the ones I see look like CGI.</p>

<p>Did you know that this number is somewhere in the neighborhood of 300?  NASA is part of the US military which makes extensive use of compartmentalization, many people just staring at screens.  Contrast this with the Manhattan project which managed secrecy for years with hundreds of thousands of people involved.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can.  For a sphere of circumference ~25,000 miles a decent approximation for the drop below a parallel at the observer is 8 inches * (distance in miles)<sup>2.</sup>  Assuming light travels in straight lines through the atmosphere, we should not be able to see all that far.  Here is an example:  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/3e9nly/photo_i_took_today_of_the_toronto_skyline_from/ctcvjzc">https://np.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/3e9nly/photo_i_took_today_of_the_toronto_skyline_from/ctcvjzc</a></p>

<p>It gets interesting when you remove the assumption about light traveling straight through the atmosphere.  Our brain assumes straight light when we interpret photons at our eyes, we don&#39;t get information about their path to reach us.  But if you perform an experiment to determine how light bends as it travels, then reinterpret the image you see in that context, you get led in a different direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surveyors have been making adjustments for this so that their methods work.</p>

<p>An experiment to demonstrate how light bends as it travels through the atmosphere using surveying devices called theodolites is described here:  <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/#Theodolites">http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/#Theodolites</a></p>

<p>On the subject of accounting for the discrepancy due to the earth&#39;s concavity</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Mr. Martin, this is a well-known phenomenon within the surveying community as surveyors always measure from the center if possible. The manufacturers also know about this as modern and expensive dumpy levels have built-in switches to compensate for this “error” in order to keep all readings the same as if light traveled in a straight line. </p>

<p>Funny how the horizon has gotten lower, exactly as expected if the Earth is convex.</p>

<p>And guess what?  Refraction was first mathematically calculated by Newton.  We already understand how light bends in the atmosphere and it has no bearing whatsoever on the shape of the Earth.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some actual information about how Surveyors deal with refraction and the Earth&#39;s curvature:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ask some good questions which had me curious too. Satellites in particular had me skeptical of flat earth, but I&#39;ve since concluded that GPS uses ground based antennas. GPS is military technology, so they can hide whatever they want in the software to pretend it&#39;s triangulating from satellites when it&#39;s really just using radio/cell towers. Planes use radar, and ships use another ground based navigational system - <a href="https://youtu.be/PDtHulWGMGg">https://youtu.be/PDtHulWGMGg</a>. Even airplane wifi, which I thought used satellites, explains on its own website how it&#39;s ground based system works.  Think about any satellite technology and replace the satellite with ground radio transmissions. Makes a lot more sense. Satellites wouldn&#39;t be powerful enough, and they&#39;d be subject to all sorts of weather disruption and technical issues. The infrastructure for terrestrial antennas has been around longer than satellite tech. And let&#39;s not forget satellites were invented by sci-fi writer Arthur C Clark.</p>

<p>Plane travel times mostly don&#39;t make sense in the southern hemisphere. Who knows how air travel works, but it&#39;s definitely not what we&#39;re led to believe. </p>

<p>Yes, astronauts are liars and frauds. Most or all are freemasons. ISS crew tape their interviews in front of a green screen or from an airplane performing zero-G maneuvers.</p>

<p>Scientists, NASA employees, etc are compartmentalized. Don&#39;t look at it like the entire science profession or everyone at NASA is lying. Everyone is doing their jobs, there&#39;s a chain of command, and only the people at the very top truly know what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Water always lays flat, or finds level, how is it curving all over the world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the earth is almost spherical and the direction of gravity is towards the center of that sphere. Water on opposite sides of the planet is being pulled in opposite directions towards that centre.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are Airplanes maintaining altitude so easily over a curving away from them ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because gravity is pulling them towards the centre of the earth. The plane has to generate a force that opposes gravity in order to stay in the air. If it was to travel in a truly straight line, it would gain altitude into thinner air, reducing lift and causing it to fall back to the same altitude where the wings were providing enough lift to counterbalance the gravitational pull. But it can&#39;t travel in that straight line because its wings are not providing enough lift to cause it to rise in the first place. Think of it as a speck of dust stuck to the surface of a soap bubble. It is held up by the &quot;surface tension&quot;, but does not have enough energy to rise above the surface, so it follows the curve of that surface.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is the earth not rotating beneath them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is. Flying the same distance in the opposite direction to the rotation of the earth takes less time than flying the same distance in the same direction as the rotation of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are things seen in the distance beyond which they should be hidden behind curvature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not. There are some optical effects that allow light to bend in our atmosphere to show things just beyond the horizon, but beyond that you can&#39;t see. For example, there is no telescope that can see Hawaii from California.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why can know one show curvature?</p>

<p>They can. It&#39;s been done dozens of times on this sub alone. You fools just refuse to believe it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Einstein admit there is no way to measure the earth&#39;s motion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t. At least not the way you are claiming. It is not possible to measure the Earth&#39;s (or any other body&#39;s) absolute motion because there is nothing static to measure it against. Everything is moving, so we can only measure relative motion. We <em>can</em> measure relative motion, and have done so for centuries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that just means I have good critical thinking skills, I stay skeptical, and only buy into real/believable conspiracies...</p>

<p>Water lays &quot;flat&quot; because you can&#39;t percieve the potential for it to be round, because you would be talking about roughly 1 degree of curvature over a horizon&#39;s worth of miles...just because you can&#39;t percieve it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not &quot;curved&quot;. It&#39;s like if you keep increasing the number of sides of a polygon from hexagon,octagon,etc... eventually you will get so many sides that it will appear to be a perfect circle, simply because you cannot percieve the sides without special tools.</p>

<p>I truly hope you&#39;re not serious about the &quot;how do airplanes maintain altitude&quot;--if you can&#39;t understand how lift is created with fluid (air) pressure, completely independent of the shape of the fluid contained therein...and how the sheer size of the earth makes the change in slope imperceptible to something thats not going near the speed of the earth&#39;s rotation. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t measure the motion of the earth? Really? Every civilization since the myans have been doing it, even primative cultures could plot stars and determine the precessional wobble of.the earth around an axis</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, some day the layers of changing air pressure correct the plane automatically,  some say, no, the gravity of Earth pulls it down constantly, others day, no, the auto pilot corrects it downward automatically, still others say the pilot does it himself. The slope is not inconsequential to a plane traveling 550mph. It would quickly fly off into higher and higher altitudes were there not some counteracting force.   The truth is they don&#39;t, there is no counteracting force, they get to 35kft and chill and keep at that altitude because the earth is flat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>GPS could be achieved on a flat earth by using the LORAN system.  There&#39;s no need for satellites when there are long range cell towers covering most of the world.  Most flat earthers regard satellites as a hoax.  Information travels by land towers, undersea cables, and signals can also be bounced off the ionosphere.</p>

<p>I looked up &quot;grand circle route&quot; but I didn&#39;t get a clear definition of what that means.  I&#39;m guessing it refers to the curved flight paths a plane will take?  This is actually pretty simple because the flat earth is a circle.  A straight line on the equidistant flat earth map generally appears curved on the Mercator projection. <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/10660219_1460811497564704_9188768804143407669_n.jpg">This image displays the paths on the Mercator vs the equidistant</a>. </p>

<p>And I mean, as far as astronauts that just doesn&#39;t hold water with me.

It is not as if we can replicate that radiation, and lack of gravity -- those things have very identifiable consequences that we can&#39;t replicate (we try to replicate it with mouse models, and nothing works reliably besides actually taking them to space)... so I mean I&#39;ve seen these effects firsthand, and even if they&#39;re lying, their bones and bone marrow can&#39;t really lie..</p>

<p>Not at all.  It&#39;d be like light bouncing off a flat mirror.  Though most flat earth models hold that the sky is a dome.</p>

<p>Do you process tissue samples and data?  Or are you actually working with the astronauts in person?  That&#39;s very interesting.  At the same time, radiation and other unique conditions could exist on flat earth at very high altitudes.  The sun may be small in flat earth models but it&#39;s still putting out radiation.  It could be that they&#39;re in high altitude and experiencing unique effects of that. Doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re orbiting a ball.  Additionally, they could have ways to artificially induce and replicate those effects.  The government definitely has technology kept away from the public.</p>

<p>Water lays &quot;flat&quot; because you can&#39;t percieve the potential for it to be round, because you would be talking about roughly 1 degree of curvature over a horizon&#39;s worth of miles...just because you can&#39;t percieve it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not &quot;curved&quot;. It&#39;s like if you keep increasing the number of sides of a polygon from hexagon,octagon,etc... eventually you will get so many sides that it will appear to be a perfect circle, simply because you cannot percieve the sides without special tools.</p>

<p>I truly hope you&#39;re not serious about the &quot;how do airplanes maintain altitude&quot;--if you can&#39;t understand how lift is created with fluid (air) pressure, completely independent of the shape of the fluid contained therein...and how the sheer size of the earth makes the change in slope imperceptible to something thats not going near the speed of the earth&#39;s rotation. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t measure the motion of the earth? Really? Every civilization since the myans have been doing it, even primative cultures could plot stars and determine the precessional wobble of.the earth around an axis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s too big a conspiracy, too many people would have to be in on it!&quot;  This tells me you&#39;re not a conspiracy theorist despite your claims. </p>

<p>Water always lays flat, or finds level, how is it curving all over the world?  How are Airplanes maintaining altitude so easily over a curving away from them ground?  How is the earth not rotating beneath them?  How are things seen in the distance beyond which they should be hidden behind curvature?  Why can know one show curvature?  Why did Einstein admit there is no way to measure the earth&#39;s motion?</p>

<p>Funny how the horizon has gotten lower, exactly as expected if the Earth is convex.</p>

<p>And guess what?  Refraction was first mathematically calculated by Newton.  We already understand how light bends in the atmosphere and it has no bearing whatsoever on the shape of the Earth.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some actual information about how Surveyors deal with refraction and the Earth&#39;s curvature:</p>

<p>Your Dunning-Kruger is showing.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want to get dragged into with me because you know what I&#39;m about -- destroying people&#39;s stupid bullshit.</p>

<p>This has <a href="/r/flatearth/comments/4pb0b5/flat_earther_airplane_faq/">already been explained</a> specifically to you, at least two other times; are you off your meds?</p>

<p>How is the earth not rotating beneath them? </p>

<p>The only person who claims this is you.</p>

<p>Search &quot;Cape Air Flight 1791&quot; and &quot;Cape Air Flight 1750&quot;... Two flights, one from Billings, MT to Glendive, MT, and the other from Glendive to Billings ; East-West flights done in the EXACT SAME MODEL aircraft, with an 18 minute difference in flight time. <strong>GUESS WHY!!!</strong> Once again, this has already been shown to you numerous times.</p>

<p><a href="http://stupidconspiracies.org/misc/toronto.gif">One more time</a> just for you... Again! Either the entire town is sinking, or the earth is curved... (hint: its not sinking)</p>

<p>1) he didn&#39;t say anything in his lifetime that you will ever understand, nor did he ever say anything that will explain any notion of Flat Earth.</p>

<p>2) don&#39;t pretend to understand Einstein, you don&#39;t even understand water FFS.</p>
