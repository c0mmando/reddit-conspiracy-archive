        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>UPDATE:
Looks like the mods muted the post in question on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and in the results on /all .  Hurray</p>

<hr/>

<p>Being one of maybe 4 people here who occasionally post occult related stuff because I think it&#39;s applicable as counterintelligence, I find it unreasonable that the following post </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4s6yks/4chan_just_discovered_a_secret_message_on_the/">&quot;4chan just discovered a secret message on the Clinton Investagation FBI document.&quot;</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>would be so highly upvoted, based on performance of similar <strong>incredibly subversive occult posts</strong> such as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4pqyoe/lucky_number_7/">&quot;Lucky Number Seven&quot;</a> which is now [deleted] that said basically this.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last crash in 2008 was for 777 point on Sept 29, 2008.  From Sept 29 to Jun 24, 2016, it&#39;s been 7 years, 7 months, 7 weeks, and 7 days.  (some have said a leap year so not 7 days but that&#39;s still 777 and 7 or 8 depending on timezone)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do <em>not</em> think the occult is applicable, then maybe you&#39;ve not been paying attention. </p>

<p>The occult is the language of spies.  Spycraft, the occult and psy-craft (psy-ops) go back a very long way...to the Rosicrucians and John Dee.  That is history, not fantasy.  King Arthur&#39;s Merlin was also similarly a spy and magician, because he was based on the Dee figure of the Victorian era.</p>

<p>I study this stuff only to understand the hidden agendas and for counterintelligence.  I post occult stuff for the minority who enjoy it not just as food for thought, but as a way to communicate how <em>they</em> communicate.  How <em>they</em> leave <em>calling cards</em> at false flag events and psyops.  How <em>they</em> mock us openly, for example this very 4chan post, which I believe to be an attack on us, on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, on conspiracy theorists and conspiracy theory generally.  It&#39;s more <em>&#39;transfer propaganda&#39;.</em> More <em>taint</em>.</p>

<p>This 4chan gematria nonsense shitpost was placed here and artificially upvoted to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look dumb.  As a way to discredit this sub.  </p>

<p>You may be asking yourself: why if I am one of your 4 occult guys am I thinking an occult post is a shitpost...am I butthurt or a sore loser from not getting the karms?  </p>

<p>Because the Gematrix.org is clearly a game. It&#39;s a crowdsourced game.  A person can &#39;add terms&#39; to it.  That&#39;s all it is.  They&#39;ve build this esoteric jew database game that&#39;s all cute but at the end of the day, I know for a fact from following her whole career and reading her book, that Sarah Silverman has been fucking around with the gematrix.  Here is why.  When you search &quot;Sarah Silverman&quot; you get</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Gematria is Stupid Nonsense&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The Chocolate Orgies are All His Fault&quot;</li>
<li>Sand Witch</li>
<li>Sandwitch</li>
<li>Yummy One</li>
<li>The New Barack</li>
<li>The Eye Of My Apple</li>
<li>Aleph Aleph Aleph Got Daphne Rosen Pregnant</li>
</ul>

<p>Search daphne rosen and you find she&#39;s a porn star.  Yes, God really cares about trivial porn star information, plays on words, is profane, somehow fixed on anal sex and self-doubting.  Does that sound like God, or like Sarah Silverman?  (perhaps at the end of time we find out they are one and the same)</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you want to know how this sub treats occult conspiracies, here are some fine examples for comparison to 4chans, from yours truly, with their current (fuzzed) corresponding karma, again which I don&#39;t care about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the post is still up there. For the record, I agree it is bullshit and made a comment to that effect yesterday, but this post didn&#39;t break the rules of the sub, and anyway, it is important for people to make up their own minds. If we take down a post like that, it looks even more sketchy than leaving it up.</p>

<p>I am disappointed so many people upvoted the post without thinking how easy it is to create a gematria phrase (for any number) that appears to convey a real or pertinent message.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because coercion is a reasonable explanation for Comey&#39;s statement, too many users just assumed the post was saying something valid.</p>

<p>I suspect a large number of votes also came from conspiratard and topminds trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a normal substitution of A=1  B=2  then 88 is HH or &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. That&#39;s why 88 is used frequently in neonazi tattoos.  I didn&#39;t understand this until recently when someone on CST explained it to me.</p>

<p>The <strong>33</strong>=&gt;<strong>88</strong> connection is my assertion--which is not a unique one--that the Freemasons created the KKK.  Some, like myself, allege that Albert Pike <strong>33</strong>rd freemason was the creator of the KKK movement as an early racial <em>strategy of tension</em>, similar to what we are seeing now with BLM--the racebaiting is a form of social control.  Pike was the leader of the southern region of the scottish rite of freemasonry in his time.  He wrote the letter to mazzini which described the world wars perfectly, over 25-100 years prior, yet it&#39;s considered &#39;a hoax document&#39; because freemason&#39;s power and influence is so strong they&#39;ve effectively rewritten history.  This, along with elders of zion (another &#39;hoax&#39; come true), p2, and several other instances of treachery establish a pattern of lying and false flaggotry by the freemasons in my mind.  It&#39;s historical.</p>

<p>The KKK org structure is directly based on masonry.  They have wizards and such.  Freemasonry has tried to distance themselves from KKK in the past, although the roots are with masonry.  KKK is luciferian  They use alchemical symbols to communicate in the higher eschelon. I&#39;ve witnessed this first hand by going to the bathroom of some podunk bait shop in arkansas.  I felt myself in the grip of terror because I&#39;m an empath of sorts; all around me were not typical graffiti but alchemy symbols and a map to a nearby area, where I believed they would meet.  This was a kkk place since it had 88s and swastikas and such.  At the time, I only knew enough to identify it, but not to &#39;read the walls&#39;.  I can now.  These things have been verified and at some point I may take a special trip to photograph these things, if only I could remember where it was (over 13 yrs ago). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean arkansas or alabama?  These places are very nice, geographically and ecologically. It&#39;s the redneckers and bigotfaced &#39;you aint from round here&#39; people who muck it up.  The ozarks are nice also (north arkansas).  It&#39;s all very wooded and natural, and damp, so these states are prime for hunting, fishing and wildlife.  Which is why they do that stuff there.</p>

<p>But the problem with hunting, fishing and stuff is that it goes back to neoprimitivism and tribalism and paganism.  Which means a tendency for there also to be pagan enclaves and weird backwoods voodoo horseshit happening.</p>

<p>A lot of these freemason hunter folks are into the animal sacrifice.  Some even eat the animal&#39;s raw organs as tradition, &#39;to get the animal&#39;s spirit.  So I&#39;ve heard.  That&#39;s all hunters, not just freemasons, but it&#39;s telling of the kind of mentality of nature domination and the desire to fucking want to kill something for the kill itself and the &#39;power&#39; rather than the fckin&#39; just the food of it.  I mean if you wanted just food you ought simply use laser cannon and just sear its head clean off at a distance and collect your meat into a yeti cooler.  Or better yet, raise deer in your backyard and then just go get it.  But no, that wouldn&#39;t be sportsmanlike.</p>
