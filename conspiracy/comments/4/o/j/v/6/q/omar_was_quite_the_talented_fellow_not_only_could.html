        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The NY Times now reports that, in addition to texting and making phone calls during the attack, Omar was also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/orlando-shooting.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">posting to Facebook under multiple accounts</a> -- which means logging in with user name and password to each account.  As if that&#39;s not sufficiently unbelievable, he was also, they say, searching the web (during the attack!) to see if the media was reporting it yet.</p>

<p>So, picture this:  He kills a few people, then takes a break, slides into a booth and is peering into his phone to text, do Google searches, and post to Facebook.  It takes one hand to hold a phone and another to type.  What did he do with his guns at that time?  What were the hundreds of young men in the club doing and thinking while Omar was busy on his phone?  Why didn&#39;t someone either bean him from behind with a Dewars bottle or grab his guns? And why didn&#39;t everybody simply head out the door?  </p>

<p>No, instead they just stood around waiting for him to be done, at which point he picked up his gun and killed a few dozen people.  </p>

<p>But were there really 320 people in there?  While the Wendy&#39;s across the street has 26 parking spaces (and pretty sure they don&#39;t get 320 people in a Wendy&#39;s) there are only nine parking spaces at the Pulse. </p>

<p>Plus, the Pulse is about the same size as the Wendy&#39;s.  They got 320 in there only if they were all anorexic and holding their breath.</p>

<p>This whole story makes no sense at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does it suddenly jump to 320 people? How many people were actually in the club after the initial shooting took place and when he retreated into a bathroom with hostages? How many hostages were in the bathroom itself? Were they able to see the shooter or were they hiding in stalls and other areas where he wasn&#39;t in their FOV?</p>

<p>Please think more critically here.</p>

<p>Also, a program like Last Pass or anything else equally mundane (there are thousands of them on Google Store and App Store) can swap between accounts at the push of a button.</p>

<p>The guy had 3 hours to do what he wanted to in a night club full of dead bodies and screaming, dying men and women.</p>

<p>I kind of get a chuckle out of everyone who armchair quarterbacks the actions of a mass hysteria situation, I could make up a dozen situations where people attempt a tackle and stop for various reasons, and another dozen situations for why people wouldn&#39;t attempt a tackle in the first place.</p>

<p>I have experience  in actual shootings, as in I&#39;ve been in firefights and I&#39;ve been shot at while unarmed 3 times while within the states. It is a very paralyzing fear and the last thing that pops into your head is &quot;hey I should bum rush these guys, it&#39;s my only chance.&quot;</p>

<p>Coroner&#39;s report, from everything I&#39;ve read, stated there were no signs of trampling on the dead bodies found. Which means that everyone went into flight mode but didn&#39;t have an exit strategy - because NORMAL PEOPLE don&#39;t check all exit points and have a plan of attack the second they walk into a night club looking to have a good time.</p>

<p>How do I know this? I&#39;m a Combat Veteran with PTSD, we routinely discuss things like how we will position ourselves in a crowd with our backs to one, or preferably two walls, scope out all routes of exit in our heads and essentially create a plan for a worst case scenario in a few seconds then remain hyper vigilant for the rest of the time in public.</p>

<p>Normal people do not do that. Normal people do not expect to walk into a night club and then suddenly have someone shooting into a crowd watching people&#39;s heads get split open, women and friends screaming and begging for their lives, chunks being shot off bodies, people laying lifeless in a pool of blood, etc.</p>

<p>There was a Soldier with two Combat Tours under his belt that died, how did he die? No eye witness accounts yet on Captain Brown.</p>

<p>There was a Marine there who chose to find an exit, and even he states that approximately 50 people were frozen in fear at the exit when he screamed at them to open the door repeatedly before jumping through the crowd and opening it himself.</p>

<p>People react strangely to fear situations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting really fucking tired of these crack pot theories where just because people didn&#39;t fight back it&#39;s suddenly a complete fabrication.</p>

<p>You intentionally skew the number to make it seem more inflated than it is, 320 people. How many people immediately fled the club the second shots were being fired? How many were within line of sight of the killer when he was doing it, and how many were just hearing the screams of people with the sounds of gunfire and deciding to retreat?</p>

<p>Even I wouldn&#39;t run towards the sounds of gun fire without a weapon, that&#39;s not intelligent thinking, that&#39;s not how soldiers are trained to react, that&#39;s not how I&#39;ve been trained to react after a lot of combat experience.</p>

<p>Please, people, stop arm chair quarterbacking the situation like this. Most of you are painfully, obviously not qualified to comment on situations where civilians are being shot at - and those of us who are (I&#39;ve been in firefights with both enemy combatants and civilians in the area, want to guess who cowers in fear and who fights back?) aren&#39;t commenting on it because for the most part it adds up.</p>

<p>It fucking sucks, and for all I know people did try to rush him at first and were gunned down - which would have put a complete halt to any moral boosting thought towards other individuals to continue a dog tackle (one eye witness account said he shot someone from arms length away.)</p>

<p>Tl;dr The guy had 3 hours with an unknown amount of ammunition and an unknown amount of people in a hostage situation, the majority of the time was spent holed up in a restroom where some people were cowering in bathroom stalls - this is reinforced by text messages from one of the victims with his mother before he was killed - approximately 40 minutes into the start of the shooting he was in the bathroom after two officers attempted to engage him and failed.</p>

<p>Just because there are more of you than him doesn&#39;t suddenly mean your instinct is going to be to run towards someone who is indiscriminately killing people in front of you, having been in firefights and having been shot at - the overwhelming urge is to run and hide.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t ever been shot at, if you haven&#39;t ever been in a firefight, if you&#39;ve literally zero real life experience in the psychology behind fight and flight response outside of learning about it over a day or two in a college class for your General Education - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop armchair quarterbacking the situation.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m annotating, that due to the amount of backlash I got from this post - that I was very angry when I made the post. It&#39;s incredibly annoying as someone who has personal experience to draw from when I see posts like the OPs, and if this were the first time I&#39;d likely have responded a lot less harshly - but it&#39;s not the first time, in fact a bulk of the Orlando posts are based around this topic.</p>

<p>I was in no way trying to insinuate that people are cowards, or that only military personnel are capable of heroic acts, or that having PTSD somehow makes me qualified to speak on the issue, or any of the other ridiculous conclusions people came to in their responses to me.</p>

<p>I was responding to a post that is largely based on personal opinion from drawing a narrative that was immediately - in my mind - flawed, with my own personal experience and opinion. Having been a Medic for the past 10 years, having been shot at when I wasn&#39;t armed, having been in firefights - I DO have a unique personal perspective to draw from when formulating my opinions based on why people do not fight back when confronted with an armed gunman, and as I&#39;ve already stated, for every variable and scenario you can come up with that creates a conspiracy theory, I can come up with one that equally debunks it.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that there isn&#39;t enough evidence of what went on inside to say for sure one way or the other, I&#39;ll refrain from making this post longer than it already is by pointing out and reiterating why the timeline based on what evidence we do have, eye witness testimony, and other events that took place during the shooting add up to Marteen being a lone gunman and having plenty of time to post on Facebook and make phone calls and do whatever else he wished to do.</p>

<p>I DO think that police added to the total number of dead bodies in this incident. I DO NOT think that there were other shooters involved in this directly by their own free will. I DO see why people go into a fear state and flee/hide when they see people dying around them instead of charging at gunfire. I DO NOT know if anyone tried to stop Marteen and was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I find this sub entertaining, but it has one major flaw:</p>

<p><strong>Every</strong> time something bad happens, people on this sub insist that it was a false flag attack. I have yet to see one terrorist attack, incident, etc. where people come here to say, &quot;Oh no, that ____ bombing was legit; just a crazy religious fundamentalist with a small cock and a backpack bomb&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to see some critical thinking here. People should learn from your example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please explain how he got into the club in the first place? Did he walk in with guns concealed? Did he shoot his way in? How did he conceal the guns if it is June in Orlando, FL? Some patrons were in tanktops or shirtless. I still haven&#39;t found a play-by-play on how he got into the nightclub. CCTV from street cameras or above the entrance to the club itself would help a lot. The media keeps going off on other angles except for the details of how the shooting even started. And, I find it questionable about there only being 1 gunman. I would be amazed if in reality, it was just Omar Mateen as the sole shooter. Amazed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a Facebook link, but it serves it&#39;s purpose - note that if these magazines were loaded he&#39;d need a pretty strong belt, but it proves the point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about The Vibe&#39;s security measures. I don&#39;t know how the bouncers/doormen conducted themselves. I don&#39;t know what Mateen did as he entered the club.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simply to illustrate that it&#39;s a lot easier to conceal these weapons than people think, and again I&#39;m wondering just what a bouncer would do if he did in fact find a long gun, glock, suicide vest (still undetermined, but a lot of sources say he was wearing one - or at least a fake one to make people believe it was one), and magazines on a frisk.</p>

<p>You&#39;re drawing a line straight from A-to-Z without considering <em>ANY</em> of the countless red flags attached to this incident. Take your own advice and apply some critical thinking to the entire scope of this shooting rather than rant about one little piece you passionately disagree with. That fact that you&#39;re &quot;really fucking tired&quot; already proves that you have a pre-existing opinion, thus swaying your &quot;critical thinking&quot;. If you really were a critical thinker then you would understand how asinine it is to be so certain about all the things you just posted. To be so certain that nobody else would step up to save lives simply because &quot;even you wouldn&#39;t run towards a shooter&quot; is hilariously naive and is a massive disservice to our countless soldiers (and even civilians) who have given their lives to protect others. As a veteran you should know better and show more respect. </p>

<p>Please try to remain objective here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not defending the OP but....This is the most hypocritical and ignorant post I have seen on this subreddit and that&#39;s really saying something. Everyone in my unit would be truly appalled at how out of touch you are. I can&#39;t think of a single person I met when I was stationed overseas that would hesitate to risk their life to protect others or save their own. You think that&#39;s a trait that&#39;s only present in people who have been in combat? Nobody in my unit would hesitate to give their life to protect others, <strong>nobody</strong>. They didn&#39;t learn that in basic training, they didn&#39;t have to be shot at, that&#39;s just the kind of people they are. It&#39;s human nature to fiercely protect what matters to you. Hell I have a buddy who nearly became a paraplegic wrecking his motorcycle trying to impress some girl that wasn&#39;t even interested in him. Yet you, with all your wisdom and critical thinking, are so confidant that only us soldiers are even remotely capable of such things. Well not you of course because you&#39;ll be running the other way apparently. </p>

<p>There very fact that you so passionately disagree with this but troll a conspiracy sub shows that you just come here to mouth off your pre-existing opinion and are unwilling to look at any of the questions raised by this shooting and do some actual critical thinking.</p>

<p>Unbelievable. </p>

<p>TL;DR
You have to be a special kind of scum to go parading your supposed PTSD around the internet to drum up support for your own crack-pot, unwavering, groundless opinions. I&#39;ve never known a single PTSD sufferer to use their awful struggle as a talking point in a dick-measuring contest to prove how much they know. Absolutely disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not touting my PTSD as &quot;how much I know&quot; I was using it to prove the point that MOST people do not immediately look for all points of exit and remain hyper aware of their surroundings. </p>

<p>A Marine saved at least 50 lives in the shooting. </p>

<p>Captain Brown may have died trying to stop him or may have been shot dead before he knew what was going on. </p>

<p>You should know damn well that being in a theater of combat changes how a person thinks and behaves, and that there is a huge difference between being in a night club where we have zero evidence as to what went on and how many people were actually in the club within distance of the shooter. </p>

<p>My entire point should have been pretty clear, had he targeted a bar frequented by military personnel this might have played out differently.</p>

<p>He targeted a gay night club where video prior to the shooting shows a rave style environment with bartenders running around half naked and people drunk and high dancing around. </p>

<p>I do not know why it&#39;s so hard for people to understand the concept of mass fear mentality and how it changes the actions of other people. </p>

<p>Literally every mass shooting we have footage of shows this type of behavior. People either panic and trample each other or hide and get killed if they&#39;re found. </p>

<p>The only &quot;mass shootings&quot; I know of where a gun man was stopped involve people identifying and neutralizing the threat before the shooting could start. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think soldiers are the only ones capable of out of the ordinary behavior and I never said anything even remotely of the sort. Don&#39;t question my integrity based on bullshit interpretation just because you didn&#39;t like how I chose to phrase my response. </p>

<p>I do think that training plays a huge role in how someone responds to a situation, and as far as I know only two people who were in that shooting had any. Not including the killer. One died. One saved 50 some odd people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m at a computer now, so I&#39;m responding to every message on this thread again.</p>

<p>Firstly, I was angry when I made this original response - because I&#39;ve seen countless people making the same determination with what I believe is very junk critical thinking towards the situation - so if I came off as abrasive or arrogant, well there you have it, I was mad.</p>

<p>Secondly, I wasn&#39;t trying to attribute my PTSD, or insinuate that soldiers/military personnel are the only people in the world capable of doing extraordinary things in uncommon situations - I was drawing from my own personal experience in most aspects of my response to show people why I personally believe the narrative that &quot;someone didn&#39;t fight back so it must not be real, or was a false flag&quot; is ignorant.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a dick-measuring contest, nor was my commentary on having been in firefights and being shot at while unarmed stateside - it was to illustrate that from my own personal experiences I have come to the conclusion that fear plays a huge role in why people choose flight over fight.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not &quot;trolling&quot; a conspiracy sub. I&#39;ve been an active member of these forums for years now, I just rarely post - this is personal for me because, as I&#39;ve stated before, I knew Captain Brown.</p>

<p>So go re-read what I posted, look at the actual talking points that make sense versus the opinion I threw in, and re-assess my commentary.</p>

<p>There are plenty of mass shooting events with footage where people chose not to fight back, in fact the majority are that way. People either panic and trample each other or go for hiding and are killed as they&#39;re discovered.</p>

<p>The majority of mass shooting events that are prevented due to action never became mass shooting events because the killer was identified before they could start shooting and neutralized.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have no idea what happened inside that club, none of us do - but I know that there weren&#39;t 320 people in there to be fighting off a gunman as the original post claims. Plenty of people fled immediately at the sound of gunfire, a Marine&#39;s testimony states 50 people were frozen in fear next to a door - to the point of ignoring him asking them to open it so they could get out several times before he did it himself. I have no idea how far into the timeline this took place.</p>

<p>What we do know, from text messages between a son and his mother, is that the shooter spent around 40 minutes in the main area of the club before going into the bathrooms, and that two officers, one an off duty cop and another a SWAT Officer if I remember correctly attempted to engage the killer but were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>This left him with a good 2 hours and 20 minutes to do as he saw fit in the restrooms he locked himself off in, assuming that the narrative of the text message coincides with the timeline of when the two officers were unsuccessful in engaging him.</p>

<p>There&#39;s eye witness testimony that Marteen was giving orders to people in the night club, too - so there&#39;s a chance he told people to lie on the floor. He took everyone&#39;s cell phones, asked if there were any blacks in the crowd and said &#39;I have no problem with blacks&#39;. Along with some other odd behavior.</p>

<p>Could very well be that he gained control of the situation through compliance letting people believe it was a hostage situation and then started killing. I don&#39;t know, there isn&#39;t enough evidence to say one way or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made note of this before in other responses to the &quot;why didn&#39;t people fight back, it doesn&#39;t add up&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>If people sift through my personal opinion and just look at the critical analysis/talking points that are responding directly to the original post I think there are some decent points brought up.</p>

<p>There weren&#39;t 320 people in the night club to fight the guy off, I have no idea how many fled, but we can assume it was a good amount.</p>

<p>There are tons of mass shootings where the idea of being stuck in a fear state sticks, Columbine is a good example, as was the Paris attack - people run, people hide, if they&#39;re found they&#39;re killed.</p>

<p>The Coroner has stated that none of the dead bodies showed signs of trampling, which means they just laid down - for whatever reason. Some eye witness testimony says that Marteen gave orders, maybe he ordered people to the ground before he started killing them. I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very insulting to a person, who is dealing with loss, to see such blatant disregard for what I see as totally logical and simplistic - clear cut - thought.</p>

<p>I interpreted the original post as intentionally trying to skew the reality of the situation to provide a false narrative then building on that. 320 people, two hands on a cell phone, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>To me, it felt like the OP didn&#39;t even do any real research into the timeline and eye witness testimony before making the post, and as I&#39;ve already said, if it were the first time someone made this post I&#39;d of addressed it a little more calmly, but these seem to be the majority posts about Orlando now in this sub reddit, and frankly it hurts.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve asked Mark Zuckerberg for help. Remind you of FBI vs Apple recently? You want to know why they needed access to that iPhone in San Bernardino? To make sure he didn&#39;t inform someone when the plot went south. They also had to make sure a copy of that (his messages and/or contacts which may expose their own informants) didn&#39;t end up in Apple&#39;s iCloud where someone could fish it out like a curious Apple iCloud engineer, or even Tim Cook himself. FBI had to make absolutely sure this wouldn&#39;t happen, hence the court battle. I highly doubt the FBI vs Apple thing was a publicity stunt or attack on encryption like so many people thought.</p>

I&#39;m not talking Jihadi Special Forces, I&#39;m talking more towards guys who gained a lot of experience in media manipulation due to interaction with US Forces on a day to day basis for years.</p></li>
<li><p>The seizure of the weapons of war, combined with knowledge from TERPs who either had the choice of having themselves and their families killed, along with journalists, etc. lead to a fringe group that originated in Camp Bucca (a prison camp for Al Qaeda/Taliban operatives during the US occupation of Iraq) to basically take over some of the largest key points in Iraq, specifically Mosul, which is also a key point in Iraq from a military stand point because it creates a direct block for food supplies to the Yazidi and Kurds North, East, and West of the city.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially what you had was a large group of guys who spent a lot of time in Camp Bucca together and felt Al Qaeda wasn&#39;t being adamant enough in their adherence to establishing a Caliphate - who then gained access to weapons of war, took over cities that had millions of dollars in them, and then began to expand outward for the seizure of oil and gasoline to continue funding their campaign.</p>

<p>Add people who were trained either directly or indirectly from watching years of the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; type of war we were using in the area - and suddenly having assets from the largest News sources in Northern Iraq to start creating propaganda and you&#39;ve got a pretty clear and cut case of how a group of 10,000 - 30,000 militants can take over entire regions.</p>

<p>The level of sophistication in Daesh&#39;s own propoganda can be seen in things like their claim to be executing Christian&#39;s on the beach in Libya was actually done in front of a green screen. They duplicated the amount of victims to make it seem like there were more walking in the line, and they intentionally increased the size of the executioners to give a sort of illusion of power towards Daesh and it&#39;s militants by making them appear to tower over the people they oppose.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t new, hostages who have been rescued by allied forces have stated they would be taken into green screen rooms where they would perform mock executions as a director and producer dictated camera angles before being returned to their holding areas. In short, they&#39;re the first terrorist organization to really start using media propaganda to it&#39;s full potential, and it&#39;s scary as all hell.</p>

<p>The CIA has also started to warn of knowledge of Daesh sleeper cells in the United States being a much more credible threat than before.</p>

<p>Those of us with military connections already knew a lot of this. It kind of blows my mind and frustrates me to no end as a Veteran of OEF to see the indifference of Western cultures towards how real of a threat this is.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also got the issue of Obama insisting that all weapons and ammunition to support local war efforts against Daesh go through Turkey first - I know a lot of Kurdish people from Iraq and Syria, and the bottom line is Turkey is pro-ISIS and is committing systematic genocide against the Kurds specifically.</p>

<p>So now you have a very convenient way for our Administration to say they&#39;re helping the good guys, and washing their hands of these weapons getting sent directly to the bad guys.</p>

<p>That said, the assessment is true in terms of Daesh not gaining any headway in Iraq and Syria in recent time. Mosul has been kind of a stand still with a neutral territory about 20 KM out of the southern entrance to the city where Dwekh Nawsha and Peshmerga forces patrol. (I have friends who served as Marines and Infantrymen in the Army who have gone to fight with the Dwekh Nawsha to try and combat Daesh, there&#39;s a lot more shit going on over there than the media ever reports on. One of them is on his second year out there.)</p>

<p>That long rant aside, my information on why Mateen was being investigated by the FBI could be off - but I&#39;ve yet to see anyone offer a counter argument towards it and the sources I got my information from are people I trust who often have inside information on shit like this because of the circles they&#39;re a part of in the military. Word travels fast in smaller circles of the Army because they have a direct interest in killing these fucks until there are no more on the planet earth.</p>

<p>Mateen claiming allegiance to ISIS in the middle of the killing spree makes enough sense to me, it&#39;s often what terrorists do to affiliate and help strengthen the agenda of the groups they support. It&#39;s not something new, is what I&#39;m getting at.</p>

<p>There are a lot of inconsistency&#39;s happening with the actual investigation of the shooting, though, specifically with the DA and State of Florida being denied access to investigation materials from the shooting and the 911 tapes - which are a matter of public record - to start conducting their own investigations.</p>

<p>So at the end of the day, who really knows?</p>

I tend to believe Brennan&#39;s statement - that there are no direct ties between this guy and Daesh - although Mateen may have <em>thought</em> at some point he was dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea what Elgin is, but it&#39;s cute that rather than saying &quot;oh, thanks for providing me proof.&quot; You opted to continue with whatever Elgin is.</p>

<p>You can trace this username and my Reddit posts back almost 2 decades over the internet. Most of what I do involves playing video games and posting in knife collector forums. The only reason I&#39;ve been so vocal in this specific portion of posts in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> forum - as I&#39;ve already said - is because I personally knew one of the victims.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a long time lurker and sparse poster in these forums for quite some time.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t sit right with you, it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re a bit overly paranoid. If me proving that I&#39;m a Service Connected Disabled Veteran leads you to make more attempts at discrediting me, for whatever reason, then it&#39;s probably because you don&#39;t much care for what I have to say, and have very little rebuttal in terms of intelligent response to try and open a dialogue to help me better understand your own thoughts on the attack.</p>

<p>Mass shootings, or even shooting incidents such as the reporter on the news, always seem to draw out the crazies in this sub reddit in droves.</p>

<p>If it was a false flag, which is something I haven&#39;t ruled out - in fact there is plenty of suspicious shit around the scenario that make me believe it is - it sure as shit is doing it&#39;s job of distracting people from all the other crazy shit that&#39;s happened over the last week.</p>

<p>What I take offense to, is people calling it a hoax. It wasn&#39;t, these people are dead. Their friends and family members, including myself, are hurt by it - and when you insinuate it&#39;s a hoax with what I perceive as totally ridiculous speculation I&#39;m going to come back and respond in kind with why it&#39;s so ridiculous.</p>

<p>This time I happened to be in a pretty bad mood because of how many inconsistencies in critical thinking there were in the original post, and went a little too personal, it is what it is. I stand by my comments.</p>

I&#39;m leaning towards remote mind control patsy with crisis actors and maybe a few actual deaths.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming you mean Eglin and your phone is giving out typos.</p>

<p>I think the body count is real.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there were any crisis actors involved.</p>

<p>I do think there is plenty of evidence to point towards it being a false flag, and that it did it&#39;s job, as a lot of shit happened over the last week politically that went completely ignored due to the shooting.</p>

<p>Personally I think Marteen was mentally ill, and that his father could very well have influenced that pretty heavily since he was a CIA asset. His father is probably how he got connections with all of the other shit people are alarmed by as well.</p>

<p>Friends say he was clear cut gay, or at least bi sexual (but probably gay.)</p>

<p>There&#39;s an interesting documentary by VICE here, that people should watch, to sort of get an insight into how ass backwards the culture in Afghanistan is. Homophobia is rampant, Jihadists/Extremists/whateverthefuckists place being gay as a killable offense above being a Westerner or being a Christian.</p>

<p>Yet pedophilia is rampant, and they dress up with flowers in their hair and in make up on Thursdays then go around having gay sex and making out with each other like it&#39;s no big deal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very odd, and it points towards how cultural acceptance of sexual orientation can play a huge role in a person&#39;s mental well being.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about conspiracy theory shit enough to look into mind control and how real or unreal it is. I do know Cultural Marxism in this country is very real as I&#39;ve seen a huge shift in how accepting millenials are of the idea that the Government is there to be a giant piggy bank for them, and how accepting they&#39;ve become of more oppressive bullshit instead of resistant to it.</p>

<p>100 years from now this country will be very different from what it is as we know it. I hope I&#39;m not alive to see it change into a police state, or wherever it&#39;s headed. The Government has generations to put their plans into action, we have but one short lifetime on this earth to do what we can. That&#39;s the major issue at play. 80 year old men still have seats in top political positions and they shape the way this country grows - it seems like Millenials were intentionally raised for more compliance knowing that they would be the next to take office in those seats.</p>

<p>I&#39;m ranting.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the documentary.</p>

<p>Check out the website unitedagainstmindcontrol for some pretty mind blowing info on where that&#39;s at. Consider NG was 17 miles away from orlando, 7 miles away from aurora, 15 from virginia tech, 30 from sandy hook, and boston. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That VICE documentary is accurate to what was going on in Afghanistan prior to us pulling out of the region, it doesn&#39;t really have an agenda. I don&#39;t normally recommend VICE stuff, but this one is to the point and pretty candid.</p>

<p>There are military bases, federal buildings, etc. all over the country, I don&#39;t buy into the &quot;because X was close to X it points towards conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p>People react oddly when they&#39;re in the middle of a mental break, I&#39;ve seen people run the gambit of hysterical crying to blank expressionless soul crushing depression to flat out mania.</p>

<p>When I did my PTSD exit interview at the VA I actually laughed a lot about stuff that I cry about at home.</p>

<p>The media also does a lot of prep work with people before an interview, they go over the questions before hand, they coach the people they&#39;re interviewing to better fit their own agenda and narrative, they&#39;re very good at mentally manipulating average citizens, and even moreso when someone is in the middle of extreme shock or a mental break.</p>

<p>If you want to link me to case by case stuff I can give you my opinion on it, but quite frankly there are already a lot of people who are against guns around the country - and if they found out their kid was just killed by the &quot;evil AR-15 assault rifle&quot; then coached through interview questions before actually going live, or even having the idea put into their head &quot;how do you feel about guns? Don&#39;t you think you should make a statement about it to get justice for your baby boy?&quot; it&#39;s not really all that far of a reach to see it brought up as a talking point.</p>

<p>The media gives two shits about the people who died. Maybe Anderson Cooper took it a little bit to heart because he himself is gay, but the overall agenda is just to continue pushing what the current administration&#39;s agenda is - which right now is gun control.</p>

<p>If Trump gets elected you&#39;ll see a huge shift again towards whatever his policies are. The same thing happened with the shift from Bush Jr. to Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a side note, while I&#39;m not pointing a finger directly at you, I see a lot of people who are interested in how the political agenda at the time is manipulated by the media due to the administration seem to be so young that they don&#39;t remember a pre-Obama administration in terms of how the media was driven.</p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to remember all the way back to Bush Sr., and one of the reasons you see apathy from a lot of older American&#39;s towards the overall thing is because it&#39;s just generally accepted that the media is no longer about journalistic integrity.</p>

<p>For a lot of younger people it&#39;s still some shocking revelation that the media isn&#39;t reporting on the news, but instead is reporting on what the administration is saying is the news.</p>

<p>Obama has been very polarizing as a President compared to Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr. though - to the point of him being a borderline troll who is laughing at the American public while he pulls strings.</p>

<p>I think that today&#39;s youth will start to realize the truth of it all when we have a shift in political party and see how the media shifts along with it. It always happens, it will continue to happen.</p>

<p>You had me up until this line. Not sure if you have, but I&#39;ve been to a club or two and this is usually the case. Especially in busier city areas, people will park a few blocks away and walk, or use a cab.</p>

<p>From my experience, newbies who read your post will reach that line and realize the same thing I did, and say, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s not suspicious!&quot; Also, this is a common tactic for controlled opposition to use to discredit themselves. I&#39;d strongly advise removing that bit.</p>

Maybe a whole bunch of people did run right past him out the front door but aren&#39;t exactly proud of that and aren&#39;t talking about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory...no evidence...it just makes sense to me. There are two options.</p>

<p>1) This was perpetrated by an Isis sympathizer. The reason they attacked a gay club is that the LGBTQ community is typically more liberal and would be more likely to vote for someone like Hilary Clinton or Gary Johnson. Since the shooter was a Muslim, ISIS could think that this would lead the LGBTQ community to adopt anti-muslim sentiment. Ultimately this would lead them to vote for a president who has a more anti-muslim stance. Moreover, based on the current political/social climate in the states, this could lead to the United States ripping itself apart from the inside out, at which point, they wouldn&#39;t have to do anything else.</p>

<p>2) This attack was initiated by Trump for the same reason.</p>

<p>As I stated these ideas are pure speculation and there&#39;s nothing to back them up. Just something that I think made sense.</p>

<p>&quot;The witness said he recalled hearing Mateen mention a female who was playing dead and allegedly had a “bombing vest” like the one he reportedly wore during the attack. The other two people Mateen allegedly mentioned were two snipers, whom he said were waiting for police to arrive so they could shoot.&quot;</p>
