       I was looking on yelp and noticed an 8-month gap in reviews from 7-14-2015 to 3-13-2016. I also saw in another post an old photo of the building that looked much fancier than recent pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the club have been closed/bought out before re-opening in March?

       I googled him and went straight to the wiki. I couldnt find anything holocaust related, could you provide me with a link please? I'll copy a sentence from the wiki : "On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting. The attack is the deadliest single gunman mass shooting in United States history, the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in U.S. history, the largest targeted mass killing of LGBT people in the western world since the Holocaust, and the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the September 11 attacks of 2001."  Seems like this editor has a somewhat narrow view of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : He traveled to new york in 2001 to start up an art center? Perhaps the art center the Israeli students were supposed to visit? ;)

       Here are actors moving off camera, dropping off "victim" (with thigh wound-yes bullets were used) and then grinning and doing a little jig. Nothing to see here, move along?

       I don't, I'm positive I read it somewhere in this subreddit, though, so it's probably to be taken with a grain of salt. When I tried to Google it all I see is that the owners "vow it will be rebuilt in the honor of the victims."

       i read that the owners were trying to make it a historic building.  (i.e., increase the value of the property.)  i find this happens a lot with the property owners struck by "terrorist attacks" -- much like larry silverstein's multi-billion dollar insurance payout,
       <strong>
        the property owners always seem to profit from tragedy.

       Pulse was a rock/artsy clue called Dante's maybe 15-20 years ago.  It has been Pulse for at least 11 years.  It wasn't closed for any period of time that I'm aware of.  I live in the area and lived about 2 miles from the site for 10 years.  The difference in the photos people are posting is a decade of wear and tear on the facade.

       ONE ... social and mainstream media blackout. Two... reports of multiple shooters from eye witnesses.   Three the shooter himself is a contradiction...
I think we are being set up for a "Super event" that will happen some time next year after the election.

       In what fantasy world was there a mainstream media blackout? This was all over the news in the morning, I couldn't get away from it (sorry, I was not awake at 2am-5am). This was all over my facebook feed that morning too, you are mistaking "
       <a href="/r/news/">
        /r/news/
       </a>
       " stupid modding policy with "social media blackout."
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are a couple of reports of multiple shooters. One says heard two guns going off. Maybe that is when he was in a shoot-out with the police officers?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The guy was holding the door and not letting us exit.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, that guy also came forward and said he did so to save the people in the alley. He wasn't one of the shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another person said that the gun fire was "too consistent" for it to be one shooter. Note, they didn't say they saw two people, only that their "expert" opinion about guns, in a moment of probably pure terror, leads them to believe there was more than one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, more importantly, this contradicts the overwhelming reports from eye-witnesses of seeing only one shooter.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Three the shooter himself is a contradiction
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How so?

       It's great you think this, but it seems to be based on some pretty questionable facts, at best.

       Eye witnesses to these type of events are terrible witnesses. In the shock and confusion people don't know what's happening. Colombine is a perfect example.

       That's not a second and/or third gunmen. I was speaking to eyewitnesses saying they heard multiple gunmen. IDK WTF happened, just saying people in shock are poor witnesses.

       We have a couple of people claiming that they
       <em>
        heard
       </em>
       stuff that led them to believe there was more than one shooter, and many people saying they only saw one shooter.

      <p>
       It's not that we dismiss eye witness account, but it is pretty insane to take the opinion of what two people thought they heard, instead of the opinion of many people who say they only saw one guy.

       Places this size can be difficult to operate.  They're too small for big events and too big for small events.  Usually they have a run of 1-3 years, unless it has "casino level" decor, meaning someone is just throwing away money to be cool.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were open sporadically and only if they knew they had a crowd coming in from a promoter or a pre-booked party.  Most of the news descriptions describe the event as a Latin night, to me that says they had a Latin promoter in there, that night.  The exterior also looks like they just tried to change the appearance of the place outside, probably because they were trying to reinvent themselves after business had been down.  If a place that size isn't doing great, they're very likely only open when they know they'll make money.

       Has anyone noticed how perfect almost all the people that died looked, it's almost like they were professional models. Almost actors?

       Also, isn't it faking your own death not illegal in this country? As in you're legally allowed to do it.

       Not true. Especially if they signed some sort of legal document prohibiting them from divulging any information.

       That, and ya know..the fear of the possible loss of life resulting from speaking up, or even worse... friends and/or family being attacked, deaths made to look like suicides..... never know.

       Maybe try coming up with a better argument in the future. It's been used like every time something like this happens, and it's really just an ignorant statement IMO.
