        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m Dark Journalist, independent reporter and filmmaker with over 3 million channel views. My video show adds a new twist to Alternative Media and my YouTube channel offers insightful hours of penetrating interviews with top whistleblowers, like former Defense Minister of Canada Paul Hellyer, former US Assistant Secretary of HUD Catherine Austin Fitts and veteran investigative reporters, like Linda Moulton Howe and Jim Marrs along with a host of experts of the clandestine world.
I’m happy to answer any questions you may have on subjects such as Deep State Political Control, The Black Budget Economy, Exotic Technology, Transhumanism, The Breakaway Civilization and UFO Secrecy.
I think we&#39;re in a pivotal period, where we’re seeing desperate moves on the part of the controlling elite to distract us from important, hidden information that is impeding us from a new reality, outside of their control. We need to develop critical thinking in the face of unrelenting media entrainment and disinformation about the level of our actual scientific development, which is being hoarded, for the most part by massive US defense contractors, in tandem with the Deep State.
I call this new approach “Dark Journalism” and I feel it’s necessary that we share the truth and achieve transparency in our culture.
I’m interested to hear what you think about these topics and maybe together we’ll come up with some truly inspiring answers.
Visit me at <a href="http://www.DarkJournalist.com">http://www.DarkJournalist.com</a>
I look forward to answering your questions.
Thank you! We&#39;ll Start at 4PM...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for that!</p>

<hr/>

<p>There are people out there who claim that sites like the pyramid of Giza were built atop of even older more ancient sites, like perhaps the Sphinx is significantly older than the Great pyramids, Manchu Picchu built upon an even older wonder etc etc.  </p>

<p>Maybe the elites are well aware of a cyclical but natural destruction of the earth, and the whole point of the break away civilization is to ensure that some representative portion of humanity is equipped to survive the global purge and repopulate the new virgin earth.</p>

<p>Maybe they know they can sell us global warming because they have historical record of a similar ramping up to the purge.</p>

<p>You have this life boat, and you know that 50 people can survive comfortably on it.  However your boat already has 60 people on it and 3000 people are in the water swimming towards you, do you and your 59 companions paddle away?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a lot of great information here to follow up on. There was a very interesting fact that I found in an Edgar Cayce reading regarding the age of the Sphinx that I think has been overlooked. In the reading where he was discussing the Atlantean Hall of Records being buried there. He said that when they set up the Giza Plateau in 10,500 B.C that they were doing archaeological research themselves and discovered this ancient site and built the Great Pyramid and Sphinx there. For those who know the value of Cayce&#39;s work on the subject this is very interesting...more here: <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-boulter.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-boulter.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read in <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6Cw5M">Alien Digest Volume 1 (of 4) that a psychic named Sven Peterson</a> from Scandinavia believes there is a planet beyond pluto inhabited by many hostile aliens (probably reptilians) in a deep freeze that are waiting for when the earth is weak from war and polution and becoming docile that they plan to attack earth and annihilate humanity or at least, greatly reduce the population. I could not find more info on this suposed psychic. Some speculate that this planet would cause weather problems and whatnot when it comes close to the earth. What are your thoughts regarding this?</p>

<p>Relevant:</p>

<p>Evidence suggests huge ninth planet exists past Pluto at solar system&#39;s edge. Astronomers investigating the odd alignment of rocks beyond Pluto have concluded that an undetected icy planet four times the size of Earth must exist.</p>

<p>I mean not only were they masters of acoustics, but also incredibly precise and original architects.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptian tried to imitate the great pyramids, thus they built smaller step pyramids. But they were nothing to compare with the great pyramids. And not even that precise.</p>

<p><a href="http://anthony.sogang.ac.kr/Books/2012Photos/steppyramid.jpg">Quite retarded, to be a little bit dicky.</a></p>

<p>You see, IMHO no normal human could have ever built the magnificent great pyramids. Nope, it was still the aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep interviewing the same people over and over again. Catherine Austin Fitts, Joseph Farrell, Linda Moulton Howe, et all. </p>

<p>First of all, Howe was duped by AFOSI agent Richard Doty once back in the &#39;80s. And yet she continues to promulgate claims by inside military sources as if they&#39;re not obvious disinformation. Those fake drones and the supposed CARET documents anyone? </p>

<p>Why do you not ask her difficult questions about this instead of one softball after the next? </p>

<p>Some goes for the rest of your guests. It&#39;s either promotion for Fitts&#39; or Farrel&#39;s subscriber news service or book promotion. But never any <em>real questions</em> that challenge the views of your interview subjects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Linda has cumulatively done some of the best investigative reporting on the subject of UFOs period.

    <div class="md"><p>Get out of town, you haven&#39;t looked closely at it. Matthew Williams and friends have been really open about making crop circles for a long time, and they&#39;ll even show you the blueprints, and he was even prosecuted for it. Even Colin Andrews accepts this reality. 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GXkteXRoiF8">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GXkteXRoiF8</a></p>

<p>There may be some that are non-human created, but they&#39;re not the big dramatic ones, at least not in the U.K. &quot;The Paracast&quot; hosts acknowledge this, Richard Dolan acknowledges this, U.K. Researcher Rob Buckle acknowledges it, etc. We should be listening to what these &quot;Circlemakers&quot; say, because there&#39;s a lot of juicy paranormal stuff in there. </p>

<p>But Linda Howe is quick to jump to th e most radical-sounding explanation, same with the the cattle mutilation phenomenon. We don&#39;t honestly know what the fuck is going on there. Chris O&#39;Brien has been studying it for decades, and he admits he has very little idea who or what it actually represents. Linda comes off as a profiteer, I&#39;m sorry to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because a few hoaxers make bad imitations of genuine Crop Circles that doesn&#39;t mean anything. Remember the Doug and Dave claims of doing the designs and then utterly failing to reproduce anything near the intricacy of the patterns? </p>

<p>If you follow Colin Andrews work or anyone of his ilk then you know the validity of the Crop Circle phenomena, don&#39;t get hung up on a few lame hoaxers and lose all the genuine research. Those are always bad imitations. That is a program designed to produce the kind of reaction a disinformation campaign is built upon. </p>

<p>As far as cattle mutilations go, you sound like you haven&#39;t understood the material that&#39;s available. I&#39;d start with Linda Moulton Howe&#39;s documentary, A Strange Harvest. That is excellent reporting even 30 years later.</p>

They&#39;re artists, and they&#39;re out there because they believe they&#39;re connecting with a separate intelligence, which they are. They give a lot of the best evidence for a paranormal phenomena, and you should listen to them to get a more full picture of the phenomenon. Colin Andrews totally acknowledges this aspect of the story at this point. He changed his estimation of U.K. Crop circles from &quot;80% human made, 20% non-human made&quot; to &quot;95% human-made.&quot; Something like that, probably - what should matter is the TRUTH, come on man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Linda Howe was snookered by Richard Doty and Robert Collins in the mid 1980s. They promised documents and film they never delivered. As a result she was unable to meet her contractual obligations to HBO and lost production financing. Yet she goes to the same group of people, all connected to the same alphabet soup intelligence agency financed UFO and exotic propulsion research group, to continue her so-called investigations. They lied to her. Yet - like George Knapp - she continues to beg them for more disinfo to promulgate. Presumably - like William Moore and Jamie Shandera - to get inside information. </p>

<p>I know who these people are. I expect you do too. But you don&#39;t report on it. </p>

<p>Albert Stubblebine, John B Alexander, Harold Puthoff, Robert Collins, Robert Wood, Howard McConnell, Bill Wilkinson, and a few others. Later, Jacques Vallee. And one might assume international coordination with Claude Poher over at GEFEN. More recently Eric Davis has been working with Puthoff over at Earthtech. I expect he&#39;s Puthoff&#39;s protege. And Edward Mitchell was part of that crowd before he passed. So was Brian O&#39;Leary. </p>

<p>Most of these guys were connected in some way to the Remote Viewing program at SRI. Most of them have Ph.Ds in physics. They all still communicate via a private email list. They do it by CC: so there&#39;s no central mail server. Are you on it? Have you seen it? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some documents you&#39;ve probably never seen:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Dpc9b">http://imgur.com/a/Dpc9b</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re important.</p>

<p>You do know they&#39;ve been lying to reporters and UFO researchers since the early 1980s. And it&#39;s been a coordinated disinformation campaign run straight from US Intelligence. They arranged the bogus MJ-12 documents on film to Shandera. Doty is just a lackey. </p>

<p>A curious question I&#39;ve wondered is: who ran the group before them? There was a group. That is, if you believe Ingo Swann&#39;s account. And I&#39;m inclined to. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve all gone very quiet since 2013. I wonder what&#39;s up. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen you chase Daniel Sheehan&#39;s account of digging through top secret UFO archives in the mid 1970s for Marcia Smith&#39;s Presidential Briefing on UFOs to President Carter. </p>

<p>There are so many good avenues to explore beyond interviewing the same people over and over again. Why don&#39;t you do some reporting?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that the electric / hybrid car movement was deliberately orchestrated, to steer the public away from the reality of zero point energy technologies? Tesla is at the forefront, and I find it very intriguing that they have literally changed the meaning of Tesla within modern culture. Within this community, we know that Nikola was onto paradigm shifting technologies, not an electric powered car, that still taps into a dirty, profit-based resource grid. Do you see all this as just another psy op, to sweep the immense implications of free energy under the proverbial rug, and placate the population, by offering the illusion of cleaner, sustainable energy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I completely agree, electric is worlds better than petro, and it&#39;s a good step for now. However, we still are tied to the grid... I think the next logical step (whenever a crack will form within the suppression) will be portable zero point generators, to charge our electric cars. Then it would be sustainable. Yes, the one inventor / scientist who stays in my mind is Stan Meyer, and his water powered car. He died of &#39;food poisoning&#39; It&#39;s such a shame, and yes, I have been waiting for people to wake up to this reality.

    <div class="md"><p>You make some excellent points here. I&#39;ll tell you that I tend to approach each persons story or testimony with a completely open mind about its validity. I try to apply a journalistic method of discovery and discernment rather than set up a judgmental dynamic.</p>

<p>We find in general that there are too many sites and forums where it seems the function of the enterprise is to simply tear down everything and discredit everyone. A true researcher will never get far with this across the board negative approach.  It discourages trust and community learning. It is also a playground for intel operatives.</p>

<p>There are also some cases where I see researchers give too much credence to information that is unsubstantiated, a recent example is Michael Salla and his complete acceptance of Corey Goode&#39;s narrative with no backing material. We can see the dangers in either extreme.</p>

McCloy (who shared a booth with Hitler at the 1936 olympics) is a suspect organization.

<p>I believe it is some kind of weapons development program using dimensional doorways as a function of this research. 
There is viable research out there that shows when it is turned on it produces a variety of hazardous effects, including a change in solar activity on Earth. There are many countries now saying they are going to build their own bigger and badder particle colliders. Perhaps they have been tipped to its military function. In any case it is hard to say exactly what the real nature of it is, but it&#39;s fair to say that the implications are potentially earth shattering.</p>

<p>Anyone else with a physics major here to address this claim? Absolutely not: a particle accelerator merely smashes fundamental particles together. The LHC smashes protons and scientists have to filter out a massive amount of data to check signatures of particles predicted by the standard model (and that&#39;s how they found the Higgs boson). The research is simply fundamental physics research that cannot evolve anymore without these big facilities since we are now able to probe deeper and deeper into the fabric of matter. We don&#39;t know what technology it might lead to, but governments are unlikely to have an obscure agenda behind this. Fundamental research has a larger long term impact on the economy and society, and these research endeavors are mostly merely for the sake of knowledge. Weapons development and other higher TRL research come from other budgets and from private companies.</p>

<p>Dimensional doorways? What does that even mean? Noone comprehends the other dimensions predicted by string theory (and many even doubt their existence). In any case, we are nowhere the energy levels required to probing these dimensions predicted by string theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the JFK assassination was such a complete change of history and disruption of the march towards freedom and prosperity in the world. The forces that accomplished the elimination of President Kennedy were betting on the fact that they could control the coverup also. But there was a certain point where the average citizen looked at the situation and understood what happened. </p>

<p>We&#39;re now in a similar position with 9/11 and the aftermath of events there. These deep events are implemented to make vast changes in our system, as we know things have operated almost like a police state since. The power elite operating in the wake of these incidents does seem to be trying to speed up the clock in the last 2 years towards their goals and have abandoned some of the usual caution. They are obviously working on some timetable that is a mystery  to us. But I agree they seem to be acting in an almost erratic fashion. </p>

<p>Bart Sibrel recently posted an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-qMyHyMNZw">unedited interview</a> he did for a documentary--interesting how much great stuff ended up on the cutting room floor (interview is 1hr 40min, the documentary was just 28 minutes)...Killing of Gus Grissom (his mother thought he was killed and they blocked US government from disposing of the evidence)...Sibrel is also on board with the possibility that Stanley Kubrick filmed the Fake Moon Landing (this is explored in the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vthms96ESU4"><em>ROOM 237</em></a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of these guys do good research. But I think the idea that we didn&#39;t go is absurd. In my opinion it&#39;s clear that we went to the Moon. What we found there is another story. I think in Ingo Swann&#39;s Penetration book there is some info to suggest what was happening when we got there and why we basically let the public space program go shortly after. Strange indeed. Quite possibly there were offworld civilizations using it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well let me give some credit where credit is due. Bill Kaysings book &quot;We Never Went to the Moon&quot; tracked some serious anomalies in the story of the moon landing and how those who questioned the operation were systematically discredited, or worse. I think the conclusions about the mission being faked are wrong for a number of reasons. However, that they found something there when they went, like large scale structures that they didn&#39;t want to show us, is where I believe the confusion on this comes from.</p>

<p>There is a massive coverup, but it involves an offworld culture and their activities being discovered there. I covered some of this in latter half of this episode: <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-farrell1.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-farrell1.php</a></p>

<p>Ah, that&#39;s why you think the notion of the moon landing being faked is &quot;absurd&quot;, because the &#39;astronuts finding an &quot;offworld culture&quot;&#39; theory holds-up better I suppose.. Makes sense.</p>

A dystopian society that gets so bad that the pain endured by the masses will motivate them to try something new which will lead mankind into a higher standard of living as the culture would realize it&#39;s power through unity. The other option is that humankind realizes that it&#39;s better to create a new society with a new set of values as of now and decides to restore the planet before it gets any worse. </p>

Emory does excellent work also, tracking fascist influences. I don&#39;t agree with all of his research, for example he believes Ron Paul is a fascist link, which is absurd, but I think he&#39;s done some interesting stuff on these subjects...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the info he brings out in that series is brand new and his book only just came out this week. As far as Boorman is concerned, it is confirmed that he cashed a check in South America in the 1960&#39;s for over a million dollars. he was certainly alive and well long after the war. He ran the post war fascist international according to Farrell&#39;s research. I don&#39;t think we know who took over when he died...but we can be sure they are still very active...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of good questions here. I think 2016 is a turning point year for sure. I find it fascinating that between Trump and Clinton this year the media has had to touch on 9/11, UFO Disclosure, the JFK Assassination and Private Prisons because there was no way to avoid them. </p>

<p>Disclosure is being parodied here and there, but I don&#39;t see anything conclusive coming out from any official channel. I do think that with the rise of corporations we&#39;re seeing some attempt to co-opt research in the area of UFOs.

I think they realize that there is a great likelihood we will discover these off world cultures on our own and they need some kind of insurance if that happens...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got a great overview there, let&#39;s see. Well Farrell&#39;s division of 3 levels operating during 9/11 is new and still needs further elucidation. In the three part series I had with him on this just recently I came to the conclusion that there is a competition between level 2 and 3 and that involves getting their hands on the advanced technology. This technology is likely the result of experiments dating back to the Nazi era that were completed at a much later date by a rogue network that survived after the fall of Germany in World War 2 and was headquartered in South America. </p>

<p>Now that aspect of a breakaway civilization using a human developed technology is disturbing enough, however, the research does point to another even stranger source for the exotic technology, which is the re-engineering of off world craft that the military recovered and experimented on for over 70 years. There are links in the background of SAIC, which was heavily involved with the cleanup and reconstruction of the pentagon before and after the event, that point to their research interest in UFOs and their own experiments on a scale model of the Nazi Bell.</p>

<p>Now the idea that level 3, a rouge network that was in possession of the advanced technology, tricked level 2, elements in the Deep State that are comprised of intelligence and military personnel, during their own conspiratorial operation is fascinating and I believe explains the erratic actions of the leadership during the whole ordeal. The second episode in that series goes deeply into that here (watch and listen close for the links to the PROMIS software being used to help level 3 achieve access to secret codes they used to blackmail level 2): <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-farrell8.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-farrell8.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly wanted to ask this, but wasn&#39;t sure how well it would be received. I&#39;ll ask anyway... In all seriousness, how do you stay sane while going further down the rabbit hole? I&#39;ve been researching for many years, and this is something that I still struggle with. What types of mindsets / perception shifts do you personally try to incorporate to stay grounded? Sure, I know there&#39;s meditation, but that can also lead to a disconnection from the surface reality we all unfortunately need to live within. These waters are deep, the information / implications of it all is endless, and it feels like an incredibly isolating path, especially when those around you aren&#39;t anywhere near the same level. It&#39;s a tricky balance...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have to say this is what I am most focused on at the moment. From what I can tell it is definitely a multipurpose facility. I don&#39;t believe the cover story about it being a project to discover the &#39;God Particle&#39; and the wonders of science aspects. It has very dicey connections in its development, including fascist connections. It has a massive military-style budget of over 6 billion dollars and it is also set up as a sovereign entity (hard to sue them in court) with no public oversight. I think we&#39;re looking at weapons development here, but the kind of weapons that are dimensional in nature and therefore very hard for us on the outside to really observe and critique. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping some of my reporting opens up a real conversation of the dangers inherent in the CERN Hadron Collider project.

Well you&#39;ve tripped into my current fascination which is how every little interaction we have in social networks like Facebook is being fed into AI systems, in effect teaching these systems to act like us. There are so many cases where this kind of information can be misused that we need to bring major transparency to this type of research ASAP. We know that these people in power cannot be trusted. How will we like it when they have a robot clone army doing their bidding for them using our thoughts and even our voices?   Let&#39;s focus on this now, raise awareness and try to stop it.

    <div class="md"><p>What a great question, well really they are not mutually exclusive. So first off let me say that in my research I believe that there are off world civilizations visiting here and being very secretive about that. </p>

<p>I do believe that there are advanced technology groups here, like the groups that Admiral Byrd ran into during his travels. Those groups may be descended from secret societies that kept an ancient technology in their brotherhoods for centuries. I think there is compelling evidence for this. I don&#39;t think we know a lot about their intentions, but that is a human civilization with exotic technology we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the work of Nick Cook and Igor Witkowski are very illuminating on this. There&#39;s no question that the Nazis had achieved things in physics which we were never told about. I think the elimination of the Bell scientists reveals that. I think that the post war group of Nazis took that tech with them and developed it in South America. I think that Torsion Physics was involved and that we can&#39;t even imagine what that project would look like 70 years later. But possibly some of the mystery around directed energy weapons is linked up to this Bell project..fascinating stuff...

    <div class="md"><p>One more quick question I wanted to ask... Do you believe that for the most part, tptb are being manipulated through archons / other malicious entities, who have their own esoteric agenda for our planet? Jay Weidner speaks about archons very openly, and I was curious what your thoughts were. I often contemplate the sinister nature that I see within some areas of humanity, and how it doesn&#39;t quite fit into the majority of humans, which I believe to be good people. Are there a percentage of humans manipulated / taken over by entities? I very much feel that one of the invisible wars we fight is this type of manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s an excellent question. The idea of Archons is very old and if we go back to the Book of Enoch we can see his story of watchers has something in common with this idea. There&#39;s no question that from Zoroastrianism to Greek Myths we&#39;re looking at an attempt to help us understand forces that are not easily seen using only our physical senses</p>

<p>We&#39;re always better off taking the whole picture into account whether or not the culture we&#39;re living in accepts the concepts of evil entities. Modern Science is obviously lacking in this area, but many of the alchemists in the middle ages certainly still understood these powerful principles.

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is exactly the situation the US government was in after World War 2. There&#39;s no question they had developed real information on an offworld presence visiting here and they decided for various reasons to keep it quiet. One of the reasons was, as you say, for the level of understanding that society was on at that time. </p>

<p>What happened later is that they decided to keep the information about the technology out of direct government hands and moved it into private corporation hands so it would be easier to hide the research etc. Unfortunately this process led to private military contractors like Boeing to be able to shut out the oversight from official sources and still continue to develop the exotic technology. The situation apparently became ugly enough that President Eisenhower threatened to invade Area 51 in order to be updated on the progress of UFO technology. JFK followed in a similar vein and according to former Watergate Lawyer Douglas Caddy, his friend E. Howard Hunt , the Watergate burglar and high ranking CIA official told him that JFK had been assassinated due to the fact that he was going to disclose the &#39;Alien Presence.&#39; His interview is here:  <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-caddy.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-caddy.php</a></p>

The Gulf of Tonkin incident for example was the false flag needed by Johnson to get us into Vietnam. As we get into the 21st century the public mind is becoming more discerning so the covert ops take on a more confusing character. </p>

<p>I think on the 2nd part of that question, we see a trend rising where some alternative media sources just love to say:  false flag - martial law - FEMA camp - emergency broadcast - literally because they get good ratings that way. So those outlets are actually on the same low level as the corporate media in terms of public manipulation. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to not always jump the gun, to acknowledge that these situations do happen, even while we seek answers. We shouldn&#39;t parade someone else&#39;s tragedy to make political points or better ratings. That&#39;s what the corporate media does and we should shun that practice.</p>

Anna Von Reitz is all about this theory, and it implies the BAR lawyers are in on the scam through using Maritime commerce law (versus Common Law) to rule us.</p>

<p>There are a lot of theories of false flag events that involve faked deaths and crisis actors. IMHO these scenarios seem too complicated and involve too many people to be realistic. I wonder if the events are real, but are set up. For instance Adam Lanza could have been manipulated into committing mass murder to further the gun control agenda. What are your thoughts on this theory? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a crucial question and very important to understand. I can give you my ideas about the various inconsistencies that come up in the mass shooting events we&#39;ve witnessed. The inevitable association with some intel faction and the leaderships attempts to exploit them for greater control. What is really important I think is the extent that the media will assist these operations. Now that being said we do have some terrible things that happen and we need to look at every situation on it&#39;s own merit and not become desensitized to real tragedy because of these false flag aspects that come up. It&#39;s a tough line to walk sometimes, but this is the era of the false flag event...</p>

<p>&quot;When an honest man, honestly mistaken, comes face-to-face with undeniable and irrefutable truth, he is faced with one of two choices, he must either cease being mistaken or cease being honest.&quot; - Amicus Solo (Latin for &quot;a lone friend&quot;)</p>

<p>I read WHERE DID THE TOWERS GO? by Dr. Judy Wood 5½ years ago. No one can refute the overwhelming, conclusive, and indisputable evidence contained in Dr. Wood&#39;s book but only misrepresent it. Science is not determined by popular opinion, but a psyop is. Referring to the sum of 2+3=5 as &quot;a view&quot; or as &quot;an opinion&quot; or &quot;a theory&quot; is how cover-ups work. It creates doubt where there is no doubt. Directed energy weapons exist. The whole world witnessed its use on 9/11 as two quarter mile high concrete and steel towers plus one 47 tower were turned into dust never hitting the ground. (molecular dissociation)</p>

<p>The scientific method, as it came into being during the Enlightenment period, is a method of thought known as empiricism or as the empirical method. Under the terms of empiricism, all conclusions are, must, and can be drawn from observable evidence and from observable evidence only. Evidence must precede any and every conclusion to be drawn from it. Then, if sound logic governs in the relationship between evidence and the conclusion drawn from it, that conclusion will be irrefutable.</p>

<p>Scientists, as all know or should know, proceed in their thinking not according to belief or desired outcome but according solely and only to what the empirical evidence they have gathered, studied, and observed allows them to conclude or makes it inevitable for them to conclude.</p>

<p>This is why Dr. Wood&#39;s work is irrefutable. She only presents evidence and an analysis of that evidence. There is no use for a theory in forensic science. Either you know something or you don&#39;t. That is why those in charge of a cover up don&#39;t want people to look at the evidence in Dr. Wood&#39;s book. Dr. Wood does not ask you to believe her. She only wants you to believe yourself and think for yourself and look at the evidence yourself and not argue about opinions of theories of speculation of ideas. That is what keeps a cover up in place. Those of us who have read Dr. Wood&#39;s book know this to be true. ;-) ♥</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree with you. The UFO research community fixated on UFO disclosure is like a desert community always dreaming of waterfalls. We will never get the kind of disclosure they are searching for, but I do feel that they brought it as far as they could. Let&#39;s remember that half of all the UFO documents that we got through FOIA requests were from Jimmy Carter&#39;s administration in the 1970s. Since then we haven&#39;t done very well. This raises the question: is the UFO technology a bigger secret now than ever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Please don&#39;t call me crazy)</p>

<p>Regarding mind control and MK Ultra... are these telepathic thoughts and visions that we receive coming from ancient technological sources (aliens, gods, spirits and whatnot), or is it a cruel program the government created to justify their murders by distracting us with false magic?</p>

<p>As of late, I&#39;ve been feeling wind that physically moves things and controls beings around me... Aztec and other religious prophecies seem to be taking place. It is implied that Quetzalcoatl is speaking to me. Is this meant to be a delusion to keep us distracted? It&#39;s puzzling because Quetzalcoatl was against sacrifice...</p>

<p>Although technology seems magical, it ultimately leads to sodomy, torture, and murder of countless people for the benefit of a chosen few. These things don&#39;t seem &quot;godly&quot;, they seem psychopathic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The primordial part you mention there is also fascinating. Quetzalcoatl was certainly a kind of wisdom teacher and assumed an archetypal presence in Mayan culture, but what was he really? He, like Akhenaten in Egypt, embodies a real mystery that history has missed. And no I don&#39;t think they were aliens or space travelers in the regular sense. I think that these type of figures are fighting a kind of metaphysical battle with darker forces and there is a clash here that occurs on what we can almost call a spiritual plane....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a good journalist can also be following up on someone else&#39;s work so it&#39;s not just originality that counts. It has more to do with insight and dedicated research, also luck. One of the moments I enjoy the most in my show is Watergate Lawyer Douglas Caddy telling me that CIA Icon E Howard Hunt told him that JFK was killed because he wanted to share the secret of the alien presence. That video is here: <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-caddy.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-caddy.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds more like a stenographer, or at best, an interviewer.  If original research does not make a journalist, then what is an original researcher to be called?  &quot;Following up on someone else&#39;s work&quot; is indeed original research when it uncovers new material.  </p>

<p>For example, if you had followed up on Peter Dale Scott&#39;s comments about the Claire Booth Luce mystery and uncovered some new connection which could have illuminated it, that would be a significant find and would qualify as journalism.  What have you uncovered in any such follow-up?  What new extension of someone else&#39;s research have you contributed?  Journalism is not merely repeating already-known, already-existing information to other people.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your view on project blue book and do you think it&#39;s related to any other projects? </p>

<p>Also, what&#39;s your take on MKUltra, and what form, if any, is it used in today&#39;s media?</p>

<p>I have a hundred other questions but I don&#39;t want to take up too much of your time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Well Blue Book was the PR exercise, but the programs that preceded it were attempts to find out what was happening with the wave of sightings around the early fifties. At a certain point blue book was trotted out there as a kind of caricature of the real investigations. But Dr. Hynek who worked with Blue Book became disenchanted with the lack of legitimate investigation and became one the first real scientists investigating UFOs. </p>

<p>So there is value in the fact that whatever happened to create Blue Book it got people like Hynek to change their allegiance and try to find out what was the actual truth and I think he brought the research along well in the 1970s. </p>

<p>The 70s and the 90s were the glory period for UFO research, since then it&#39;s been really in a backward state where alternative research voices will say &#39;it&#39;s a government psy-op&#39; etc. this is totally wrong. You don&#39;t cover up a phenomena for 70 years because it&#39;s a psy-op, that doesn&#39;t make sense. The UFO coverup is one of the most effective tools for maintaing control over the advanced technology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well not before he was President, no. It&#39;s more likely that since he became President he has had contact with our secret space fleet that  has visited there. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve heard people claim things about &#39;jump rooms&#39; that military personnel can be having lunch in Montana and then walk into a room and suddenly be zapped to Mars. Unfortunately, even though that sounds like interesting technology, there is nothing we have to back those claims up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that you&#39;ve probably stopped answering, but what is the single most compelling/bulletproof piece of verified evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial entities, how and by whom was this evidence verified? Two quick additional questions; Terence McKenna, state asset or no and is US patent 6506148 B2 being used on me right now?</p>

<p>I would also second another poster&#39;s request that you do an episode of Greg Carlwood&#39;s The Higherside Chats, he is deferential to his guests and doesn&#39;t really betray any personal bias during interviews. Also pretty sure he just encourages smoking weed, I&#39;d be shocked if he actually did it on his show.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is, what do they know about the nature of one, the truth about who and what we are, and do they try to keep the common man from knowing about it?</p>

<p>Also on a side note glad to see you know Edgar Cayce, I&#39;m fascinated by his work and have read many books on him and his readings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point! They are indeed very aware generally and well studied in all aspects of esoteric study and occult practice.  As a rule they discourage and ridicule the very same fields of unique interests in public because they tend to fear a well informed populace. </p>

<p>Yes, Cayce was extraordinary and the value of his readings combined with the psychic grasp he had relating to areas like reincarnation and Atlantean technology show the real innovation of his work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Well the extent of the coverup and narrative control tactics whenever there is a UFO sighting, landing, abduction or interference with a major military nuclear base is indicative of the reality of something alien from our culture visiting us. A case like the Phoenix Lights where an entire city, including the Governor,  watches technology like nothing on earth float by for hours with thousands of witnesses also will give us some idea of how real all of this is. Years of witness testimony from airline pilots, Presidents, astronauts, astrophysicists, and others really paints a complete picture in my mind. My interview with Jim Marrs on this subject give us some of this: <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-marrs4.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-marrs4.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the reply. Yes, I have read about the undergound bases that are occupied by reptilian bipedal beings (extraterrestrial or earth-based?), and that people could be disappearing down in those bases. </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the fact that UK hacker Gary McKinnon broke into NASA (and US military?) computers/servers, and saw reports that purported that the US (or world elite?) have &quot;off-world&quot; bases, so I worry if people are just being disappeared just for the sake of populating a particular base. </p>

<p>I was just chatting with someone who said that people disappearing is much less &quot;other worldly&quot;, but rather people are being taken to work in the penitentiary system to work as free labor. Hmm... not sure if I could buy that since then you&#39;d have someone eventually spilling the beans about people being taken against their will to work inside prisons making food, clothing, putting parts together for various electronics &amp; motors, etc. </p>

<p>I was thinking about the huge number of missing person cases in Mexico, albeit it could be due to the drug wars, however, I fear there is an international cabal whose goal is to harvest body organs to sell on the market. Well, just a hunch, but I&#39;ve heard scarier theories. </p>

<p>Thank you, and have a great weekend!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, Daniel. What do you think about the Designated Marksman doctrine? I mean the concept is kinda new. Probably born shortly after the Afghan war in 2002.</p>

<p>The US has had a DMR previously. The M14, which was actually a battle rifle. Although an old design, but it was also proper to serve as an DMR. All you need is add a scope onto it.</p>

<p>The .30 DMR was to operate against targets usually ranging from 200m - 800m. Since the .22 assault rifles were virtualy uneffective at more than 300m distance.</p>

<p>While dedicated sniper rifles were slow single action bolt design. More accurate but slower. They operate at targets at 500m - 2km.</p>

<p>I do believe that there are advanced technology groups here, like the groups that Admiral Byrd ran into during his travels. Those groups may be descended from secret societies that kept an ancient technology in their brotherhoods for centuries. I think there is compelling evidence for this.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the work of Nick Cook and Igor Witkowski are very illuminating on this. There&#39;s no question that the Nazis had achieved things in physics which we were never told about. I think the elimination of the Bell scientists reveals that.

I think that Torsion Physics was involved and that we can&#39;t even imagine what that project would look like 70 years later.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it was faked or not, but that would be an awful big lie to keep up with for several decades, especially the Cold War ones.  People landed on the moon and had to fuck off for some reason and no one has ever gone back on a manned mission vs. nobody went, ever, and no one called NASA out on it.  Which would be the most believable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Well the extent of the coverup and narrative control tactics whenever there is a UFO sighting, landing, abduction or interference with a major military nuclear base is indicative of the reality of something alien from our culture visiting us. A case like the Phoenix Lights where an entire city, including the Governor,  watches technology like nothing on earth float by for hours with thousands of witnesses also will give us some idea of how real all of this is. Years of witness testimony from airline pilots, Presidents, astronauts, astrophysicists, and others really paints a complete picture in my mind. My interview with Jim Marrs on this subject give us some of this: <a href="http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-marrs4.php">http://www.darkjournalist.com/s-marrs4.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get out of town, you haven&#39;t looked closely at it. Matthew Williams and friends have been really open about making crop circles for a long time, and they&#39;ll even show you the blueprints, and he was even prosecuted for it. Even Colin Andrews accepts this reality.

<p>There may be some that are non-human created, but they&#39;re not the big dramatic ones, at least not in the U.K. &quot;The Paracast&quot; hosts acknowledge this, Richard Dolan acknowledges this, U.K. Researcher Rob Buckle acknowledges it, etc. We should be listening to what these &quot;Circlemakers&quot; say, because there&#39;s a lot of juicy paranormal stuff in there. </p>

<p>But Linda Howe is quick to jump to th e most radical-sounding explanation, same with the the cattle mutilation phenomenon. We don&#39;t honestly know what the fuck is going on there. Chris O&#39;Brien has been studying it for decades, and he admits he has very little idea who or what it actually represents. Linda comes off as a profiteer, I&#39;m sorry to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Linda Howe was snookered by Richard Doty and Robert Collins in the mid 1980s. They promised documents and film they never delivered. As a result she was unable to meet her contractual obligations to HBO and lost production financing. Yet she goes to the same group of people, all connected to the same alphabet soup intelligence agency financed UFO and exotic propulsion research group, to continue her so-called investigations. They lied to her. Yet - like George Knapp - she continues to beg them for more disinfo to promulgate. Presumably - like William Moore and Jamie Shandera - to get inside information. </p>

<p>I know who these people are. I expect you do too. But you don&#39;t report on it. </p>

<p>Albert Stubblebine, John B Alexander, Harold Puthoff, Robert Collins, Robert Wood, Howard McConnell, Bill Wilkinson, and a few others. Later, Jacques Vallee. And one might assume international coordination with Claude Poher over at GEFEN. More recently Eric Davis has been working with Puthoff over at Earthtech. I expect he&#39;s Puthoff&#39;s protege. And Edward Mitchell was part of that crowd before he passed. So was Brian O&#39;Leary. </p>

<p>Most of these guys were connected in some way to the Remote Viewing program at SRI. Most of them have Ph.Ds in physics. They all still communicate via a private email list. They do it by CC: so there&#39;s no central mail server. Are you on it? Have you seen it? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some documents you&#39;ve probably never seen:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Dpc9b">http://imgur.com/a/Dpc9b</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re important.</p>

<p>You do know they&#39;ve been lying to reporters and UFO researchers since the early 1980s. And it&#39;s been a coordinated disinformation campaign run straight from US Intelligence. They arranged the bogus MJ-12 documents on film to Shandera. Doty is just a lackey. </p>

<p>A curious question I&#39;ve wondered is: who ran the group before them? There was a group. That is, if you believe Ingo Swann&#39;s account. And I&#39;m inclined to. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve all gone very quiet since 2013. I wonder what&#39;s up. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen you chase Daniel Sheehan&#39;s account of digging through top secret UFO archives in the mid 1970s for Marcia Smith&#39;s Presidential Briefing on UFOs to President Carter. </p>

<p>There are so many good avenues to explore beyond interviewing the same people over and over again. Why don&#39;t you do some reporting?  </p>
