<p>I&#39;m wondering if that sequence at the bottom is referring to the license number of Deacon 10, LLC., </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that it means anything, but I found this pretty interesting. I found a site that has reviews by workers who worked for that <a href="http://www.bbb.org/cleveland/business-reviews/auto-alarms-and-security-systems/premier-protective-services-in-euclid-oh-39001776/">Premier Protective Services</a> company in Cleveland. If you look at the bottom of that BBB site, Premier Protective Services has an alternate name that is, you guessed it, Deacon 10. Anyway, I realize a lot of people who work jobs with shitty wages and long hours tend to be disgruntled, but a couple of <a href="http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Premier-Protective-Services/reviews">these reviews</a> talk about shitty business practices by management about not getting paid on time or constantly screwing with their wages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, who knows? It sure is an interesting plot so far with the alleged shooter&#39;s ties to the FBI as an informant in another terrorism case in Florida, the fact that his father ran for president in Afghanistan, G4S involved, etc. I believe those leads are planted to point towards the middle east so they can push the ISIS/terrorism agenda. In addition to terrorism, the MSM is also pushing the &quot;lone wolf&quot; and LGBT agenda so hard with this, yet there are numerous &quot;eye witness&quot; accounts of people who were allegedly in the club who heard multiple shooters. Then you have the account of people holding the doors closed so people couldn&#39;t get out... They try to make this look like a terrorist hate crime claiming alleged shooter was anti-gay and shot up the club in disgust after seeing two men kiss, yet he was also allegedly a regular of the club who had a profile on a gay dating website. It just doesn&#39;t add up. There are so many conflicting reports that it&#39;s hard to know what to believe. And honestly, I believe that&#39;s the whole point. Create as much confusion as possible with misinformation and keep pushing the agendas forward with the narrative.</p>

<p>EDIT: So if I&#39;m understanding correctly the connection is that this &#39;Deacon 10&#39; security corporation posted an ad in Dallas, TX shortly before the Curtis Curwell attack which was allegedly linked to ISIS, then also placed the same ad in Orlando shortly before the attack there this week?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start with the conclusion, then provide evidence. Finally map out next steps and a time line of events.</p>

<p>I present to multi-millionaire investors all the time on commercial real estate deals. They need to understand your thesis before anything else. If you lead with evidence, they don&#39;t know what the evidence relates to and, even worse, may draw different conclusions before you even present your conclusion.</p>

<p>For you it would be something like this: &quot;I believe that Neil Alexander and Deacon 10 out of Euclid, OH may be involved in staging real or simulated shooting events to further an unknown agenda... Possibly to support gun control or an expansion of US Military activities in the MidEast. Two events I believe he may be involved in are the Draw Mohamed shooting in Garland, Tx and the Orlando Gay Nightclub shooting. Neil is president of DeaCon 10 and has relationships with other defense contractors. His firm place suspicious Craigslist ads for a large group of temp security contractors several days before each event. Additional evidence is x, y, and z. I am also investigating leads a,b,c and would like the communities help.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fairness, you do not work in security so your views on what makes sense or not is irrelevant. There are plenty of events that may require a large security staff. They may have hit a snag with their normal vendor and are working out a last second contingency. This is something we always do before we fire a vendor. If you don&#39;t have an out, you have no business getting into a hard nosed negotiation. But that reality doesn&#39;t stop a bunch of dumb duckies from negotiating themselves into a corner. </p>

<p>I provided some help to you in another post on how to make your case clearer and lay everything out in a logical fashion. Using that process lends credibility to you as a rational person and allows the community to start to help you investigate. </p>

<p>I need to see a little more before I am confident that we are onto something, but there are certainly a few interesting coincidences that bear thorough investigation. If the defense or intelligence industries were going to set up a false flag, then it plausible that they would use someone like Neal and set it up this way. </p>

This is huge, even if this might not seem impressive at a surface level I&#39;m reaching out to people and ill be cooperating to investigate this lead, currently I&#39;m talking to someone and we&#39;re discussing getting a subpoena for craigslist to tell the complete truth and in a way we can verify.</p>

<p>But yeah I can&#39;t say how excited I am, just think about it, we will very likely start working on getting a subpoena for craigslist in a secure way and find out who&#39;s behind it, and THEN the ball will roll because this could not be approved without him.</p>

<p>This is huge yes, Because I&#39;ve been so involved I might be a bit too excited but if you&#39;d know me you&#39;d understand, this is the actual one lead I hope gets opened, this will bring Obama down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, back up a second and think about this logically.  Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a powerful shadow government type that wants to stage a false flag event.  When you are high up on a three letter agency, or have a friend or partner that is high up in a three letter agency, it&#39;s assumed you get to use some of the agency &#39;s funds to conduct this operation, and this is how you pay for the 75 security guards.  </p>

<p>But think for a second what you&#39;re doing.  The more people you bring into the conspiracy, the more cogs it has, and that means more chances that something goes wrong or important info gets leaked.  So with that in mind, if you need people to fulfill a role in an operation like this YOU DONT GO TO CRAIGSLIST!!!!  You use people within the agency that are aligned with your agenda!!! Out of 75 people at least one will have a guilty conscience and leak some truly damaging evidence.  And I&#39;m not talking circumstantial evidence either, I mean names dates pictures etc.  real proof.  Even if they were paid a million dollars each, someone will say something.  O mean, 50 people were killed!  That has to weigh heavily on someone knowing they had a hand in it.  So why use John Q. Public when you have trained talent already on the payroll?  It would even be cheaper than paying for someone&#39;s silence.  It just doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>With that being said, I still like what you&#39;re doing.  You seem like you&#39;re pretty good at investigation, and we need more like you.  You&#39;re also very passionate about your work, and that&#39;s good.  And I&#39;m in the rabbit hole with you, and I know that when you&#39;re in deep it&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees sometimes.  But sometimes we all need to take a step back and look at the big picture.  </p>

<p>Keep up the good work.  I could be wrong on my thinking about how this would all work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re just hopped up on adderall or something, but you really need to calm down and take half a step back and think about the shit you say. You&#39;re literally claiming smoking gun over coincidences. That&#39;s called circumstantial and is not a smoking gun. Hell, there was more of a smoking gun to go after Hillary on Benghazi. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, but it&#39;s very easy to discredit you based off of your over eagerness and incoherent rambling. Take a deep breath and type coherently and with formatting. Multiple people have tried to tell you, and you basically called them stupid for not understanding what the hell you&#39;re rambling about. Not everyone has tech experience. Break it down simply and coherently if you want to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Edit: and why would you think that a super secret shady false flag wouldn&#39;t have its own crisis actors? Why would they need to post on craigslist? Surely they know in house &quot;secure&quot; people? Unless they needed a crowd. Just things to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight after reading the posts here.</p>

<p>Deacon 10 is associated with Texas, a confederate state and Florida another confederate state and both LARGELY Republican, yet, OP has linked this false flag to Obama, someone who has made it clear both in words and in actions that he is ALL for the UNION. Even forced the world against the confederate flag.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense, everyone knows that in the Mafia, you are not allowed to go to another Mafioso&#39;s land and do as you please. </p>

<p>Questions</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If this was a false flag hoax or whatever people keep trying to make it out to be, why would southern cops, swat and organizations be on the side of Obama? Texans hate Obama as well as Florida. As the video shows, the cops took forever, when there was a Dunkin Donuts right next to the club, this is not to stereotype either, lots of people who work at night go to donut shops for coffee and food. So why were there no cops at the Dunkin Donuts and why did they take so long.</p></li>
<li><p>If this was a false flag by the Democrats, why would the perpetrator be a Muslim? Why not a white guy? So that everyone would be like &quot;crazy white people&quot;. Why would they set up a false flag with a Muslim? It would literally be playing into the hands of Trump from his <strong>Ban all Muslims ideology</strong>. You could say because white people wouldn&#39;t follow democrats <strong>but then you&#39;d have to say the same thing for the cops/swat caught on video dropping victims back off to the club.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Gun stocks soared after this event, doesn&#39;t that seem a bit odd to anyone? The only people that benefit from this false flag are confederate states where guns and ammo are literally stockpiled in every house. It&#39;s no secret, it&#39;s common. I&#39;ve got two white friends down south that swear by their guns and go hunting on the weekends. Majority of the south are military trained, again no secret either.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying this for a while, a civil war is brewing, and it&#39;s obvious that this was from the confederate states. Who are known for false flags as we saw Texas Republican President G. W. Bush Bomb New York City on 9/11. Nothing has changed. This is a false flag indeed but the only people it effects negatively are Muslims just like in 2001 and benefits anyone who hates Muslims and loves guns highly (south). </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but there is no reason why Obama would do this. There would literally be no way he could, he&#39;d have to get the entire confederate police department of Florida on his side and since there is no way in GD hell that can happen, it only leaves one side left holding the bag. The devil doesn&#39;t have a race but he can damn sure use race to trick the minds of the people.</p>

<p>Wake up, it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think you&#39;re getting too caught up in the left/right paradigm, which is exactly what &quot;they&quot; want. The southern states don&#39;t benefit from increased gun sales, the gun manufacturers do. Obama is just a puppet like all the others and is doing his part in an attempt to push through stricter gun laws while simultaneously adding fuel to the fire with the Islamic terrorist fear mongering as well as garnering sympathy for the LGBTQ community. Obama is no different than G-dub. Same brand, different flavor.  </p>

<p>They <em>all</em> want us divided (on gun laws, gay rights, race, hot topic of the day, etc.) so it&#39;s easier for them to rule us. The more we argue and fight with each other, the less we look at what&#39;s really happening behind the scenes and the more they get away with. Divide and conquer. That&#39;s the strategy and it&#39;s been working for centuries. It&#39;s the only way they&#39;d ever be able to take the all the guns away. Get us to turn on each other by any means necessary and then bring in the UN &quot;peacekeepers&quot; to finish the job. Neither side really cares about any of these issues. They care about power and about ruling the rest of us.</p>

<p>This is a fallacy, everything in the media and main narrative tells us that a civil war is coming. I don&#39;t understand how you would try and throw out a large part of conspiracy when it&#39;s apparent that such is happening. It would be foolish to do so.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense, so while devising an evil plan in order to take over America, the objective was to implicate Muslims, something that a lot of white conspiracy theorist demonize Obama for, into a false flag that would have white Americans up in arms. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it, one minute Obama is some evil genius and the next minute he&#39;s a idiot. I&#39;m not understanding the narrative here. I will admit that the gay vote was pretty much guaranteed for the Democrats already because they helped push <strong>LEGALIZING</strong> gay marriage. Therefore, why would Obama go and <strong>UNDUE</strong> his own work by having a Muslim shoot up a gay club.</p>

<p>Again, that doesn&#39;t make sense, the only people that would help would be Republicans who are against Muslims and gays. Why would Obama help Republicans?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama is no different than G-dub. Same brand, different flavor. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true, Obama didn&#39;t commit genocide against Americans on 9/11 nor did he fly over to the middle east and kill 3 million Muslims. <strong>That was led by a White, European, Zionist, from the south.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They all want us divided (on gun laws, gay rights, race, hot topic of the day, etc.) so it&#39;s easier for them to rule us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true to the extent that there is indeed a information war going on not just here in America but across the entire world. There would be no divide if there wasn&#39;t two sides. If there was no opposition for the most powerful and richest people on the planet who control all the armies across the world. America would be in flames already. So WHY? Why has it not happened yet? Because there is a dam that is slowly but surely breaking.</p>

<p>You gotta wake up, the idea that there are not two sides is bullshit created by evil Zionist in order to make you think there is no sides. <strong>If there are no sides then why has the majority of conspiracy picked one?</strong></p>

<p>Miss me with the BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically for such a large scale event like they did in the past they need &quot;crisis actors&quot; people who can fake stuff or run around etc, we know they had those on the scene just from the guy pointing out how they walked towards the club(lol)</p>

<p>So it does make sense if they themselves think it&#39;s some exercise, my guess? I don&#39;t want to make harsh assumptions but maybe those people were there just to be around the building to already shut the area off before people came to look, that&#39;s my best case scenario, but with the people who found the connections to these companies this will prove very interesting, just help where you can, as questions to me or anyone else if you want, we&#39;re fighting this one together, the faster the better.</p>
