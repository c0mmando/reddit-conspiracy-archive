I&#39;m not following this anywhere near as closely as some others, so feel more than free to chime in with thoughts.  I&#39;m of coursed not saying that this is &quot;the&quot; theory of what happened, but - again - it does seem to make at least some sense to me.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://gawker.com/multiple-people-say-the-orlando-shooter-was-gay-1781932976">this</a> article in an OP in this sub, this is what I posted as a response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems like a situation where a Muslim guy was gay, but - because of his upbringing, religion, because of society in general, etc - he absolutely hated being gay; a totally self-hating gay man who was trying his hardest to not be gay...and ultimately A) he got to the point that he just hated himself so much for being gay that he ended up hating gay people as much as he hated himself for being what they were/he was. In addition to all this, B) somehow the FBI got a hold of his ass (not literally - he probably wouldn&#39;t have liked an FBI man holding his ass while he was still in the closet), and they subtly (or not so subtly) &quot;radicalized&quot; him.</p>

<p>Seems like he might have been just another pawn in the West&#39;s continued attempts to A) take away guns/undermine the 2nd Amendment (&quot;OMG we have to do something to protect the citizens against all these crazies with guns! Uncle Sam will help the citizens!&quot;), and B) continue to villanize Islam so as to add more propaganda fuel in the West&#39;s attempts to take over the middle East.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection">projected</a> propaganda, the target is not the Second Amendment, it&#39;s the First.</p>

<p>While Republicans are frothing at the mouth over an attack on the Second Amendment from the Democrats, they are themselves attacking the First Amendment by wanting restrictions placed on Muslims. By placing restrictions on Muslims, you conveniently also create a precedent to put restrictions on the <em>rest</em> of the things in the First Amendment. That&#39;s the sort of thing that gives Alphabet Agencies a hard-on.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that while people are obsessing over what might possibly maybe happen to the Second Amendment, they don&#39;t seem to care that the Fifth Amendment has been increasingly bent and ignored over the last 15+ years.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone else has talked about this issue, but this is besides the point of this particular OP, as this topic never even crossed my mind actually.</p>

<p>That being said, what kind of &quot;gun legislation&quot; are you suggesting?  The second amendment should by absolutely no means whatsoever be undermined.  You want TPTB in America to have even more power than they already do?  Allow them to activate this &quot;gun legislation&quot; you talk about.</p>
