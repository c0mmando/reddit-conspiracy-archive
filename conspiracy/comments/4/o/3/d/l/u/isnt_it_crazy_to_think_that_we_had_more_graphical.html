       Where is the 911 call the killer allegedly made?! I have been to the club Pulse, I live in Orlando, and that is a legit club... That being said, there are cameras there and in the areas surrounding. I am not really familiar with conspiracy theories from history... Although I have heard of some. But THIS has caught my attention, I don't know whether it is true or fabricated, but I do know that I have seen enough discrepancies  regarding the "attack" in Orlando that I am sure thinking HMMM....

       The pattern of no video or photographic evidence of the shootings in progress is obvious. Brussels, France, Orlando...where is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a pattern of the imagery that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       available of having the solid look of contrived fakery and theatrics.  It's getting ridiculous...they are actually trying too hard now to push the anti-Muslim propaganda. Their desperation is starting to show as plain as day. There is just way to much that doesn't make sense and doesn't look or feel right.

       Honest question here. If they released the audio would you believe that it was actually him making the call? None of us here know what his voice sounds like. I suspect that releasing the call wouldn't really do anything but stir up more questions that can't be satisfactorily answered.

       I don't think the whole thing is a hoax, perhaps a staged incident however. I believe people did die, but I feel it wasn't a random act, or a hate crime, or terrorist attack... Maybe an attack on the US citizens by their own government to brain wash...? Hell if I really know.

       Live in Orlando. Know friends/family that had friends/family that were there that night. Some of them that were shot, some killed.

      <p>
       This is a real event.
      </p>

       Do I believe there was government involvement? Hard to say.
Did the government make a mistake by not continuing their investigation of the shooter? Hell yes.

       There is so little information as of yet and numerous conflicting eyewitness reports it's going to be awhile before we have enough information to make credible theories.

       Thank you for having some sense. Everyone here is ready to write off the entire event because of some "crisis actors" but fail to acknowledge the fact that real people died and real people that knew them are currently mourning. How can they explain that?

       I'm sorry for his loss. But your report of him telling his personal account is not going to satisfy anyone (it's double-hearsay). It shouldn't even be taken by you as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are wary of our media and government.  So much of the past reporting (and investigation) on events very similar to this have been thoroughly called into question.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just want to see more evidence. No one (really) wants to say that this whole thing was staged and fake, but it's cathartic to get upset and proclaim this given how duped we feel over past events. So, please understand we don't mean to offend anyone.  However, we will not believe anything without more proof, in addition to adequate explanations for the inconsistencies and anomalies thus far.

       I have a theory, it's crazy I know, but I think some elite forces scooped in for a specific target, still trying to find his name but I know there was one but the article vanished so gonna dig through names further, and that they also did some collateral damage on the way, I'll get back to you

       I've detailled it before but basically it hit me after Paris, first he got shot and then suddenly stabbed, for some reason the man runs in the house and again they wait hours (this was done by RAID more on that later) and when they went in "killed" him and the boy was unharmed
      </p>
      <p>
       But now for the twist to the story, I had the stuff he put online send to me through a few sources, the woman was laying there dead, but what's eve more interesting, her baby lay there on the floor and did not move face down, means their claims on that are absolutely false. I 'll not post it unless people want because it's gore but it's censored, I compared the uncensored with official released pictures and it's a match
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look Duterte, his 'hostages' killed by ISIS gonna invoke martial law, US  has "IS" attacks everywhere, same for Paris, this all leads to martial law why mossad and probably a whole lot of other operators are assassinating their targets, that's what I'm compiling a document on, all strange cases and victims know
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clarify, strange cases are disturbingly common, just now read story of a man, saw his entire family killed got charged with making a false statement, where they got killed is close to what I suppose their lawfirm, and they fight the government on their bullshit laws etc, so, then you have 'fake hosage' stuations coming from everywhere, people call in a hostage situation, SWAT arrives 'Oh nothing here" and it's done, you know....?
      </p>
      <p>
       I's stiff like that and much more but its lke they play it down all the time, I'll be going back a math to find out everything

       With his fathers alleged ties overseas it wouldn't be crazy to think they possibly just used him as a scapegoat, and he didn't die in the event, escaped the club and is now long gone to the Middle East never to be heard from again... No one is the wiser. I know it's just speculation, and guessing but it's definitely a possibility.

       This is how i got involved in the 9/11 truth movement. The irony is at first i was completely for the attacks on afghanistan and iraq, it wasn't till things like loose change came out that i was like 'lets look at this subjectively' and a lot of it made sense. .. so i started looking into other things. Don't look into 1215.org, dont look into the income tax or federal reserve, dont look into false flag terror as a way to control the heard, just acquiesce those rights.  The big point is that this shit is real but so depressing that its almost a question of .. do you want to know to which level of slavery you really are bound by, and the realization that its an ideology problem.

       Do you know anything about the event taking place that night? I read it happens every week, so I don't know how you could fake something this massive there.
      </p>

       It seems like regular club goers would know if they weren't aloud to be there this past Saturday.
      </p>

       I've driven past that intersection before, though I honestly remember the dunkin' donuts more so than the club. I've been to some of the other clubs downtown though.

       What happens every week? 50 ppl dead + injured in a "hate crime" no wait "a terrorist attack?" Yes there have been a rise in shootings in different clubs in the area (central Florida), are those world news? Granted there aren't  the amount of casualties as in this incident, however there have been numbers... Not just "one dead in club shooting." But those headlines sure don't get the coverage this has. I do believe people were really killed and injured, maybe not as many as they are saying, perhaps real people with a mix of fake? I do think this really happened, however I think there is wayyyy more to it than an average American is willing to wrap their head around. Do people honestly trust and believe our government soooooo much that they they are not capable of creating something like this? The media only tell us what they and the government WANT us to know, as needed basis. I'm not saying what I believe has happened or believe, I'm not even sure at this point. I DO know that there are many discrepancies and many flags have been raised in my opinion.

       Ah, ok... It may have been Latin night, it's typical for clubs to have different things, events going on depending on the night of the week. I will have to find out what Saturday night is... Just my opinion from my experience... Typically Latin nights are not on a weekend night, because those are popular nights for people to go out to places like that and they don't want to deter those who may not be interested in Latin night from coming on a high money making night of the week... And also i wouldn't think they would have a Latin night on a Saturday night during gay days at that. But again that is just my opinion and it really doesn't mean much. I'm too lazy to go look it up right now, I apologize. Lol

       I didnt mean it like that at all. To be honest i think this shooting was real and really could care less about cell phone footage because the degree of suspiciousness is not that high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it is a little but at the same time i can understand why there wouldnt be alot, i know i wouldnt be filming, id be running for my fucking life or playing dead or maybe trying to fight back.
      </p>
      <p>
       So cell phone isnt really an issue with me i was more or less commenting on the cctv footage of the club. The police may have most of the cctv footage of the surrounding areas. As to whats on the tapes, we hopefully will find out.

       Daily violence happens and people in stressful, life threatening situations think to whip out their phones and record... Hell I just saw an incident on the news of a potential situation that arose on a plane flight and they called in 2 fighter jets to escort the plane to landing and cell phone footage of the whole thing including the FAA or TSA or FBI, whoever the powers may be storming the plane upon landing to arrest the suspect. That cell phone footage was released and aired on the news within hours of the incident.... Not weeks. 
The way that pulse is set up (been there several times and live in Orlando) there are different rooms that are separate from each other with different themes. It is not unreasonable to question why if the shooter was on the opposite side of the club in an entirely different room from a group of hostages why was no one documenting ANYTHING?! The shooter would not be able to see or hear someone on a phone call or snapchat or recording in this instance so there shouldn't have been as much fear for someone that was within ear shot of him. I see that now a few weeks have gone by and slowly some cell phone footage and what not is being released... Huh. Plenty of time for someone to create, and or misconstrue and edit these things so the public only sees enough to keep the sheep following the herd.
There is just so much surrounding the Pulse tragedy that doesn't add up. And I am by no means a conspiracy theorist. I have never questioned things of this nature being what they appeared to be. (9-11, Sandy Hook etc.)But THIS... there is a lot more to it, probably a lot more than an average American citizen is willing to believe and wrap their head around. 
And the chances of us ever REALLY knowing what happened or if it was indeed a false flag of some sort are slim to none. So I go on, keep my thoughts about it to myself... I'm not running around central Florida sharing my theories about it, REAL people DID die, that's a fact bottom line a tragedy did occur. But who or what was really behind it and orchestrated it?! Who knows... I sure know that I'm going to be more aware and educated about events in our world playing out that are suspicious though. Sorry for the rant... Like I said I don't talk to others about these things for respect of the event and those lost here and Orlando, so I come here to share thoughts.

       I really don't see the point you're trying to make or why you are even commenting on this at all. The government or whatever you people on this sub think is behind these attacks would have no reason to stage these events in order to sway opinions on gun control. If they wanted to take American's guns away, they would just do it. Why would they wait for public outcry about keeping us safe and taking away guns but not wait for public outcry about keeping us safe and taking away digital privacy? There is no such thing as crisis actors, a fake shooting is impossible to get away with in an age of everyone having a camera in their pocket and every other piece of "evidence" you can muster up to support this and any other retarded theory is merely a product of your own personal feelings and desire to make sense of a chaotic world where you secretly want there to be an all-knowing, all-powerful secret society running everything because that would mean there is some form of order in the chaos despite how evil they may be and that is oddly comforting to people like you. You think you've got it figured out and you've got the inside information that all the "sheep" don't and that makes you feel smarter or better than everyone else. Hell, even using the word sheep is solid proof that your egos are doing the talking on this sub rather than common fucking sense.

       If you think you're about to die, do you honestly think you'd pull your phone out and record things? And don't give me a bullshit answer like "Why yes of course I would! I need to show the people!" No. When a gun is pointing in your direction, you don't pull out your phone and reciprocate the gesture. Those people were afraid and were too concerned with finding a way to survive.

       I think that in this day and age of social media that even in that situation of the shooter was across the building in another room it is not unreasonable to question why no one went live on Facebook about it, or sent out snapchats to loved ones or face timed someone... To say their goodbyes just in case if nothing else. And what about his cell phone? Is that in evidence? I'm not saying that it isn't possible that no one has a recording of some type but it's just hard to believe, without there being more to it...

       The lobbyists and crooks involved in the Sandy Hook shooting made it illegal (in their state only I think) to release photos/videos "to protect the victims' families". The precedent is set. Better use the restroom before we depart because this ignorance train has no more stops.

       Truth is being manufactured at a high rate. There are few checks and balances remaining for the public to ensure that what they are being fed is even remotely accurate. This needs to be reversed.

Now, it's just people mourning then off to the next news event. They should show the actual attacks so no one can call it fake or take away from its ruthlessness if it is real...

       unfortunately not fake. Take this for what you will, as this is the internet, but a friend of a friend was killed during the attack. That being said, I still think the whole thing was fishy

       well I'm definitely still going to "bring that." You're right that I did not know them personally, but I've known the friend of this person since birth and can attest to his integrity. Seems like a weird thing for me to lie about (and then try to lie about more with this comment).

       I do believe that the Orlando shooting was real, but just for journalistic integrity, is there anyway to confirm it.. Or you could possibly talk with the victims family within good time of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nwoslave has a point when it comes to people lying especially if there is money involved i.e gofundme pages, memorial charities etc. We even know that some of the Sandy Hook victims memorial pages were cached and timestamped days before the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that this Orlando event is fake or anything. Atleast as far as i can tell. All options must be left on the table.

       Think about who would have to be involved in this grand scheme, if it were all fake. Orlando police (and no, not a few of them. the majority of them), hospital staff, EMS crews, multiple government agencies both local and federal, etc. These people are dead, dude. Does that mean a crazed radicalized Muslim did it? Eh, maybe and maybe not. There's definitely an agenda to be pushed. But the chances of hundreds (maybe thousands) of people being in on this huge conspiracy are pretty slim.
