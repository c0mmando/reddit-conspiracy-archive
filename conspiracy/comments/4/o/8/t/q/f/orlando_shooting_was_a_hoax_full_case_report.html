        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, I am still open to the possibility this was a false flag, however no one has pointed to even a single piece of substantial evidence that anyone died or got hurt and the only even potentially compelling evidence presented towards such a possibility has been people coming on this sub saying they have a friend who has a friend who died. I do not consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4o3dlu/isnt_it_crazy_to_think_that_we_had_more_graphical/d49m4ui">vague stories about people who are 2nd or 3rd degree connections</a> sufficient evidence and I suggest you hold yourself to a higher stand than that as well.</p>

<p>Without cctv footage, photos or video of the event surfacing of which there should be an ample amount in any real scenario there is no way to prove anything really happened. However, it is not enough just to hold the false flag theorists and orthodox backers to presenting their proof, the hoax theory must present proof of its own, and as in the case with any correct theory there is a wealth of proof out there that this was a hoax. Far more than I can even present in this post.</p>

<p>Let us consider three pieces of evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owJdEsMBVHQ">A</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0yN_qM_ZeM">B</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wQS_B5FXTQ">C</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A</strong> is an official news clip of what is supposedly people who were in the club that night carrying &quot;victims&quot; with gunshot wounds to safety. Now there are so many things about this clip which are off and are a dead giveaway that this was a staged photo-op, but one in particular stands out which is that these people were carrying the &quot;victims&quot; <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1465787974056.webm">back towards the club</a>. Now I&#39;m sure somebody will devise some rationalization as to why this was the case, but for those who hold their media to reflect any notion of reality this should be the nail in the coffin that this is indeed a staged clip. However, if you are still on the fence, please take a look at what happened in the pre-edited version where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IV9wuXID0">camera kept rolling</a>. Yes, that&#39;s right, you just saw them drop the man who was &quot;shot in his leg&quot; and the &quot;victim&quot; who apparently could stand with easy this whole time proceeded to playfully push another man away. I close my case with <strong>A</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>B</strong> is an official news clip of an interview with what is purported to be a mother who just found out her son died in the shooting. This woman had been featured in previous news clips as the woman who could not find her son, in these clips she appears to be distraught and upset (example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiBxr94XINg">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URi2M5UXdTY">2</a>). The sudden change of mood and &quot;24 hour emotional resolution&quot; that is seen in comparing these three clips is completely unrealistic. For those making the argument that we cannot demand a certain emotional reaction from an individual upon hearing of their son&#39;s death, that argument may hold some weight in the case of a particularly stoic personality, but here we see that she is not stoic or one to put an optimistic spin on everything. She did a 180 degree flip in personality, and that flip doesn&#39;t make emotional sense within the persona she initially presented. It is as if you are looking at two completely different women, and there is no continuity presented other than her strange statement that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have incredibly sad moments...but when you want to know about that love, the love is going to usurp the hate.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps there are those out there who are able to whitewash all their emotions with a gushy positive feeling, however for those of us who still maintain a shred of humanity this should be easily recognizable as an unrealistically short mourning and grieving phase for a woman who supposedly just lost her son. People who actually lose children often have trouble expressing such positive sentiments about their loss even decades later, however this woman was able to fully resolve away all those pesky emotions of loss and void by dinner time. I close my case with <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong> is an news clip of an interview with someone who was supposedly in the club during the shooting. By this point, you have almost definitely made up your mind one way or the other and this evidence is likely to do little to shift your view, however I am presenting it as demonstration of how thoroughly fake this event everywhere you look. The first thing this person says which is very suspicious which has been repeated in many other interviews and media narratives is that people thought the initial gunshots were part of the song over the house sound system. He says specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At first it sounded like it was part of the show...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absurd for several reasons, first of all it completely discounts the ability of human beings to assess the directional sources of the sounds they hear and more importantly it discounts the fact that an AR-15 would be much louder than any club sound system. An AR-15 is known as one of the loudest guns and would create a sound between 120 and 140 decibels which is at least 10 decibels louder than even the loudest a club speaker system could be (100-110 db) without causing permanent hearing damage to everyone who attends (sound at 120db causes permanent hearing damage within 7 minutes). For those who are unaware of the decibel scale, every three decibels is perceived as approximately twice as loud. This means that the gun shots from the shooters AR-15 would be perceived at least 4 times louder than the loudest sounds in the speaker system and likely more like 10 times louder. This is why in real scenarios where a gunshot goes off in a club (example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7Zh6-mXhU">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8DcRdJFvr0">2</a>) everyone immediately knows something is wrong and reacts appropriately in fear. There are many other things about this interview which are a dead giveaway he is lying and acting however for the sake of brevity I will close my case with <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and consideration of the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the big tells for a green screen (well, two) is the &quot;aliasing&quot; around the edges of the subject in front of the screen. The other major tell is lighting. A well organized crew (of videographers) will take the time to set up the green screen lighting so that it is difficult to tell the difference between the subject and the overlay (underlay? whatever the background image is). If the crew is lazy and/or the shoot is rushed, the lighting might be able to be fixed in post, but sometimes this doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Sandy Hook work is any indication the news media is actually pretty lazy about fluff/filler clips. For example, there are people shown walking into a wall, etc. This sort of thing is poor journalism, I think, and <em>not</em> an indication of an ulterior motive (conspiracy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m faaaar from an expert, but I have a little experience with green screens.  I used to make videos with my friends back in the day and put them on myspace.  So your green screen doesn&#39;t need to be green, it just works well because who the hell uses that shade of green on any clothing.  It&#39;s a very easy color to pick that is going to produce a huge contrast with everything in the foreground.  Then when you record it, if you&#39;ve lit everything correctly, you&#39;ll have no shadows behind you on the green screen.  Shadows from the lighting they use are what you see when you can really notice the green screen effect.  After recording, you edit the footage with a program that allows chroma key compositing.  This is placing another image (or video) on top of that particular shade of green.  That&#39;s why you want to eliminate the shadows and get your lighting as even as possible on your green screen.  Changes in contrast of the color aren&#39;t picked up by the computer and it won&#39;t place the image over the screen correctly.</p>

<p>Now, all that being said, this video doesn&#39;t look like it was in front of a green screen based off of that effect.  The lighting does look weird, but the sun is going down and they have lights on the cameras and can even set up lights next to them.</p>

<p>Edit:  I take back what I said.  That was only about the first interview.  I paused it and skimmed over the video preview and thought that was the only interview.  I take back saying it wasn&#39;t green screen because who uses lighting in broad daylight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say, purely for the sake of being Devil&#39;s advocate, that lighting in the day time is sometimes used. If it is a clear day then the direct sunlight produces dark shadows on the face. Now, I&#39;m a photographer, not a videographer, and I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be a green screen. Just saying that lighting during the day isn&#39;t unheard of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for explaining this. I&#39;ve noticed a lot of the interviews look they have inconsistent lighting with the background and also the wind in the background seems to have absolutely no effect on the people in the interview. This is something that needs closer study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in the business... those interviews were not done on green screen. Almost certainly under a tent, with at least two lights.

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of looks like it at first but if notice in some of the shots it&#39;s raining and they are clearly under a tent of some sort which distorts the natural lighting. Also in those interviews they have artificial lighting all around which causes it to look almost like a green screen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still though, considering they had to use a robot to search the area until well into the following morning (it was broad daylight in all the robot footage) then it seems like bad planning to setup your ambulances right in front of a building that could have contained some kind of explosive. In any bomb threat situation (not even involving an active shooter) law enforcement typically won&#39;t let people anywhere near the location being threatened. Let alone bring wounded back towards said location.</p>

<p>This just seems amiss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Victims families always get to me. My father was murdered when I was five, my mom raised 3 kids on her own and became tough as nails. 11 years later my brother died suddenly in a car accident. </p>

<p>1 hour after, 12 hours after, 3 days after, 7 days after... It didn&#39;t matter if you talked to my mom about my brother she would break down and cry everytime. Even I as the tough older brother had the exact same reaction. A week later at the funeral even tho I didn&#39;t have to speak I couldn&#39;t contain myself crying like a little girl. </p>

<p>Now when I see all these famlies get on TV such as in Sandy hook and show no emotion I know it&#39;s horse shit. It&#39;s literally just not possible, and I consider our family tougher than average. </p>

<p>I have no clue if this is staged or not but victims families imo are always the biggest flags. </p>

Laughing, smiling kids after their mother was shot to death in Charleston. It&#39;s incredibly bizarre behavior, and something I now look for every time something like this happens. Most people have suffered personal tragedy, losing friends and family members in sudden, tragic ways, or even expected deaths (cancer, old age) where you know it&#39;s coming. No one I know would be behaving like this after their loved one was shot to death. It&#39;s so weird and unsettling...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my brother wasn&#39;t the only one dead in the car. So among three families and several dozen friends the reaction was identical. Breaking down constantly. Trying to talk about the little things is the worst. </p>

<p>When I see family after family speak easy about someone just brutally murdered I know it&#39;s not possible. Especially when it was one after another, not one single family member distraught. It does not happen. And if it was just one exception I could totally get that, one guy who&#39;s just tough as nails toughs if out. But one after the other? Women especially? NOT POSSIBLE. </p>

<p>Try and take away from my message all you want by claiming i couldn&#39;t possibly know how someone else could react, but the fact of the matter is I do know. Sudden death of immediate family kills you. And I&#39;ve watched multiple mothers lose their children and it&#39;s horrific and they&#39;re distraught for months. Even the concept of getting on TV would very preposterous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that you knew this person and that his family is saying he is dead. This seems to be consistent with these events that the victims had real identities and their communities believe them to be deceased.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s having a wake with an open casket then I&#39;ll take you word for it and I&#39;ll know that he really did die. However, and I know it sounds warped, without something like that I&#39;d still be suspect that he faked his death and his family was in on it.</p>

<p>It sounds unbelievable, but others have definitely done this as part of these hoaxes. What I don&#39;t know for sure is if every supposed victim of the hoax is doing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re reaching if you believe that many people could fake their deaths and have it go anywhere near according to plan. The narrative of them actually being killed, whether it be by someone who was trained by the CIA/FBI, or just by some terrorist nutjob is a lot more plausible.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t be attending his wake, but I can find out if it was open casket or not after the fact.</p>

<p>I do know people who will be attending his wake that knew him better than I did from out here in California.</p>

<p>I understand the narrative that this might be a false flag, since it&#39;s just as easy to create scenarios where there&#39;s an over reaching axis of evil pulling the strings as it is to create a scenario where bad things happen to good people in the world, and that&#39;s life.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the total hoax theory at all, for a lot of reasons. I think that&#39;s very paranoid and borderline delusional thinking at best, and flat out tin foil hat bullshit at worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I don&#39;t find the false flag theory to be plausible is because if these people were really being killed you would see family members active in the public sphere pushing for an investigation as to what really happened and going against the official narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of curiosity how old were you when 9/11 happened?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember family members pushing for an investigation a week after it happened, I actually don&#39;t remember family members asking for an investigation for at least a few months, if not longer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 34 years old, I was born in 1982.</p>

<p>Most of these people are not even buried yet, this falls into the same line as &quot;why are people smiling and laughing during interviews?&quot; I can tell you from experience that Acute Anxiety has varying effects on people, and media manipulation only helps to push someone who&#39;s already mentally distraught into behaving in ways you wouldn&#39;t suspect.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said in my previous posts, I encourage people to keep an openly subjective mind and use their critical thinking skills here instead of just jumping the shark with crack pot theories they create in their own minds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen so many junk theories up voted on here that are literally someone creating a scenario that never happened, or running with completely ignorant and baseless information, and running with it that it&#39;s kind of sick.</p>

<p>As a Combat Medic who served in the Army I&#39;ve got a unique level of experience that lets me look at certain things differently because of that experience. In instances like this shooting it&#39;s kind of a curse because the amount of stupid from some people hurts.</p>

<p>For most of the hoax theories I&#39;ve seen, there are much more plausible explanations available - and I don&#39;t understand the mentality of jumping straight for the most outlandish scenario possible when there are so many more plausible scenarios in between.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t remember anyone from the family members of the Twin Towers demanding investigations less than a week after the collapse, I don&#39;t even remember them demanding investigations until months after it all happened.</p>

<p>A lack of evidence isn&#39;t proof of a hoax, the police are not obligated to show you pictures of dead bodies to calm your own mind, I&#39;ve even see people ask why there weren&#39;t people posting pictures of the attack on Facebook - like that&#39;s somehow something a person who would do in the middle of a mass shooting?</p>

<p>Some of these thought processes just confuse me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I&#39;m saying &quot;nobody has pushed for an investigation&quot; I am referring to these other mass shootings. It&#39;s been years since Tucson, Aurora and Sandy Hook and hasn&#39;t been a peep from anyone connected to the event about a serious challenge to the official narrative. </p>

<p>What you do see is occasional things flirted out there like James Holmes&#39; alleged neighbor saying he was set up, but kind of thing is where it ends.</p>

<p>I think the difference in our thought processes results in a different understandings of how the media-government complex operates. It has become apparent to me that the media is nothing more than a propaganda wing of the government, and I don&#39;t mean just government that is visible, I mean also the government that goes unseen, which as an ex-vet you should be somewhat familiar with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on the media, you can watch the shift in agendas from Bush Jr. to Obama, they follow the narrative of the administration.</p>

<p>Perhaps Tucson, Aurora, and Sandy Hook weren&#39;t pressed for more evidence because the family members of the victims are positive that these people were killed in the way described and just wanted to move on.</p>

<p>The argument that &quot;there is no photographic proof of a dead body&quot; doesn&#39;t suddenly nullify that it happened. Odd behavior from parents or loved ones on camera when they&#39;re still in a state of shock, on top of being manipulated by the media around them (which they&#39;re very good at) doesn&#39;t equate to it being fake.</p>

<p>Lack of evidence isn&#39;t proof of foul play in situations like these, and strange behavior isn&#39;t either. My experience as a Medic in a Combat Zone opened my eyes to a lot of very strange behavior that you wouldn&#39;t expect from people who just went through hell, but they act how they do because they&#39;re in the process of a nervous breakdown and suffering Acute Anxiety Disorder.</p>

<p>To correct you I&#39;m not an ex-vet - I&#39;m a Veteran, you don&#39;t become an ex-Veteran. Just for future reference when you address someone who has served.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I can think of which would explain the lack of family activism if people did indeed die in these shootings would be that they had to sign some kind of non-disclosure agreement in order to collect from the victims fund. That is what happened on 9/11, and the only reason there were families pushing for an investigation is because some declined to take money from the fund.</p>

<p>This idea that the media is manipulating the family members to such an extreme degree that they are going out of their way to back the official narrative and tout the gun control agenda on top of their teleprompter reading, scripted lines, and fake emotion is too much for me. Also, that would not explain the &quot;crisis actor&quot; like behavior of people who were supposedly victims of the shooting. How do you manipulate someone who was supposedly just in a mass shooting to seem completely untraumatized? </p>

<p>Strange behavior would make sense out of these people, but what we see isn&#39;t &quot;strange behavior&quot; in general, it&#39;s strange behavior for someone who was supposedly just shot, because they seem perfectly fine.</p>

<p>As someone who&#39;s been a medic does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oWvgigppac">this interview</a> seem consistent with someone who claims they were shot in the arm multiple times and sprayed with shrapnel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s too soon to say the lack of family activism is suddenly a point towards hoax, this is still a fresh tragedy within the community. Give it some time, and again - even if nobody asks for further investigation - it doesn&#39;t suddenly point towards hoax. It could equally be that family members know their loved ones are dead and want to move on.</p>

<p>If there aren&#39;t a few people asking how many were shot by police I&#39;ll be surprised, but again I doubt a coroner report will ever pop up showing how many deaths were police related and how many were from the shooter - assuming it can even be proven (if he was using .223 ammo and 9 MM ammo these are the same as what the cops use, which makes it almost impossible to differentiate between the two and a lot easier for a coroner to write it off as the killer for the sake of not dealing with the backlash of the police officers in the town where they live.)</p>

<p>When I say the media manipulates these people, I meant moreso that they would be prepping a person&#39;s mental state by talking to them in certain ways and prompting them to look happy or do this and that for the camera - which is what producers do. Period. There&#39;s no such thing as a real, candid interview anymore.  The media has devolved into some weird circus (or at least the mainstream media) of who can break the story first without any form of journalistic integrity.</p>

<p>You need to also keep in mind, again, that Acute Anxiety Disorder does a lot to the mind. When I did my first exit exam for PTSD at the VA after my discharge I was under more mental distress than I can recall, and I laughed about things and smiled about things followed by crying uncontrollably as I described them in further detail. Specifically performing CPR on a very good friend in a pool of his own blood after finding him in the latrine from a suicide attempt.</p>

<p>The gun control angle isn&#39;t something I was even considering when I made my original statement, I was strictly speaking to emotional behavior that people would find odd. How we behave when we are told we&#39;ll be seen by millions of American&#39;s, or even in the public, versus how we behave behind closed doors when grieving are very different things. There is plenty of evidence I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve even experienced yourself to support that idea.</p>

<p>You also need to keep in mind that these guys are doped out of their minds on Morphine or Dilauded or a cocktail of all kinds of shit. When I had my hip pinned after the femoral neck snapped in two the hospital had me on a full morphine IV push every 4 hours, 2 percocet every 4 hours, 20 mg of oxycontin every 12 hours, and 1 mg of dilauded every 12 hours.</p>

<p>These people are fresh out of anasthesia and high on very potent opiates, it&#39;s something to take into consideration - all of these factors are. Being told &quot;smile, be positive, don&#39;t let them see you cry&quot; when you&#39;re suffering a mental break on top of being semi-sedated/euphoric from anasthesia side effects and opiates is easy enough. People are susceptible to doing what they&#39;re told during a mental break because they&#39;re losing control of their own mind. This is Acute Anxiety Disorder - which will manifest into PTSD if the effects do not go away after 6 months. It includes a lot of other symptoms.</p>

<p>These people could even have gone over the entire interview in a &quot;tell me your story&quot; type scenario, and then being told &quot;you should do X instead of X when you&#39;re talking about this, so the public is more clear on what&#39;s going on&quot; - and they&#39;ll comply because this is a situation where people who are adept as setting up productions for dramatic, compelling television are coupled into the fact that someone who has just come out of an extraordinary situation is doing what they feel is right, or have been convinced is right, via telling their story.</p>

<p>The way this guy has mobility of his arm in the sling and is waving it around with his gestures would point towards him being under the influence of narcotics as well as having superficial wounds, but that&#39;s speculation. The location of the tears in the shirt point towards grazing or direct impact from the side into his arm, but judging by mobility grazing is the likely answer.</p>

<p>Swelling and real mobility loss/rigidity takes about 48 - 72 hours to kick into effect with serious trauma. Scar tissue has to start building up first.</p>

<p>The entrance wounds on his shoulder point to small caliber. If he&#39;d been hit by .223, 5.56, or .300 &quot;blackout&quot; (all of the calibers that the long rifle being used are capable of, unknown which caliber was used at this point to the best of my knowledge.) There would be more evident visual trauma such as bruising, and just an overall larger entry wound.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is all speculation. I can&#39;t tell you for sure what&#39;s what without visually inspecting someone and getting my own situational size up of what occurred.</p>

<p>This is why I get irritated with armchair quarterbacking of situations like this, similar to how angry I was when people were saying the gunshot impact from the news reporter shot live on TV weren&#39;t real. If you aren&#39;t there to physically inspect and get a scene size up, you really can&#39;t know, and pretending that you do is arrogant and ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like people really are dead but the situation is sprinkled with false information and a lot of the people on TV may just be manipulated into saying things because they think it&#39;s right at that time. I have been reading a lot about this and I think it&#39;s so weird that everyone I talk to immediately brings up &quot;don&#39;t believe everything the media says&quot; or &quot;something is fishy with that&quot; but entire groups of people, from this shooting and others, don&#39;t seem to think anything is up. Everyone seems to be perfectly okay with a club being shot up by a guy where the only proof of association to ISIS was a phone call to police a couple of minutes before and some obscure background story... like I said, I think someone shot those people but I don&#39;t think it was who they said it was... but we do live in a bizarre world so it could just be what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are not alone in your theory, I don&#39;t personally agree - but I can respect your reasoning. </p>

<p>I think it &#39;s really hard to tell - if people really died - but I think they did not. I think they did not - because i see ZERO expected behavior around real death. and because all of the witnesses and footage of aftermath that they show us is clearly staged -- I don&#39;t think it would make sense that the shooting was real but all the evidence was staged, witnesses were lying etc. </p>

<p>I think the planning for these events is years in the making - and people who are going to participate let themselves get known - in their community etc, -- I know that sounds so diobolical -- but I also think it&#39;s kind of espionage 101, the long con. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, the Army&#39;s a small world and he happened to be in a unit that someone I trained with back in 2006 when I joined the Army was in during his time in Kuwait - and we got to know each other through that.</p>

<p>When I say I know him personally, I mean I knew him in that I have spoken to him multiple times in Veteran/Military Facebook groups in the past on various subjects that we all go over.</p>

<p>I met him when he was out here in Irvine California and had a beer with him at a local bar with some of my battle&#39;s from service.</p>

<p>When I found out he was one of the victims I contacted his family directly to give them my condolences.</p>

<p>I can ask my friend who served with him if he has any pictures of them together from Kuwait, and then show you pictures of me with that buddy on our deployment together, but that&#39;s about as close as I&#39;ll be able to connect the dots - which won&#39;t do much to sate disbelievers in the first place.</p>

<p>I would think the influx of people coming in to say they knew victims would be an indicator to some people that these deaths are real. Whether it was a false flag or not I don&#39;t know, but it wasn&#39;t a hoax.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a bit reluctant to give out names of family, or even my battle buddy who I met him through simply because of the nature of these forums - which I would hope people can appreciate, but I can also appreciate that my word doesn&#39;t mean much when people have already made up their minds on this situation.</p>

<p>I will admit that I&#39;ve gone out on a small vendetta to start questioning people who have made some pretty outrageous narratives by creating their own stories then running with them because this is personal for me, but it&#39;s all with the intent of getting people to think critically instead of jumping the shark over something I know for a fact happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true.  (Me, applied mathematician, 30+ years experience.)</p>

<p>Decibels represent the <em>logarithm</em> of the intensity of the sound.  An increase of 10 decibels - one bel (yes, really), represent an increase in the <em>amplitude</em> by a factor of 10 - not 2.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Wikipedia page if you doubt me:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel</a></p>

<p>More, &quot;loudness&quot; isn&#39;t measured by amplitude at all.  Your ear hears volume logarithmically - that means that every increase of 10dB represents the same increment in <em>perceived</em> loudness - not a doubling at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing this for over 20 years, so I know a thing or two about decibels as well.</p>

<p>While most audio related relationships expressed in decibels are indeed derived from 10 log equations, when calculating Sound Pressure Levels, the equation dB SPL=20 log (p1/p0) is used. This math shows that a 6dB increase is a &quot;doubling of SPL&quot;, however... because of the way human hearing works, a 10dB increase in SPL is perceived to be roughly &quot;twice as loud&quot; to the casual listener. If you don&#39;t believe me, feel free to consult any book about acoustics or sound reinforcement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>excellent post, there is much more to say of course, but you have made an excellent proof. and I agree with you. </p>

<p>-- I don&#39;t want to jump the shark for anybody -- as it&#39;s a big enough hurdle to realize this thing is a hoax - full stop. but the &quot;mother&quot; of the alleged son who died - who is speaking in so many interviews -- looks SO much to me like she is in full prosthetic makeup and wig, like just in a full on disguise -- like a girl playing a middle aged lady - in a play or something. think nicole kidman in the hours -- that kind of makeup. if you look at the &quot;mother&#39;s&quot; face as she talks it just doesn&#39;t move like it should -- her teeth are too deep within her mouth, there are no real creases and bags under her eyes -- and I think her glasses and bangs are there to help hide the imperfections of the disguise around the eyes. her skin is so saggy but also so smooth, an improbable combination - what it really looks like is that the saggy element is built - it also looks like she&#39;s wearing tons of makeup over it, - yet -- it&#39;s all sallow colored -- so it looks like she&#39;s wearing tons of makeup to try to make it look like she&#39;s wearing zero makeup, which is a real tell of a disguise. I think it&#39;s pure theatrics. she has no pores, and she doesn&#39;t sweat. in florida heat. --- this thing is a hoax either way, nobody has to go down this rabbit hole with me if it&#39;s just not for them -- but I ask anybody out there also curious to really look at her face too -- and look at examples of realistic prosthetic disguises -- and compare, see if you can&#39;t see it too. </p>

<p>I think it would make a lot of sense too if she were in a disguise -- who wants to live a life as the person everybody knows as that crisis actor -- they had to know she&#39;d get intense backlash. I think what nobody , (besides myself , that I can find) is yet picking up on  -  -- is that that is actually an actor inside a disguise. I have no idea what actor -- could just be a nobody -- but whoever it is does not look like the face they are displaying. it could also be multiple players inside the mask, different actors playing the differs moods, but -- I suspect it&#39;s just one actor, in a fake ass face. </p>

<p>Do people not know that no matter what you call &quot;us&quot;, Tin Foil Hats, Truthers, Conspiracy Theorists, Crazy Heads....pick a name, I don&#39;t give a shit. </p>

<p>We are not crazy we are trying to bring truth to find out the real story, people so often get confused with what we are saying and say something along the lines of &quot;X didn&#39;t happen&quot; or &quot;X is saying no one died&quot; no we aren&#39;t you idiots, read the stuff we post to the fullest, do your &quot;OWN&quot; research and either GTFO or partake in being part of bringing the truth to the light.</p>

<p>No one is forcing you to come here and read this stuff, this is all &quot;Theories&quot; and &quot;Opinions&quot; last time I checked that&#39;s not illegal and quite honestly what is wrong with this country, People give other people shit for having said Opinion. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an idiot for thinking this was a false flag it is simply my Opinion based upon the research I have done NOT watching the main steam bullshit you see on the major networks, (Don&#39;t forget guys these networks are owned by major political gurus, Rich Oil companies, and govt entities)</p>

<p>Example: You drive up to me wearing a red shirt, red hat, red shoes, driving a red car, and the person sitting next to you (not coming out of your mouth) says your favorite color is blue....bullshit my Opinion is that your favorite color is red. </p>

<p>Now can someone tell me exactly what that sounds like?
Hint? I already gave you a hint.</p>

I feel like a fish out of water in my own ocean. when you know everybody around you, the whole country ( world?) is getting mindfcked.... how do you put it in perspective? what do you really do with  that awareness. </p>

<p>i want to  free everybody . ha, but most of them would rather have me locked up for my thought dissent . ugh. so surreal. </p>

<p>how do you all carry this knowledge in your life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, there are several possible ways that this could have gone down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Crazed Lone Gunman</strong>: Mateen was a deranged, hateful maniac who acted on his own - as the media has portrayed. The only ones who knew about the planned attack would be Mateen himself, and possibly his wife.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Jihadist Warrior</strong>: Mateen was a deranged, hateful MUSLIM maniac who was in contact with other persons of Jihadist/terrorist bent. Under this scenario, Mateen, his wife, and possibly a small group of Jihadist lunatics would have been aware of the planned attack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Sting</strong>: Mateen was being <strong><em>unwittingly</em></strong> manipulated by undercover FBI agents and/or FBI informants, who, as they have done in so many other cases, presented themselves as &quot;fellow Jihadists&quot;, encouraging and cultivating the &quot;Jihadist Spirit&quot; in Mateen, working with him and helping him to plan the execution of the attack... <strong><em>BUT</em></strong> unlike other high-profile FBI &quot;stings&quot;, instead of stopping him at the last minute, they just let him move forward with the attack for the sake of the political windfalls they would reap in the aftermath. Under this scenario, Mateen, his wife, the FBI informer(s), their handlers, and their superiors (possibly reaching to the DOJ or higher) may have been aware of the planned attack. Still, a relatively small number of people in a notoriously tight-lipped group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Patsy</strong>: Mateen was <strong>knowingly</strong> working with the FBI - <strong>as a paid informant</strong>, and was <em>led to believe</em> that he was involved in a FBI &quot;sting operation&quot; in which they would entrap a <strong>third-party</strong> &quot;Jihadist&quot; who was about to carry out a terrorist attack - with Mateen playing a key role in the ruse (possibly as one of several accomplices to the &quot;Jihadist&quot;), believing all the while that FBI agents would SWOOP IN at the last moment and BUST the third-party Jihadist who the FBI was targeting. Under this scenario, Mateen may have been murdered by an FBI operative during the first moments of the attack - with the remainder of the mayhem and carnage being carried out by his fellow FBI operatives - leaving behind Mateen&#39;s dead body (and associated weaponry) as the &quot;Patsy&quot; that would take the blame for the entire event. As in &quot;The Sting&quot; above, a relatively small number of persons in a notoriously tight-lipped group would have had foreknowledge. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>THE HOAX</strong> (as implied by the OP): Under this scenario, <strong>there was no carnage at all</strong>. It was all a carefully planned and choreographed theatrical presentation designed to SHOCK AND AWE the gullible public, and was planned and executed by parties unknown (but undoubtedly holding high government office), apparently in the hopes of swaying public opinion to support a political agenda (that remains unclear). The success of such a &quot;HOAX&quot; scenario would be no easy task. The planning and logistics in its presentation would have been extremely complicated. First, the venue (the night club) would have to be secured for the operation. Second, scores (hundreds?) of &quot;Crisis Actors) would have to be hired to participate in The Show as patrons or employees of the club. Third, scores or even HUNDREDS of law enforcement officers - from local, county, state AND Federal agencies would need to be &quot;in the loop&quot;, fully aware of the theatrical scam. Add to these hundreds of paramedics, firemen, doctors, nurses and other staff members working at hospitals where the NON-WOUNDED showed up (or didn&#39;t!) for NON-TREATMENT, and soon you have a thousand or more people that know damn well that SOMETHING STINKS. And let&#39;s not forget the members of the local and national media who swarm on the site - or countless other local, state and federal agencies who feel compelled to STICK THEIR NOSES into this business for whatever reason...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course there are other possible scenarios, but of those that I have listed, the <strong>HOAX SCENARIO</strong> is by far the MOST complex and LEAST likely to succeed due to the thousand or more people that would need to cooperate and play in the charade. </p>

<p>Does anyone seriously believe that anyone who thought it was &quot;worth the trouble&quot; to serve their political agenda would even CONSIDER a such a &quot;Hoax&quot; scenario???</p>

<p>No. They&#39;d say <strong>&quot;FUCK IT. Let&#39;s kill some bastards! It&#39;s WAY EASIER&quot;</strong> - just like they do EVERY DAY in places like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, etc. They kill MILLIONS without batting a fucking eye.</p>

<p>Such fuckers have no respect for the lives of a bunch of piss-ant peasants overseas, what makes you think that they would feel differently about piss-ant peasants in Orlando, or Boston, or Newtown?</p>

<p>Do I believe that the Orlando event happened as presented by the media? Not necessarily, no. But the notion that this whole thing was a &quot;HOAX&quot; is absolute hogwash.</p>

<p><strong><em>No offense, OP!</em></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that any of my alternatives are necessarily &quot;right&quot;, or that your &quot;Hoax&quot; theory is necessarily wrong, just that, in my view, the number of people that would need to be &quot;in the know&quot; (cops, firefighters, etc) and those who would see RED FLAGS (medical personnel - <strong><em>&quot;where are the injured???&quot;</em></strong>) would make it so impractical that the likelihood of the &quot;Hoax&quot; theory being accurate is minuscule.</p>

<p>If you would like to offer some ideas on how those problems could have been avoided/minimized, I&#39;m all ears, bro.</p>

<p>For those who are unaware of the decibel scale, every three decibels is perceived as approximately twice as loud.</p>

<p>This is also completely wrong - indeed, the decibel system was originally chosen because it&#39;s approximately <em>linear</em> with respect to our hearing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An AR-15 is known as one of the loudest guns and would create a sound between 120 and 140 decibels</p>

<p>The intensity of a point source sound decreases as the <em>square</em> of the distance away from it.  It makes zero sense to say &quot;a sound between 120 decibels and 140 decibels&quot; without giving a distance from the sound.</p>

<p>So absolutely - if the gun were right near your ear it&#39;d be literally deafening.  Move 20 feet away and it&#39;d be comparable to the sound system.  Move 40 feet away and if you were near a speaker, you&#39;d never hear it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a good question and the answer is no. It&#39;s much easier to set up fake identities which can be made in a matter of minutes in some cases and are basically untraceable.</p>

<p>Actually killing people, like they did in 9/11, has dire consequences because the families of the real victims tend to demand answers and won&#39;t immediately back the official story and or the ultimate agenda (gun control in this case) like a crisis actor would. </p>

<p>These loved ones of real victims tend to dedicate a significant portion of their lives to holding the true perpetrators accountable and the public will back their demands for an investigation. This is why an investigation was done on 9/11, as much of a con-job that was, and that is why TPTB ultimately had to resort to killing Beverly Eckert to ensure her movement to find out the truth was crushed. </p>
