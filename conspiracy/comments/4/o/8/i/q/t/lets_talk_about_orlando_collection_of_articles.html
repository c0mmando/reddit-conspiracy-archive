    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of people creating their own narratives and kind of running with them to try and prove this was a hoax.</p>

<p>Whether it was a false flag or not I don&#39;t know. I personally believe the police had something to do with a bit of the total body count.</p>

<p>As someone with experience in actual combat and as a medic I&#39;ve had a really hard time with some of the narratives people have been creating.</p>

<p>Please think critically about these things when you&#39;re trying to connect the dots instead of going from A straight to Z.</p>

<p>I understand the people who believe it was a hoax are probably the minority, but you still don&#39;t do a lot of service to the credibility of the community with some of the outrageous stuff I&#39;ve seen posted in this sub reddit lately over these incidents.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be down voted into oblivion for this, but I feel like it&#39;s the responsible thing to say. To remind people who are actually looking for the truth to keep a level head and think clearly.</p>

<p>Things like the guy with the tourniquet around his leg being set down by two people carrying him, based on his wound location, are not suddenly evidence of crisis actors. I know this from first hand experience as a Combat Medic, the location of that wound doesn&#39;t suddenly equate to being immobile, and the idea that someone in shock would ask for a second to rest, or the people carrying him, once they know he was in a safer area isn&#39;t that far of a stretch...it seems like the more likely answer in my mind when I recognize the wound location and the amount of blood on his jeans...I can understand why it might not to someone with no medical background.</p>

<p>Saying he couldn&#39;t have possibly had enough ammunition based on a theory of what he would be using to carry the ammunition itself isn&#39;t creating any sort of credibility to help figure out whether or not this was a false flag. I read through a fairly long rant that was entirely based on him wearing an LBV that limits the number of magazines he can hold, when as far as I know we have zero information on what he was using to carry  his ammunition - and last I remember there were reports he was wearing a suicide vest (though I don&#39;t know if this is true or not.) That&#39;s not conclusive evidence or even good critical thinking, that&#39;s creating a scenario in your head to try and explain something you can&#39;t wrap your head around.</p>

<p>If I have to explain why to you, I&#39;m happy to try and go over it, but I would hope that your own critical thinking skills would bring you to certain conclusions after the knee jerk reaction someone with a skeptical mind has.</p>

<p>The fact that this sub reddit has blown up with non stop posts over this, if it was a false flag, just shows that it&#39;s doing it&#39;s job.</p>

<p>As someone who knows for a fact one of the victims is dead, and is pretty well convinced everyone who is being mentioned as a victim of the shooting is in fact dead, I think it would be in the interests of the community to try and maintain that critical thinking when trying to connect the dots. Wishful thinking, I&#39;m sure, condensed posts like the OP definitely make it easier to put two and two together, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having triage set up close to the scene after its been secured makes sense as a Medic. </p>

<p>The most important cases that need help first will be in the building in critical condition. </p>

<p>The less severe cases will be people who got out and fled with superficial or even serious wounds but not to the point of being on the brink of death. </p>

<p>People returning to the area for medical care after getting out and running to safety makes sense in such a large casualty shooting. </p>

<p>There aren&#39;t enough paramedics and EMT P qualified fire fighters or ambulances to deal with that many people and go to them. Setting up a spot for it is making the best of a bad situation and standard procedure for medics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Walking the &quot;injured&quot; actors just  the news crews, then sitting them down and congratulating themselves (the injured included) once they incorrectly believed they were out of the cameraman shot was extremely telling.  The biggest indicator that this was all staged nonsense was amateur actor Mr. Anal Colon. A &quot;shattered leg, with SIX 5.56 rifle shots.  One &quot;deflected&quot; away from his skull by his FINGER?  Less than 48 hours afterwards, and he&#39;s WALKING and doing physical therapy.  Allegedly shot six times, yet zero visible damage is seen anywhere.  His behavior gives it all away.</p>

<p>The aimed number of people.  The entire lack of still worked automobiles for the claimed dead clubbers.  Never seeing masses of blood or even a large number of bodies being removed from the broom closet sized club that allegedly held over 300 people.  This was so blatantly a staged hoax, it&#39;s not even funny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, were not the minority. The preponderance of evidence very clearly indicates that this was yet another botched staged terror hoax.  The &quot;shooter&quot; was an actor.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you&#39;re saying and we need more perspectives like yours if we&#39;re going to figure out what is/isn&#39;t fact here. Though if I may comment on one thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>once they know he was in a safer area isn&#39;t that far of a stretch..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally find it hard to believe that going back towards the crime scene (the club is catty-cornered to where they stopped at that intersection) is hardly a &quot;safer&quot; area than being down the street as they seemed to be according to where they came into frame. However to defend your position I&#39;ll point out that they stopped and set him down at the <em>crosswalk</em>, which is where any normal person would stop instead of just walking into the street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe I read somewhere that they had drug a lot of victims pretty far away then the Paramedics decided to triage closer to the site of the shooting after the fact, so that would explain the people being run back.</p>

<p>The amount of blood on his jeans would indicate to me that he had either a shrapnel or small caliber handgun wound to the meat of his outter thigh, there also wasn&#39;t an exit wound.</p>

<p>Jumping straight to crisis actor definitely isn&#39;t the first step in figuring out the why of it, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy was interviewed briefly the next day and seemed like a very overly dramatic, stereotype of the flamboyant gay man you see in Hollywood movies. He was being very dramatic over what was a non life threatening wound, whether he could walk or not I don&#39;t know, but my guess would be yes, he was probably high out of his mind on morphine IVs and anasthesia from surgery to remove the shrapnel or bullet, too.</p>

<p>The fact that he was even able to give an interview within 24 hours of that footage being shown points towards the wound being superficial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Howell called the Santa Monica police on Sunday morning claiming that he needed protection from the CIA. Howell further elaborated to the dispatcher stating that he “had been set up by the CIA – they are going to kill me.”</p>

<p>According to Howell, he was in LA to meet with another person in a collaborated attack on the gay communities in both Florida and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Howell additionally stated that, “everything has gone south. Dan was gone when I got here. They killed the leader of the Florida attack this morning. They are going to kill me. I need protection.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the suspect killed in the Pulse Bar massacre in Florida, Howell stated, “Omar was not suppose to be killed. They lied to us – Omar and Brandy were suppose to get away.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, looking into the Islamic Knowledge Seminary Course Howell was alleged to be taking part in, I came across these tidbits:</p>

<p>Omar Mateen was enrolled in the same course: 
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/12/orlando-gunman-tied-to-radical-imam-released-from-prison-last-year-say-law-enforcement-sources.html">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/12/orlando-gunman-tied-to-radical-imam-released-from-prison-last-year-say-law-enforcement-sources.html</a></p>

<p>Marcus Dwayne Robertson, the leader of this course, is ex-military, and was released early from prison many years ago in return for informing on terrorist networks in Africa, Egypt, and the US (even though allegedly he fucked that up): 
<a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/06/marcus-dwayne-robertson-omar-mateens-possible-teacher-omar-mateen-teacher-orlando-shooting-terrorist-attack/">http://heavy.com/news/2016/06/marcus-dwayne-robertson-omar-mateens-possible-teacher-omar-mateen-teacher-orlando-shooting-terrorist-attack/</a></p>

<p>Last year he was inexplicably released early from prison for other charges. </p>

<p>Omar Mateen posted during the shooting on Facebook that he had knowledge of other attacks coming in the near future:
<a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/15/omar-mateen-posted-facebook-during-pulse-massacre">http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/15/omar-mateen-posted-facebook-during-pulse-massacre</a></p>

<p>Seems like the report of Howell&#39;s alleged correspondence with Mateen could hold some water.</p>

<p>Edit:  We need more real information from California. I had never heard of getoffthebs until now, and after looking at their front page it is obvious that it simply churns out pro-Trump stories, in record numbers. Can we get any more confirmation on this? I am not quick to jump to conclusions in these cases, but this connection, far above all the other wild theories, would be highly indicative of something bigger at work here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this one of those &quot;operations within operations&quot; akin to one interpretation of the 9/11 event?</p>

<p>What I mean is... is this a problem with how they &quot;layered&quot; this particular cake? I&#39;ve heard something that alleges to be the audio of the SWAT team &quot;breaching the club&quot;, the amount of clearly audible <em>automatic</em> gunfire is crazy. </p>

<p>I&#39;d think that this is part of the obfuscation angle; the weapons that actually did the killing are law-enforcement issued, and they are having a real problem with the narrative because of the shooter&#39;s employment history. </p>

<p>One interpretation of the physical evidence might conclude that all of the injuries were done by guns issued to a security company? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I read this thread, the more the idea that Mateen and any of his accomplices were only meant to be a trigger. It wouldn&#39;t be too far of a stretch to claim that the entire purpose was to send in an armed &quot;police&quot; force to actually commit the 100 casualties. All Mateen had to do was to open fire a single clip (8-10 rounds?) and then sit back and wait. The &quot;police&quot; (military/CIA/etc special forces) would come in and execute all on site individuals, then Mateen, and claim he did all the work.</p>

<p>Add to that the fact he wanted armor. He knew he was going into a mission that he was supposed to die in. Nobody would ever buy armor to attack a soft target, assuming they&#39;re the only armed person on scene. An escape plan would have been a huge factor if he were interested in committing the act himself. He didn&#39;t kill himself, the police did, which means it wasn&#39;t intended to be his last day alive. He wanted <em>some</em> degree of protection, and if he did have an accomplice on site, discussing them having armor indicates that he wanted to see her(?) survive.</p>

<p>He was possibly a sleeper agent, programmed to attack, and while the brainwashing left him with the <em>imminent doom unless I fulfill my orders</em> mindset, his person was still too ingrained to fulfill it without some type of resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s alleged that he was wearing a mask... like &quot;body armor&quot; a mask... then we couple that with the early allegations of &quot;multiple shooters&quot; and this looks eerily similar to a couple other such events.

<p>News reports mentioned 49 dead and 53 injured in the Orlando nightclub. Since then I haven&#39;t seen anything in the media on the condition of the 53, or a modification of the original death toll. So out of 53 injured, some in critical condition, not a single one succumbed to their injuries? Is this a case of awesome doctors, or are we not told of additional deaths?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the news, I understand that Omar Mateen quit claimed his actual house to his sister (in April or May?). Why would he do that and move to the shithole area of Fort Pierce with wife and child? It&#39;s clearly a set.</p>

<p>Sundays are typically very slow days on the police scanner in St. Lucie County. But, aside from the circus at the apartment and his father&#39;s house, the dispatch was overwhelmed with all kinds of crazy calls, including an &quot;active shooter&quot; at Tradition Medical Center (which turned out to be a mentally ill guy with a gun and a note in his car.) There were so many strange calls that I started to wonder if it was real or not.</p>

<p>Someone might check out the ownership of the club. It&#39;s the black sheep of a group owned by husband and wife. Husband owns restaurants and wife owns Pulse. It is ragged out and not especially profitable; and there has been talk of selling it. I believe that it&#39;s the personal playground for her son [need confirmation on relationship]; and that he is almost always there, partying hard. The owner was conveniently on vacation. It might be interesting to dig deeper on this.</p>

<p>I also find it very unusual that the club was at full capacity and still serving when they should have been winding down; especially with the word that another local bar was closed down two hours early, by police? </p>

<p>Oh, I live near a place (in Fort Pierce) where people have a private gun range on their property. It&#39;s amazing the sheer amount of semi-automatic shooting that has been taking place. We&#39;ve talked about how these people have spent a fortune on ammo. It sounded like military training. They don&#39;t shoot regular guns, just a steady stream of semi-auto fire; sometimes for hours. I&#39;m extremely curious to see if that continues on, now...</p>

<p>As if 1. we care at all about YOUR personal interpretation of our collective &quot;credibility.&quot;  We don&#39;t.  We can&#39;t.  We&#39;re here to discuss the truth.  Not to impress anyone with a singular hivemind.  Especially our adversaries who flood our board with constant shill attacks and attempts to disrupt and force a false narrative on the far too frequent manufactured hoax events.  And 2. Need I remind you both that this is a massive open sub of differing backgrounds, thoughts and personal beliefs and understandings.  There is no &quot;pangea&quot; shared credibility that is relevant.  </p>

<p>Literally with EVERY single other time I&#39;ve heard people remark about their, let&#39;s call it od, over-concen with OUR shared group credibility, they&#39;ve turned out to be clear as day infiltrators and liars, hailing from the Israel First <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a>, <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">/r/TopMindsofReddit</a>, <a href="/r/DiagnoseThem">/r/DiagnoseThem</a>, and <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> subs.</p>

<p>You must ask yourself, why would these apologists, liars, and disruptors (or simply a combination of all of the above) care so much about spreading such obvious disinformation and lies about the MULTIPLE shooting hoaxes thst have been used to advance the unconstitutional gun control delay.  Just as were seeint now with the hoax in Orlando?  What we see is those pushing the disarming of United States citizens is primarily being done by Israeli dual citizen politicians.  Senators and Representatives </p>

<p>So this why they&#39;re so intimately involved with the unconstitutional encroachment against the natural rights of citizens they care about AFTER the citisens of their homeland.  Cui bono is the absolute question we all must ask is what their motives and and means are for doing so.

Free homes to build their characters for a short period of time, then almost all of them still around mov7l(e away.  They most certainly have created fictional victims before in prior staged hoaxes.  </p>

<p>They have a man with a surname of COLON who claims to have been shot an unbelievable SIX times with the hithly damaging 5.56± who is walking and going through &quot;physical therapy less than 48 hours after being so severely harmed.  This was the pathetic lying asshole who claims he deflected a surely fatal 5.56 headshot with HIS FINGER.  And then during the laughable press conference, zero damage to his body is seen.  Especially on his tungsten-like finger skin.  </p>

<p><strong>And you try to claim that manufacturing victims is &quot;delusional...</strong></p>

<p>There is onr person attempting to sell the official bullshit government narrative here who is rar more delusional than anyone claiming that very little of this laughable bullshit hoax is backed by any physical evidence or credible reports.  Talk about LOL!  Yet another horribly botched hoax that so many can see right through.  Hence the large number of disinformation shills mobbing any discussion of the Orlando hoax </p>

<p>Challenging and showing concern for our sub&#39;s &#39;credibility?  Really?  Now let&#39;s else have I seen exactly this type of identical behavior before?  This is a very large community, made up or individuals.  Whenever some treats it like it&#39;s a single entity, it speaks gokumes about the person attempting to claim it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People die in FALSE FLAG attacks.  If you need an example, just look back to September 11th, 2001.</p>

<p>The Fire/Ambulances were kept away from the scene, as unmarked police trucks picked people up and allegedly brought them to ORMC. Amazingly, there were false reports that the gunman was inside the hospital, which caused a lockdown, and had people &quot;turning away victims&quot;.. interestingly though, these &quot;victims&quot; were not taken to other hospitals immediately during this lockdown- Odds are, this is when they were in fact brought into the hospital and put into beds to later be discovered when the staff returns to be part of the &quot;20+ people&quot; who would play the roles of the injured.</p>

<p>Of course, the scene where crisis actors are carrying away a person with an alleged gunshot wound to the leg, then set him down and start congratulating themselves is damaging to the official fairy tale, the very quick creation of t-shirts and donation pages, which have now brought in millions are also fishy.</p>

<p>The testimony by a man who supposedly lives nearby that people were running away from the club, then turned around and came back would be an indication that crisis actors were being &quot;Recycled&quot; like they were during Sandy Hook walking around the firehouse.. This limits the number of total people involved.</p>

<p>The testimony given by &quot;the victims&quot; also seems staged, and not believable, and the mandatory eye rubbing (instead of wiping tears from below the eyes) is seen again.</p>

<p>Keeping the real police fire and EMTs a block away created a hoax &quot;Safety zone&quot; where recycling of crisis actors and general nonsense could take place, with only a few &quot;Safe&quot; camera angles. Even these safe camera shots were screwed up, as the camera was left rolling too long in the now infamous &quot;screw up&quot; shot where the crisis actor is seen standing on his allegedly shot leg, and his friends are seen playfully shoving each other and congratulating themselves, now, apparently, unconcerned about further moving their injured friend or carrying him as they have reached the supposed &quot;finish line&quot; where they can set people down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google Crocodile Tears.... Adam P. Lanza: His DNA found was found on the side of the Mark .22 that was used to shoot his mother, and possibly on the barrel end. His DNA was not found on the bullets, the trigger, the shoulder stock, the envelope, the stamp, the Bushmaster, the 5.56x45&#39;s or even the doors to his car. Both sides of the envelope, the card, the adhesive side of the stamp, and the .22LR bullets were all found to have DNA MATCHING SOMEONE IN THE CONVICTED FELON DNA DATABASE FOR NEW YORK STATE From page 5 of report #00124235 “The DNA Results eliminate both Nancy Lanza and Adam Lanza as the source of DNA found on the driver&#39;s side front door handle and driver&#39;s side exterior door handle on the suspect vehicles car as well as the gun.” Incidentally, on page 5 of report #00063156, it is indicated that during a search of the vehicles in the parking lot: “a red blood like substance was located next to a white Subaru bearing New York registration FGX5945, which was parked in the NE section of the parking lot. An Integriswab swabbing was taken of the red blood like substance (Exhibit #502) for the purposes of identifying a potential DNA source.” (This does not appear to have been followed-up insofar as far as I know). What I find striking, in addition, is the fact that: while we do not have the un-redacted photographs themselves … we do have the list of what those photographs are supposed to have recorded. So, ask yourself: Why does it appear that the very experienced, longtime CME (Dr. Carver)—(in addition to listing Adam Lanza&#39;s DOB as 4/22/82)—forget to take autopsy photos of the entry wound, said by police to be in the lower right posterior of the skull (aiming upwards)? Perhaps because, according to Dr. Carver, Adam died of an “intraoral GSW” When Adam&#39;s brother, Ryan Lanza was located by police walking down the street to his apartment in Hoboken, NJ, he told the police that “he didn&#39;t do it, it was his brother, and his brother had killed his mom, too” The police naturally inquire as to how he knew this... …he said: his father told him via telephone. (Hoboken Police Department&#39;s own officer testimony of this encounter, starting around page 340 of Book 8)Now, wait a minute — exactly what time is this conversation taking place; where Ryan Lanza has already been informed (by his father) of his mother&#39;s tragic murder? Yep, the exact same time that his mother is being declared dead, 80 miles away. I wonder if anyone who was paying attention, noticed that the EMT stated that they tried to go in Room #12 (first door on the left, Roig), but it was locked. But remember, that in Kaitlin Roig&#39;s official account and in her nation-wide motivational speeches she says that she didn&#39;t have time to lock the door. So they go into the next room, Room #10, and see bodies. Then they go into Room #8, and someone says that there&#39;s a 2nd shooter, so they clear the room and begin searching for the 2nd shooter (the paramedics are doing this?) Anyhow, they go into the next rooms and find “several live victims” Who were these “live victims” further up the hall? Why would they be victims?For more extensive investigation or if you just want to download everything onto your HD, then of course use this <a href="http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/Official">http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/Official</a> CSP link to the full set of archives (released on 12/27/13) Inside of these ZIP format archives you will find: all crime scene photographs (many redacted) investigatory reports for all crime scenes (in PDF format) all crime scene video recordings (much of it redacted; and randomly I may add) several (but not all) first responders&#39; dash-cam footage (can be found on YouTube as well) audio + transcripts 911 calls misc. other documents, maps, etc. supplemental reports, ancillary investigations, and follow-ups to tips given to the police by the public</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clerical error on missing Mateen psychological evalution - from Miami Herald:</p>

<p>&quot;Nine years ago, the state of Florida received documentation from a security firm vouching for the mental health of Omar Mateen, who launched a bloody attack this week on Orlando nightclub patrons.</p>

<p>But the psychologist whose name appears on the document in state records said Friday that she never evaluated a man who now ranks as the worst mass killer in American history. In fact, she wasn’t even living in Florida when the evaluation was supposedly completed.</p>

<p>The revelation Friday became another source of scrutiny for the G4S security firm, which was known as Wackenhut at the time. The psychological evaluation done for the company, which is required under state law, cleared Mateen to carry a firearm as a private security guard.</p>

<p>“What I do know is that in September 2007, I was not living or working in Florida, I was not performing any work for Wackenhut, and I did not administer any type of examination to Omar Mateen,” Dr. Carol Nudelman, who now lives in Colorado, said in a statement released through her attorneys to the Miami Herald and other papers who had published her name.</p>

<p>The company on Friday called the discrepancy a “clerical error” and said that Mateen was indeed evaluated, but by a different psychologist.</p>

<p>The global security firm — which does work in more than 100 countries — is locally based in Jupiter. Its operations have come under scrutiny a number of times over the years.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hi guys,
I&#39;m normally not one to jump on false flag stuff so fast, but right from the get go this one had a weird stink to me. 
Here is a list of things I have seen so far that are more than suspect. 
In no particular order:</p>

<p>In the video below the victim impersonates the gun sound like automatic weapon ‘ratatata’. He also says there were 2 shooters.
There are also copters overhead, yet no copters in ANY video during the event / attack (?)
<a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/eyewitness-account-from-within-pulse-nightclub/nrfJF/">http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/eyewitness-account-from-within-pulse-nightclub/nrfJF/</a></p>

<p>What did I present the above? Because in the (how coincidental) video, the only clip from within the club, magically shot at the EXACT moment of gunfire - we clearly hear BAM BAM BAM - NOT the ‘ratatata’ spoken of above <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3638930/Snapchat-footage-shows-moments-shots-rang-inside-Pulse-nightclub.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3638930/Snapchat-footage-shows-moments-shots-rang-inside-Pulse-nightclub.html</a></p>

<p>Also re: above - we were told the incident took place at 2am. Alcohol is stopped at 1am so typically people leave. How come it still looks packed at 2am?</p>

<p>Also, this Snapchat was (apparently) sent to the victim&#39;s brother. Here is his reponse - please look for signs of grief (??)
brother???? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsD_QSp-rK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsD_QSp-rK4</a></p>

<p>And here is his facebook profile: (fb) /proformanceheatandair.brianalvear
Yet his SISTER Amanda Alvear is not one of his 469 friends (???)</p>

<p>The video below is my favorite - civilians (why not paramedics?) are carrying a &#39;victim&#39; - but when they think they&#39;re off camera they put him down and laugh (!)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNewsknuBw&amp;amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNewsknuBw&amp;amp;app=desktop</a></p>

<p>There are more but consider this the &#39;starter kit&#39; to &#39;something&#39;s afoot&#39; in Orlando.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: assuming that innocent people were killed, this is a tragedy and a travesty; my post is in no way to present any disrespect to victims. Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you directly or indirectly knew four out of the 52 people who died when the city of Orlando has over 455,000 is ridiculous. Even if you were &quot;in that scene&quot; (which I don&#39;t believe you are since none of your direct friends were killed), then it would have been incredibly rare to even know one of the deaths, seeing as Orlando has 10s of 1000s of Queer residents and there are 20 gay nightclubs in the Orlando area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck off dude. 7 of the people killed were valencia students. One of them was my classmate. My old dormmate&#39;s boyfriend was killed and he hasn&#39;t stopped posting about it on fb since he found out the day after. The Tuesday after the shooting I went to my bio class and the girl I sit next to showed me her group chat where her friend was talking about hiding and telling them to call the police. I work at a Korean restaraunt that is 90% gay, one of the guys who used to work there was shot and killed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even accounting for the friends of friends I know who were injured. Talk to anyone in Orlando and it&#39;s not hard to find someone who was 2-3 degrees away from knowing someone affected. My barber lost a regular who was killed during the shooting ffs, that&#39;s another one for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna write that again, I think it is becoming clear why the CIA was involved, they probably saw they were losing control in the middle east region and a move like this firmly regains that control they lost and allows for more support.</p>

<p>A renewed support for action in the middle east and allowing oppressive regimes to happen.</p>

<p>But perhaps it&#39;s even a short term scheme for the long term new world order plan, but less gun control does not fit in there, aaah it stays confusing, only future will tell.</p>

<p>But even now, we have all paid no attention to the many murders happening, global intelligence killing off dissidents or important businessmen and no one seems to realize and those who do play along.</p>

<p>The Wife must know too much. Remember that UCLA shooting which just happened? His Girlfriend may have known too much as well, she was killed too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vocativ.com/328593/orlando-shooting-reddit-exodus-censorship/">Orlando Shooting Sparks Reddit Exodus Amid Censorship</a></p>

<p>Lots of people were angry at this. Maybe break out a section for media blackout, censorship, cutting people off in live interviews.</p>

<p>Remember when Obama was crying crocodile tears for the Sandy Hook parents on TV as he pushed new executive gun control orders? Or what about when Hillary Clinton spun her campaign into something about gun control, with Obama supporting her by adding that it definitely IS a political talking point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so too. Why would 11 police officers be relieved of duty?</p>

<p>Should be easy to find out via autopsy as long as nobody tampers with that process. The autopsies are now done but they won&#39;t release them to the public during an active investigation (how convenient).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One doctor said the wounds show some were shot at a distance, likely as they ran away, others were shot up close.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/orlando-shooting-surgeons-survivors-expected-to-sp/nrf4k/">http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/orlando-shooting-surgeons-survivors-expected-to-sp/nrf4k/</a></p>

<p>But the shots at a distance couldn&#39;t possibly have been from police who were known to be shooting towards the building? Sure.</p>

<p>&quot;There was a concrete wall behind our target when we opened fire.&quot; Sure.</p>

<p>My best guess is what the FBI is doing now is tying up ALL the loose ends and determining if anyone else needs to take the fall for whatever loose end remains. If they can&#39;t fully iron out the story, they could probably throw these cops under the bus.</p>

<p>I looked up articles and they did bring him to a hospital that I later found many had the same experience, celebrities that is, they said they changed his meds etc, people said he got worse but they denied that, he vomit, the exact same thing as in the documentary.</p>

<p>I still thought it was crazy but then I thought it through, if they can brainwash one famous person and influence public thinking so much, why wouldn&#39;t they, and indeed.</p>

<p>I found many articles on people getting in strange situations where they get hospitalized for a while and come out a changed person.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still crazy to think about it but the amount of people who go through the exact same when you piece it together is baffling.</p>

<p>So who did control Muhammad Ali in the end? Who did accelerate his death?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, the mainstream media puts so many spins on it and has you chasing so many rabbits that the event, in and of itself, is made to seem like a foregone conclusion. They&#39;re no longer required to prove anything. Even the spins and rabbits require zero proof. Beyond that, if a question is raised wherein an investigation seems appropriate, the good &#39;ol gov will deem it a matter of national security and part of an ongoing investigation. &quot;We&#39;re still gathering information. We remain open to all possibilities.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>QUESTION:</p>

<p>Why would a person, armed to the teeth to kill as many people as possible, (and with enough ammo to shootout with cops 3 hours later) even bother to take HOSTAGES inside the building? </p>

<p>If the intent was to kill 50+ people, and the police are said to have stopped further killing... what was he trying to negotiate by keeping hostages? They suspected everyone to be dead already, so at that stage, you bum rush the facility and attempt the capture the culprit for questioning... yet the attacker always dies. </p>

<p>Something does not make sense. Crisis actors... I mean hostages in a mass shooting. Doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A valid question. If James Wesley Howell is to be believed (get your tinfoil on) then perhaps Mateen was never supposed to take hostages, but did so when he put the pieces together and realized they were never going to take him alive. It&#39;s a streeetch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong bathroom is interesting and well done. A NYT article show a different analysis of the holes rammed into the building and include the ladies room. Not sure to what to make about that.</p>

<p>Kevlar Helmet makes sense. I couldn&#39;t understand why the brim of the helmet is bent down. Looks like someone took a hammer to it.</p>

<p>To Catch a Crisis Actor. I have seen Chris Hansen compare to at least 2 different crisis actor. While I think he is odd, none of the videos I have seen make me think he is anyone except Chris Hansen.</p>

<p>(Okay, not really shocked that it&#39;s being buried, as legal drugs&#39; culpability in mass shooting attacks is one of the great conspiracies of our time - actually more shocked Reuters actually had the guts to report psychoactive drugs could be involved.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the hoax theory was disinfo, we would have seen blood, and a metric shitton of the claimed &quot;murdered&#39;s&quot; cars still in the lot (no one actually died here).  Not just the participants (actors) cars (note-around 20 people played part in this hoax, where the official bullshit story claims a laughable &gt;300 count.  The cars seen support this).  Nor would have we seen the actors walking the injured down the TV camera line BACK to the crime scene.  </p>

<p>Mateen was an ACTOR for Christ sake.  This same bullshit lie of multiple shooters was used to support the 100% confirmes staged bullshit of Sandy Hook.  The largest push to date to attempt to unconstitutionally disarm American citizens.  That failed because people were picking apart the staged shooting WHILE IT WAS STILL ALLEGEDLY ONGOING.</p>

<p>Orlando, just like he rest was a staged psychological operation.  Yet again, a psyop that failed entirely.  I just loved watching the dual citizen politician puppets watching and seeing that NOTHING was going to come of this bullshit staged event.  So their owners/handlers made them to the most ridiculous thing they could.  A joke of a &quot;sit-in.&quot; How long did that treasonous bitch claim they would keep it up?  &quot;Until Hell froze over...&quot;</p>

<p>Good one whore.  You&#39;re NEVER going to win this one.  The American public will hang you from you lampposts before they&#39;ll give up their protections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most important question to ask whenever the authenticity of these type of events come into question. I can vaguely answer you on some ways that people could benefit from this shooting. (Note: I am not saying any of the below is fact, just possibilities)</p>

<p>-Reignites fear of islam, making it easier to gain public sympathy for the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; and related foreign policy, of which public support is dropping</p>

<p>-Reignites the gun debate and is fuel for the &quot;ban assault weapons&quot; fire (see current filibuster on capital hill) and divides people on where they stand on this issue</p>

<p>-Prompts negative responses from those known to publicly be islamaphobic (see Trump&#39;s response and how it shines positive light on Clinton and Obama who are pushing solidarity and gun control). This is a very hot button issue between the upcoming candidates and sharply divides them.</p>

<p>-Spreads fear, making it easier to push legislation for arming local authorities with military weapons and equipment they should otherwise never have access to. </p>

<p>-Favors the debate about how the gov&#39;t needs more freedom/less red tape to spy on US citizens. Gains sympathy for pushing related legislature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The election is an illusion also. You have to see past the false flag, and the election. If these people wanted to remove our guns, they would invoke martial law at once... but they know a war will start on american soil (a real war), and if they move too quickly without hiding behind the puppets, everyone will wake up to the entire plan.</p>

<p>No matter who wins, the plan still progresses. I just hope Trump puts his foot down. They can&#39;t buy off an already billionaire. It will be another JFK in the making if he goes against the NWO.</p>

It&#39;s also a major hub for old <em>company</em> retirees, mostly the cowboy types. Many, many upper military retirees. Several of the top lawyers in the US live there, along with several top Democratic heavies. Not to mention the nuclear power plant on the island, and it also being the only inlet with no radar or coast guard coverage for miles...(real easy to go back and forth from the Bahamas without hassle.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lot of strange things about this one:</p>

<p>Shooter was wanna be cop with gun training and worked for mysterious security company - he also said there were 3 snipers outside, other reports of a second shooter inside - also his Dad is some kind of Afghanistan activist who had a TV show and had been welcomed into various important gov&#39;t offices in DC</p>

<p>He was pro ISIS yet also a latent homosexual  - conflating two of the most potent issues with the fact that he also used an assault type rifle which he legally bought - so 3 of the biggest most divisive issues in one</p>

<p>2 previous fbi investigations of him went nowhere</p>

<p>Not many ppl shown being evacuated for a club w 300 ppl</p>

<p>No pictures of the bloody crime scene or the damage in general</p>

<p>A military vet is now being praised as a hero who saved 70 lives - similar to the Oregon military hero - also the hero said he opened a door to let people out - meanwhile there were one or two other guys who admitted pushing doors shut, even as people were banging on it to exit - how many exit doors does this place have?</p>

<p>And once again, the witnesses/survivors who were interviewed, none were hysterical and crying - just like every other mass shooting lately - they were remarkably calm and composed</p>

<p>!<strong>Meanwhile</strong>  if you watch the new ESPN OJ documentary, they show 2 bodies nearly beheaded, a vast amount of blood, and family members and friends on both sides who were emotionally wrecked and sobbing </p>

<p>Oh, also the gay white guy in LA who was caught with an arsenal supposedly in a vague strange story with various allegations that he said he was ties to Orlando</p>

<p>Also no video or club camera footage of the action and carnage</p>

<p>Also CNN just had on a local tv producer there who also said he called him proclaiming allegiance to isis - and that shooter was searching Facebook while in the club for info news on it - yet nobody took him down or escaped</p>

<p>He also apparently killed all the Latinos there while letting all the black ppl go</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It strikes me the attacker was above all mentally ill. His terrorism claims were deeply intermixed with his illness, but to the extent he recognized his illness he likely ascribed it to the dysfunction of American society itself, perhaps even as a conspiratorially-directed attack against himself and others by unseen political forces.</p>

<p>It may also be that humdrum home-life had become secondary to him as he entered deeper and deeper into an Internet-enveloped fantasy world of psychosomatic dependence, which in itself was a sort of virtual medication for his dysphoric and depressive states. The Internet-filtered ‘ontology’ became more real, more directing, than actual reality, which either was the source of the dysphoria, or could do little to compete against the narcotic and palliating power against said dysphoria afforded by the Internet. The Internet, as a narcotizing agent-cum-source of ‘semiotic reality’, afforded a toxic blend of narcotized or intensely psychosomaticized ideas, namely the subconscious desire to become permanently integrated into its now indispensable virtuality, an occurrence which could be ‘materialized’ through his own dematerialization, i.e. death, via a heinous yet socially (and perhaps even historically) significant traumatic event: i.e. an extremely high ‘kill score’ attack tinged with potentially highly resonant and delineating political messaging. Indeed, as the killer was in the midst of his attack, it has been reported, he repeatedly checked Facebook and other online media for reflexive manifestations of his attack, yet the Internet was not simply a mirror of his acts, but the impulser of his feelings and thoughts, i.e the primary prism of his personal reality–his death during the unforgettably devastating attack would insure that his life would be ‘uploaded’ to the highest degree informationally and technologically possible onto the Internet, he would finally be fully integrated into his primary, most real, essential and necessary sphere of existence. He would lose his soul, according to normal human quotidian accounting, but enter the ‘heaven’ of an enveloping virtuality where everything was permissible, relative, and forgiven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/4ox7s5/a_suggestion_why_orlando_police_did_not_more/">Police didn&#39;t enter PULSE b/c they were afraid of contracting HIV/AIDS?</a></p>

<p>It has been noted, and photos verify, that a number of police were present at the Pulse nightclub but did not enter the facility. I want to broach the unpleasant subject of why they likely did not. I do this because I believe it has not been explored by the press  and becuase I believe it results from a set of beliefs that is largely unexamined and should be brought to the collective consciousness and resolved to everyone&#39;s benefit. </p>

<p>In the past decade, as HIV/AIDS worked itself into the fabric of life, police, fire and health workers have become indoctrinated in  at least two new beliefs, one very general and one specific to AIDS/HIV:</p>

<p>a) It is not worth risking my life in any situation,</p>

<p>b) I should avoid <em>any</em> potential contact with HIV/AIDS pathogens. </p>

<p>I believe (a) is perhaps reasonable for health workers but not for police and fire. However this is merely my personal belief. Twenty years ago or further police and fire would have risked life and limb to save someone but unfortunately, those days are largely gone. But this is not my main point. </p>

<p>(b) has become an embedded belief. Today police will put on gloves and surgical masks before handling anyone who even potentially has HIV/AIDS. The attitude is one of zero risk tolerance. </p>

<p>Fast forward to the PULSE nightclub. Police know there is a shooter inside and that many people have been shot. There is blood on their bodies, on the floors, on the walls, and <em>in</em> <em>the</em> <em>air</em> <em>itself</em>. The club is known to be a gay club. <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2010/09/26/study-20-of-homosexual-men-are-hiv-positive-but-only-half-know-it/">CDC estimates that 20% of gay males have HIV</a>.  Cops know that if a bullet pierces someone with HIV and then strikes them, they may  be exposed to HIV. The shooter is using a rifle (larger, high-velocity round more likely to penetrate). </p>

<p>Given this situation, it is my belief that most police simply would not enter the building and would instead wait. At best SWAT, who have body armor (and breathing equipment that filters air-borne pathogens) only would enter the facility. At worst police would never enter at all but would wait until the shooter is driven out (by smoke grenades etc.) and, even then, would wait until they could put on masks and gloves (if not full HAZMAT suits) before entering the nightclub to aid victims or to gather forensic evidence. </p>

<p>Now <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/aerosols.htm">there is no documented case of a medical worker getting HIV/AIDS from aerosol (airborne) pathogens</a>, so I question that one could catch HIV/AIDS from breating airborne pathogens, but I am no expert. </p>

<p>So I bring this out as a potential reason why officers were so reluctant to storm PULSE nightclub but would likely be more willing to storm a non-gay nightclub. </p>

<p>If this conjecture is true, then it is an unfortunate reality and it falls even more upon the gay community to protect itself from such destruction, since they may be unable to rely on police for protection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey fellow tin foil hats, can we change the word &quot;hoax&quot; while it may be true that some aspects don&#39;t add up, and it may be true it is used to distract us from issues, bills passing, other intentional mishaps of our governemnts, understand that real people die. And real people grieve. And (y)our messages of truth will go unheard if continue to insult people by saying it&#39;s a hoax, because hoax implies it didn&#39;t happen, or everyone is in on it. Just because something was staged doesn&#39;t mean everyone was involved. I mean 3000 people died in 9/11 and yet ALL aspects point to we were lied to. But it wasn&#39;t a hoax. Just like Orlando wasn&#39;t a hoax. There may be serious problems with how it&#39;s handled but let&#39;s change our terminology please?</p>

<p>The most important cases that need help first will be in the building in critical condition. </p>

<p>The less severe cases will be people who got out and fled with superficial or even serious wounds but not to the point of being on the brink of death. </p>

<p>People returning to the area for medical care after getting out and running to safety makes sense in such a large casualty shooting. </p>

<p>There aren&#39;t enough paramedics and EMT P qualified fire fighters or ambulances to deal with that many people and go to them. Setting up a spot for it is making the best of a bad situation and standard procedure for medics. </p>
