    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been coming for a while. Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve been seeing it: the awakening process for humankind is unfolding. Part of that process is clearing old patterns from our collective consciousness. These violent acts are the symptoms of that clearing, as latent personal issues are pushed forcefully to the surface, causing some people with severe repressed issues to snap.</p>

<p>This actually triggers a positive cycle, because the violence brings this repression into the spotlight, allowing us to collectively discuss it and address it, which means we make further progress in clearing these issues from humanity.</p>

<p>If the issues are not fully cleared, then they will pop up again. In this way our collective consciousness is churning and congealing into something new and beautiful, but it all takes a bit of time to work out.</p>

<p>So, even while &quot;evil&quot; people are orchestrating violence with the goal of pumping up our fear and keeping us trapped in it, we have the opportunity to see that this strategy is truly futile, because ultimately these tragic events will bring us the understanding we need in order to love each other for real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At risk of sounding complacent, it&#39;s unfathomable to think that these oligarchs are going to get their way in the end. It&#39;s no secret that the federal government is out of control, and they simply won&#39;t be able to get enough Americans to hold each other down. I guess the real concern would be UN peacekeeping troops or whatever secret military they could be drumming up.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see FEMA camps happening, I don&#39;t see martial law being declared (or at least, enforced in the way we imagine), and I don&#39;t see Obama in a third term. This stuff seems like fantasies of the elites.</p>

<p>While not everyone knows about what&#39;s going on with the false flags, Americans are resolute and won&#39;t be giving up their guns. Which is key - however, more of us need to keep our senators and reps informed that we know what&#39;s going on and the jig is up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...they&#39;re trying to do it &quot;legally&quot; by tossing Hillary Clinton in. She&#39;s the only one they can trust fully to go along with the global gameplan. I still don&#39;t know what role Trump is playing, other than just being a guy who actually seems worse than Clinton.</p>

<p>If somehow Clinton does get indicted and booted from the nomination, then I don&#39;t think Trump is a shoe-in - something else will happen. It&#39;s interesting!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure if something big is coming. It certainly looks like we should feel that way: either positive &amp; hopeful, or terrified &amp; negative. I&#39;ve heard a lot of people say they feel it, but I&#39;m just not so convinced anymore. I wonder if every generation feels that they are on the cusp of something, if maybe it&#39;s human nature. </p>

<p>A lot of people are waking up to new ideas now. As <a href="/u/many-one">/u/many-one</a> said, so much of what&#39;s going on is an apparent catylist for real change. I am on the fence though, about it being a major hella shitstorm of crazy, or a nice slow progress toward newness. </p>

<p>Whatever happens, we can definitely say we live in interesting times. </p>

In world war 2 they didn&#39;t call it a world war, and the average German only knew what was going on by word of the government, like today the only thing you know about the middle east and what is happening there comes from the media which equals the government : we are being attacked and our way of life is in danger so anything we do is to protect you, don&#39;t ask questions and preferably join the military </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, I genuinely liked the point you were making.  Mike Rivero talks about this topic frequently and seems to believe we are in ww3 already and the USA will be the nazis when history is written.  I&#39;m on the fence, while I am fully aware of the innocent lives our aggressive foreign policy has decimated over the last 15 years, the World Wars were such mass casualty events; even relative to the 1 million+ Iraqis and countless others in Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan etc, the world wars were huge.  I don&#39;t think we are there quite yet, if anything I believe we are in the second or third phase of a multiphased, very protracted war.  Future history books may end up referring to this as the &quot;130 year war&quot; with complex timelines and everything.  We have re-entered the dark ages and the length and scope of our wars will reflect that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is like I have detailed in my threads but I keep getting down voted, I try so hard to get all the evidence I can, send it wherever I can, to as many people as possible, but everyone just gets some information from the FBI that &quot;he&#39;s linked to ISIS&quot; or &quot;His wife was involved&quot; and they freak out and say &quot;I KNEW IT&quot; while losing sight on the big picture.</p>

<p>They are assassinating people en mass across the globe and they do their best to hide this, events like these are just to keep us distracted, I feel really sad, I wish people would listen.</p>

<p>If they would even get a grasp of the amount of people killed last week and who exactly they were, they would be standing up, but with all this distraction it gets lost they have been killing 100s of people, and that is just what we know of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck man I would but it&#39;s such an effort I found so many already and establishing links but I would need help, I asked for help but people just down voted me when I made a thread.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just sad, but I&#39;m not giving up I&#39;m working day and night to tie it all together and document deaths, hostage situations they claim and when SWAT arrives &quot;there is none&quot;</p>

<p>Even a man who saw his mother/sister/father shot and the father was linked to a law firm nearby who does litigation against the government for a host of shit they try.</p>

<p>It really is a lot and I will keep trying to get this out, but any attempts to call for help &quot;hur dur move on&quot; so whatever, I&#39;ll keep compiling information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they officially took over the US via continuity of government on 9/11 and since then the shadow government has been running things. Bush (after 9/11) and Obama were not actually anything other than puppets running the fake show to keep people in the dark about the fact that the shadow government never gave the country back after taking it over on 9/11. </p>

<p>Look it up. </p>

I hate prediction threads, that is why I left out a date.  Just a bunch of crazy stuff going on, feels like predictive programming leading up to the &quot;main event&quot; if you will.
