<p>To normal people, there&#39;s no red flag. In a society where guns are widely available, it makes sense that those guns would be used against innocent people occasionally, especially when you factor in the number of bad and hateful people in the world. In fact it would be weirder if it never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you have no standard of evidence (otherwise you would have answered a simple hypothetical by now), you&#39;re asking us to meet a burden of proof that can&#39;t be met and then you&#39;re using that as proof of a conclusion that you already reached.

<p>But why wouldn&#39;t the (shadow) government trust actors? The government knows most people are sheeple unable to look through the lies, no matter how crappy actors are used. They can break character all they want (and they do, just watch the clips), but the sheeple still believe the events are entirely real. And people questioning said events are called lunatics. Precisely what the government wants, and precisely the reason they keep using the crappiest (cheapest) amateur actors they can find. Why waste money on good actors when crappy ones will suffice? </p>

They probably do the real thing, at least in some cases, but the people interviewed afterwards are typically not real eye witnesses, but actors who deliver the propaganda lines Anderson Cooper and the rest of their CIA handlers tell them to deliver. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, they get recognized. So what? Why would that be a problem? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like people believe us conspiracy theorists when we point out that crisis actors are a real thing anyway. </p>

<p>&quot;I know that guy, I went to acting school with him, he&#39;s an actor, he&#39;s acting now.&quot;  <em>points at screen</em></p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, sure he is ... lunatic.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch this. If this isn&#39;t enough proof for you that actors are being used during and after these staged events, then I can&#39;t help you anymore. Sorry: </p>

<p>A lot of people are starting to call the bluff. Those people are called a lot of things by a lot of people, including &quot;lunatic&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I believe you, that actors are being used to personalize victims, but I&#39;m not convinced of the degree your are talking about. It&#39;s one thing to carry a dude 100 ft to give media some nice footage, but a different thing to go on camera under a fake name and tell a fake story about yourself that everyone you know will be able to see through. But I&#39;ve underestimated the publics gullibility before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. Do you really think the government would trust actors who could theoretically break character at any time? I believe the government was behind it and there may have been some actors but there were (I think at least) some real injuries inflicted upon unsuspecting people just to keep it seeming real. </p>
