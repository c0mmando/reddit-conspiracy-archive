       It's less a case of blind acceptance and more a case of the alternative being much stranger. Like Truman Show levels of strangeness.

       To normal people, there's no red flag. In a society where guns are widely available, it makes sense that those guns would be used against innocent people occasionally, especially when you factor in the number of bad and hateful people in the world. In fact it would be weirder if it never happened.

       Doesn't it make you wonder about your position if it has no standard of evidence and is not falsifiable? If no piece of evidence is good enough, what's the point of asking for it? Why should anyone engage you in any evidence-based discussion at all?

       Where did I say I had evidence? I was very clear from the beginning that I was just curious about what evidence  would hypothetically convince you. No one has been able to answer me openly and honestly, which makes me think that no evidence would. This kind of fallacious tactic a very common feature of sophistry.

       Since you have no standard of evidence (otherwise you would have answered a simple hypothetical by now), you're asking us to meet a burden of proof that can't be met and then you're using that as proof of a conclusion that you already reached. This is a logical fallacy known as demanding impossible perfection or moving the goal posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no reason for anyone to engage with you, and your disingenuous demands for evidence are meaningless. I could use the same tactic to "prove" that the statue of liberty isn't real.

       I don't think that's true. Do you really think the government would trust actors who could theoretically break character at any time? I believe the government was behind it and there may have been some actors but there were (I think at least) some real injuries inflicted upon unsuspecting people just to keep it seeming real.

       But why wouldn't the (shadow) government trust actors? The government knows most people are sheeple unable to look through the lies, no matter how crappy actors are used. They can break character all they want (and they do, just watch the clips), but the sheeple still believe the events are entirely real. And people questioning said events are called lunatics. Precisely what the government wants, and precisely the reason they keep using the crappiest (cheapest) amateur actors they can find. Why waste money on good actors when crappy ones will suffice?

       It's a combination. They probably do the real thing, at least in some cases, but the people interviewed afterwards are typically not real eye witnesses, but actors who deliver the propaganda lines Anderson Cooper and the rest of their CIA handlers tell them to deliver.

       Thanks! I believe you, that actors are being used to personalize victims, but I'm not convinced of the degree your are talking about. It's one thing to carry a dude 100 ft to give media some nice footage, but a different thing to go on camera under a fake name and tell a fake story about yourself that everyone you know will be able to see through. But I've underestimated the publics gullibility before.
