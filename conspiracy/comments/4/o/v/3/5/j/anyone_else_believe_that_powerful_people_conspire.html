        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just curious. How many people are there here that believe that intelligence agencies, organized crime, and other networks of people conspire all the time?</p>

<p>BUT - don&#39;t believe in &quot;the Illuminati&quot; or that &quot;Rothschilds and Jesuits run the world?&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Masonic symbolism has any significance in the current age. I don&#39;t think that the Catholic Church and the Jesuits have all that much power anymore. I don&#39;t think the &quot;occult&quot; is anything other than outdated superstition.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that anyone other than very religious orthodox Jews cares about the Talmud.</p>

<p>The Illuminati was a sub-group of the Masons in the late 1770s - one of many, many similar groups that were interested in fomenting revolutions against the traditional monarchies of Europe and installing republics. It worked famously in France. The Illuminati itself was busted by the authorities and was shut down.</p>

<p>Freemasons were still a somewhat powerful network in America until about the 1960s, when TV killed off all of the old time social fraternities. Most Masons just listened to philosophic lectures and drank beer at Shriner parties. They hadn&#39;t been political for 200 years.</p>

<p>Skull &amp; Bones is just a fraternity for rich kids at Yale. The CIA recruits the same people that join Skull &amp; Bones - because they are rich kids from established families.</p>

<p>Bohemian Grove is just an old fashioned Burning Man for rich people. </p>

<p>NSA and the CIA, Edward Snowden, the Fortune 500 companies, mercenary groups - these are the kinds of things that explain what happens in the modern world.</p>

<p>Religion, the &quot;occult,&quot; the Jesuits - none of that stuff has any relevance outside of history.</p>

<p>Anyone else?</p>

<p>While that logic might comfort one&#39;s confirmation bias, it doesn&#39;t actually tell us anything of value, though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Certainly. The term became a popular stand in for all-or-nothing conspiracy theory after Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s <em>Illuminatus! Trilogy</em> in the 1970s.</p>

<p>The point of my example is it is not necessary for those doing the ritual that all of those witnessing it have any knowledge of it. The same could certainly be true to the Burning Man events. What &quot;looks cool on shrooms&quot; to you might have a very different meaning to others. </p>

<p>What you seem to be advocating for is simple coincidence theory. Once you consider the preponderance of evidence available on the Internet for these occult events, if you are math inclined, they are undeniably purposeful. </p>

<p>It&#39;s theater. You interpret that symbolism as &quot;occult&quot; while everyone else interprets it as &quot;cool looking&quot; or &quot;artistic.&quot;</p>

<p>In some cases, Hollywood and the music industry KNOW that some people see the symbolism as &quot;occult&quot; so they put it in there on purpose to get you talking about it.</p>

<p>Just like the heavy metal bands of the 1980s would use all sorts of &quot;Satanic&quot; symbolism, so preachers would denounce them and the kids would rush out and buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How many people are there here that believe that [power brings corruption] BUT - don&#39;t believe [secret society conspiracy theory]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I summarize correctly? I wanted to eliminate the specifics, since you seemed to be asking a more general question.</p>

<p>I would say yes to that. I&#39;m a Freemason, and in part I joined <em>because I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist</em>. When I started to meet actual Masons, they were anything but what I&#39;d been told to expect, and so I felt I had to learn more. That was years ago, now, and I feel I understand the Fraternity well enough to say that the bulk of secret society conspiracy theory is nonsense.</p>

<p>But power corrupts and always has. Freemasons aren&#39;t immune to that corrosive force, even if I like to think that we&#39;re a bit more resistant. That&#39;s exactly why the Fraternity has no central power structure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think Masonic symbolism has any significance in the current age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm... I&#39;d partially agree. I think the meaning behind that symbolism has something to teach all of us, but you can&#39;t go gish galloping through popular culture, trolling for anything that can relate to Freemasonry and find the secret masters of fandom and their compulsive hint-dropping, certainly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think the &quot;occult&quot; is anything other than outdated superstition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I have to strongly disagree, but then I&#39;m aware of the subtleties in that word. When most people think of the occult, they think of 19th century cocktail party popular culture: seances, ouija  boards and artless uses of astrological, alchemical and tarot symbolism to predict when someone would find a mate. Sure, that&#39;s all bunk.</p>

<p>But the occult isn&#39;t that, or rather that&#39;s just the occult through the warped lens of popular culture (a bit like judging computer science by 90s hacker movies). The word occult simply means knowledge that&#39;s hidden behind the veil of initiation. Every monastic order&#39;s teachings; every initiatory society; every school in the world up to about the 18th century; ... these are all initiatic institutions and their teachings, no matter what they are, by definition, are &quot;occult.&quot;</p>

<p>Like many words that have come to mean less than they were coined to represent, this is confusing in a modern context when talking about historical organizations and events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Illuminati was a sub-group of the Masons in the late 1770s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not. They were a stand-alone group, created by someone who, in part, based his ideas on an initiatic society on exposes of Freemasonry. But there was no contact between the two initially. Eventually he joined Freemasonry as well in order to try to recruit members, but that didn&#39;t work out so well, as Freemasons turn out to not be all that thrilled with quasi-Masonic groups which we refer to as &quot;clandestine.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freemasons were still a somewhat powerful network in America until about the 1960s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It actually varied quite a lot. Freemasonry in the early days of the US (late 18th and very early 19th century) was riding high on the association between the founding fathers and the Fraternity (though many of the founding fathers were not Masons, that didn&#39;t dissuade the public from enshrining the Fraternity as a part of our cultural identity for a good 30 years.</p>

<p>Then there was the anti-Masonic period that lasted for about 20 years, and the return from that was slow, really only gaining momentum after the Civil War and going into what would be called the Golden Age of Fraternalism a the end of the 19th century (when it was not uncommon for a man to be a member of 2, 3 even as many as 6 fraternal organizations!)</p>

<p>Then membership plummeted during the Great Depression as people focused on their families and  financial well-being. Post-WWII, numbers swelled again and the Fraternity returned to national relevance, but those numbers began declining (per capita) in 1955 and were on the general decline (as an absolute number of Masons) from 1960 until the 2000s when the loss of members began to level off, and may have begun to reverse... but time will tell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They hadn&#39;t been political for 200 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is basically true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bohemian Grove is just an old fashioned Burning Man for rich people.</p>

<p>Shh! Don&#39;t give away their secrets! ;-)</p>

<p>So, I agree with much of what you had to say, but I just have more first-hand experience with the fraternal side of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think of it as being a term like &quot;Anonymous&quot;... anyone can claim to be, or be accused of being &quot;Anonymous&quot; (the hackers) because there is no actual group. It&#39;s just a label people use.</p>

<p>Same thing for &quot;Illuminati&quot; - there is no organisation that people join and become &quot;Illuminati&quot;. There are powerful people conspiring together (and often against each other) that the rest of us <em>call</em> &quot;Illuminati&quot;, but the &quot;membership&quot; is constantly changing as those powerful people&#39;s interests align or diverge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he shouldn&#39;t.  It&#39;s disinfo.  And no if you watch what jacks1000 says, it&#39;s very clear that he <em>consistently opposes any hints of freemasonry or jesuit or catholic conspiracy</em> in any / all of the posts you come across.  This is well-beyond any &#39;hey guys I have an idea...maybe...<em>this</em>&#39;</p>

<p>No he&#39;s got an agenda it&#39;s clear.  That gives me a red flag.  I believe the opposite of everything he&#39;s said; that all this globalism is a coordination of the above with coporations engaged in kingmaking, insider trading, playing both sides of a hegelian world chessboardism  </p>

<p>You see when you have a network of double agents within the CIA (knights of malta freemasons working with jesuits), then you enable insider trading that is international, with an incentive and a &#39;support network&#39; of &#39;event planners&#39; who can manipulate markets by &#39;knowing ahead of time&#39; certain facts caused by their own events.  This has been proven, and they (freemasons, knights of malta) were caught doing it several times before in propaganda due and gladio.</p>

<p>You have intergovernmental interference of inquiries into these groups through financial auditing operations like the FBI&#39;s Operation Green Quest that is hijacked by homeland security and whose documents are summarily destroyed, closing the investigation.</p>

<p>These things happen because of power networks that are &#39;above and beyond&#39; our traditional governmental bodies and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>That &#39;above and beyond&#39; are everyone jacks mentioned.  </p>

<p>Anyone who studies history and reads actual books would know this.  But if you want a crash course listen to the entire Mae Brussell archive starting with knights of malta, masons, propaganda due, opus dei and all that.  You&#39;ll get a very good idea of who started all this nonsense and how 9/11 was a fascist freemason-jesuit, neocon coup de&#39;etat by cheney, rummy and bush sr. puppettering jr who was a &#39;useful idiot&#39; in all of it.    Everything will make sense when you get the connections from Allen Dulles to Bush and from there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say there is no &quot;all-powerfull secret society&quot; - there are multiple &quot;secret societies&quot; - and some not-so-secret - that have various amounts of power. The intel agencies, certain business networks. The Mexican Drug Cartels.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about that. The assassinations of political figures often have intelligence agencies, organized crime groups, or opposition parties behind them. Of course, it&#39;s just another form of war.</p>

<p>America was able to build the atomic bomb without it being leaked.  Look into how that was done.  </p>

<p>When you start talking about a hypothetical massive world wide powerful hidden elite, I dont know that your assertion holds that much weight.</p>

<p>Ill brainstorm a little.</p>

<ul>
<li>Segment tasks so that people dont actually have any idea of what they are working on.</li>
<li>Obtain dirt on people to keep them in line (sex with children on camera perhaps)</li>
<li>Kill people who get out of line</li>
<li>Have control of all major media outlets so whistleblowers are limited in the damage they can do.</li>
<li>Have control over politicians, police and judges, todestroy the credibility of enemies, whistleblowers etc. </li>
<li>Cover the internet in false information  to dilute the real information out there. ( they wouldnt have to make up info by the way, just throw a combined 10 million dollars at about 100 random nutjobs who are completely wrong with what they think.)</li>
</ul>
