<p>My question is this: although I believe they exist, how is their silence bought? </p>

<p>Rigged Lotto wins shared amongst them is one theory. The threat of death is an obvious other. </p>

<p>But even with those two and more reasons surely ONE have them would have spoken out by now? Is there an example of any of them doing this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure. I think it is amazing some of the evidence that people present in support of crisis acting. It is compelling stuff. But then I get to thinking, and an old saying stands out to me, one we&#39;ve all heard before: &quot;Reality is stranger than fiction.&quot; I think about events in my own life, and I think, yeah that&#39;s true. I think many of the people that come off seeming like actors really are just that odd. Other &quot;evidence&quot; just lacks the proper context. In the end the crux of the news is probably all for real. It would be just too damn difficult to orchestrate that level of fakery and never get caught.</p>

<p>Now that being said, I would not at all be surprised if a few people are snuck in here and there to push a narrative, and there&#39;s plenty of evidence that people who happened to be involved are coerced to keep quiet and/or stick to a certain narrative. And that certain events and people involved are setup in one fashion or another. That can work b/c the people in the know are few, and the events that play out are mostly as they appear. Take Orlando, it would not surprise me to learn that the FBI targeted Mateen for one of their setup stings, but he went &quot;off-leash&quot; on them. I would also not be surprised to learn that there are drugs that can be used to make people more homicidal. The San Bernardino case is one that really stands out to me. It would have been rather easy for three men to kidnap that couple, perform the shooting pretending to be them, and then let them out on the street a few hours later half-drugged to be shot up. Far fetched perhaps, but the evens the official narrative present are far fetched too. And since they haven&#39;t released any security camera footage, why would we believe them? Actually that&#39;s what gets me the most. Why doesn&#39;t the government release the footage? In this day in age there has to be tons of footage, and we see so very little. That bothers me.</p>

<p>Then either before or after the gig, when they inquire about payment, big brother says, oh about that.... Here&#39;s your meager sum for work done. Here is also a list of all the sick porn sites you search, the people you had affairs with, phone numbers you&#39;ve called, all the horrible things that the NSA/Google/Reddit has on you.

<p>No one died at sandy hook. that was the first where families were assembled. Boston was fake as fuck, what you saw was fireworks, you can even see the launch tubes. Orlando is fake as well. You will begin to recognize the patterns as they amp up these manufactured terror events whilst the empire continues to decay. </p>

<p>So if those high authority / high trust whistleblowers aren&#39;t listened to, what makes you think Joe Gaydodger is going to be listened to?  Seriously.  We have ALL THE DATA and we cannot connect the dots.  Not at all.  These small time craiglist actors can yammer all day and nothing...i mean nothing will happen.</p>

<p>The measures some people will go to turn their brains off in order to justify a corrupt system is unfathomable. You can lead a horse to water.  And then you can watch it die of dehydration.  Sitting there watching this horse for 15 years being a complete and utter disability to itself.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong.  As a conspiracy theorist I know the problem is with the aliens.  I see the alien every time I look in the mirror, and don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re friendly.</p>
