<p>&quot;What can we do?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put aside the indoctrinated differences that have been brainwashed in us from birth and come together as the unified human species that we indeed are - independent of race, class, color, socioeconomic status, religion, education, etc, etc.</p>

<p>We do this, and fixing the planet would not be difficult.</p>

<p>Without doing this, however, little will ultimately get resolved because TPTB rely on the disunity they have put into us to remain in power and keep us dumb, immobile, subservient, and enslaved to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about w/regard to &quot;slavs&quot;.  Slavs or no slavs, billions of humans have been murdered throughout the species&#39; existence.  Independent of this, I&#39;ve no problem with what I said above - and it&#39;s not &quot;idealistic thinking&quot; to me.  It&#39;s how I am.  Perhaps someone like you would call it &quot;idealistic <em>being&quot;</em>?  Regardless, as I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;m certainly not the smartest person in any room, and I don&#39;t see myself as being much different than anyone else, so the fact that I can understand the concept of human unity I mentioned above indicates to me that it&#39;s not some sort of &quot;far out&quot; idea that no one else can possibly wrap their head around.</p>

<p>A proper modus operandi is needed in order to accomplish what I talked about, and your stupid hippy girl reference is...well, just that.  Stupid.  That&#39;s not the way to do things either and is a huge straw man fallacy, as it doesn&#39;t have much of anything to do with what I&#39;m referring to.</p>

If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8 This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.</p>
