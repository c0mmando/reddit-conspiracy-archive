       Vote out. 
1) The world isn't ready for super states as extreme poverty, wars and climate change has shown. We need to financially promote  worldwide peace, sustainable industry and equality before setting up huge multinational governments that are impossible to change.
2) The UK government is nulled the EU court. The EU president is not elected and isn't even known to most citizens, but their laws supersede national laws. Rules such as cucumber shapes (yes really) may seem trivial but set precedent to how controlling the EU will become without our say in how to laws are set. 
3) I don't know if immigration is overcrowding the UK. Look at the house prices, doctor availability, job pay etc in your area. But EU immigration law means that people from overseas are entitled to the same benefits as residential tax payers. In this system how can services like NHS, job seekers allowance, working benefits, free education, business start up funds, pension contributions, emergency services and public transport subsidies (and probably more) be run effectively when non contributors get the same benefits out of them? 
4) IF voting out means we leave the free market there could be tariffs on EU exports which will affect the economy exporting to Europe. The tariffs would take years, at least two, before taking effect. Either the price for EU exports will increase or profit decrease for those particular businesses. But in turn we would place tariffs on imports from EU meaning the UK companies would sell more internally and of course can set up trade deals globally which we currently can't and the whole economy would be much better off. I don't think the EU tariffs would even be set up as 1 the EU sells more to us than us them and 2 they won't want a rival marketplace that would entice other members to leave. 
5) Voting in isn't the status quo. The EU will keep adding members and making laws you have no say in with no accountability. By ensuring the UK stays independent means we can control our own resources, army and government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many more reasons but these are the main ones. I like Europe and Europeans but we need to control our own country by voting out on Independence Day 23rd June 2016

       You counter a statement that you would otherwise agree with because it takes a neutral stance at progression as a species aand doesn't fit a nationalistic agenda? That's disgusting. If you want to live in qn angry closed off box, then that is your prerogative, but it does no good for the prospects of all humqnity and will eventually lead back to where we are now. The answer is real change and not allowing someone to control you and your ideology by preying upon your passion and creating a boogyman out of someone who is a different color, or a different shape.

       I think Britain should leave the EU for the same reasons the guy qbove you posted. An EU like federation is possible once we've reached a social maturity not based from greed qnd power. If you honestly don't feel we can get there; then humanity is doomed qnd this vote reqlly doesn't matter anyway.

       Just like the pissed off plebs of the red army, or the pissed off plebs of the nazi party your anger will be used as a means to push someone elses political agenda and ideology, and we will wind up exactly where we are today if not worse.

       When you say anger is heqlthy you show your own ignorance, anger is not healthy. Quite the opposite, anger can lead to high stress levels, high blood pressure, and a higher heart rate all of which puts more strain on your heart and is otherwise unhealthy.

       If Britain doesn't leave the EU, the unelected bureaucrats who run the EU will assume that the British are all tame snakes who can be twisted around any which way without biting back. It will get a lot worse, and very quickly. Britain really has no choice -- if you want any political independence at all, you have to get out, now. If you want to preserve your culture, what's left of it, you have to get out, now.

       It's an undemocratic, failed economic project designed to consolidate power in Brussels...U.K has the 5th largest economy, a huge trade surplus with Europe and only 10% of the U.K economy trades in Europe....
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget how EU law supercedes parliamentary democracy by imposing law without the mechanism to remove unwanted elected officials..... time to leave me thinks!!!

       We had the 5th largest economy when we joined, which was primarily for economic reasons. Really it's thanks to the eu that we stayed up in that position

       Really...? Look at the EU's growth for the last decade... it's failing and about to hit another recession...

      <p>
       As I mentioned 90% of the U.K economy is trading outside of the EU... yet 100% of our economy has to live with the red tape... Alaska is the only place performing below the EU

       Is that why the EU still hasn't been able to agree a trade deal with China etc.. Not easy to trade with a union when you have to consider 28 member states!!!

       If you find there to be any value in the concepts of sovereignty and democracy, you must vote LEAVE.
      </p>

       The internationalist prototype vehicle to consolidate Europe nation states - the Soviet Union - was a failure and it was disbanded in 1991. No matter, the globalist elite already had plans for a bigger and better political Union, and the very next year (1992) the Maastricht Treaty came into being, and with it the European Union.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU would replace the EEC (1957-92) and be run by an unelected politburo in Brussels (called "the Commission") deciding overall policy for all member states, with the primary purpose of subsuming those states into a single EU superstate. There would be a sham Parliament or a "democratic beard" (the USSR had one too) to hide what would be a deeply anti-democratic system.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what we signed up to in 1992, although most people didn't really understand it at the time. And incredibly, millions of Brits still don't understand what the EU represents. Most Remainians think this referendum is asking them to state whether they "like Europe" or not. That is not the question being asked! I love Europe (but not the EU) and the British Isles will always be part of Europe (but hopefully not the EU), and I don't want my country to be ruled by a faceless, unelected EU politburo based in Brussels, any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The European Union is a sinister NWO plot, just like the USSR was. You have a once-only chance help the UK to extricate itself from this Orwellian dystopia on Thursday. Please use it.

       The two richest countries in Europe opted out of the EU (Norway &amp; Switzerland).
