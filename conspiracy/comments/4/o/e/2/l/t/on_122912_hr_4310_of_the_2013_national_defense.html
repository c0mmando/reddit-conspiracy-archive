       Propaganda can take on many forms. It can be a poster on the wall. It can be a movie, a commercial on TV or a sensationalized Staged Event.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.maxkeiser.com/2013/06/first-time-since-1948-propaganda-is-now-legal-in-the-u-s/">
        On 12/29/12, President Obama signed HR 4310, the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act.
       </a>
       Section 1078 of the bill authorizes the use of propaganda inside the US, which had previously been banned since 1948 when the Smith-Mundt Act was passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/feminist/files/2015/07/Mass-Shootings-Frequency.png">
        Since 12/29/12, the occurrences of mass Shootings and Terrorist Attacks that appear to be staged and or a sensationalized hoax have dramatically increased.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the sensationalized gun attacks have the anti-assault weapons propaganda woven into the MSM spin reporting of the events. And most of those will also contain an anti-Islamic/Muslim spin as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, lets move on to the rise of the biggest and well known anti-Islamic propaganda BS the MSM has to offer the brainwashed masses of the American citizenry,
       <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ISISAttacks_YearlyAttacks.png">
        The Rise of ISIS.
       </a>
       As you can plainly see, ISIS blasted off in 2013 right after President Obama signed HR 4310 and allowed the propagandizing of the American people to begin. So much of the ISIS propaganda looked as if it was produced by Hollywood itself.
      </p>

       </a>
       and terrorist attacks that appear to be hoaxes or staged events could all be theater productions for the brainwashing of an entire nation and the world.

       Those lights are super hot. It is not inconceivable that if they used 3M sticky stuff it would cause the adhesion to fail. As someone that has had news crews at my house before, they had us move pictures, furniture, etc to get a better "shot" /lighting. That is why the national news looks better than local news.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why they didn't react. They probably know that they moved pictures earlier and were equal parts amused and embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a better place to spend your time and effort. The US government is actively spying on your phone records, communications, and can "own" you any time they want. Let's focus on that.

       Kinda also weird that at the moment the picture hits the ground, couric says the word "pain."
      </p>
      <p>
       My bet is that the painting didn't fall at all.  There's a green screen behind them, and the falling painting and sound were added after.  This would make sense given their reaction is ... well ... nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All a coincidence?  Small chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Futhermore, the falling picture grabs the watcher's attention.  The word and sentence Couric was saying and is about to say are distinct from the rest of the interview for this reason.

       Watch out for these magic tricks is all I can say.

       I always thought this was the stupidest thing ever.  Obviously this guy wasn't beheaded because a picture fell off a wall 2000 miles away.  They didn't react because they knew they were on national TV&gt;

       So you posted it as bait for reactions, and so assumptions would be made. With the little context we have its safe to assume you agree with the video, why else would such a shit video be your favorite. My guess would be your just trolling though, you knew how people would respond, and you wanted them to.

       To be fair, the context of this thread is propaganda and the core of that video is also propaganda, whether you buy the agenda or not (i.e., filming on a set --》 shitty hanging and sideways picture).

       Also the fact that ISIS claims responsibility for every shooting that could maybe be a terrorist attack around the world, only to have the media confirm it with no solid evidence. I believe they are one and the same.

       It's important to note that the terminology/definition for a mass shooting was changed in this time period as well, and to dissect the information on each individual shooting and whether it really is a "mass shooting" or just more gang related crime that other Administration's without such an anti-gun agenda wouldn't really care about categorizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I agree, under Obama shit has really hit the fan. He's a complete failure as a President, and for the sake of not going into a 2000 word rant on why I'll just leave it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason a majority of Veteran's and military personnel do not like him, we can sniff out bullshit and people who lack integrity pretty easily because of the high standard we held each other to during service...Obama didn't pass the sniff test the first time I saw him on TV.

       I'm not saying you're wrong about Obama, but didn't GWB win a wide majority of the military vote? Twice?

       The current POTUS generally receives a large portion of the military vote during a time of war because guys who are deployed have their unit write in their ballots without actually ever choosing their candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think GWB is behind a bunch of shady shit, I think you're wrong. His behavior to this day says otherwise, which is why most military personnel are endeared to him. I think the people around him manipulated his behavior (Powell specifically), and I think that while he's a rather charismatic individual he was a bit naive in giving complete trust over to people in his administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no easy answer in politics, the alternative wasn't exactly great from a military perspective. A lot of us wanted Bush Jr. to stay in office because we were personally invested in OIF and OEF at that point and felt an obligation to see it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're in the military, the last thing you have time for is musing over conspiracy theories. What's going on in the civilian world, or even back home is kind of a non-issue. You've got more important shit to think about in the here and now, one of the reasons so many Veteran's and active duty personnel like the military is because it gives them purpose in life, to the point of forums like these being total petty bullshit.

       Just so I am clear, what you believe is that GW Bush is generally innocent of misdoings during his administration, and Colin Powell was the main force in making his administration do bad "shady" things?

       I've never heard that theory before. People often point the finger at Cheney and Rumsfeld, but I've never heard Bush Sr implicated like that.

       Bush Junior seems like the perfect embodiment of the two usual views of bad government: either very incompetent or very evil.

       I think he was fairly incompetent, I think he won the election based on a rigged vote due to his family influence, and I think he was thrown into an extraordinary situation that he was not mentally prepared for by people in his administration who had this planned out without him having much knowledge of the fact.

       To this day he still attends all sorts of military and Veteran events, especially for Disabled Veterans that were a result of Combat.

       As a notation on your list, the San Bernardino shooting was real, and I don't believe it was a false flag. I live out here, it impacted the community pretty heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think ISIS have a very strong presence in other countries due to the internet, and why we haven't shut down their internet capabilities at the source is beyond me. They recruit from disenfranchised youth with recruiting ads that are on par with the Marine slaying the lava monster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Westerners from different countries have left their homes to go live as female sex slaves or male soldiers for ISIS, and it goes unreported.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DoD is fully aware that reaper drones only create more terrorists, why we don't have boots on the ground is beyond me. We should have never left Iraq or Afghanistan - we maintained a military presence in Germany for over 60 years after the fall of the Third Reich, we had a very good shot at giving Iraq and Afghanistan a semblance of a peaceful way of life under a non-dictatorship style Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       For whatever reason America rallied around a President promising to pull troops out and just created more turmoil. The rise of ISIS directly coincides with the draw down of the American military presence in Iraq and the inadequate training of Iraqi Police Forces who were left with a hefty payload of weapons of war that ISIS seized. It gave them a strong foothold against the only force really combatting terrorism in that region - the Peshmerga, since for whatever reason Obama requires all weapons going into Iraq and Syria come through Turkey - and Turkey is openly committing genocide of the Kurdish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       These weapons go directly to the hands of ISIS, not the intended place that fits the narrative our Administration wants the people to believe.

       You make it sound like we didn't keep stirring shit up in the Middle East after the Iraq withdrawal. Nobody knows how the withdrawal would have turned out if we didn't give insurgents Qaddafi's arsenal and did everything we could to destroy Syria. It's not like Obama and Clinton let people know that they weren't going to stop fucking around after the troops left Iraq.

       No one knows for sure, but best guesses show if we left and left for good - like never even touched it again - a different group, maybe not ISIS, but an Islamic caliphate group would pop up. Going in was a mistake to begin with. Leaving was as big of a mistake.

       Whose best guesses? You're suggesting that the Middle East would be just as unstable today if we hadn't toppled Qaddafi and supported the Syrian rebels, which doesn't make any sense. And you're ignoring that lots of people join jihadist groups because of our presence there. Those groups would have much less success recruiting people if the US and other countries weren't still spreading chaos.
