       are you serious? I would argue this is right up our ally here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       This murder will ensure that that the stay campaign wins, hands down there is no way that people will vote to exit seeing now that the Brexit bloc is now stained by this murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that the british government wants to stay. That large and powerful interests with access to mind control tools could have easily found a loner to reprogram.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they have the technology. We know they have no compunction about killing humans and seeing that they targeted a Labour Party politician, a woman with two small children, you could see how she was the perfect target. Look at the murder of Gareth Williams. We know that the powers that be are happy to murder even there own operatives in order to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Madmen killing politicians during a referendum are extremely rare. Like we're talking about all of the referendums out there that the number of politicians killed in relation to the campaign they were on would be a like 0.001%.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no its not crazy to think that this was not part of a wider campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its crazy to think it wasn't part of a wider campaign to ensure that England stays in the EU.

       Well they killed that poor woman for naught.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect though that the english electoral commission royally fucked up with postal votes, that there will be a big scandal and ultimately the push for a second referendum will gather pace where people will come back and vote to overwhelming to stay.
      </p>
      <p>
       After trillions have been lost, countries not even in the EU fucked over the english are awaking to an angry realisation that voting for brexit was a terrible mistake.

       I think they thought remain had it in the bag. And technically it did. See voting in the UK isn't compulsory, with over 47 million registered voters what this mean that over 14 million people failed to turn up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remain camp would have won easily had these people turned up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the remain camp were cocky. They didn't think to run the usual campaign of rigging the vote. They thought that millions od young people, with a vested interest of having access to visa free / jobs / across Europe would get up and vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just like Bernie the fucking youth failed to rock up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exit camp won because they knew that implied racism a'la trump "taking back control of who comes into UK" would cloud the minds of their very myopic supporter base.
      </p>
      <p>
       A supporter base who are now realising as the UK economy comes crashing down that they were tricked. Indeed I just heard Nigel Farage claiming he never once promised that the remain camp would stop immigration
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course he implied it, and implied that they would stop lowly job stealing people from non-white countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire referendum was one based on fear of muslims and immigration. That's why they killed this labour MP.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had to strike quickly and fast. They did it just outside of a week and they needed something that would take over the news cycle, and cut through the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, they had left the vote rigging too to late.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always though killing a person like this screamed of panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well anyway the plutocracy really fucked up this time. A huge heap of them have lost billions though a few have cleaned right up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be interesting if anyone can see who won big on the markets.

       What an opportune moment to "suspend" the campaign, just as the leave campaign was ahead in the polls, if there was ever a false flag then this fits the bill.

       Get with the program. The local man didn't say "Britain first" or anything else. Some journalist has put words in his mouth, just like they do when they want to pin someting on "Muslim terrorists" - to push an agenda.

       Was expecting more posts about this here. Even if its just a coincidence it happen so close to the vote it does raise some questions even from pure skeptics heh.

       Politicians will use this no matter if they orchestrated it or not. Like one famous person said:

       What? As far as I can tell, this is only a Rahm Emmanuel quote. Do you have a source for Churchill saying it?

       I suspect that Orlando is sucking the air out of this story, especially considering that

       First and foremost I'm gonna say this - I think this is coincidence that a remain campaigner was murdered less than 2 weeks before the vote with the latest polls suggesting the leave vote might win.
      </p>
      <p>
       However It infuriates me to see how the remain campaigners have politicised this tragedy. I think we can be sure that this is going to be politicised to the maximum- exploiting The less intelligent of our society with propaganda and sensationalist headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say propaganda but I imagine most of the news outlets have posted this story to get the most clicjd so they gain more money.

       Just goes to show you that some of these votes that are happening this year actually matter. Politics has never been this crazy. And if the Deray leaks are true were getting massive riots in the US through the summer. I think the votes going down now are really critical to determine if the Globalist will succeed in what they want to do. They seem to be pulling increasingly dirty tricks, and twisting the narrative so hard it's even breaking for some people that used to believe it.

       I wouldn't say crazy, but it's really annoying how this subreddit seems convinced nothing bad ever really happens. Night club shooter? Government conspiracy. Sandy hook? Conspiracy. British PM killed? Conspiracy. And it goes on and on and on. Bad shit just happens sometimes; not all of it is a conspiracy.

       Brexit supporters are finally succeeding in their campaign. They are getting more and more support. Some polls predict even more than 50% support.

       Polls are independant (anyone can run a poll) but vote is controlled. Because polls started to become inconsistent witht the scripted outcome of the vote, something was needed to justify the difference observed between polls and vote. Now with that event on record, nobody will question when the cooked up referendum results give a small victory of Bremain. Business as usual.
