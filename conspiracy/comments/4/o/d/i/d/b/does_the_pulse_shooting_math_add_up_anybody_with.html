        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Regardless the math doesn’t add up: A man walks in to a night club with an Sig Sauer MCX, shoots 103 people in under 7 minutes. The majority of the victims were shot multiple times, some as many as 12 times, with reports of several dozen rounds fired in the air and several dozens of rounds missing. Three hours later, shooter engages in a gun battle with nine police officers that lasts nearly an hour.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight. One lone shooter in under 7 minutes reloaded his MCX 30 times with 30-round magazines, firing nearly 1,000 rounds while in a nightclub surrounded by 320 people, managing to kill and injure a third of them. One would know that among 320 would be men with military experience who know about reloads, and would react to a life or death situation. Shooter then takes a 3-hour break before engaging in another gun battle lasting nearly an hour in what was described as a “hail of bullets” with a SWAT team.</p>

<p>Taking nearly 7 minutes to reload 30 times — let alone having time to aim and shoot 1,000 rounds semi-automatic in between firing dozens of rounds in the air while screaming “aloha snack bar” — doesn’t add up.</p>

<p>He had to have managed to have 30 30-round mags loaded and at the ready in order to do it under 7 minutes. If he is holding an ammo can in one hand (that weighs 40 pounds) and the MCX in the other, what was he doing. Reloading and firing with one hand at the same time? Either that or he had a tactical vest from hell that was able to hold 30 mags! Plus he had enough ammo to fight police for another hour: 50 magazine clips? 70? This is absurd on it’s face.</p>

<p>As if he wasn’t busy enough, on top of this, the shooter was overheard by a “playing dead eyewitness” chit chatting on a cell phone. The level of black-magic synthetic reality that the observer is asked to accept at the Orlando Pulse fabrication gets more asinine by the hour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You fire a few rounds, and everyone stops dancing (well not everyone) to determine what&#39;s happening. Then they understand, or see others running, and people rush the exit. Now you have a giant flesh mass trying to exit the building... that&#39;s an easy target.</p>

<p>That would account for some of the multiple shots (1 bullet will pass through many in the flesh mass) reported at the scene.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three hours later, shooter engages in a gun battle with nine police officers that lasts nearly an hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he definitely had plenty of ammo. He could have set a bag down as he entered, that was full of additional magazines. &lt;-Speculation</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume I am at the best possible location in the night club. I fire at the flesh mass, and I always hit at least 1 person. My rounds then follow through and sometimes hit 1 to 2 more people before being too slow, or lodging in something/someone. So every trigger pull, we&#39;ll say we do 1.5 &quot;shots&quot; worth of damage.</p>

<p>Now we have several 12 shot people, and many lesser, but we have a cap of 320 potential, and 103 actual. Even at Neo skill level, that would be, at minimum (with JFK magic bullet tech in effect) 69 shots. That assumes no misses, rarely the same target, penetration of first target on every shot, and everyone (of the 103) gets at least a hole in something.</p>

<p>I have a friend that can regularly get 4 shots / second on an AR 15. We&#39;ll assume our shooter was that fast, and more accurate. In 7 minutes, ignoring reloading, the shooter could have fired 1680 rounds, with his chain fed rifle. That&#39;s 56, 30 round magazines. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s add in a sustained firefight with police. It lasts &quot;nearly an hour&quot; so we&#39;ll call it an hour. We won&#39;t be using the &quot;spree&quot; shooting rate of 4 rds / sec, as this is a firefight. Short bursts of multiple rounds, then cover/movement. So, we&#39;ll account for controlled suppressive fire. (I based this time off of recording of firefights from Iraq, mostly, but also from some domestic US footage) Over a minute, the shooter averages 9 rounds shot in 2 - 4 bursts. So, 1 hour of that (which would be grueling...) is another 540 rounds (yes i adjusted my 8.78 to 9 for perfectly filled magazines...) or another 18, 30 round magazines.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the hard limit. The shooter definitely had less than 74 magazines, which would be well over 148 lbs of ammunition.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll keep the suppressive fire number of 18 magazines... that seems like a conservative &quot;nearly an hour&quot; firefight with constant suppressive fire, or a &quot;hail of bullets&quot; to any reporter. Now, what&#39;s the minimum amount of magazines for hitting 103 in the club. Before we had a minimum of 69 rounds from the never-miss rifle. I&#39;m going to bump that to 90 so it&#39;s a little more plausible, but still low. So that&#39;s a minimum of 3, 30 round magazines, inside the club. So our hard minimum is 21 magazines. That&#39;s still hefty.</p>

<p>How did he move, at least 40lbs of ammunition into the club? Entirely on his person? That&#39;s possible, but I think it would be quite noticeable... This leads me to believe the shooter either:</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t use the main entrance, and was able to smuggle additional supplies.</p>

<p>Had planned the attack, and also had delivered those supplies to the location in some hidden spot, prior to the attack.</p>

<p>Had accomplices.</p>

<p>Or maybe he was John Rambo, and actually had a 1000 rd, chain fed belt of ammo... I find that least likely...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe he only fired 202 rounds like the media reported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3:15 p.m.</p>

<p>Channel 9 found out that 202 rounds were fired during the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting Sunday, a law enforcement source said. That includes the gun battle between Omar Mateen and law enforcement, the source said. </p>

<p>In which case he only needed a total of 7 magazines - one in the rifle, six in pockets. Here is a chest rig that can easily and comfortably hold 6 magazines:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skdtac.com/Esstac-Chest-Rig-Bush-Boar-A1-p/ess.502.htm">http://www.skdtac.com/Esstac-Chest-Rig-Bush-Boar-A1-p/ess.502.htm</a></p>

<p>Or he could have just worn cargo pants. The pockets on those could hold 6 magazines.</p>

<p><a href="http://mediaweb.actionnewsjax.com/photo/2016/06/14/Heroes_inside_Pulse_nightclub_during_mas_0_4834312_ver1.0_640_360.jpg">Next we have targets like this:</a></p>

<p>In the foreground are about 20-30 people standing shoulder to shoulder. They&#39;re not crammed against each other as if trying to escape through a doorway (more like a crowded dance floor in a nightclub, actually), but even an untrained rifleman would find it difficult <em>not</em> to hit someone with every shot fired. And if those shots passed through the first person (as they likely will) he would find it hard <em>not</em> to hit multiple people with every shot.</p>

<p>As people fall, they block the path, making escape even slower and piling more and more people into a small area, making it even easier to inflict mass casualties with few rounds.</p>

<p>The claim that he hit 102 people with 202 rounds seems very plausible.</p>

<p>Agreed. Even if it isn&#39;t the flesh mass I describe, the layout of dancing club goers is already suited for what was described. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That accuracy is quite high. This would have been a skilled marksman, which the shooter may have been.</p>

<p>Either way, it is a feat that could be accomplished by a single actor, with high skill (accuracy, reload, the cucumber attitude.) I always considered the &quot;hail of bullets&quot; as a description of his first burst fire against the police. After that, everyone&#39;s butthole is clenched, and less bullets are needed to keep that level of tension.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Look at that image again. How could you point a rifle at that crowd and <em>not</em> hit someone? They are overlapping each other so that you could not shoot in their direction without hitting someone. Anyone could do that.</p>

<p>He could easily miss the target he was aiming at and <em>still</em> kill someone. He could miss every single target he aimed at and still have killed dozens of people. In a situation like that, your accuracy could be atrocious and you&#39;d still rack up a high kill rate simple because it is practically impossible to miss <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>Damn! I didn&#39;t even notice that was reported.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem is with the follower 90% of the time. You can test your magazine by grabbing a pen/pencil/pokey-thing and depressing the back end of the follower (the side closes to the rifle butt, when magazine is inserted.) then push the front end. </p>

<p>A cheap mag will bind on the first push, leaving the front of the follower pointing <del>down into the ground</del> up into the sky, at an angle. A good mag will not bind (until you twist the spring out from under it... they all bind if you do that) on the first test, instead it will return with a quick pop. The 2nd test might cause even a good mag to bind, but it&#39;s not reliable, from my experience.</p>

<p>If the follower will jam, then it can recreate that failure when firing rounds in succession. I&#39;ve never been able to get it to jam when firing at a slow rate, while keeping the rifle level. If I&#39;m shooting upward, I can recreate the problem randomly. I think it is also more likely to occur when the follower is at the curved portion of the magazine, so somewhere around 24 to 16 rounds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of all things... a highway patrolman explained that to me at an NRA range. It happened to me, and he showed me the test, and sure enough my newer magazines would bind instantly. One was a pain to even get back out.</p>

<p>I ordered just followers from ... idk, maybe gunbroker, and had them shipped. The spring is a site to see, if you&#39;ve never seen one before. It&#39;s probably a lot longer than you might think it should be. And it&#39;s &quot;fun&quot; to get back in the magazine...</p>

<p>But removing the spring from the follower, and putting the new one on, is trivial. The followers were maybe $4 per, so not a bad price considering that the cheapest magazines will operate &#39;like a magpul&#39; or other more expensive brand that ships with a proper follower.</p>

Be open to both sides of the story. Assuming it&#39;s false is just as bad if not worse than assuming it&#39;s true. That shit just happened. You can&#39;t accurately declare what happened based on the information available. Debunking something takes a considerable amount of evidence. Everyone on this sub wants to just jump the gun and assume it&#39;s all fake. That&#39;s as bad as assuming it&#39;s all true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If its close to three hours before anyone can reach the people inside, then even if it wasn&#39;t an instantly fatal gunshot wound, that leaves quite a bit of time for someone to bleed out and die. Say he fired 300 rounds. That&#39;s reloading 10 times. Not an unreasonable amount. Hes in a crowded building. One bullet can hit more than one person. Most bullets will probably hit someone especially initially. ~50 people dead and another 50 hit. That&#39;s a total of 100 hit..not 100 killed. Hitting 100 people in 300 rounds seems pretty reasonable for someone whose moderately comfortable with a gun.  Im not saying that there isnt more to the story...but I&#39;m not sure this particular angle is going to go anywhere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While Rambo was dispatching 103 casualties he was also involved in a firefight with THREE OFFICERS, which makes the whole tall-tale even more improbable and ludicrous. Plus at one point Mateen&#39;s gun jammed. After twenty minutes he took a minute to call 911. </p>

<p>Source Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting</a></p>

<p>About 320 people were inside the club, which was serving last call drinks at around 2:00 a.m. on June 12.[3][4] After arriving at the club by van,[5] Mateen approached the building on foot, armed with a SIG Sauer MCX[6] semi-automatic rifle and a 9mm Glock 17 handgun.[3][7][8][9][10] A uniformed Orlando Police Department (OPD) officer working extra duty[11] engaged Mateen, returning fire at 2:02 a.m. EDT.[12][13] Mateen was able to enter the building, however, and began shooting patrons.[3][4][13] The officer was soon joined by two additional officers who also began engaging Mateen. Mateen then retreated further into the nightclub and began to take patrons hostage.[3][7][14] About 100 officers from the OPD and the Orange County Sheriff&#39;s Office were first dispatched to the scene.[14]</p>

<p>During the attack, people trapped inside the club called and messaged friends and relatives. Initially, some of them thought the gunshots were firecrackers[15][16] or part of music.[17] Many described a scene of panic and confusion caused by the loud music and darkness. One person hiding in a bathroom covered herself with the bodies of victims for protection. Some entertainers hid inside a dressing room when the shooting started and escaped the building by crawling out when police removed the air conditioning unit. One of the bartenders said she hid under the glass bar. Many patrons attempted to save the lives of those injured.[18]</p>

<p>According to one of the hostages, Mateen entered a bathroom where people were hiding and opened fire, wounding several. The hostage, who had taken cover inside a stall with others, was injured by bullets and flying pieces of a wall that was hit with bullets. Mateen&#39;s rifle then jammed briefly, at which point he stopped firing and took survivors hostage.[19] Two survivors reported Mateen as saying &quot;I don&#39;t have a problem with black people&quot;[20][21] but that he &quot;wouldn&#39;t stop his assault until America stopped bombing his country&quot;.[22] Other survivors heard Mateen claim that he had explosives as well as snipers stationed around the club.[23] Hostages called or texted 9-1-1 to warn of the possible presence of explosives.[24]</p>

<p>At 2:09 a.m. EDT, several minutes after the gunfire started, the club posted on its Facebook page, &quot;Everyone get out of pulse and keep running&quot;.[25] At 2:22 a.m. EDT, Mateen made a 9-1-1 call in which he expressed sympathy for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bombers,[14] and made a reference to Moner Mohammad Abu Salha, an acquaintance of his who died in a suicide bombing in Syria in 2014</p>

<p>There are about 20-30 people in the foreground of that image. Imagine that they are people trying to get out of a doorway that can accommodate no more then two or three people at a time, and imagine you are a gunman with a semi auto rifle trying to kill them all.</p>

<p>The thigh pockets in a pair of cargo pants could easily hold two or three 30 round magazines. Seven 30 round magazines carry 210 rounds. That would mean he could change magazines six times (one in the gun, six in pockets) and fire off 202 rounds with very little effort.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t help sell the conspiracy theory OP is creating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen anything but speculation.  Also, a fully loaded 30 round magazine weighs 1 pound. The guy has been training with firearms, police issue types, for at least 5 years. Once it becomes a reflex, reloading is effortless. 1000 rounds? If there were 1000 rounds fired, I guarantee 500 of those were cowboy piggies getting off.</p>

<p>If the guy was shooting <a href="https://youtu.be/j2uMOv1YSXo?t=1m24s">.223, close range</a> 2700 fps would rip through multiple people, especially if bunched close together... <em>like if some retard held a door shut trapping people on the other side,</em> 1 shot would/could easily scatter into multiple projectiles.</p>

<p>While everyone is saying this dude was hanging out at a gay club I say he was calculating this attack.</p>

<p>So yeah, I think it&#39;s entirely possible that he found ways to inflict maximum damage during this attack.</p>

<p>Sunday, 2:02 a.m. ET: An officer working extra duty in full uniform at the club responds. He and two officers nearby open fire on the shooter, and a gunbattle ensues. The shooter goes inside the club, where a hostage situation develops. Some 100 officers from the Orange County Sheriff&#39;s Office and the Orlando Police Department respond to the chaotic scene.</p>

<p>Which could explain the rifle jamming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn! I didn&#39;t even notice that was reported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheap magazines not wanting to cycle rounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is with the follower 90% of the time. You can test your magazine by grabbing a pen/pencil/pokey-thing and depressing the back end of the follower (the side closes to the rifle butt, when magazine is inserted.) then push the front end. </p>

<p>A cheap mag will bind on the first push, leaving the front of the follower pointing <del>down into the ground</del> up into the sky, at an angle. A good mag will not bind (until you twist the spring out from under it... they all bind if you do that) on the first test, instead it will return with a quick pop. The 2nd test might cause even a good mag to bind, but it&#39;s not reliable, from my experience.</p>

<p>If the follower will jam, then it can recreate that failure when firing rounds in succession. I&#39;ve never been able to get it to jam when firing at a slow rate, while keeping the rifle level. If I&#39;m shooting upward, I can recreate the problem randomly. I think it is also more likely to occur when the follower is at the curved portion of the magazine, so somewhere around 24 to 16 rounds.</p>
