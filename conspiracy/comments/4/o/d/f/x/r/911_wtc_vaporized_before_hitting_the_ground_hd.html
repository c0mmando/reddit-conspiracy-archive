    <div class="md"><p>It is painfully obvious what you are trying to do here and you are not very good at it.</p>

<p>You are trying to suggest that i believe in theory&#39;s you have postulated on the basis of the fact that i outright reject your Judy Woods disinformation theory, for the record, this is what i believe.</p>

<p>Two remote operated drones of unknown specification, crashed into WTC1&amp;2, the US government used this as their theory as to why they collapsed, the evidence suggests that thermite was used in some capacity to demolish the three buildings (WTC1,2&amp;7) this is supported by two peer reviewed scientific papers and supported by a government paper also.</p>

<p>WTC1,2&amp;7 were controlled demolition, this is what all the evidence says to be true.</p>

<p>WTC1&amp;2 were not <em>dustified,</em> this is another moronic claim made by Judy Woods, but pulverised, very likely by traditional explosives or thermite explosives (which is experimentally proven)</p>

<p>To completely disprove your held thoory, be it no planes or space beams, then i suggest you read the following links;</p>

<p>I have not once denied they exist, i have now told you this three or four times, are you that hard of thinking that you can not follow a simple comment chain.</p>

<p>The DoD nor any of it&#39;s contractors have never claimed they have a weapon that destroys steel framed skyscrapers, you just making things up and pulling random thoughts out your arsehole, i have already proven that.</p>

<p>You on the other hand have offered nothing to back up your claim and thus, i am done with you now, you are worthless and so is the theory you can not back up.</p>

<p>I will always prove you wrong every single time, no problem.</p>

<p>NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system - that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns - consisted of a grid of steel &#39;trusses&#39; integrated with a concrete slab). Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon - NIST 2006</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST  now advocate the The progressive collapse theory, an unproven, untested theory that they claim only ever occurred on 9/11, that is the fucked up shit they want us to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video is OK but no sound/narration etc. The idea here is that part of the WTC must have been vaporized because there&#39;s so much dust.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen some other video that actually shows solid parts of the towers going kind of &quot;blurry&quot; as the structure collapses. All kinds of way out explanations are offered for this. Stuff like scalar whatever, directed energy and all kinds of next gen secret destructive tech that we won&#39;t hear about for another 20 years. But I&#39;m going to suggest another explanation that is perhaps more plausible, while at the same time far more disturbing.</p>

<p>Special effects. Watch any big action or disaster movie and you&#39;ll see the same thing when a building gets &quot;destroyed&quot;. Little bits and pieces go blurry and just turn into part of the dust cloud. This is due to the limits of rendering. They don&#39;t bother to do a render that realistic to that level of detail because a) it would take too much server time and b) because the average movie goer wouldn&#39;t notice the difference anyways. </p>

<p>With 9/11, I&#39;m guessing server time/cost was no issue. But I&#39;m also guessing that 16 years ago there was more of a limit on how close they could get to reality in terms of physics, detail and whatever else.</p>

<p>Yes, the towers did come down. But I&#39;m claiming that the footage we all saw on the news was altered for whatever reason. As proof, I offer the video that you can see online where solid pieces of building structure transform into powder... just like in the movies.</p>

<p>It vaporized because most of the debris turned to dust in midair and never reached the ground. The debris pile from 110 stories was just a little  higher than street  level. Impossible.</p>

<p>This  apparently didn&#39;t pile up with a hundred more layers on top, they were  simply gone.</p>

<p>If you are referring to that video that shows a tall, thin column that appears to turn to dust in midair, that has actually been explained and confirmed by another video, it simply fell away from the camera</p>

    <div class="md"><p>correct, the TV stuff was CGI.</p>

<p>the NYPD aerial photos show upwind smoke generators that are obscuring the WTC site from outside view.</p>

<p>there was massive rendering and scale errors with the smoking burning and collapsing WTC towers 1&amp;2. repeat patterns in the smoke, smoke way too extensive for burning office carpets, two different conflicting approaches for the WTC2 plane. errors in collapse direction for the WTC1 antenna tower.</p>

<p>and with all the conflicting evidence from various official and MSM sources, not everything can be correct, therefore there is obvious and massive fraud.</p>
