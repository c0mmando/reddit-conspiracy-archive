        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For some years now, tobacco use has been a popular enemy.</p>

<p>The reason cited is public health.  Since when does the government care so much about public health?  Almost &quot;everything&quot; causes cancer and the statistics I have read show that most lung cancer diagnoses are made in the 75 and older demographic.</p>

<p>It also does not make sense to have a concurrent marijuana legalization movement.  According to my college drug dependency textbook, one joint has the equivalent of five cigarettes in tar.</p>

<p>What ever happened to tobacco lobbyists?  Have they simply all moved to India where smoking is extremely widespread?</p>

<p>What&#39;s the real story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the tar is bad for you, but the cbd and thc are medicinal, so to a degree yes they do cancel each other out.   nicotine itself may be carcinogenic but not strongly so, it&#39;s the tar and the &gt;120 other essential oils and other flavorants they put into the cigarette that cause problems when burned and aerosolized...like clove or nutmeg oil for example.  This has made it impossible to make any completely fair statement on tobacco, every brand is very different from the next.  In aggregate of smokers v nonsmokers the data is very clear, it causes oral esophogeal and lung cancer (among others) and that is not something for debate.  THey have decades of data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but if you went fully natural with what we consume, no pesticides, no roided animal feed, just bare bones nature - You&#39;re going to struggle with feeding the nation and keeping it affordable. </p>

<p>Take a chicken for example, a totally natural chicken with clean feed takes longer to grow, is smaller than a hulk chicken and if you&#39;re against caging too, they can&#39;t grow as many. So the customer ends up paying more and getting less. </p>

<p>If two farmers went different routes with how to grow chickens, the farmer pumping out the most produce is going to earn the most till any severe health consequences are found with eating hulk chickens (And I mean <em>severe</em>, people love chicken). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right given current consumption practices. If consumers want entirely natural food, they might have to eat differently. The inputs for meat are enormous compared to the inputs for grains, veggies, etc. We raise most of our food organically but eat no meat except wild game.</p>

<p>Factory farming practices are an integral part of the big Agra agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, this is true.  It didn&#39;t have to be the way things are, but at some critical juncture, the decision was made.  It&#39;s not enough that people decide to go vegan or go all organic.  I mean, sure there&#39;s a market for that stuff, but it&#39;s not reducing the market for less expensive meats and pesticide covered produce.  Companies like Monsanto are worse than Satan for farmers.  I personally don&#39;t see much of a solution unless there&#39;d be global anarchy and collapse of all financial systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s what my textbook says... albeit I would be foolish to accept a textbook as gospel or even truthful.  Still, it&#39;s something you can put between your lips and smoke.  I am not saying it&#39;s bad, I am pro-legalization, it just seems very contradictory to push for relaxed pot laws and stricter tobacco control.  I mean, didn&#39;t the native peoples use tobacco in ceremonies and in their traditional medicine too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people vape now anyway.  both cigs and pot.  That&#39;s why when you look for a &#39;head shop&#39; they are all called &#39;vape shops&#39; now.  If it&#39;s a trend, it seems it&#39;s here to stay.  They even have little pocket sized vapes that store your pot and they are cigarette sized.  My boss from my last job would invite me outside to smoke (software dev...apparently helped him).  I didn&#39;t smoke or do pot at work but I&#39;d hang out with him and chat.  He showed me his little microvape and I was impressed at how well made it was.  I think smoke free cigs and vapes have coalesced into a solid trend.  some people still like the smoke iself though.</p>

<p>sorry this doesn&#39;t add much to the conversation except that the tar argument thing has to be over now that there&#39;s a much more popular alternative</p>

<p>also, lung cancer is a specific cancer that&#39;s generally from inhalation of carcinogens, whereas the &#39;everything causes cancer&#39; is more a characteristic of breast, colon, and skin cancer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on this. Tobacco has had 0 negative health effects in my family&#39;s history. Grandma on my dad&#39;s side smoked from 14 to 75 (when she died in her sleep from what they think was heart failure), grandpa on mum&#39;s side has also smoked for years with no cancer or anything. But mum&#39;s dad&#39;s wife got brest cancer and had never smoked.</p>

<p>This might all be anecdotal, but in my experience and lifetime the people I&#39;ve met who get lung, brain and brest cancer have never smoked a day in their life.</p>

<p>I think governments needed a scapegoat for the rising cancer rates and blamed it on tobacco. Smoking rates have fallen but cancer rates have gone up in recent years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, cancer is very unpredictable.  I get angered that anti-smoking labels state that smoking factually causes lung cancer.  It&#39;s misinformation to support a political / health policy.  My general thought is, &quot;everything causes cancer.&quot;  And of course, I say that a bit sarcastically, but cancer does seem pretty easy to get.  I think there is an industry of consumer products, you know, the &quot;drink this or take that and you&#39;ll reduce your risk of cancer&quot;.  Also, as I commented elsewhere, nicotine replacement products, like the patch, gum, and inhaler are all very expensive products which for many just transfer their addiction.  Not to mention that the pharmaceutical industry has and will continue to market &quot;quit smoking&quot; drugs.  They had a real run with Champix until enough people killed themselves or were psychotically violent.  Notice too, if you have a very basic prescription drug benefit plan, they usually don&#39;t pay for those type of drugs or NRT products.  So there&#39;s a bit of a money trail.</p>

<p>People want to poo-poo on the outliers like your grandma and say that they just got lucky.  I don&#39;t believe that.  I&#39;ve known plenty of my grandparent&#39;s generation who smoked and lived well past the average life expectancy (or whatever it is called).  These elderly people may suffer from some health problems, but everyone develops health problems as they age, and so cigarettes can&#39;t be blamed.  I think the &quot;powers that be&quot; are preying on our fear of death, especially a painful drawn out, chemotherapy filled, death.  They are appealing to mankind&#39;s desire to live forever.  They do all this and try to gain further control over our bodies which should be sovereignly our own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right given current consumption practices. If consumers want entirely natural food, they might have to eat differently. The inputs for meat are enormous compared to the inputs for grains, veggies, etc. We raise most of our food organically but eat no meat except wild game.</p>

<p>Factory farming practices are an integral part of the big Agra agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, this is true.  It didn&#39;t have to be the way things are, but at some critical juncture, the decision was made.  It&#39;s not enough that people decide to go vegan or go all organic.  I mean, sure there&#39;s a market for that stuff, but it&#39;s not reducing the market for less expensive meats and pesticide covered produce.  Companies like Monsanto are worse than Satan for farmers.  I personally don&#39;t see much of a solution unless there&#39;d be global anarchy and collapse of all financial systems.</p>
