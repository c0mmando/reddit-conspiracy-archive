       Cool, have you actually looked into it? Also, why are all the scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, etc, pushing the heliocentric model all affiliated with ancient majick/mystery schools? Curious, no? Also, NASA is filled with ex-NAZIS via operation paperclip (you should check that out). But what am I saying? Nah, just disregard..... They care about us.....

       Because humans are the best classifiers of objects into abstract groups, the world has ever seen. I attended a school that was next door to a massive satanic ritual sacrifice, 20 years ago. I then went on to attend a Uni that has ties to the occult and other "mystery schools." So even if I never had any ties to the occult/mystery myself, if I just finish my degree plan I am " affiliated with ancient majick/mystery schools?" by default. Kind of sucks, no? Now all of my legitimate research is thrown to the wind because some asshole I never met read a really old book in a dark room, one Halloween night.

       A known fact. At that time... how many qualified rocket scientists were there? We stole expertise at an opportune time. We stole the Nazi Brain-child and it helped us "get to the moon."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like we absorbed their organization and became them (though that is debatable) overnight. But hey, I guess humans are irredeemable to you. Once a Nazi, never a human again... is that how it works?

       Says who? It wasn't known until ~500 years ago. Before that, those people would like a word with you.... If it was round, what do you think about hollow earth or concave earth? Either fits into the heliocentric model...

       This is blatantly false, numerous observations and experiments disprove both the hollow Earth and concave Earth models.  It's as if people have never been outside and seen the Belt of Venus and thought of how it works, or done some basic research into seismology regarding why we know the Earth isn't hollow.

         visible ISS trajectories can be combined and provide demonstrable evidence that the Earth is convex and spherical.  You can view this yourself, tabulate the results and use them to demonstrate the shape of the Earth yourself.  After enough days of observation you will be able to calculate something that looks like this:

         the Belt of Venus is something you can see every day and demonstrates that the Earth isn't concave.

         here is a video showing how you can construct your own Foucault's Pendulum and use it to calculate your location on a convex, spherical Earth as well as the rate of rotation of the Earth.

         You can conduct this experiment yourself which readily demonstrates that the Earth isn't concave.

         seismic data demonstrates that the Earth isn't hollow and is actually filled with a variety of different minerals and materials.  There are numerous resources demonstrating this fact from hundreds of scientific institutions across the planet.  It's quite surprising that you haven't encountered any of this in your research:

       How are you experiments coming along?  Any data to share yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another simple experiment you can conduct.  Maybe the simplest of those listed, since it's now very easy to now communicate with people at different locations.  It should help you demonstrate the convex curvature of the Earth very easily, looking forward to your results:

       No he's saying the NASA Nazis (gnostic globalists is what I call them) are pushing this FE theory.  I agree with him.  I'd add their aim is to bring about a dark enlightenment...which is a neofeudal dumbing down of people into a post Orwellian technocracy

       I reckon that's pretty dumb. NASA is full of people who are passionate about what they are doing. And if they are trying to do what he is saying, they are doing a poor job of it considering nobody actually believes this theory except a few lunatics

       I think the only thing going on there is actual arctic research. It's a really good place to research because the ice has been there since the last ice age, and you can study previous epochs and such. I give scientists and such the benefit of the doubt with conspiracy because most of them are good people and passionate about their research
