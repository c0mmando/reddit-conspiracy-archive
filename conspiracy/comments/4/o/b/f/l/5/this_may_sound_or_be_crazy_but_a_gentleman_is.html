His account was then flagged and banned. He says he&#39;s going to only answer 10 questions. I apologize for the formating, but I basically just copy and pasted what he sent me from his original post. He will be answering questions via chat with me and I will copy and paste them here. For all intents and purposes,  any questions he answers will be labeled &quot;Jake.&quot;</p>

The end is soon. 20 years. This post will stay up for 48 hours (maybe. Keeps getting removed)
u/48hrthrowaway11m
I will allot time for 10 replies. No more. This post will remain active for 48 hours at the most. Posting here because most other &quot;threads&quot; or &quot;subreddits&quot; will go unnoticed. If you are angered or find that this goes against your common pre-conceived ideas of the inner workings and chose to disregard what I have to say, that is fine. 10 replies.</p>

<p>Mass shootings- schools, gay night clubs, colleges, black community centers. Look for the areas that haven&#39;t been hit. Slowly but surely they all will be. Eventually it will incorporate every variety people in our nation. Then they will vote to have gun availability restricted to special cases (LEOs, Reservists, People living off the land, etc.). The populace will not be able to defend themselves. 10-15 years</p>

<p>Technology- You are watched. For those that take comfort in the deep web, you are watched. Your car, your phone, everything.</p>

<p>Israel- Is a false flag. Conspiracy theorists focus on Israel as a potential &quot;enemy.&quot; This is false. They want you to be convinced otherwise. If you are, it will be easier to wage war on our previously considered ally. 20 years</p>

<p>ISIS- Not an asset of the CIA. Created by the government and allowed to run rampant. Even ISIS is ignorant to their conception. They will be a tool to limit social media, weapon ownership, and eventually when you can or cannot leave your home. 12 years</p>

<p>FEMA- Your soon to be jailers. You will be, at first, be registered. Eventually you will be herded. More acts of terror will lead to &quot;safe zones.&quot; 18 years</p>

<p>War in the capital- Colorado will be the new established safe haven for government personnel. It is currently 75% built and is currently under renovation at the state Federal Center, several remote locations through the Rocky Mountain Region, with fall back points established in the city of Ft. Collins and the outskirts of the Super max compound. 18 years</p>

<p>Your safety - If you or any other people on this website come across valid information regarding cover-ups, you will not be in danger until you name name&#39;s. Mask your identity as best you can if you discover legitimate information, you will go missing.</p>

<p>I have plenty of information, as said, I refuse to name name&#39;s. 10 answers.</p>

<p>Edit: I am confused by reddit so far. Everything I post, my posting is removed within 5 minutes, at least the content is. Possibly reddit is not as secure or obscure as hoped</p>

<p>Edit 2: It would appear he&#39;s done for the evening. I guess maybe p.m. me if you want him to answer any more questions? I&#39;ll see if he wants to come back tomorrow!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez I was way off. I was thinking the COG from Gears of War!</p>

<p>JAKE- COG/COOP are primarily directed by the financial elitists.  There&#39;s no point or purpose for any sort of political dictatorship without revenue. Politicians are merely puppets. It&#39;s the wealthy that will benefit. For the most part, half the politicians that have malicious intentions are unaware of the other politicians that are in the same circumstance. As such, each is facing his own fearful private battle. Blackmail and extortion primarily, fueled by promises of financial and political gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, this sounds like an observation any of us could make. It still doesn&#39;t answer the question. Who exactly are the financial elitists and if they&#39;re the primary then who has it the rest of the time when they don&#39;t? </p>

<p>I know you said he&#39;s having trouble posting things, but the 10 answer limit with a 48 hour window; why? Why go through you to basically throw out hypotheses about the future? So far it&#39;s interesting, but there&#39;s nothing damning or profound to censor. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a dick. It just... smells like bullshit. What exactly is the purpose of this pseudo-AMA and what makes <em>Jake</em> so knowledgeable that he can comfidently state circumstantial evidence as fact? Does he have first hand knowledge, documents, recordings; any evidence to support his assertions or is this all conjecture and speculation? </p>

<p>Just curious, because <em>Jake</em> sounds like an old friend of mine. He also liked to let on like he was privy to secret information nobody else had by being just as vague. If he were to dismiss me as being too closed minded to <em>get it</em> and claim he was Mossad then I&#39;d really have to wonder if it&#39;s him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JAKE- Great question. Understandable as well. I could be some crazy old guy in the woods or some kid posting on my gameboy. It may not seem like a whole lot of information and bizarre with the limitations I&#39;ve set but here&#39;s my reasonings. For one, I work in a private sector that readily tracks any accounts associated with my IP. Consider the different between an average Joe talking about what he thinks &quot;insert politicians name here&quot; is doing and seeing someone under your employ telling the world what he knows &quot;insert politicians name here,&quot; is doing. One is speculation,  the other is prison. What seems to as typical information anyone could spout off is enough to get others into serious trouble. </p>

<p>As for the ten answer limit with a 48 hour window. I did not expect so many questions, which may be ignorant of me, so I may go beyond the 10 answers. The 48 hour window is just how long I am willing to inconvenience myself by going to a different every now and then to secure an Internet connection.  </p>

<p>Call me a cynic, but I have done enough service in my time that I feel I can be a bit selfish.  I&#39;m not willing to do some sort of water gate expose. I&#39;d rather dissappear from the radar and live my life in comfort. </p>

<p>Also, Jake is not my actual name. You can call me something else if you like! </p>

<p>All that in mind, if you consider what I have to say  bullshit, I take no offense! It is good for you to be skeptical of everything. This is more an act of karma on my part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they don&#39;t know what COG is they don&#39;t know anything really and this account and this AMA is fake. </p>

<p>In fact, nothing they&#39;ve said in the OP is groundbreaking whatsoever.  Anyone who&#39;s been here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> knows all that.  The &#39;its the jew&#39; people are easy to ignore at this point.  We are clearly working with many countries and they want to completely delete islam from the planet, but they have to give the appearance that we are tolerant first by importing them into society, creating massive rapings and terrorism as an 8th century culture clashes with a modern 21st century culture.  By doing this, they&#39;re just nazifying the whole world with intolerance.  IN a few years, we&#39;ll beg for a one-world security state government to kill all muslims around the world and we&#39;ll have much justification to do so.</p>

<p>The mass surveillance it turns out is to keep track of these muslims that are imported into society so we can drone / phone kill them later.  It&#39;s just that the psychopathic leadership needs to pay for it, so between now and then, they use it to sell deep-mined personal data of all citizens around the world.</p>

<p>The people who were sold on this plan were led to believe that once the muslims are gone we could stop going into everyone&#39;s panty drawer.  Of course that will never happen..they will continue these programs to control citizens.....</p>

<p>If muslims were smart, they&#39;d figure this out and actually do something about it.  So they know that we know that the government knows this...what that means is that the muslim 8th century culture has been given a mandate.... get with the 21st century or you&#39;ll all be eliminated.  </p>

<p>Iran seems to have figured this out.  Any muslim country seeking nukes is a country that is getting with the program.  Any country that isn&#39;t is going to be eliminated.  That&#39;s just a fact.</p>

<p>Afganistan is done.  Its now a colony of the US.  Same with Syria, soon Jordan, Palestine, Libya, and all the minor, derpaderp pan saudi countries like oman, yemen, qatar, uae etc.  they may be rich but are they nuclear?  No.  They&#39;&#39;ll all be absorbed on behalf of saudi and become one big supersaudi.  THat&#39;s what ISIS is about actually: an excuse for Saudi to absorb the other countries by creating a cancer and letting it spread until it must be burned by fire of saudi incredibly lazy and lax unmovable army that &#39;finally&#39; decides to show up for battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JAKE- Here&#39;s the deal. Be prepared. Be educated. Be active and don&#39;t draw a huge amount of attention to yourself. I&#39;m not asking you to be a &quot;sheep,&quot; but when the ball gets rolling there will be those than will follow without question and those that need to be removed from the populace because they may spook others. Being a wolf that disguises himself as a sheep will allow you opportunity. </p>

<p>The end game is political and financial control. It&#39;s a game. Financial elitists are accustomed to having their way. Think sociopaths. How can I convince people to like me, support me, follow what I want and say, while putting a knife in their back and taking what they have? It&#39;s purely ego and control. As far as how to change things, I honestly do not know. But I will say that being prepared mentally, physically,  being communicative, and active in your community will make you a leader among many. These leaders that simply want to live freely can bring about change when the snake finally crawls out of its den.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JAKE- Good question. Major events are honestly &quot;schedules&quot; in terms of what will get the best response. Imagine if you will, you&#39;re a parent and all of a sudden you child throws a tantrum. A major tantrum will lead to punishment but not permanent change. However,  if once every 2-3 months your child becomes increasingly upset and acts out by stealing things, you&#39;re going to look for counter measures to prevent it from happening again.</p>

<p>In the same way, if five years ago 800 people were killed in a mass event, it would be a tragedy but not something that mandates the public making such a change. However, if once every couple months there&#39;s a &quot;less major incident&quot; people are going to begin to look for ways to take preventative measures. Yet, if things are not happening as fast as predicted, it will increase in severity until those measures are taken. </p>

<p>Again, as if your child is stealing and stealing and you don&#39;t do anything about it besides put them in time out. One day your child steals a car, a much more major offense and yet you still give them simple punishments, the severity will I increase until decisive actions are taken. </p>

<p>This has been the plan all along. There have been more mass shootings in the last 8 years than during any other time period yet guns are still legal. The government is looking to make the nation so fed up and so afraid that they have no choice but to turn to a government mandated plan for disarmament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The secret space program.  What do you know about it?  Is it really as monumentally developed as individuals like Marine Captain Randy Cramer, Laura Eisenhower, Brett Stillings, Andrew Basiago, Bernard Mendez, and Corey Goode talk about?  All of these figures have said that they&#39;ve been involved in extensive programs dealing with time travel and various trips to both the moon, Mars, and other areas in and around our solar system.</p>

<p>How solid is all this information?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JAKE- I would say stay where you are. It sounds like bull, I know, but this isn&#39;t something that will happen overnight.  Like I&#39;ve said, become educated and active in your community. When things start to go south,  you can help steer people in the right direction. If there&#39;s enough leaders in the community that can see through the BS, a lot of future problems could be avoided. </p>

<p>As for the website, no offense to anyone on here but conspiracy theorists are very much considered &quot;crazy, or paranoid.&quot; How many websites do you see that have all sorts of theories written off as crazy drabble? I don&#39;t want to be active in the &quot;conspiracy&quot; world. I want to pass on to people that are better than me with technology and then put it out of my mind. Call me selfish. Not to mention I&#39;m old school. Apparently my posts weren&#39;t working because I haven&#39;t been a member very long? I always assume &quot;I&#39;ve been hacked.&quot; When I can&#39;t login into my email! That said, under the recommendation of my buddy here, reddit is a great forum for sharing information and he talked me into sharing some of the information I have rattling around up top. If I found someway to make a website or something of that nature, I may consider it in the future.</p>

That said I&#39;ve always avoided tech for the most part unless I have to, but I have seen some very crazy military craft.

    <div class="md"><p>To me it&#39;s always been about the long con. He makes it sound like its not a long con and things are going into motion very fast. When I say long con I mean 60-150 years from now. The rise in gun ownership has only risen since 9/11 along with people finally starting to understand how corrupt the system really is.</p>

<p>Question-What makes him think that this is going to happen in our life time and are we talking a civil war to achieve the final goal or Orwell-en sheep heading?</p>

<p>In my mind their are too many gun owners and future owners to attempt a disarmament of the populace. Over night legislation would only incite riots and more than likely armed riots at that.</p>

<p>I could see a Union(Pro current government) vs Rebels (Anti current government) civil war being started over the right to the 2nd amendment. Just like the American civil war those who didn&#39;t care about the politics that started the war joined the Union to preserve the State. So you can pretty much assume the &quot;pro gunners&quot; would be steam rolled. You can pretty much grantee those who are even Pro gun are likely to join the Union just as pro slavery Union soldiers.</p>

<p>Then and only then and through this way do I see &quot;overnight&quot; gun reform. Otherwise in my mind just like the Clinton ban legislation will be overturned and fought over generation after generation. And its that long battle of minds that prevails not brute force. As we have seen with controlled civil wars such as Syria they can be messy and other foreign power would love to come play. It would be much safer and easier for the TPTB to &quot;ride the wave&quot; so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JAKE-  Half the country sees weapon ownership as an unnecessary privilege. The aim is to make it less about guns and more about people. Hence the social circles. It&#39;s not an anti gun movement,  it&#39;s a pro LGBT movement. It&#39;s not an anti gun movement, it&#39;s a pro civil rights movement.  It&#39;s not about guns, it&#39;s about the children. In the age of technology,  it doesn&#39;t take much to convince people that those who support gun ownership are &quot; narrow-minded.&quot; Don&#39;t make the mistake of underestimating the ignorance of modern society. Ignorant people can change things overnight</p>

<p>As I glance at a prime example like Australia. I get his point but I think he underestimates the average American. I mean Sandy Hook goes down and a handful of states do reforms. Reforms the population at the moment is willfully ignoring. Now once this generation dies off and their kids and then grand kids grow into the &quot;new system&quot; they will not willing ignore the system but rather conform to the new standards. 
Again this takes years and during that time it&#39;s possible for the reforms to be dropped and brought back up again. Basically like we see already in regards to &quot;gun bans&quot;.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff. Thanks again.</p>
