       Title. Don't get me wrong, being a Canadian, I'm not a Trump supporter by any means, but with r/enoughtrumpspam being made subreddit of the day it's not even subtle anymore. r/politics, which was primarily a pro-Bernie subreddit, has now shifted into a Trump hatejerk, and the previous anti-Clinton sentiment is nowhere to be seen. Hell, the only subs where Clinton seems to be getting criticized are here and r/the_donald, and considering the dubious reputation of both it's possible that this is very well intentional, putting anti-Hillary views in a bad light. Sorry if this seems like whining, i just wanted to know if I'm the only one that feels this way

       No it means we are getting visitors who want to know about the shootings.  Be nice to them.  Just because they don't want trump doesn't mean they are stupid or shills.  Its time to grow up and let people have different politics even if you think they are wrong.  I would like to see us get beyond this political theater and talk about facts and how to total destroy the corruption in the system so that the mentallyill psychopaths in our government are reeducated and assisted in the activity of not causing widespread death and suffering and totalruin of the planet.

       Are they tied together somehow? If so who is responsible? Reddit? Clinton campaign?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a tricky one though since you would expect some of this naturally. Such as the Bernie fans focusing on Trump now that the Sanders campaign has all but ended. They won't praise Clinton because they hate her.

       Lots of those people have been around forever - like me.

       And let me tell you - I like Hillary as much as I like Trump, which means I'd like to see them tied together in a bag and locked away somewhere I never have to see them again.

       Trump is a deliberately abrasive and combative individual.  You would hardly call him conciliatory or expect him to reach out to his opponents.

       No conspiracy is needed to explain why both candidates are so widely disliked!
