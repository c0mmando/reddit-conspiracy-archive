<blockquote>
<p>A few months back I purchased a Netgear Arlo home security camera set. I set up an online account, connected the cameras, tried them out for a few days and ultimately changed my mind. They were returned to the store and I never gave it another thought...until today. I got a random email alerting me that the camera had detected motion...but I don&#39;t have any cameras. So I logged into my online account and I can see the new owner, their house, and everything they&#39;re doing. Netgear obviously doesn&#39;t have a system in place to prevent cameras on multiple accounts. If I&#39;m not mistaken, anyone could get the serial number off your cameras and link them to their online account, to watch and record your every move without your permission. A creeper dream. Does anyone else see this as a serious security flaw on Netgear&#39;s behalf?
I&#39;m even happier that I returned them now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew a guy who installed for brinks and said they&#39;d test the remote feed. The system is connected so anyone can get into it if they wanted. It&#39;s a bad flaw the company should fix though. Anything that&#39;s connected can be used against you or by someone you don&#39;t want. It&#39;s the trade off for security. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This takes me back.  I don&#39;t know if it is still around but there use to be certain thing you could google that were like a string of code that looked like: hhjvgh4+bhk3b4khbki53b.pil.414khb542jb52</p>

<p>The search results would all be unprotected cctv feeds.  Most of them from China but some where university campus cameras, zoo cameras and mall cameras.  While others were live feeds that people where meant to be able to view.  You could even take control of some and and zoom and pan.  I wounder if you can still access these today? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t some conspiracy by net)gear but most likely the result of some non technical middle management type trading off security for usability. If it isn&#39;t easy to set up and link to your online acct, people will not use the product. Hence why wifi password used to ship with default credentials. Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity </p>

<p>Have you tried contacting the manufacturer?  They have &quot;bug bounty&quot; programs this might qualify for </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me... We got an ecobee thermostat.  If it loses wifi for four hours, the associated online account is automatically deleted.  The associated authentication token, however, apparently gets reused, so my phone started controlling some random thermostat in Canada.  Also, the codes used to register the devices and associate them to an account are only 4 case insensitive characters, so it&#39;s kind of easy to brute force.</p>
