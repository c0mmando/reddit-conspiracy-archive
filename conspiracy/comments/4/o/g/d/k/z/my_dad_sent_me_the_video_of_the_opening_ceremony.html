    <div class="md"><p>Naw, I didn&#39;t. The Gotthardarea plays a massive role in swiss (and central european) history, culture and folklore - all of which was present in the ceremony. And why? Because it is symbolic. This tunnel breaks trough a natural barrier which has been around since mankind settled in this area. This ain&#39;t just another tunnel..</p>

<p>Maybe a example would help to understand my point: Take the pledge of allegiance. Having children recite an oath on the nation simply screams fascist indoctrination. It is simply wrong, it has no place and there is no need for it and yet, it is part of the US american culture. I probably won&#39;t get it unless I spend a long time in the USA just like someone who didn&#39;t spend a sufficent amount of time in the alpine areas of Europe probably won&#39;t get the roots of the symbols and stories which where referenced in the ceremony.</p>

<p>One of the most famous stories surrounding the Gotthard ist how the Teufelsbrücke (the first bridge on the gotthardpass) came to be. In this story the devil builds the bridge for the low price of the first soul which crosses the bridge. The wise people of Urn then send a goat across the bridge which made the devil so angry that he attempted to destroy the bridge. The ladies/spirits in white could be then linked to e.g. Perchta or the white women in general. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I am and therefore I know that christian faith is mostly seen as exoteric. Trough the history of christianity the catholic church has time and time again taken a firm stance against esoteric christian movements. </p>

<p>(Just ask any priest if he believes that there is a hidden knowledge in the scripture .. )</p>

<p>Nonetheless there have been and are a myriad of esoteric christian movements - some of which have been classified as heresy some which were more or less acceptet.</p>

<p>If we accept that esoteric and/or occult movements played (and play) a significant role in the history of christianity we could furthermore seek out some of the roots. A few are trivial - egyptian &amp; hellenistic for example as well as the esoteric aspects of judaism.</p>

<p>As few seem rather hidden eg. celtic or german influences. </p>

<p>(best example would be christmas: the 25 december is set due to pagan and/or roman influences, santa claus is further based on german figures (one of which is Perchta btw.))</p>

<p>The next step would consist in finding those moments when  symbols changed their meaning - Baphomet was redefined due to Eliphas Levis, the theosphical schools in the late 19th century redefined most of esoteric christianity.. </p>

<p>tl;dr: Using a 19th century definition from a french christian esoteric to explain a figure used in a modern ceremony which references a 14th century swiss tell tale might get awkward when you mix it with the ancient roman deity of harvest and the modern hellenistic/roman deity of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is strictly far fetched  speculation but at the top of most conspiracies you find the bankers. </p>

<p>A ceremony  like this, in public,  isn&#39;t allowable by the norms of social acceptability. It has to have been authorized  by someone with great power.</p>

<p>Speculatively, this could be a demonstration of influence  by one of  the most powerful entities in the world. the BIS, The Bank for International Settlements,  the central bank of the central banks,  located in Basel Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Bank for International Settlements seems to  think they can defy God.</p>

<p>The BIS  along with the IMF and the World Bank have a virtual monopoly on the creation of money. I imagine that&#39;s a  pretty valuable monopoly to have. </p>

<p>I assume they do probably think highly of themselves in light of  their having virtually  limitless power over the human race. </p>

<p>They appear to envision themselves as the new Tower of Babel and thus  they are by definition, &#39;defying God&#39;.</p>

<p>The reason I say this is because of their location, Basel Switzerland, their history (whew!), the shape of their building strongly resembling the biblical tower of Babel   and the fact that they are composed of a large group of people grouped in a single building, who  speak many  different languages. </p>

<p>The board of directors consists  of the presidents of the world&#39;s central banks generally. They meet once every two months  while in possession of the power to decide what happens to us all in an entirely enforceable way.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s their building.</p>

<p>The tower of babel  reportedly ended up being  destroyed by God.  Building a new Tower of Babel from a position of such  world domination appears to me as an act of defiance. </p>

<p>The BIS seems to believe they have so much power that they can challenge God to try to destroy them,  again.</p>

<p>This ceremony, along with whatever  other  content,  could  essentially   be a statement, by the world bankers, of their  dominion  or domination. &#39;Not even God can destroy us, we have Satan on our side.&#39; </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that having  the power to create money would not generally be a favorable condition  for maintaining a sound and balanced  mind.</p>

<p>Ya&#39; might get a little carried away</p>

<p>and they&#39;ve got us all by the money.</p>

<p>This is speculation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual truth is more like we believe that these people believe in satanic rituals. We dont actually think the devil is real, but these elite do rituals like this ceremony and loke Bohemian grove. Are they doing actual rituals? We know thats highly unlikely. Do they think theyre doing rituals? We think they are. Kinda like &quot;eating the body of christ.&quot; We all know theyre not actually eating his body, but we recognize the symbolism involved. Same here with these supposed satanic rituals. Does that sound logical to you? Or do you think Im a religious conspiracy theorist even though Im atheist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this makes no sense. the idea stated was religious people that believe everything is a conspiracy related to religion interpret things they don&#39;t understand to be an indicator reflecting their religion--be it in regards to the devil or the rapture or some sort of religious prophecy. that is the nature of having an omnipresent god and an identifying faith--everything must tie back to one&#39;s religion. i appreciate your position that we think they think what is happening is real. your thought (assuming you don&#39;t have a nordic anthropology masters under your belt) is flawed, however. it&#39;s like trying to use a background in cuneiform to understand korean pictogram words. it doesn&#39;t translate and the natural human desire to order chaos will cause a Pareidolia in which one assigns meaning form a place of ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s Gotthard pass in Switzerland. It&#39;s actually the new longest tunnel in the world at 35 miles long. It&#39;s also pretty deep underground compared to other trains. It&#39;s an impressive feat of engineering, but the opening ceremony was definitely satanic. They are viewing it as a symbolic portal to hell I guess because of the length and depth of it </p>
