       No doubt about it.   You'd have to be borderline retarded to believe this crap.  320 people in a club, a 3 hour standoff, and no compelling footage of anything?  Bullshit

       At least they
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O00YFKJe1fo">
        showed footage of them with guns in the school
       </a>
       .  Something as basic as this could sway public opinion, but no videos of shooters on site are allowed.  Same with Aurora shootngs, San Bernardino etc...  Columbine was very real.  Orlando?  Not so much.

        All they need to do is show something like this.

       We don't need to see live video of them shooting, but fucking something linking them to the scene would be nice.

       I agree with you OP!  Extraordinary claims of 50 people killed, requires extraordinary evidence.

       that Batalcan photo doesn't make sense for what was reported.  Also, the smear looks a lot like the Brussels airport logo.   check out the figures in the upper balcony.     Also, where is the rest of that set?  only one photo?  really?

       I don't think that's common practice. Shows respect for the relatives of the deceased. You know, so they don't have to see their dead kid on TV or have someone ask them "is this your dead kid?" type stuff. In my city, for no murders do I ever see anything other than tarps covering bodies.

       Why do you have to see the bodies? Do you really think that there aren't any and the hundreds of first responders are all in on it? Like why do you have to see the bodies physically? 300 rounds really isn't that heavy or bulky. 10 magazines? Easily could fit in a backpack or in pockets and tucked in to your waist if you don't have a tactical vest.

       How about all the family members that had to go identify the bodies? Go ask one of them and see where that gets you. Cause you're not going to see any bodies unless something gets posted to liveleak.

       You are incredibly delusional if you think that nobody actually died that night. Why the hell would they show you bodies? If your family got shot up like that, you wouldn't want their mangled up bodies shown everywhere

       He thinks he's owed the bodies for some reason. Because he's entitled to his proof and if he doesn't see them, then of course the whole thing is definitely fake.

       The last thing on people's minds when they're getting shot at or are in the same vicinity where people are getting shot is to do a snapchat or make a status update. They're going to get the hell out of there as fast as possible.

       Oh so there were hostages inside with the shooter after the shooting? Okay so put yourself in their shoes. Are you going to risk doing anything that might make the shooter upset? Or get his attention? I don't think so.

       I found a few but this one looks like the guy (or girl) is dead already. Or else just very stiff. There's another one where two people are carrying a guy in red shoes, but you can't tell if he's been shot. Can't see where this person was shot if at all, but they're clearly being handled. And here's another one where she's got blood on her.

       That's all I can find in like 2 minutes on mobile at work. Less than 4 days after the shooting. No idea where they are and I'm sure their funerals will be soon, probably some have happened already. And I doubt they'll be open to the public, or at least most of them.

       Apparently a few of them are open because Westboro Baptist Church is in town to actively protest at a few of the funerals. But yea, it makes perfect sense. These are just fake funerals for fake people who didn't die. Perfect sense. Perfect. Fucking. Sense.

       This guy gets it.  This is what I've been trying to tell people.  People whose knee jerk reaction to every mass shooting is to scream about how it's a false flag and where are the bodies and why are people walking to the scene instead away etc etc are just as bad if not more so as the people that believe the official narrative without question.  They're opposite sides of the same coin.

       Yeah I'm all for questioning the media because obviously they all spin some sort of angle, but I'm not gonna demand to see the bodies of the victims or pretend I'm a fucking psychologist and declare that relatives are crisis actors because the smiled or laughed during an interview.

       Where are the drunk people, where is the panic, where is the post traumatic stress, where are the emotionally unstable? If people were getting shot around me I would not walk out in the same as when I walked in. I would not be smiling, I would probably be crying my eyes out because my friends and I almost died.

       A doctor was on the radio talking about how he expects most of the victims will survive.  If there were no victims at the hospital he works at someone would speak up and call him on his bs.  Just because there are no pictures of bodies or victims doesn't mean there are none.

       There was atleast one more of the videoer hiding behind a bar with direct sight if two bodies on the ground that lit up when the outside lights shown in, but alot of videos are buried under the snapchat video and news video, as well as injured exiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only sharing the videos I found with a quick search. Don't shoot the messenger.

       Apparently, everyone in Orlando still uses flip phones? I mean, come on, the most basic phones now have better cameras than what these videos show. Nobody with an iPhone got any footage??

       What you're doing is called "moving the target."  You'll never be satisfied with the evidence that is contrary to your opinion or you'll set the threshold so high that nobody will be able to present good enough evidence for you.

       releasing evidence publicly pre-trial falls under jury tampering because it creates assumption and bias in potential jurors before they hear the evidence. O.J. got off because of Jury Tampering, everyone thought he was guilty because of news coverage and that was grounds to get him off because he would have never gotten a fair trial

       Video 2 works for me. It's the bathroom, also of potato quality, but a body is shown atleast twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video 1 is when swat entered and the club was being cleared. You can see a body on the ground as the light moved around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video 3 is from outside, and when I first watched it I thought I saw two sheets. But see now I was mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is videos, pictures will come out I'm sure as time passes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, only sharing the videos. But I h
ave trouble understanding what the story is when one minute the focus is on the guy dropped off air because he mentioned someone holding the door, and the next its all a complete hoax.

       RantingMosquito,
      </p>
      <p>
       Something happened at Orlando and is off key. It's feels strange right? Same with Sandy Hook, San Bernardino and not even one photo released of Bin Laden's body - who was the most wanted man on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there were real victims but the agenda behind the actions could have been staged. I don't know.
But to tell someone, who for all we know does know a victim at Pulse and is telling the truth, to shut up and post dead body pictures does nothing but make you look like a petulant little cunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a fucking clue and some basic social skills and then maybe the people will take you seriously.
      </p>

       See, you're doing it again, talking down to everyone.  Get fucked, "sweetie", and wonder why everyone in this thread is yelling at you and vice versa rather than engaging in discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you're not a teenager and haven't learned how to talk to people is sad.  Now you being rude as fuck has turned everyone off from your point of view.  Great Job!

       I live in Orlando and I fully believe an "event" happened at Pulse...and people really were killed, and for that I am sorry. But, I can't help but see that things do not seem right. I'm not going to point EVERYTHING that is questionable about the whole story AGAIN, as many before me have... I have never even considered a conspiracy before in my life, but this has made me take a good hard look into things. "Believe nothing you hear, and only half of what you see."

       I knew one of the people killed in the shooting, it was real, his mother's grief is very real, my grief is very real, and while I'm sure you'll have all moved on to your next crack pot bullshit by the time the funerals are held, the funerals will be very real. Some of you need to get off the computer and spend some time in the real world. Like your mind can't process the fact that bad shit happens for no reason in the world every day.

       Dude. Even if photos were public they'd be immediately dismissed as a photoshop job or doctored or patently false. As someone with a decades worth experience in research and investigations, I can assure you there's no definitive proof in the world good enough to convince paranoid  people who want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the safe refuge of their insulated life they will warp the outside world to fit into the narrow delusions they hold. They'll call you a troll, a sheep, etc. They will only talk with like minded individuals. These are amateur crackpots, with no ability to cite or source their claims, no understanding of research methods or common logical fallacies.

       Maybe these people should buy a plane ticket and go visit some of the open casket funerals in Florida...or just get off the computer and get into the social world like I said earlier.

       I'm well aware nobody who is convinced these are "staged" or "false flags" are going to change their minds, but I'd be remiss to not state that I knew Captain Brown and have spoken directly to his family when people shit all over his memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the people arm chair quarterbacking, they're spineless with zero intestinal fortitude. I am content enough in knowing I've done more with my life, and seen more of the world they wish they could get into (but are too cowardly to step into) than they ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like people jump from point A to point Z and skip all the letters in between when something doesn't add up in their head. They need to put down the Sci Fi books and drop off the conspiracy websites for a few months to clear their heads, there is no logical pattern to the way they try to connect the dots.

       This is people calling that news reporter getting shot live on TV fake all over again.

       Somehow I doubt a single person posting here has ever fired a gun at a human being or seen a human being hit with a firearm, let alone a hand gun - or been in a firefight, or even have any form of medical background.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've experienced all of the above.

      <p>
       Bad shit happens for no reason in this world, people need to learn to accept that instead of trying to rationalize it into some over reaching axis of evil trying to shape the world into something else.

       I have a digital footprint under this username that goes back almost two decades, if I'm a "Government hack" I'm sure doing a damn good job of it and got recruited mighty young.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple issues with someone deeming a mass murder as fake just because law enforcement doesn't put out forensic evidence and the final moments of someone's lives via 911 calls to sate the delusions of a half dozen idiots on a sub reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a huge discredit to people trying to find the truth. If you think there's anything OK with demanding pictures of dead bodies and audio recordings of people in the last moments of their lives, like it's somehow your right, when you have zero personal connection to the incident - you're a complete moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think people are going to think "Oh, there's a shooter in the building, quick, let me take a selfie and put it on Facebook." You're an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen all of these arguments made that go completely off the rails of any form of rational thought or logic, and I can only assume that the people doing it spend way too much time being the atypical tin foil hat stereotype instead of getting out and socializing - so introverted from the real world that they create their own reality from the confines of their house to try and cope with their own issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've already made it clear you're not here to make friends, or for discussion, which only concludes that you have some kind of borderline dis-associative disorder or a delusional mind - where in your world you're somehow owed information that you're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, and the other handful of morons who down vote anyone trying to push a narrative that doesn't fit into their own little glass house of la-la land do so because you cannot handle when a person suppresses or opposes the world you've created for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally I don't really go out of my way to reply to people like you, or really post in this sub reddit at all, because frankly the people who are nutjobs are plainly obvious and the people who are logical and seeking answers are equally obvious - but this is a personal matter and frankly it pisses me off that even a dozen of you can make that jump from A to Z while ignoring all the information in between as to why the evidence you demand might not be readily available to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have fun being that miserable person in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad a majority of people in this Sub Reddit seem to be more intelligent and don't just jump from point A to point Z when trying to put two and two together.

       It's easy to spout shit with no real world experience. There's a difference between being a skeptic and being an uninformed ass. You've provided no compelling argument for your arguments.
