    <div class="md"><p>If you check my post history,  someone else didnt believe me so i took some screen shots of my facebook of people grieving for paul. If you want more proof, call choice hotels reservations, ask to be transferred to blugreen, and talk to the employees. He worked there in the call transfer dept selling vacations,  and theyre currently donating a portion of all sales to his family. Everyone knew him, he was super positive, hilarious, and a great salesperson. </p>

<p>Again, i dont know what actually happened. I dont know how many shooters there were or if this was part of a bigger conspiracy.  All i know is my friend Paul is dead, and you can definitely verify it.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll plug my own speculation, though I am leaning more towards hoax at this point:

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If anyone is wondering what happened to the grieving mother who was being interviewed all over the place, here is her creepy interview with Anderson Cooper at the denouement of her character arc: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4o5bb0/now_we_know_that_they_the_smiling_parents_who/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4o5bb0/now_we_know_that_they_the_smiling_parents_who/</a></p>

<p>Also, I think this is post strikes some good points about the possibility that this was a real false flag dressed up as a hoax, where the crisis actors are there mainly to control the narrative: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4o2h28/theory_orlando_shooting_was_a_realfalse_flag/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4o2h28/theory_orlando_shooting_was_a_realfalse_flag/</a></p>

<p>People need to wrap their brains around this.  It is very possible that dozens were truly slain and yet crisis actors are still being employed in the aftermath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been posting on this sub for about a year, and have come across dozens of posts both here and on other sites in which someone says they knew someone who was an acquaintance of another who was there, or got shot, or killed, or whatever, without providing any specifics. These are largely suspected to be the postings of paid shills, the existence of which has of course been proven.</p>

<p>That being the case, I want to make it clear that this time, <strong>I&#39;m</strong> the one this time who is claiming to know someone who knows someone to got killed in the attack. My mom has been friends with a woman who lives in Central Florida since the &#39;90&#39;s, first from message boards, then from meeting in person several times. This woman, now in her 70&#39;s, claims to have lost a nephew in the attack. Knowing of her, and the nature of her relationship with my mom, it seems impossible for her to be lying.</p>

<p>Because the coverage looks so similar to hoaxes we&#39;ve seen before, it&#39;s difficult to entertain the idea that this was a false flag, and that crisis actors are putting on a show while people are actually getting massacred nearby. That&#39;s quite unsettling. What also concerns me, though, is that if this is a real attack, and there are people who obviously know it was real, then our claims of previous shootings being hoaxes look foolish. Because, look! Real shootings look just the same on the news as fake ones. And that makes me wonder if someone in charge <em>is</em> actually thinking after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is some info that is common to false flag attacks that we see in the Orlando manufactured terror event (thanks to Kevin Scott King, mhb):</p>

<p>False-Flag Commonalities – Orlando</p>

<p>1) Multiple shooters become one: but it appears they have been unable to keep a lid on this w/ Orlando.</p>

<p>2) Alleged ‘perpetrator’ dead: either suicide or death by LEO, so can’t defend themselves or claim what they were about.</p>

<p>3) Communication during event: somehow the lone shooter finds time to text, call, communicate whilst in the midst of their shooting spree. In case of Orlando the shooter called 911 (always good remind people of that trauma mind control event) to blame ISIS.</p>

<p>4) Crazy lone white gunman or dark Muslim extremist: and in this case ISIS! (wait, is that the same ISIS created by Western Intelligence Services to overthrow Assad?).</p>

<p>5) Emergency Services Drill: in this case it was 6 months prior.</p>

<p>6) Absolute ZERO video/pics of event while it’s happening: In the age where everyone has a Smartphone, but somehow no pics or vids… hmmm. I wonder why the perps never take selfies? Or pictures of their victims, or hostages? But ALWAYS manage pics of walking wounded (but never severely wounded) post event.</p>

<p>7) Grieving relatives (bad crisis actors): who can’t manage to shed a tear and show no physical evidence of emotional trauma but always remember to mention gun control.</p>

<p>8) Alleged Perps (Patsy) links to Intelligence: and usually it’s FBI, and in this case it is AND father former longtime CIA asset.</p>

<p>9) Weapons: Black ‘Assault’ Rifles! (AR15 or AK47) and black semi-auto handguns.</p>

<p>10) Internet Time Stamps before event: In this case Twitter comments made several hours before alleged event took place.</p>

<p>11) No actual evidence of any deaths: a body covered by a white sheet is NOT evidence of a death. And as stated above; In this age of Smartphones, where is the pic/vid evidence?</p>

<p>12) No surveillance camera vids: In the age of video, no video evidence = nothing happened or what happened is different than the official narrative.</p>

<p>13) Witness or family member of alleged victim (who gets media coverage; interview) is an actor: hello Luis Burbano (who was also a participant).</p>

<p>14) Gun Free Zone: Pulse Nightclub, establishments where the primary income source is alcohol prevent concealed carry by law.</p>

<p><strong>It is these ‘commonalities’ that prove that these false-flag events are staged by the same group/organizations.</strong></p>

<p>This was a Left side event. With a four-fold agenda; Gun control, LGBT sympathies, anti-Muslim sentiments, pro-war against ISIS. Actually this a Right and Left event… interesting. And as always using FEAR to manipulate the masses. Frankly I’m surprised they didn’t squeeze in a Russian angle in the event somehow.</p>

<pre><code>I personally would add in militarization of police and internet censorship (because we are become radicalized through the internet).

    <div class="md"><p>This is a rather ridiculous list of items that would require real stretches of imagination to put into &quot;evidence&quot;. No one, even someone unconvinced about what happened, would look at this list and say &quot;Yeah. That settles the matter. I&#39;m sure now.&quot; Only someone who <em>already believed</em> that the massacre was a &quot;false-flag&quot; or a &quot;hoax&quot; or whatever would put any credence to your thoughts. Let&#39;s go through them, shall we?</p>

<ol>
<li>In the chaos, several people claimed to hear gunshots coming from multiple directions. This is literally the worst type of eyewitness there is. </li>
<li>Him being dead means nothing. The Boston Bomber is still alive. So are several of the Paris terrorists. Face it. If he were still alive, you&#39;d come up with some equally wild theory, mind control drugs or what have you.</li>
<li>He was holding the club hostage for 3 hours. Yeah, he had time to call with the hand that wasn&#39;t carrying a gun.</li>
<li>He <em>claimed</em> to be ISIS. He also claimed to support several other terrorist groups. None of them took any responsibility.</li>
<li>Wow. An emergency service drill in a public venue. That <em>never</em> happens. Certainly not at least once a year.</li>
<li>Several videos surfaced of people in the club during the shooting. Most of the rest were withheld out of respect for the victims. No, they don&#39;t show these videos on the news just to satisfy the sick curiosity of people like you.</li>
<li>So out of hundreds of hours of interviews of people crying over the dead, you found 6 seconds were someone isn&#39;t crying. Wow. Solid stuff. Right there. Definitely &quot;crisis actors&quot;.</li>
<li>The guy was briefly under FBI investigation. There&#39;s no evidence of any government connection on the fathers part.</li>
<li>Yes. He used assault rifles to commit a crime. You broke the case wide open.</li>
<li>Tweets from different timezones were screenshotted and blasted across conspiracy websites. There were no tweets from before the event.</li>
<li>Again, the police don&#39;t indulge sick death-worshipping fantasies. They generally don&#39;t release pictures of dead terrorists.</li>
<li>No surveillance camera vids <em>released</em>. You may see a few pop up in the next week or so once the investigation is wrapped up.</li>
<li>Let me get this straight: Out of the hundreds of people involved <em>one</em> guy is a minor actor. That&#39;s evidence of what, exactly? That actors live in Orlando?</li>
<li>Yes. They don&#39;t let people bring guns in. They also don&#39;t have enough security to stop a homicidal maniac with multiple assault rifles barging through the doors. </li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what a lot of people think, but I disagree. I think it&#39;s just that they get a lot of voters by being anti gun control. Once they are anti gun control, they want to convert more people to that, to get more voters.</p>

<p>Politics makes more sense to me if everyone is always just trying to get more votes. I don&#39;t think many politicians care about a big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i posted this logic on another thread but i&#39;ll just copy/paste</p>

<p>omar mateen worked/works for G4S, a private security contractor that derives over a third of their revenues from federal contracts (to the tune of over $200 million dollars annually). they have a virtual monopoly on dept. of energy security contracts (G4S provides security to over 90% of nuclear facilities in the united states), which they won almost entirely without bidding for them. why is this the case? because the government pays them lucrative and overpriced security contracts on legitimate details in order to compensate them for off the books operations.</p>

<p>&quot;It is known throughout the industry that if you want a dirty job done, call Wackenhut.&quot; - retired FBI agent, William Hinshaw. wackenhut corp. merged with group 4 falck in 2002, which then merged with securicor in 2004 to form G4S. in recent years their board of directors has been home to a former FBI director, a former secretary of defense, a former CIA deputy director, a former director of the secret service, and a national security advisor to george bush.</p>

<p>if you can tell me that reports of multiple shooters, the fact that this &quot;wannabe cop&quot; (as the new york post so quaintly put it) purportedly has military grade skills with an AR-15, the fact that over three days later they STILL haven&#39;t released the 911 call audio where mateen purportedly claims ISIS, and the fact that the FBI revised the death toll from 50 to 49 &quot;to account for the shooter&quot; (this part is extremely confusingly worded in almost every news article i&#39;ve read, but the current line of thinking is that mateen was a victim and they revised the account when using him as a patsy) are all coincidences, then i will concede that mateen acted alone and of his own free will. until then, i&#39;ll be scrutinizing the $234 million contract between homeland security and G4S; this seems like convenient timing to encourage congress to exercise another one-year option on the contract, because &quot;the threat ISIS poses is now greater than ever.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for copy/pasting here. It would make sense if Omar Mateen was a victim/patsy since he supposedly was a regular at the club. Whoever set him up would just wait for him to be there, then execute the plan.</p>

<p>Also, I think this is perfect timing for such an operation since LA Pride weekend and the Tony Awards were both concurrently taking place. Think of them as &quot;force multipliers&quot; for the cultural impact of the shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hi guys,
I&#39;m normally not one to jump on false flag stuff so fast, but right from the get go this one had a weird stink to me. 
Here is a list of things I have seen so far that are more than suspect. 
In no particular order:</p>

<p>In the video below the victim impersonates the gun sound like automatic weapon ‘ratatata’. He also says there were 2 shooters.
There are also copters overhead, yet no copters in ANY video during the event / attack (?)
<a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/eyewitness-account-from-within-pulse-nightclub/nrfJF/">http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/eyewitness-account-from-within-pulse-nightclub/nrfJF/</a></p>

<p>What did I present the above? Because in the (how coincidental) video, the only clip from within the club, magically shot at the EXACT moment of gunfire - we clearly hear BAM BAM BAM - NOT the ‘ratatata’ spoken of above <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3638930/Snapchat-footage-shows-moments-shots-rang-inside-Pulse-nightclub.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3638930/Snapchat-footage-shows-moments-shots-rang-inside-Pulse-nightclub.html</a></p>

<p>Also re: above - we were told the incident took place at 2am. Alcohol is stopped at 1am so typically people leave. How come it still looks packed at 2am?</p>

<p>Also, this Snapchat was (apparently) sent to the victim&#39;s brother. Here is his reponse - please look for signs of grief (??)
brother???? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsD_QSp-rK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsD_QSp-rK4</a></p>

<p>And here is his facebook profile: (fb) proformanceheatandair.brianalvear
Yet his SISTER Amanda Alvear is not one of his 469 friends (???)</p>

<p>The video below is my favorite - civilians (why not paramedics?) are carrying a &#39;victim&#39; - but when they think they&#39;re off camera they put him down and laugh (!)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNewsknuBw&amp;amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNewsknuBw&amp;amp;app=desktop</a></p>

<p>There are more but consider this the &#39;starter kit&#39; to &#39;something&#39;s afoot&#39; in Orlando.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: assuming that innocent people were killed, this is a tragedy and a travesty; my post is in no way to present any disrespect to victims. Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this was a false flag, then I need something explained to me.</p>

<p>The narrative I&#39;ve seen from people in this sub is that Donald Trump is a political outlier, and the Powers That Be want to keep him out of office so he doesn&#39;t upset their apple cart.</p>

<p>However, terrorist attacks benefit Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton.  So....you&#39;re saying the PTB staged a false flag attack in order to...<em>help</em> the guy that they don&#39;t want in office in the first place?</p>

<p>Either they <em>do</em> want Trump in office, in which case he&#39;s their guy and not the political outlier you imagine him to be, or this wasn&#39;t a false flag operation.  You need to pick one.</p>

<p>Not everything is some gigantic government conspiracy.  Sometimes shit just happens.</p>
