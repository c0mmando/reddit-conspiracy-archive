    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but you have to check it regularly. If you search controversial by week you get the modt controversial of the week by upvotes:downvotes x quantity of votes. That means all that got kept off early and only ever had 4 or 5 upvotes either way won&#39;t show up. You catch some in the 24 hrs that have low single digits but obscure percentages that mean there&#39;d have to be 3 or 4 times as many votes as that actually cast one way or another. There&#39;s many missed however that go from new queue to controversial and because they&#39;re effectively quarantined, get very little for and against so won&#39;t appear til page 4 or 5 of the 24h and basically never in the by week.</p>

<p>Obviously you can see it has been reposted since the event. I originally saw this post mentioning it, but most of the information regarding the post has since been deleted. I still think it was interesting though. Through inspecting some of the page elements they were able to find a post ID tracing the same copied post back to Dallas shortly before the Garland shootings. The license number at the bottom of the page led to more information regarding various companies all headquarters in Ohio that also have links to the UAE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on. </p>

<p>The Powers-That-Be are supposedly so competent, organised and evil that they can secretly arrange mass shootings of their own citizens, with the aim of forcing the public to hand over their guns...</p>

<p>...and yet they haven&#39;t managed to pass a single piece of effective gun control legislation. They can&#39;t even get terrorists&#39; guns. </p>

<p>Presumably there&#39;s government guys already planning the next false flag, saying to the President &quot;okay, okay, so that was another huge waste of resources, planning and an insane level of risk for us to take... but <em>this</em> time it&#39;ll definitely work!&quot;</p>

<p>That quote is a perfect example of the desired false narrative. This is exactly what the NeoFascistPTB want their Tea Party of Amerikkka to believe...so that they&#39;ll hustle out and buy more guns. The goal is an armed and agitated army of ready-to-revolt Trumpeteers fed up with Communist (Obama)-sponsored, false-flag gun grabs. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>Obviously you can see it has been reposted since the event. I originally saw this post mentioning it, but most of the information regarding the post has since been deleted. I still think it was interesting though. Through inspecting some of the page elements they were able to find a post ID tracing the same copied post back to Dallas shortly before the Garland shootings. The license number at the bottom of the page led to more information regarding various companies all headquarters in Ohio that also have links to the UAE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does public support even matter to the government? Iraq, for example, was divisive from the start, with mass protests against it in both the US and the UK, but it still went ahead.</p>

<p>And according to Gallup: &quot;Since the summer of 2005, opponents of the war have tended to outnumber supporters. A majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake.&quot;</p>
