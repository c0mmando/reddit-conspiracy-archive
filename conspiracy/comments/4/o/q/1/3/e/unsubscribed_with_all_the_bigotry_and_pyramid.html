       Yeah, I just liked back when this sub was about conspiracies and that wasn't in question for the four years before that.  As far as "half my posts", rather than comments, most of which have nothing to do with those things, yeah.  Maybe half of 4 is 2 or half of 6 is 3.  Sorry for spamming.  I've still always contributed to the discussion in comments and asked no more of anyone else.  It's not like this sub gets bombarded with completely non-conspiracy-related material every time Israel does something non-conspiracy related or Graham Chapman announces that he farted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And BTW, it's 8+ years I've been here (take the - off the end of my username), I forgot my password over four years ago but I still miss the time that this sub was largely filled with discussion relevant to conspiracies.

       Yup; except for that of pointing out that this sub has largely gone from /conspiracy into /stormfront and /ancienctaliens and is no longer a useful source of information.

       I've contribute well over 20,000 comment karma and hundreds if not thousands of pages of rational discussion and polite argument well before this became a refuge for "white nationalists" seeking recruits.  I did most of this when Reddit and this sub was much smaller and worthwhile.  I also did it without race-baiting and appealing to the hateful attitudes of those who have largely taken over this sub.  Enjoy being a part of intentionally subverting a forum for discussion in exactly (and also statedly) the way Hasbara does others.

      </p>
      <p>
       a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. : a bigoted person; especially : a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group).

       As far as the first part, generalizing a bad trait true of a part of a group of people to all those people is
       <strong>
        fair
       </strong>
       ?  You come from Mobile, Alabama?  You're clearly married to you sister!  All Catholic priests are child molesters.  True?  No?  Well  posts that as much as say that all Rabbis are (despite far fewer known cases) are routinely upvoted.  Fuckin' Hitler speeches overlaid with messages about white people overthrowing our Jewish overlors *since Hitler's speeches on the subject weren't extreme enough apparently) are upvoted.  So, posts that say that Jews are responsible for all the problems in the political world, both domestic and international are upvoted without them providing any more evidence than those that say Jesuits are (which are stagnant or downvoted) are fair?

       Yup, I read them and the vast majority of the time they are so factually incorrect and sometimes racist/prejudiced that I don't even reply to them/  A lot of them are so obvious that even /worldnews, /news and /politics wouldn't delete them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I guess you're right.  A Rabbi molested a kid thus all Jews are pedophiles, Israel did something shitty thus all Jews are evil, a black person committed a crime and it wasn't Casey Anthony level "news" so I guess there's a massive conspiracy to not cover the crimes of black people, "white genocide" and on and on and on.  Seems like sound logic to me!

       I just did the same. I understand that there are people who intentionally flood the subreddit with garbage in order to create even more disinformation and make us look bad, but the fact that the subreddit moderators never take decisive action against it suggests to me that their interests are very different from mine.

      <p>
       This is an ok position to hold, but it's not the one that's right for me. I find that sifting through pseudo-religious garbage and flat earth posts severely reduces my interest in real conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe I'll be less aware of things that are happening in the world, but to me it's apparent that I'm better off looking at the "daily propaganda" (i.e. news media) and figuring things out myself, rather than trying to look through a dumpster of a subreddit for the increasingly more rare analyses written by people who can't bring themselves to stand up against those who want to drown their voices out.

       Real posters in this subreddit: Every time the trolls/shills post obvious nonsense they are laughing at you because you don't even try to stop them. Your target audience doesn't trust the subreddit anymore, so you're just painting the walls of the echo chamber they have imposed on you.

       What are you suggesting someone do (that's not a mod)?  Leave the sub as you have?  I think the ones that you say are laughing, would be laughing most at those who just leave.  Sure there is a lot of crap, and personally, there are a few people that spam endlessly that need banning, imo.  But they will just reappear under a new name, right?  And who is to decide what is, and isn't crap?  The National Equirer is a shitty grocery store propaganda paper that spews endless gossip and bullshit and has for decades.  But once in a while, they also break the biggest stories that no one else will touch.  That is what this sub is like.  There are ten shitty submissions for one good one.  Someone has to use their critical thinking skills to decide for themselves.  Others just leave, but to go where exactly?  Stop with your finger pointing and just exit, stage right.

       I'm not saying not to judge me, I'm saying that my life is not all about browsing endless pages of reddit or even the internet in general, so I'm not up to the task. There are undoubtedly many others like me. So if the real posters on here want to get support of the average person, there needs to be a more accessible way to do it.

       You can tell me you have $100 for me, and I'll say great, but if you then tell me it's in a landfill under 5 feet of rotting food I'll have to reconsider how to spend my time.

       What?  That doesn't make any sense.  People downvote the shitty posts, they upvote the better posts.  For the most part, it works well.  I don't see any alternative that would be superior, nor are you making any clear suggestion, (other than just leaving).

       I don't really care how you spend your time.  But in your original post, you seem to be grilling the others who populate the sub but can't express exactly why.  You seem to want people to "gang up" on the bad posters.  Well, people do do that on occasion.  But I've found the best way to deal with this sub is to downvote the "new" category when you see utter shit, and enjoy it for what it is.  Mostly shit with some gems mixed in, but stuff you won't see elsewhere.

       I think you're missing my point - the current anything goes system may work for people like you, but not for people who may only be casually interested. What do you think a black user is going to do when he sees nonsense about white genocide posted? Are they going to be open to the post directly below that, regardless of what it is, or does it scare them away? Especially someone who may be visiting for the first time or someone who spends less than an hour online every day.

       I think the black user is going to do the same exact thing I do when I see flat earth shit, they will ignore it.  Bigotry is everywhere when people can remain anonymous.

       It serves the interests of the former. The message received by them is "we're going to spam you until you leave", and the message received by the community is "I like to take it up the ass", so forgive me for not sticking it out.

       No, the community attempts not to censor, at least not to your liking.

       Awww, someone read something on the internet they didn't like, that's really tough.  Bye bye now.  I'm sure Sunset magazine has something online.  Maybe some gardening videos would help soothe your soul.  You don't have time for anything except the finest conspiracy material.  Just wait for a local nerd to fill you in.  Good day.

       It's not that, I'm prepared to ignore stupid people on the internet,
       <em>
        if there is something to be gained
       </em>
       . I'm saying that the ratio of bad posts to good ones is now high enough that it's not worth it to waste my time ignoring bad comments
       <em>
        and
       </em>
