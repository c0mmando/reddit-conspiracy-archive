       I thought I'd go here maybe you guys would agree with me. I always see these posts on reddit, or ones that are similar. Of a really high res photo of someone in the military in a cool pose or doing something cool talking about some shit the photo often doesn't have to do with. Take this

        post

       . All the comments are always super patriotic because of a circle jerk or whatever but still idk seems like propaganda, and it would sorta make sense. Also sorry if this is the wrong sub for this idk where to go.

       They are desperate for recruits (cannon fodder) for their never-ending wars of aggression for profit.  The military is even paying to have extra jingoistic promotion at sporting events, etc.

       That photo is quite interesting really.  Reverence to the flag above all, with wisp of smoke for effect.  Gun slung cool-guy style on the back of a faceless soldier, so that the observer can feel as if they are the soldier.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the sports team that I can see.

       They are desperate to get recruits, which is why they are really pushing this particular jingoistic fantasy across to the right individuals.  Unthinking people who spend too much time caring about sports are a perfect audience.

       So who they going to invade next? Not much countries left to invade I'm afraid. Iraq and Afghanistan were their favorites. Probably just stationing troops in Poland, or some other East European country.
      </p>
      <p>
       They managed to bomb Yugoslavia back into the darkage in a stopgap war between two Iraqi invasions. Are they in any way being creative again like in Libya, Yemen and Syria?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: The Syrian war also served as testing ground for the F-22. Any plan to test F-35s anytime soon? Russia tested their LACM on ISIS targets too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know I was in highschool when 9/11 happened. I'm only a few years younger than Edward Snowden. So he was probably on his senior year at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       He joined army after graduation, since he probably wanted to be part of the party who will bring into justice those who were resposible for the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       His motives were naive as of most teenagers or those in their 20s, he wanted to do something meaningful in his life. Since most of his family worked for the Federal Government, he probably got a freedom boner.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see the American culture itself was designed for war. You play American Rugby/Football in highschool and college, which is a very violent and unnatural sport. You have guns everywhere. Even most - if not all Hollywood movies depict guns in them. And war, and police actions, robberies, car chase, drug wars, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       When high school students in other countries would have more normal sport, like actual football. Even the music industry introduces you to genres like speed metal and the sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even invented motorshows like Monster Truck and NASCAR. I mean, what's the point of circular tracks? People are actually watching this monotonous 100 lap race?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to Snowden. He even drafted into a Special Operation Force Command. That depicts how much of a jingo he was. He doesn't seem much like a guy who joins to become a Grunt because he liked the violence or the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       But fate had other plans. He broke his legs or something, while in training. So he failed to graduate SOF and turned into IT intelligence service instead. Much like Manning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Snowden was this bright type person, it didn't took him long to realize there was something wrong with the NSA. The agency wasn't like he thought it was at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       He suspected the NSA was actually spying on American citizens, thus violating their Constitutional privacy rights. Once again he maintained to erect a freedom boner, but this time into a right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Snowden also knew when he told his superiors about this he would end up like few people before him, who did the same thing. So he waited and setup a plan.

       No telling for sure.  TPTB want continuous war, and that's what we've had without most people even questioning it any longer.  We are even starting some shit with China in recent weeks, with Russia we've just had those close flybys of US ships...  My prediction is Syria, then Iran.  They've been salivating over Iran for ages.  There was a recent Hillary clip I saw that basically said Iran better not so much look at Israel sideways.  So, that's coming soon, no doubt.

       i dont get it, if they are so desperate for recruits, why has the military been downsizing? they also dont really give waivers like they used to, which means anyone with a criminal background cant get in. if they were so desperate why wouldnt they just let anyone in who wanted to join?

       It's a constant ebb and flow.  2015 saw downsizing from what I've read, but that is turning around.  We are at this moment rattling sabers with Syria, China and Russia, just to name a few.  The kind of nationalism displayed in this advertisement serves many purposes, not only direct recruiting.

       Look, there's something you need to learn. When you're nothing more than a glorified murderer, getting paid to do things Ted Bundy did just because he felt like it, you need to do something to make yourself feel better, and getting told by 'patriots' that you're doing an excellent job of killing people is about as good as it gets.

       No, not at all.  I just don't like the direction this country is headed.  Becoming a soldier does not in any way make one an automatic "hero".  That kind of nationalism is how we march into fascism, and it's everywhere now.  The photo speaks volumes as to what is wrong with this nation.  It's not just a photo, it was intended as nationalistic propaganda.
