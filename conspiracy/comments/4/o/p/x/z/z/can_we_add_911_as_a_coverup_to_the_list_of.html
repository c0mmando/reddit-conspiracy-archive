       As you can tell by my handle, I believe neocon cryptofascist globalists did 9/11 and there's lots of evidence.  But putting that on the 'list of confirmed conspiracies' would be a mistake, since those sources and evidence hasn't either been accepted by the establishment / media (using wikipedia as authoritative source of 'establishment opinion'), or the
       <em>
        'court of public opinion'
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, judging from youtube comments, comments in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and elsewhere, it would seem that as of this spring/summer, the 'court of public opinion' has shifted in America towards one that believes 9/11 was
       <em>
        at the least, a big coverup
       </em>
       .  Some still believe Israel was behind 9/11, some Saudi, and some believe it was the work of a secretive network of horizontal loyalists (ex:ruling class secret societies/masons) working within the israel, saudi, egypt, pakistan, and the uk intelligence community...believing it was an international fascist conspiracy.  The opinion that it was from 'al queda' or muslim extremists has become wholly unbelievable by a vast majority in the world at this point.  The evidence for the horizontal loyalists is most compelling and complete because of a decade and a half of research, putting several decades of 'secretive underpinnings' of the Bush dynasty into full context with sites like 'history commons' and their very complete collection of 9/11 facts on a timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question for you guys, including the mods here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is this: would it be acceptable to put the 9/11 event on the list of confirmed conpsiracies if we have sufficient, verifiable evidence of a coverup (which we most certainly do), without per-se naming any groups or individuals responsible?   For example, just demonstrating that the US Government and the US Media coordinated to obfuscate, omit, and derail key details of the investigation to the extent that we believe an obstruction of justice has happened.   What comes to my mind immediately are a couple of things: 1) the rapid exfiltration of WTC steel so it could not be independently examined (google 'Joe Crowley WTC youtube steel'), 2) the stonewalling of the 'follow the unaccountable pentagon money' rummsfeld inquiry by Cynthia McKinney,  3) seizing / destruction of operation greenquest investigation documents by homeland security that would implicate middle eastern influence on us politics and insider trading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you think it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be listed on the locc as a coverup, what details do you think it should include?  So again, to be clear, I'm asking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       2 questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1) Do you believe 9/11 was a confirmable coverup that should be included on the wiki "List of Confirmed Conspiracies"?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2) If yes to #1, what are the facts you would use to derive that conclusion?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks in advance for your help.

       Um, No.  This is not a shill data collection post.  I compiled/organized the original confirmed conspiracy list based on our contributers work and mods allowed me to edit the wiki. I am not a shill.  Real shills will have to get fancy with doubtcasting on this one, so good luck.

       Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three pieces of evidence I would use to prove this are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: The lack of plane wreckage at the Pentagon. The fact that the plane had to fly in an impossible pattern (over the overpass then along the grounds of the Pentagon at less then 40Ft, judged impossible by skilled commercial pilots) 
2: Explosions heard by bystanders &amp; First Responders before the buildings fell into they're footprints. This is incredibly suspect as people from police with military backgrounds to fire fighters reported hearing the explosions. 
3. Building 7 fell in the exact same way as the primary towers hit during 9/11 down into it's footprint. It collapsed "due to fire" in spite of no other steel core skyscraper in the HISTORY of architecture failing due to fire...
      </p>
      <p>
       That for me is the final straw...

       One of the reasons pilots find the approach to the pentagon impossible is that the plane was supposedly traveling so fast at such a low altitude, parallel with the ground, ground effect would have prohibited it. At that speed as well the airplanes control surfaces would have been inadequate and the plane non-responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree about Building 7. I have experience in building demolition; I know for a fact it's simply impossible for a building to fall like that. I've had mid-rise building split open from roof to sub-basement... You can remove floors from below and the rest of the building will remain upright. If you remove enough floors the upper part will topple, but will fall like a tree. If enough of the building is intact, and you remove the lower floors, the upper stories will shear off and fall down, but the rest of the building remains standing. All of Building 7 columns needed to be severed at the same time for a footprint collapse... But the icing is the building fell into itself... Core first then perimeter. What we saw happen that day is simply impossible under the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only acceptable explanation that would work in the governments favor would be if due to the agencies working there, the building had been rigged for controlled demotion as a matter of national security... but if they were to admit that the can would be opened to a cover-up, which means every other finding would be in question. WT7 isn't in the official report simply because the official narrative is indefensible.

       My heart votes yes, of course, but head said "no, not wikipedia-true yet" reading only the title. And then, you are making a strong point: either way it is a confirmed conspiracy as per the definitions and has a rightful place among the others. The failure mode of the Twins is irrefutable evidence of course, but too complicated for some and hence, one things sufficiently serves as authoritative confirmation: the testimony of the authors of the 9/11 Omission Report. 6 of 10 commissioners distanced themselves from it. End of debate.

       Thanks Akareyon.  Good to see you here btw.   I think triangulating on as many intrigues that involve fema and nist and us gov meddling with videographic evidence is key.  I think the
       <em>
        falseheimers
       </em>
       ploy / "halp i'm being badgered by an angry black woman" of Rummsfeld during Cynthia McKinney's inquiry was something everyone should see.  If only to see a wicked old man get his ass a verbal beat-down--I watch this video at least once a year.  Those people straight up refused to give this woman what--as a representative of the people--demanded to know

       I'm reluctant to vote "yes" as we still do not have the proof as to who, exactly, perpetrated it.  The ones in the wiki are all closed cases in that regard, aren't they?  Don't get me wrong, I agree that it is indeed a cover up.  However, the key piece of the puzzle is still missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider new-comers to the sub.  They're going to read the wiki, come to the 9/11 post, get excited, and then
       <em>
        poof
       </em>
       no closure.  What are they going to think?  What would you think?

       I believe the 'who' is irrelevant.  I'm trying to show that US Government acted to obstruct investigation efforts, silence people and information, manufacture disinfo, and utilized the media to craft a narrative around it that suited their purposes.

       FEMA in supports the two peer reviewed papers, they document in their

        Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study
       </a>
       , for sample 1,
       <em>
        “evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting.” A “sulfur-rich liquid” containing “primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur” “penetrated” into the steel.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       We then have the vast amounts of evidence of molten metal, video, physical and eyewitness testimony that confirms this, the the United States Geological Survey indirectly confirm it, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled “WTC Dust Signature,” at the request of the Deutsche Bank confirms previously metal in a molten state, the Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers confirm it etc ect
      </p>
      <p>
       We then have the government produce a report that was unscientific and fraudulent, literally a coverup, which has since been proven so and before that a PNAC policy document,

       for more on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       and that is just the tip of the iceberg, i think it is safe to say that the US government were directly complicit in organizing, planning and executing 9/11, an illegal act and a crime against humanity, the very definition of a conspiracy.

       So yeah, i say add it.

       It's fucking OBVIOUS. What's truly amazing is how powerful the mind protects itself from seeing the truth (or how powerful mass programming is).

       I realized the truth a few years ago. What follows is a brief set of links that I think outlines the events in a convincing way.

       Be aware there is a lot of disinformation out there. You will now find videos claiming that lasers and nuclear weapons were used and that there weren't any planes at all. All of this is meant to make the real story look like a loony conspiracy theory. Stick to the evidence, and you will find the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding the truth however, is not enough. I lied to myself and grasped at every possible reasoning I could think of to keep the official version as the truth. Only after years of self deceit did I finally accept the reality: At best, the government knew about the attack and took advantage of the opportunity. At worst... Well you get the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have spoken to a few people who were actually there. I fully believe the towers were taken down by something other than the initial impact. Hopefully the links above will help you in assessing what really happened that day.

       The pilots for truth vids are astoundingly well done. Highly recommended buying the DVD.

I think k it belongs on the very bottom of the list as the ultimate example of anybody can poke a hole in the ommission Commission report. And then give a few solid points. Not sourcing, you know way more than me. In this. But do add for people to please look into the various points for themselves. The best medicine for cognitive dissonance.

       Only in this dumbed down country could people still believe the official myth after all the evidence (nanothermite in the dust).
After living for 7 years in Germany and then in the USA and noticing the huge disparity in intellect and education between the average person on the street, I'm not surprised people still believe cavemen can pull off a major operation of that magnitude and complexity.  Not to mention that modern steel structures DO NOT collapse due to fire into their footprint at or near free fall speed and if they did we would have to re-write the entire building code in the whole country. 
This topic bores me now since it's become another "article of faith" like the
       <a href="http://www.holohoax101.org">
        holocaust
       </a>
       with people who are emotionally weak and intellectually inferior just MUST believe and conform to the "authorities" and the status quo and every awake person is turned into a pariah.

       Well thank you, Germany.  Some of us here are still smart, don't discount all of us.  Regulars here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       know what's happening and all we can do is burn a candle for 911 and talk about it. Slowly people are waking up. But we have to suffer a lot of state-opposition by shills here, and 'tin foil hat' insults by larger society.  But that's ok, it strengthens our resolve if we study history and get real clear on what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills are easier to identify every day because they are ex-vet goons who aren't as smart as we are. I mean that's just a fact.  They aren't intelligent and we have their materials so we know their playbook and their tricks are simple and easy to identify right away.  (ex: the first thing they do is cast doubt with low information; or attack the person, not the claim.  Second thing they do is conflate nonsense with facts to gaslight people, using authoritative words to sound like they know what they are talking about.  Dumb people fall for it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've believed 911 was a hoax since 2002 and it's something I will never in my lifetime give up on.  They will have to pry the forsaken justice from my dead clutch.  I know the US government did this to us, but I consider that they did this to the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those immigrants you guys got from Syria that are screwing up your society are fallout from 911 actually.  This thing affects the whole planet so thanks for being a part of the refusniks.

       I'm not German.  I said I lived there 7 years and now I live in the USA.
As bad as it is here, there are still a lot of great people here who are brilliant, creative and understand the issues and are actively working for progress. 
As success is in the minority here, so are they. 
The most encouraging recent fact is that only 6% of Americans actually trust the corporate fascist/government sanctioned media. 
This election is demonstrating to both Trump and Bernie supporters how rigged this system is. 
It is just too late.  We will have Marshall law and a banking collapse before the masses wake up and decide to not put up with the constant psyops, false flag operations and financial tyranny. 
This is a prison planet after all.

       His post is just another example of disinformation. People are waking up, and the government is doubling down on the bullshit. It's getting to the point where they are loosing control. So now they're making it seem plausible that something else went on other than the official story. Sure... Blame Saudi Arabia. What a joke.

        What hit the Pentagon.  The nearly unanimous testimony of over a hundred eyewitnesses, is that a large aircraft, consistent with a 757, flew very low at very high speed, clipped several light poles, and crashed into the face of the Pentagon at ground level.  Still, speculation persists that the Pentagon was hit by something else, such as a Global Hawk or a cruise missile.
        <a href="http://911review.com/articles/stjarna/eximpactdamage.html">
         The eyewitness testimony is consistent with the pattern of damage both inside and outside of the Pentagon.

      <p>
       It has even been used against you in this very thread, DownWithAssad claims there is nothing untoward happened on 9/11 and doesn't think it is a conspiracy and believes the government, which is of course completely incorrect, but correctly states the Pentagon was hit by a large airliner, this is what all the evidence says to be true based on the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Chandler, Jonathan Cole, Nathan Flach, Dr. Niels Harrit etc etc, some of the best and honest 9/11 researchers are in agreement with this

       The problem is that the eyewitness testimony has a significantly different flight path than direction the plane has to have come from.

      <p>
       The government's prime witness and "evidence" was the taxi driver and car. He has admitted that the whole thing was fake while thinking he wasn't being recorded. I feel bad for the man, he was set up and feared for his life.

       That actually is not true, this myth was probably put out by the very people defending the government, i know, it is absurd.

       Seriously, i am a genuine 9/11
       <em>
        truther
       </em>
       i outright reject disinformation like nukes, DEW's, space beams, the official account etc, the Pentagon, although irrelevant in the grand scheme of things to determine that 9/11 was a false flag carried out by the US government, is a honey pot and the unanimous testimony of over a hundred eyewitnesses, is that a large aircraft, consistent with a 757 (probably a modified military drone), flew very low at very high speed, clipped several light poles, and crashed into the face of the Pentagon at ground level.
      </p>
      <p>
       This scenario is also consistent with Norman Mineta’s testimony
      </p>
      <p>
       A spiral descent is not something consistent with a missile either
      </p>
      <p>
       Lloyde England's (taxi driver) didn't admit there was no plane, his wife also worked at the Pentagon and could have been part of the honey pot, he only ever
       <em>
        admitted
       </em>
       it was all planned, he also could be a complete liar.

       Fair enough. I don't think this is cut and dry; while I don't argue with what your saying, I maintain that something other than a 757 struck the pentagon.

      <p>
       Regarding England, I assume you've seen the whole thing?

       Edit: As a response to your link (thanks BTW); the reason why I don't agree is because I do not think they would take the chance of flying a full size 757 into to pentagon (I have considered this before). The location where the impact happened was very specific. If something were to go wrong and stuck somewhere else in the building, it would have been a failure. The tower impact only had to hit a general area of floors. The pentagon impact had to hit a specific office.

       I don't agree with you about 99.999% of people can't understand 911.  It's very easy for me to understand that molten steel violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics per the NIST report explanation.  I've had college engineering also btw but I am not anywhere near nasa level or even that of a civil engineer--I went into software instead.  But still, if that's not acceptable, then consider that the ground at ground zero was 2000F for 3.5 months.  3.5 months 2000F.  Do the math, there's a missing source of heat that cannot be from jetfuel or even an entire building made of wood.  When you make charcoal you set a fire of dense wood under a mound of dirt.  Even the most massive mounds only burn for a week tops, then become cold after 2 weeks.  What that means is---and this is a very easy concept that doesn't require calculus...it can involve backcountry hillbilly logic: if you burn an entire forest containing all the wood to build a building the size of the WTC, it will burn for a week, not 3 months.

       There are missing joules.  We need to find the missing joules.  Because whoever has the missing joules will be the culprit.

       It has even been used against you in this very thread, DownWithAssad claims there is nothing untoward happened on 9/11 and doesn't think it is a conspiracy and believes the government, which is of course completely incorrect, but correctly states the Pentagon was hit by a large airliner, this is what all the evidence says to be true based on the evidence.

      <p>
       David Chandler, Jonathan Cole, Nathan Flach, Dr. Niels Harrit etc etc, some of the best and honest 9/11 researchers are in agreement with this
