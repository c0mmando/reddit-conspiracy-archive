        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the most censored topic.  It cannot be discussed anywhere online without armies of trolls descending and controlling the conversation.  So the moderation team at <a href="/r/theworldisflat">/r/theworldisflat</a> aims to provide a forum for people who have already realized that the deceptions actually begin with one of our first lessons in school - that the earth is not a spinning globe.</p>

<p><a href="/r/theworldisflat">/r/theworldisflat</a> is not necessarily meant to be a place for people who are new to the topic, but we certainly do encourage anyone brave enough to check it out and participate.  However please familiarize yourself with the basics of the model first so we can attempt to elevate the level of conversation above the basics.  This is a pro flat earth subreddit.  If you do have questions, I&#39;ll address them here to the best of my ability - but if they&#39;re fairly basic don&#39;t be surprised if I direct you to a link in the OP.</p>

<p>Lots of basic info:</p>

<p>One of the beginner sections on the best aggregate sites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://aplanetruth.info/first-questions-asked/">https://aplanetruth.info/first-questions-asked/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>IFERS - International Flat Earth Research Society - led by one of the best and first researchers in the latest iteration of the flat earth movement - I also highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XifF8DMG-RE">this few minutes of the IFERS founder speaking on this conspiracy</a></p>

<p>Good summary video  (thanks to <a href="/u/Gorkildeathgod">/u/Gorkildeathgod</a> for posting) Approx 15 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VczRorWDMvI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VczRorWDMvI</a></p>

<p>List of scientific experiments which prove the flat and stationary earth and cannot be refuted (warning the explication videos can be a challenge to get through): </p>

<ul>
<li>Airy&#39;s Failure (1871 - proving the stars moved, carried by ether, while earth is stationary) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87M2i61N1cU">explication link</a></li>
<li>Michelson / Morley (1887 - establishes the earth is stationary)</li>
<li>Sagnac Experiment (1913 - proves ether) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY">explication link</a></li>
<li>Michelson / Gale (1925 - proving the ether passes over earth over 24 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, another incorrect assumption that people tend to make - this is not a religious stance - I do not come from a religious background and am not religious now, nor have I ever been - it is one based solely in empirical reality.  All major religions just happen to agree.  I also do not claim to speak for my fellow moderators in this matter, only for myself.</p>

<p>There are many subreddits in the past that have been accused of instigating drama, witch-hunting, censorship, mudslinging, DDOS attacks, and real life harassment - their constituents make regular appearances here and anywhere this topic is broached.  This is another reason we moderate aggressively at <a href="/r/theworldisflat">/r/theworldisflat</a>.  Again, I myself am happy to address most questions via PM but don&#39;t be surprised if I direct you to one of the basic links I provided here.  Thanks for reading and best wishes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.  You list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Michelson / Morley (1887 - establishes the earth is stationary)</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes you think that the Michelson / Morley interferometer experiment establish that the earth is stationary?  I am familiar with this experiment, the purpose behind it, and the results.  See if you can explain the connection between this earth and your assertion -- which neither Michelson nor Morley would have agreed with, btw.  Their experiment depends on the fact that the earth is moving.  They took that as an assumption of their argument.  So it&#39;s hard to imagine how their experiment could surprisingly &quot;prove that the earth is stationary.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a hilarious misunderstanding and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re attempting to &quot;call me out&quot; on it.</p>

<p>The lack of interference proves either that the earth is flat or that there is no ether frame.  This experiment by itself is not conclusive.  He didn&#39;t know there was an ether frame, so he assumed that it meant that there was none.  However, this, in conjunction with the Sagnac Experiment (which proves the ether exists) proves that the earth is stationary.</p>

<p>Michelson / Morley proves that the earth does not move through the ether (either ether is fake or earth is stationary) - and Sagnac proves that ether is real, thus, earth is stationary.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link which explains Sagnac <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my goodness, this <em>is</em> hilarious.  I confess, I had to look up the Sagnac experiment.  Imagine my surprise to learn that it relates to fiber optic gyro windings, something I have worked on in my time!</p>

<p>The effect Sagnac discovered isn&#39;t caused by any ether.  It&#39;s caused by the light taking a slightly longer or shorter path when the winding rotates.  I happen to know quite a bit about this topic in modern terms.  I can see why a person from the phlogiston-and-ether days would have speculated that relativity was like an ether, but nowadays we know what it is.  There&#39;s no ether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do moderate two subreddits related to the shape of the earth.  One of them <a href="/r/trueearth">/r/trueearth</a>, is a place where you can propose that the earth is flat, and participate in a well-moderated discussion.  The other, <a href="/r/fedo">/r/fedo</a>, is for discussion of the conspiracy that you have fallen victim to.</p>

<p>As for my experience with fiber optic gyros, no I don&#39;t care to dox myself.  As for not knowing of the Sagnac experiment, who cares?  The technology of fiber gyros is entrenched.  People don&#39;t go study ancient history when they apply well-understood technology.</p>

<p>If anything, these experiments you linked proved that light behaves in a strange way. But I don&#39;t see how it should convince me that the earth is flat.</p>

<p>I mean, I have seen thousands of photos of earth seen from space, hours of videos, I&#39;ve looked at ships disappearing below the horizon, I&#39;ve seen the sun set below the horizon, I used telescopes for my own amusement, performed myself mathematical computations about parallax and predictions of eclipses, and not a single thing was inconsistent with the globe model.</p>

<p>And somehow, 4 little experiments about light should convince me that everything I know about earth is a conspiracy ?</p>

<p>How many experiments would it take to convince you that the earth is not flat ?</p>

<p>Because it requires the sun to drop below the horizon in order to cast the shadow of the Earth on the other side.  This is visible every clear day and demonstrates that the sun does in fact fall below the horizon and doesn&#39;t simply move away due to perspective.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you actually understand how these experiments were conducted.  The Michelson/Morley experiment took the movement of the Earth into account, you seem unfamiliar with what it was actually supposed to demonstrate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, another poster accused me of the same thing earlier, that is, not understanding these experiments - I&#39;ll explain the experiments to you <em>even though they are specifically given explication links in my OP</em></p>

<p>M/M:  The lack of interference proves either that the earth is flat or that there is no ether frame. This experiment by itself is not conclusive. He didn&#39;t know there was an ether frame, so he assumed that it meant that there was none. However a few decades  later the Sagnac experiment was performed.  The Sagnac experiment conclusively proves the ether DOES exist. 
Michelson / Morley now effectively proves that the earth does not move through the ether (either ether is fake or earth is stationary) - and Sagnac proves that ether is real, thus, earth is stationary.  Feel free to check out my explication links if you&#39;d like a more thorough explanation.</p>

<p>Certainly you can, download a 3D program (maybe something like Terragen) and recreate it yourself.  You won&#39;t even have to set the atmospheric conditions, you can simply use a plane on the opposite side of the sun to demonstrate the effect as trying to reproduce the atmospheric effects would take far too much rendering time.</p>

<p>Here is an example of it actually moving upwards, which would require the sun to be going below a horizon, not simply moving further away:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/the-belt-of-venus/">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/the-belt-of-venus/</a></p>

<p>You can view this yourself on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In terms of the other points of your post, it seems as though you&#39;ve also completely rejected Special and General Relativity in order to shoehorn your claims into your poor understanding of the experiments conducted.  There is really very little point in demonstrating where you are incorrect when you reject one of the most heavily tested and scrutinized scientific theories of current scientific understanding.</p>

Einstein had nothing to do with the atomic bomb and plagiarized heavily for the achievements that are credited to him.  Relativity also assumes space-time, which is not provable.  He devised no experiments that proved his theories because they are unprovable - no one has ever recorded an example of time-dilation or relativity or a black hole or dark matter - they&#39;re all ghosts left by foolish scientists who chose to chase numbers instead of experimentally viable physics.  The Sagnac experiment disproves relativity.  Einstein plagiarized heavily from Lorentz as well.</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not, it only works because of the heliocentric model.  There is no &quot;proving&quot; it, you can go outside and watch it on any clear day.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, here is one of the conclusions.  You will have to actually read the papers if you want more details.  It&#39;s quite surprising that you are so interested in disproving the theory yet are unwilling to educate yourself further regarding it:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>We find that general relativity has held up under extensive experimental scrutiny. The question then arises, why bother to continue to test it? One reason is that gravity is a fundamental interaction of nature, and as such requires the most solid empirical underpinning we can provide. Another is that all attempts to quantize gravity and to unify it with the other forces suggest that the standard general relativity of Einstein is not likely to be the last word. Furthermore, the predictions of general relativity are fixed; the theory contains no adjustable constants so nothing can be changed. Thus every test of the theory is either a potentially deadly test or a possible probe for new physics. Although it is remarkable that this theory, born 90 years ago out of almost pure thought, has managed to survive every test, the possibility of finding a discrepancy will continue to drive experiments for years to come.</p>

<p>Moreover, it seems that you are dismissing many experiments that seem to point that the earth is spherical by saying that they are &quot;not provable&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a hilarious misunderstanding and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re attempting to &quot;call me out&quot; on it.</p>

<p>The lack of interference proves either that the earth is flat or that there is no ether frame.  This experiment by itself is not conclusive.  He didn&#39;t know there was an ether frame, so he assumed that it meant that there was none.  However, this, in conjunction with the Sagnac Experiment (which proves the ether exists) proves that the earth is stationary.</p>

<p>Michelson / Morley proves that the earth does not move through the ether (either ether is fake or earth is stationary) - and Sagnac proves that ether is real, thus, earth is stationary.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link which explains Sagnac <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmlimH7laY</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m certain the effect is real - I just doubt your conclusions as to what causes it :)</p>

<p>So what causes it in the Flat Earth model then?  It is readily explained and predicted by the heliocentric model, so I&#39;d like to see what the mechanism is under the Flat Earth model that would cause the same effect.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m asking you is - what experiments are these that solidify relativity?</p>

<p>I just linked you to two of them which you were unwilling to read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can you do to prove that it&#39;s all relative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just linked you to two experiments which provide answers to what you are asking, but you were unwilling to go through them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the experiments I linked and linked explications in for my OP prove conclusively that relativity is and always has been bunk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t, they demonstrate a lack of understanding on your part.</p>
