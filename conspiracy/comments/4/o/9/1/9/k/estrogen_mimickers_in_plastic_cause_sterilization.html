       homosexuality  is obviously genetic but there are other theories, some scientists think its also hormonal.

       im not saying its unnatural but if you hijacked the factors that can lead to it wouldn't that be population control over time? and if you add to sterilization via estrogen wouldn't that be another form?

       Absolutely, but this is just the first chamber in the descent into the rabbit hole. Most don't know that the "Little Green Leaf" stevia creates sterility in females. Don't tell the million women paying doctors to find out why that can't get pregnant. The oligarchs and their long term planners have thousands of ways to kill us: they think that theirs is a greater stake in life because they own most of it. It is easy to institute their plans because there are so many sick little monkeys willing to do their bidding using the desensitizing protocols of money, power, and fear.

       It was in a book by Dr. Paul Erlich in the 70's. I think it was Guatemalan women where using it to prevent or abort pregnancies. He proposed dosing people with it back then along with other Malthusian Death Cult "solutions". What's off putting to me is I thought the health food/supplement industry was somehow immune from industrial scale murder. Most of us know or feel something ain't right. Evidence is as close to you as a pet store in a mall. Look at the treat aisle. Note how the sellers are touting more about what their products
       <strong>
        don't
       </strong>
       have in them. We'd do anything to protect our pets but cognitive dissonance makes it impossible to admit to ourselves what is bubbling under the glare of surface living. I propose that
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       with more than 4 ingredients, including packaging, has at least one slow poison or sterilizing agent. Investors are making book on it, as are insurers.

       Yeah, we don't know yet what the chemical is doing as it persists in your endocrine system and coursing through your blood. Buy, hey, if you don't care, get a double or a triple, dump it in everything. Who knows, maybe it will cure you of your ills. If it is harmful we can autopsy you and find out if it was, after all, safe to consume. Thanks!

       The actual article. Keep in mind progress has been made since 2011 on this. Estrogen-like is not estrogen.  Just like a hydroxyl is not a thiol, but they act similarly...but still different.
      </p>

       Not trying to discredit this, because the exact composition of many  plastics tend to be patented, but I will say that i wish they had used diWater as well. The saline and ethanol are good choices, but concentration matters. Not sure why they didn't use a big boy solvent as well such as DMSO. Also confused on why they kept saying less polar and more polar when NaCl (aqueous) is technically neither.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying. A wiki is a poor explanation for determining the real biomolecular science going on.

       Your article stated it mimicked actions of naturally occurring hormones. I mean if its binding to a message receptor ans releasing estrogen through the chain of events that take place, wouldn't question more be on what effects of high doses of estrogen have on the body at diffrent times of development.

       That article is the actual study the story is referring too. Estrogen and progesterone work as a team. Your body makes both. They have a few studies on it actually, a tiny bit excess shouldn't be super serious. It may cause some forms of cancer, but I am legit too lazy to search journals. The biology is a bit more complicated than bind and release, a bunch of other factors come into play. If any one of those factors isn't present, the mission is aborted. Again, a thiol mimicks a hydroxyl in how it reacts, but they are very very different.

       Honestly, I am more concerned about long term effects of GMO crops.

       BPA was originally invented back in the 20's or 30's as female birth control. They figured out that it wasn't strong enough to be reliable in preventing pregnancy in women but it made plastic harder. People don't understand that all of the artificial chemicals we're exposed to in the womb and in a daily basis negatively effects us. The ones that get curious about it hear stupid controlled opposition like "millions of people who consume dihydrogen monoxide die every year" my fucktard high school chem teacher gave us a packet about it to show us we shouldn't worry about being exposed to scary chemicals. I'm sorry if there are any teachers on here but it's usually only something that you do if you run out of options so you get people "teaching" kids and all they do is make them dumber. Dihydrogen monoxide is just water if anyone didn't get it
