    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty fucking clear. It&#39;s so obvious it was a controlled demolition -- it&#39;s actually TOO obvious, so no one wants to believe it. It&#39;s laughably funny -- except it&#39;s also very real. I&#39;m continuing to harp on it precisely because it&#39;s too obvious; until there are enough people who say &quot;enough is enough is ENOUGH&quot;, and start to ponder the real consequences of that controlled demolition. 9/11 is unfortunately either one way or the other -- you just can&#39;t take a middling position -- and the consequences are absolutely frightening.</p>

<p>We are 5 hours ahead though, it was reported 10am-ish NewYork time, 2pm or so here in the UK.</p>

<p>What is Building 7?</p>

<p>Building 7 was a 47-story skyscraper and was part of the World Trade Center complex. Built in 1984, it would have been the tallest high-rise in 33 states in the United States. It collapsed at 5:20 pm on September 11, 2001. It was not hit by an airplane and suffered minimal damage compared to other buildings much closer to the Twin Towers.
7 Facts about Building 7</p>

<p>1) If fire caused Building 7 to collapse, it would be the first ever fire-induced collapse of a steel-frame high-rise.</p>

<p>2) Building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

<p>3) According to a Zogby poll in 2006, 43% of Americans did not know about Building 7.</p>

<p>4) It took the federal government seven years to conduct an investigation and issue a report for Building 7.</p>

<p>5) 1,700+ architects and engineers have signed a petition calling for a new investigation into the destruction of Building 7, specifying that it should include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives.</p>

<p>6) Numerous witnesses say the possibility of demolishing Building 7 was widely discussed by emergency personnel at the scene and advocated by the building’s owner.</p>

<p>7) Building 7 housed several intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the NYC Office of Emergency Management’s Emergency Operations Center, more commonly known as “Giuliani’s Bunker”.</p>
