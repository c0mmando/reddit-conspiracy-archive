       I don't think its necessary to even bring that into the discussion to fully prove it's a hoax though in this case. If you can figure out exactly how that connection fits I'd like to know, but for the most part it's an auxiliary fact which will most likely be used to muddy the waters and create a rabbit hole.

       Yeah, I don't doubt it's an element. I encourage you to explore the connection, seems like youre onto something, but get back to me when you've pieced it all together into its own narrative.

       That's the difference between you and I. I agree with some of what you are saying, but it's still too soon to say one way or the other. That is my point. You are hell bent on saying this is a complete hoax. Which is wrong, imo, until more time lapses and more comes out.

       were all hoaxes and this shooting fits the patterns of those exactly.

      <p>
       So, unless some kind of hard evidence comes up making it clear somebody died (and a friend of a friend testimony means nothing), I'm not wasting my time stumbling in the rabbit hole of disinfo for months till I figure out what was obvious from the start.

       A false flag as far as I am aware is when the government/establishment commits an act of war or terrorism against themselves and then claim it was the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A hoax is when the government/establishment claims there was attack when the entire thing was fictional and nothing bad even happened.

       Exactly. So, don't jump to such strong conclusions. You don't know, neither of us do. All I can say is this Orlando event reeks. Whether a FF, a hoax, or a combo of both, idk. Time will tell and more will come out.

       Would you agree any of those events in that list had any false flag element?
      </p>
      <p>
       We've had time to digest almost two dozen of these types of incidents and they always end up being total hoaxes, but apparently I'm suppose to wait on this one even though there is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IV9wuXID0">
        ample evidence it's a total hoax
       </a>
       and absolutely no evidence anyone was hurt or died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, why don't I just sit by while CNN covers up all their crisis actor mistakes and builds a nice cushy rabbit hole with stories of F.B.I. coersion and multiple shooters for me to waste my life sorting through.

       I reckon mind control patsy shot a couple and then cops shot the rest. Numbers could be way off though from what's being reported in the press. Crises actors probably signed NDA's so can't say shit if it went live when they were briefed it would be a drill.

       Yes, but the blood sacrifice phenomenon is something different, and is never as propaganda (for ritualistic reasons is my guess).

       Here are some good videos are about blood sacrifices:

       If anything, Muhammed Ali was the sacrifice.

       I agree with you for the most part about the evidence and the long list of hoaxes. But consider the possibility that the evidence for a hoax and the lack of firm evidence for a real event in the MSM might be part of a bait-and-swtich "boy who cried wolf" psyop:
