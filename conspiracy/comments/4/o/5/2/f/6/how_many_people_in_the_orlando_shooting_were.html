       Sorry if this is the wrong place, but I didn't think I could get info on this anywhere else. I've heard rumors that the cops killed civilians on accident last weekend, but I guess my google-fu is weak. Has anyone heard about this too, or is it just hogwash?

       Many reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's the fight or flight mechanism of the human psyche. It's primal. An attribute of the reptilian/avian brain. The brain stem. When people are faced with certain death, they tend to fight back or run away. How did Omar kept an entire club staying inside without trying to break the glass windows?
Or did whatever they could to escape? There's no way a club like this only has one single entrance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Omar isn't a professional. Did he regulary frequent the shooting range? .22 bullets aren't that lethal. Most victims will need multiple shots before it can effectively kill them. Except if Omar was a specially military trained sharpshooter. Maybe he could headshot everyone in the club.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How many magazines did he need to bring to the site to shoot up 100 people? Assuming 1 magazine contained 30 rounds. 10 magazines? Why would he want so many people dead? He wasn't religious. He's a frequenter at the club. Omar was gay.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not to mention police can arrive at any minute. Most night clubs have bouncers. Security is thoroughly considered. Since people are likely drunk and high on substance. Violence isn't rare in nightclubs. There are measures taken in case of violent outbreak. Police arrival is expected in no time.
        </p>
       </li>

       Not to be a dick but semantics... the size difference between .22 and .223 is .003 inches. The difference is I the size of the casing which holds the powder and primer.

      <p>
       The 0.003" difference is with respect to the diameter of the round only. You are correct that a .223-round has a significantly larger case than a .22-round, but that's not the only difference between the two rounds.
       <a href="http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2011/05/03/guest-post-22-lr-vs-223-rem/">
        This post on The Firearm Blog
       </a>
       covers the differences in much greater detail, and is definitely worth the read, but here's the Cliff's Note version.
      </p>
      <p>
       A .22 round is typically between 36 and 60 grains, meaning it weighs 2.3 to 3.9 grams, while a .223 is typically 40 to 90 grains, or 2.6 to 5.8 grams. So a .223 is typically two to three times
       <em>
        heavier
       </em>
       than a .22 round.
      </p>
      <p>
       The .223's much larger casing also holds significantly more gunpowder which results in a much higher muzzle velocity. Typically a .223 round leaves a rifle's barrel traveling at 3,000 to 3,500 feet per second, being three times faster than your typical .22 round's 1,000 to 1,250 fps.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Summary: a .223 is a heavier bullet traveling
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       faster which means it hits

       1 - People also panic when afraid, which can cause them to make very foolish decisions. If the fight or flight response mechanism worked flawlessly, then the crowd should've converged on the gunman or calmly found the nearest exit instead of stampeding, which they most likely did.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can't expect people to react rationally when under pressure.

       Wouldn't it depend more on where you get shot, rather than how powerful the firearm is?

       , the shooting started at 2:02, at 2:09 a standoff followed. So police did respond quickly, but they had to wait for armed vehicles and planning.

       He didn't really need a bag. 300 rounds is only 1 mag in the rifle and 9 extra assuming he didn't have a drum mags. Carried in a chest rig, it's really not that much weight.

         Supposedly he called police. Bouncers will not stop police or people wearing police costumes carrying guns. Violence is pretty rare in gay nightclubs(outside of the dramatic slap fight.) There are no measures in the case of a shooting...it's is Orlando, not Tel Aviv or Brazil. Why would some religious zealot trying to get into gay muslim heaven care about police arrival times...he clearly wasn't "trying to get away with it.

       It's not that they couldn't do that much harm if they were given the time - it's that in the time they had (7 minutes) they would have needed to reload 30 times to be able to fire as many shots as they supposedly did to kill/injure 103 people, multiple times for some of the victims, plus all the shots apparently fired into the air...
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter which way you try to spin that, 30 reloads + contiuous shooting between those reloads clearing the rounds in 7 minutes is a mathematical impossibility for a single person meaning either there was more than 1 shooter (as per witness accounts) or Omar is the real life Quiksilver... but even then he'd be hindered by the speed of fire by the gun, and the bullets flying through the air... yeah, no, I'm firmly planted in the "This is bullshit" camp.

       The whole point in my mind is that it wasn't ISIS, just a typical gay muslim, but this one was rejected by the community and heard an imam say "killing infidels cleanses your gay past, gets you express line to the virgins."  Sometimes that's all a mentally deficient homicidal maniac needs. Without a manifesto or taped confession...who could really know what is going through a crazy person's mind? As far as the "official story," nobody should believe anything until video is released from inside the club. Body/car cams released, Autopsies, ballistics, etc... 300 people in the club and their videos are just starting to disseminate.

       Police do not negotiate with terrorist and hostages are no longer a buffer, remember that all these piglets are trained in israeli military tactics...so, kill everyone, including hostages...blame all deaths on the guy who started it...That barrage of fire for a single shooter is criminal.

       the cops had two options:
      </p>
      <p>
       'be held responsible for not moving in and letting the guy potentially kill everyone he has hostage'
      </p>
      <p>
       'be held responsible for killing a few while saving some by moving in on this guy before he gets to kill more'
      </p>
      <p>
       it wasnt like he killed one person and took some hostages and wanted to negotiate. he slaugthered 20+ people and THEN took hostages. that isnt the sign of a guy who is willing to negotiate peacefully in my opinion.

       This was actually because there were 20 people that made it outside before they died.  They were the ones originally accounted for.  Omar told 911 there were two others inside with him, which was false, and said one of them had a bomb vest.   They sent a bomb robot in to make sure this wasn't the case and to make sure nothing was booby trapped.  The robot took a long time to clear the place because of all the bodies and shit everywhere.  Also, people died after making it to the hospital, after the initial 20 count.  The stand off ended around 5am, but they didn't announce the new death count until around noon.  So even if the cops did kill some people, I don't know why they would have delayed the count.

       Considering that the police fucked around for 3 hours, presumably to maximize the body count, I'd have to think it was a majority.

       I was suggesting exactly the same thing in a discussion with coworkers yesterday.  I'm betting the guy shot like half a dozen people and OPD took care of the rest.

       I don't have the answer to your question, but given what happened in 2014 in a cafe in Sydney, Australia, I would be very surprised if the police did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       inadvertently shoot a few of the people in Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: the Sydney cafe hostage situation, after the gunman shot and killed the cafe owner, NSW police stormed the cafe and fired 22 rounds at the gunman, hitting him 13 times, and killing him of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the gun fight, one other hostage was killed, three hostages were wounded, and one police officer was wounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The coroner's report stated that the only person shot by the gunman was the cafe owner, who was shot prior to the gun battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words the second dead hostage, the three wounded hostages, and the one wounded police officer were all shot by the police.

       Well... wasn't Mateen working for a private security contractor, shooting a gun issued to private security? (and probably using bullets that civilians can't get easily?)

      <p>
       I guess that means that all of them were killed by cops.

       The guy who shot the video inside said half the victims were in the bathroom with him. But apparently they were alive before? So I'd assume 20-30 were killed by police.

       What? Are you bored or something? In need of communication?  OK, WOW! By the sound of that video, I would say there is a very large chance that 15-20 people were possibly killed by police. It sounded like they were just blindly shooting into the club.  Was it well lit? Were they just shooting and hoping for the best? Will the autopsy reports show what people were killed by SWAT or by the guy? Will they report their finding? Better?

       I suspect SWAT was using the same caliber weapon.  They might be able to tell by inspecting bullets.  It will be interesting to hear from the people who were there, if any of them are willing to speak on this.
