The thing we need to focus on is the multiple shooters, the security contractor and CIA connections, the FBI connections, the Gladio connections and witness testimony that completely goes against the main stream media narrative. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let us be defeated that easily people, this is the same dirty trick the CIA used with 9/11, try and make a fake conspiracy movement about no planes existing, something so absurd you&#39;d have to be mentally ill to believe it. Don&#39;t let our search for truth be weighed down by false information. </p>

<p>We must win this information war. The evidence is actually ALL out there this time, it&#39;s all hidden in plane sight! The only way the powers that be can keep the lid on this one is if they successfully discredit anyone yelling false flag. </p>

<p>I have already seen people on Facebook make the false equivalency that someone who says Orlando was a false flag is also saying the event didn&#39;t happen, but that&#39;s simply not true. They are trying to dirty the phrase &quot;false flag attack&quot; but it will not work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the thesis of McGowan&#39;s <em>Programmed To Kill.</em>  The number of significant people killed by &quot;serial killers&quot; &amp; &quot;spree killers&quot; is very interesting.  Examples:  The alleged 2002 &quot;DC Sniper&quot; stimulated fear around Washington D.C. during the 2002 Iraq War Authorization vote, but he also killed a CIA analyst who flagged specific pre-9/11 warnings from foreign governments.  The alleged &quot;Manson Family&quot; killed Sharon Tate, daughter of a military intelligence colonel &amp; husband of Roman Polanski, who was with RFK on the night he was assassinated.  Many of the 1970s-1980s serial killers (such as Richard Ramirez, the &quot;Night Stalker&quot; &amp; others) have direct or indirect ties to the CIA&#39;s Phoenix Program in Vietnam, an assassination operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the real ringer in all of these attacks. I believe most are actually carried out for assassinations and for pushing political agendas. I think Sandy hook was a test run at faking an event without anyone dying, but it back fired. They then went back to jsoc actually carrying events out to best serve multiple needs. On Russo black box forum, Russian hackers are saying that they assassinated one Omar G. He was suing the DHS for jailing him for 8 years with no trial in an Orlando secret jail. There was also 2 Guantanamo bay torturers that died too. The Russians are saying these people had decided to meet at this night club to avoid anyone snooping. When they couldn&#39;t be heard, they sent a 3 man team in and burned one dangerous agent to support the national hate on Muslims and guns... who knows though. The unelected government is way more powerful that the elected government, and they will do anything to avoid lawsuits, especially precedent cases that will allow a bunch of people to file suit. The amount of corruption and violence in the government would be readily exposed in a case against them. Just like they murdered the lady and key witness on the Flint water trial that would open a Pandora&#39;s box of citizens suing as it&#39;s coming out that 45+% of America&#39;s public water systems exceed dangerous levels of toxins. Who knows though... disinformation is so powerful and if it&#39;s not on msm, people think it&#39;s not true. </p>

<p>Tldr people were meeting to sue the federal government on secret jails and torture on American soil. The federal agents couldn&#39;t listen in because they meet in a club, so they sent a jsoc team in to assassinate them. The case was a precedent case that would expose the extent of secret jails across the country to skip due process and act without warrants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should avoid stating things as &quot;hoaxes&quot;. Hoax implies that <em>nothing</em> happened. False Flag should be our default. All False Flag means is that whatever happened, happened for reasons other than the logical ones. For example... I don&#39;t know... A ship flying US colors gets attacked by a country that&#39;s flying say Israeli colors. Logically we think this was a case of mistaken identity (because the US flag is really close to the Egyptian flag). It later turned out to be a false flag operation where certain involved parties were trying to bait the US into the 6 day war.           </p>

<p>It&#39;s sort of adopting an agnostic approach at events, and I think that in this day and age, it is clearly the safest option to adopt before we get all the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to explain more on how a false flag can be setup as a means of warfare.</p>

<p>Say for instance, one group wants the people to hate Muslims, build a wall around Mexico and unlock the gay vote.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this with a false flag is to have a Muslim shoot up a gay club and the next day have a terrorist walk across the Mexican border with plans.</p>

<p>Then the other group would be looked at as the culprit and only people with wisdom would realize it came from the same group they were against. Thus starts the oppressed helping the oppressor instead of empowering the liberator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live under the pretense that my reality is delicately constructed around me by a federal organization. I take every media event that I hear about and analyze it as if it didn&#39;t happen, trying to reason as to why the government would choose any particular event as propaganda for me to see. </p>

<p>The only weird thing about the shooting that I can think of is that it happened one day after I said &quot;I feel like I&#39;m in a media blackout&quot; to my family. I rarely watch tv these days and my world revolves around video gaming to calm my ADHD and anxiety as well as provide a world where I don&#39;t have to deal with drama and suffering so my intake of world news comes through my family or reddit. </p>

<p>With that being said, I personally don&#39;t think the shooting even happened. I think its just a tactic to analyze and profile the group of people selected to receive the information. I don&#39;t even know that ISIS is a real thing and some people are saying ISIS claims responsibility for the shooting. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less about the government lying to the people, its been done for millennia. The people in power lie to their followers to bring about whatever end goal they might have. Take the church for example, the catholic empire (the Vatican and its vast treasuries) is based around the lie that if people do bad things, they go to a place of eternal suffering. This lie was propagated so well in its infancy that it still captivates billions of people today in a scientific era. </p>

<p>Governments lie, its their job. The plain and simple is that the people are protected by those lies and without the lies currently being propagated, millions of people would surely die. There are covert operations going on all across the globe spreading falsehoods so that the American people can continue living in relative comfort without the constant threat of a foreign government occupying American soil or sending nukes our way.</p>

<p>I believe in what the government does for the simple fact that I have the freedom to post this comment on an open forum where most people are overtly anti-government. The government has plans and will move on with or without you, now is the time for you to choose whether you want to move forward into a better future or get left behind and possibly endangered by your belief that any individual is more important then the whole. </p>

<p>Learn to make sacrifices in a positive manner, give up the idea that privacy is a right. Give up the idea that the right to bear arms makes sense. Give up the idea that everything you see is truth and lastly give up the idea that the government is trying to hurt you.</p>

<p>Do this and know the government is only working towards the best possible future and that self sacrifice isn&#39;t only necessary for the armed forces to protect liberties but by every individual that takes part in those liberties as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right this post is straight disinfo like the rest of this Hillary hating/trump loving sub. Elections are fixed we don&#39;t have a choice, I thought we&#39;d be able to understand that but apparently this sub is only mildly critical thinking smh. And of course it&#39;s yet again another person claiming to know someone who was there lmao. Why is multiple shooters more plausible? To me it&#39;s just a red herring to keep you away from thinking its a hoax. Multiple shooters would help the msm cause because they could twist it to say a sleeper Isis cell is already in America and they planned this attack. If you honestly believe Christine leinonens performance there&#39;s no hope for you sorry. </p>
