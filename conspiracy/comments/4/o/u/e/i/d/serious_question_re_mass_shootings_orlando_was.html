        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is there ever a time where you guys will accept that maybe a legit crazy person went out and shot people?  I love the conspiracy world but I think it&#39;s becoming a little excessive when every mass shooting is claimed to be a CIA false flag.  Occasionally you will have crazy people  get their hands on a gun.  It happens.</p>

<p>Basically I appreciate the analysis and different ideas, but I would like to propose the idea that Orlando was legit.</p>

<p>It just makes sense to me that a closeted Muslim would do this.  I don&#39;t see any motive for the alleged false flag.  So I believe the mainstream thoughts on this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is certainly fair to scrutinize the events that are massively publicized... I think we conspiracy theorists understand that there are crazy people more than most. Knowing that there are literally &#39;mass shootings&#39; every day in America, I would say it is safe to assume that a number of these are non-conspiratorially commited attrocities by a simple lunatic. And a number of them have other explanations. I think most people here are simply curious to know the whole truth, and aren&#39;t satisfied with news headlines and anchor quips to fill the desire.</p>

This entire conspiracy theory subculture surrounding these mass shootings sickens me. Spend your time loving those close to you...and being tolerant of all people no matter what. That&#39;s a much better use of time.</p>

<p>And it just so happens that he associates with being Afghani and is Islamic. A tenet of Islam is the death of gays, so regardless of him being gay or not, or this being a &quot;hate crime&quot;, his religion most definentely had something to do with his motive.</p>

<p>It’s not. You don’t choose to get Alzheimer’s. That’s still a mental illness. You may not choose to drink small amounts of neurotoxins, but those can cause mental illnesses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You claim it is a mental illness</p>

<p>Did I? It’s an imbalance in mental state, but whether or not it’s warranted or unwarranted depends on the individual situation.</p>

<p>As showing the link.</p>

<p>So for Judeans (not jews as you know them), that would be a problem. But for Talmudists or Christians.</p>

<p>The same reason that suicide is illegal, even in private. The same reason that murder is illegal, even in private and with consent.</p>
