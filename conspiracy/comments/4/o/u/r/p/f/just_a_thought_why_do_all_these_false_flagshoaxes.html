    <div class="md"><p>Entrapment, Manchurian candidates, patsies, plants and backfiring blunders being covered up. </p>

<p>If the subject(s) find out they&#39;re being set up and try to turn the tables on them or flee, they step in and &quot;foil&quot; the plot. If the suckers never even noticed they were being played by puppet masters, then it&#39;s a go-ahead with or without a little help. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fairly easy to make vulnerable people do about anything if the right pressures or incentives are applied. </p>

<p>Take Al Qaeda f.e. If they need a suicide bomber, they often select suicidal mental cases OR force people into doing it f.e. by threatening to murder loved ones. These are fairly rough techniques and need handlers in close proximity to the bomber. Al Qaeda didn&#39;t invent these tactics, they quite possibly learned those from those who do such things best. </p>

<p>Now they undermine people&#39;s lives by ruining trivial daily things and leaving marks to make a person go paranoid and to isolate them at first. The Stasi (DDR) used to f.e. empty coffee jars into the sink of political dissents or leave windows open to make &#39;em think they were going insane. </p>

<p>Imagine how they could guide a semi-psychotic person into doing stuff, making him or her think she was getting divine messages or missions by using modern technology. Playing certain songs on the radio with an emotional meaning to the person, taking over entertainment systems and lacing them with subliminals, making youtube generate selected material to push a person deeper into the rabbit hole ... slandering folks anonymously, tearing up relationships, ruining careers, using turncoats and traitors ...</p>

<p>The thing is: the Stasi never had to actively recruit traitors, because people would present themselves as volunteers, opportunistic sycophants trying to be part of the big club by fucking over friends or family were coming in by the truckload to denounce folks. You have no idea how many cowards and traitors are amongst us on a daily basis already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The AQ suicide bomber reference needs an update. It should be considered that the bombers are  not intending on a suicide attack, and the bomb is detonated remotely while they are taking it from point A to point B or planting it. This technique of an attacker not necessarily being wise (or witting if you will) could be applied to other methods I&#39;m sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the FBI have anything to do with counter terror. I&#39;m pretty sure that is the CIA, DOD, DHS and NSA.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why anyone would think the FBI (of all people) would be involved in CT operations, they are more like the ATF. The FBI is pretty much a group of police officers with federal standing. They investigate and apprehend felons, at least, that is how I perceive them.</p>
