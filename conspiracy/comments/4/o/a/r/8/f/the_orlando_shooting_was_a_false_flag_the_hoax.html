        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-06-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/humbleirony.html">humbleirony</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all the attack makes complete sense as far as I can tell if there are multiple shooters. It is a closed off club with only a few entrances, loud music playing, everyone is drunk, no one expects it. 50 dead 53 injured.</p>

<p>Moreover people have consistently come this forum the past few days claiming to be from Orlando and know people that died but still think this was a false flag. How can that even possibly be disinformation?</p>

<p>Why do people think this was a hoax?</p>

<p>The reasons so far: are crisis actors. Yes one of the main people interviewed (Luis Barbano) is an actor and it is easy to verify this. He says there was one shooter and that he held the door shut on accident. This is easy disinformation to put out there to tie up two loose ends. Maybe there were multiple shooters and someone (other than him) held the door shut on purpose. Moreover, since it easy to verify he&#39;s an actor it is easy for people to spread the hoax theory disinformation.</p>

<p>Lack of CCTV footage: This doesn&#39;t mean its a hoax, it means they don&#39;t want you to see there were multiple shooters.</p>

<p>Rescue workers carrying people toward the club: It would be more unbelievable if every single injured person was carried directly away from the club at all points of time. Plus this could be easily constructed, staged disinformation to support the hoax theory.  </p>

<p>An important point to consider is that the Pulse is a real club, people go to it every week:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwcvGZ7yOM4">video 1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_CSOyxADUo">video 2</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_CSOyxADUo">video 3</a></p>

<p>You can clearly see people there that night. I mean people, not crisis actors, just ordinary people going to a club like they do every week. You can clearly search on youtube and see video from the pulse going back many years. You can clearly see an Edward Sotomayor at 7 seconds into video 1. He is listed as a victim. You can probably verify that there are more victims in these videos.</p>

<p>The LGBT community knows these people that are dead or are as good as dead. Whether crisis actors or not, those people are not coming back, If this is a hoax they can never come back and the entire friendship of these people must have been a lie going back 5+ years at least.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t very hard to find these people claiming to know victims. Since it took only a few minutes to find these you can probably find more youtube users claiming to know victims. Every such video must be a lie for the hoax theory to make sense.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnmHaMPAlkg">1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khu-8QOuc94">2</a></p>

<p>Is there a clear push on this forum for people to believe the hoax theory?</p>

<p>Well:</p>

<p>The user RavenMJ74 literally started a thread titled &quot;Can we condense all the evidence that this Orlando shooting is a hoax? Thank You.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the user NWO_slave spent the past few days going onto every thread posting things like &quot;this is a hoax&quot; and not saying much else. Today he constructed this masterpiece of a thread in critical thinking called &quot;Orlando Shooting was a hoax [Full Case Report]&quot; Which gives the most absurd reasons for saying this is a hoax including bodies being carried back to the club. All of his reasons are explained by one or two crisis actors thrown in and them staging the carrying of bodies towards the club as disinformation.</p>

<p>If you believe this is a hoax please explain how they made up 49 victims including victims recognizable to the LGBT community, fabricated the existence of 2 Universitiy of Central Florida Students and one Florida A&amp;M student, fooled regular club goers into not going to the club that night with no one noticing, meanwhile inserting their entire 50+ crisis actors.</p>

<p>All that I have to explain with the false flage theory is why no(clear) video of the shooting has surfaced. Maybe no one filmed it entirely because they were trying to survive? I mean there&#39;s a video of somebody shot in the bathroom claiming its from Pulse, but you have to take people&#39;s word on it. The best we can hope for is the CCTV footage but of course they&#39;re not going to release that.</p>

<p>Is there this ridiculously massive conspiracy going back 5+ years involving the hospital, University of Central Florida, Florida A&amp;M, fake friendships in the LGBT community, and the worst shills imaginable.</p>

<p>Or is there a censorship of the multiple gunmen theory with hoax disinformation thrown in?</p>

<p>Apply Occam&#39;s razor and think critically. Please r/conspiracy don&#39;t let them manufacture consent on here so easily.</p>

<p>And get out of this echo chamber and contact people. Do some research and type &quot;Pulse Orlando&quot; on you tube and see what real verifiable people are saying about this before believing the hoax theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about all that ridiculous footage of people being carried out with barely a scrape on them and only leg wounds?</p>

<p>Sandy Hoax, I believe, was 100% staged and ZERO victims. So this one I don&#39;t think had any real victims because they are hard to control. 9/11 was allowed to be real because back then there were no smart phones to record little nuances. Of course, all the security cameras did not record the Pentagon attack, which is highly convenient. In this case, I still think there would be at least ONE intrepid person wanting to get some footage and still protect themselves in the process.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhihjos5zD8">Orlando terrorist subject of failed FBI sting operation</a></p>

<p>The whole thing is fishy but it&#39;s apparent people died and that it had to include at least 2 if not <a href="http://www.snopes.com/orlando-mass-shooting-math-doesnt-add-up/">more shooters</a>.</p>

<p>And lets not forget about the 2nd attack that failed on the same day. <a href="http://getoffthebs.com/five-suspects-involved-in-planned-attacks/">Howell and Four Other Suspects Involved in Planned Sunday Massacres</a>. Notice it involves five people. Then take a notice at the rumors about <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-15/new-orlando-shooter-eyewitness-emergestestifies-5-people-were-involved-pulse-attack">5 people</a> being involved in the Orlando attack. Also take notice both party&#39;s of 5 planned to attack LGBT locations <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-monica-howell-charges-20160614-snap-story.html">Howell</a> &amp; <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/details-emerge-orlando-nightclub-shooter-omar-mateen/story?id=39891550">Mateen</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hoax is a null hypothesis and does not need to be proven.  More the opposite - the extraordinary claim of a massacre needs to be supported by extraordinary direct evidence and isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There was every opportunity to prove it wasn&#39;t a hoax, and those opportunities have passed.   </p>

<p>Where are any crime scene photos?  Where is this 911 call?  Where is any direct evidence of a massacre?    Extraordinary claims...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is Law Enforcement and a grieving community obligated to produce pictures and information on the last minutes or dead bodies of loved ones just to sate the paranoid delusions of a dozen nutjobs on a Sub Reddit?</p>

<p>How in your mind does that add up at all? Maybe you should fork out money for a ticket to Orlando and attend some of the funerals, speak to some of the family and friends, and get a look at how real it really is.</p>

<p>People called the San Bernardino shooting a false flag. I live in San Bernardino, it wasn&#39;t fake or a false flag.</p>

<p>People called the News Reporter shooting fake, it wasn&#39;t, all the people armchair quarterbacking for that one have never fired at another human being, let alone a handgun.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more disturbing to me, is the fact that some of the people on this sub reddit seem to feel they are somehow entitled to images of dead bodies and 911 recordings just so they can put their own mind at rest. That shows some clear signs of borderline delusional behavior if not total disassociation from the reality of the world, bad things happen to good people.</p>

<p>I knew Captain Brown, I&#39;ve spoken with his family, he is dead. He was one of the victims.</p>

<p>Some of you are a huge discredit to finding the truth and overstep the bounds into being complete tin foil hat stereotypes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They showed a photo from the Bataclan,  the Boston moulage was all over the press for maximum impact.   You&#39;re right, journos don&#39;t want to publish photos of this, because it&#39;s sensational, and sensationalism sells too well.  </p>

<p>As for your personal attacks, noted.     Of course you knew them personally, someone always does on this sub.  We see the treatment it gets like Sandy Hoax, and it&#39;s the burden of the media to show that this actually happened.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of allegations thrown at me based on assumptions, but I guess that&#39;s what truthers are these days.</p>

<p>I can tell when I&#39;m talking to a brick wall and when I&#39;m talking to an open minded individual, you&#39;ve already painted me in your head as some drone who baah&#39;s with the rest of the sheep, which I&#39;m not. I just happen to not jump straight to the &quot;over reaching axis of evil&quot; scenario before going over more plausible scenarios because, unlike most people in these sub reddits, I have real life experience with dealing in trauma in both Combat and civilian side life.</p>

<p>I can understand the mentality of going straight to the most dark and deep conspiracy plausible, but in real life it&#39;s simply not the truth. Bad shit happens to good people for no reason. Evil people do bad things every day, trying to rationalize it in your head by attributing it to the Government is good and fine, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the correct scenario every time.</p>

<p>If photographs were available the media would probably be plastering them all over the place, the Police Chief of this particular area seems like he&#39;s a pretty good guy in terms of wanting to protect the citizens of his community - giving out free CCWs to anyone who applies for the forseeable future because he believes it&#39;s his duty to arm and protect everyone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard for some people to fathom that a man&#39;s integrity would preclude him to not allowing pictures of dead family members to be plastered all over the web. It&#39;s not the first time stuff like this has happened and it doesn&#39;t suddenly point to hoax.</p>

<p>There are torture videos of serial killers and their victims that have never seen the light of day, the Bind and Torture killer, those two guys who kidnapped a woman and filmed themselves torturing her for weeks, etc. - are we to believe that it never happened because this footage hasn&#39;t been released to the public?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see the connection, and I don&#39;t have unwaivering faith in authority. I judge people based on their own merits, that&#39;s part of my own set of integrity. I have a high level of distrust for the Government. I just don&#39;t jump straight down the deepest rabbit hole I can find before exhausting other options.</p>

<p>If a police chief is offering free CCW&#39;s to the people in his city, that tells me a lot about his integrity and morals. In a mass shooting with this many casualties it&#39;s going to take a long time for all of the evidence to be gathered and put together - I doubt we&#39;ll ever hear reports on how many bullet wounds were found to be of a caliber not used by the shooter, but by the police. That is my distrust in the system and common sense coming into play.</p>

<p>But saying it didn&#39;t happen just because the department is either too focused on doing it&#39;s job, or simply wants to respect the dead of their own city, with a Police Chief who seems to be a decent human being - is too far a stretch in my mind at this point in time.</p>

<p>False flag is a possibility, hoax isn&#39;t in my mind. Too complicated, too many people attached, and I knew one of the victims - personally - whether you want to believe that or not. The Army is a small world, one of my battle buddies served with Brown during his second deployment, we met via Facebook groups where Veteran&#39;s and active duty personnel discuss military and Veteran related stuff, and then later I met him in person when he flew out with a battle buddy to Irvine, CA and had a few beers with him. He was a good guy, and despite the popular conspiracy theorist belief, the Army isn&#39;t full of sleeper cell CIA assets doing dirty work. The CIA operates independently from the Army, and the number of guys in the Army doing dirty work are a few thousand at best, the culture within that part of the world none of us will experience wouldn&#39;t allow a gay man to be in their ranks...I&#39;m sort of ranting at this point, my mind wanders, which is my original point - think critically and don&#39;t have knee jerk reactions or let yourself dive down the rabbit hole until you&#39;ve exhausted more realistic situations.</p>

<p>All the evidence we have suggests hoax. We can&#39;t rationalize that away. We&#39;re all willing to jump on the false flag theory if anyone can present anything that actually demonstrates a shooting went on or people actually got hurt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lack of evidence is not always evidence in itself. Honestly it&#39;s only been 3/4 days since the attack and anyone that thinks stuff will be released 3 days after a big event like this has no knowledge of how the government and police/swat/FBI investigations work. I will admit it is a little strange there&#39;s no pictures or videos or anything yet, but like I said it&#39;s only been 3/4 days and everyday someone posts up some new theory. Give some time for investigations to run their course and if a month later there&#39;s still nothing released then that&#39;s looking more on the sketchy side for this event.</p>

Is he an actor, and if so where is he now? Or was he a victim? The latter may explain why they were reporting 50 victims for about 2 days straight then suddenly revised it to 49. And also why there are several reports of him being a &quot;regular&quot; at the club..</p>

Somebody posted a facebook page which said he was from Orlando, and the news wanted to make it clear that he wasn&#39;t from Orlando. Now they are saying he&#39;s a regular at the club. I don&#39;t know how big of a deal that is, but they are definitely covering up the multiple shooter scenario which shows that there is a conspiracy here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It almost seems certain there were more shooters. There were multiple witness accounts of a second shooter. It&#39;s also unbelievable that one person could inflict so much carnage with a semi-auto. So many victims, some with multiple hits ... just the mags and ammo he would have needed to carry would be so cumbersome. Also, no one to cover his back either ... 300 people and not one tackled him from behind while he swapped in the ... what .. 10th mag?!</p>

<p>Some reasons that I can think of that the authorities are covering other shooter(s)...
1. The authorities do intend to tell us sometime. They consider they have better chances of catching the other shooter(s) if everyone, including them, don&#39;t know they are being hunted down.
2. A plain cover up for incompetence/mistakes of letting the other shooters(s) get away.
3. It better fits that narrative those up top have, that there was only a &quot;lone nutter with guns&quot;. You have no hope of pinning this on lack of gun control or hate crime if it was clearly an Islamic terrorist cell.</p>

<p>Another theory -- most of the victims were actually from the authorities when they busted in and opened fire. Again, they would rather that covered up. Though for me I would not hold it against them if that was the case.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying this not just with respect to this event, but with previous hoaxes like Aurora and Sandy Hook where years have gone by and still not a peep from a family member beyond more gun control narrative.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t believe anyone is being sacrificed. I think people are faking their deaths/identities.</p>

<p>It, along with the conflicting eye-witness accounts, are enough to make one wonder if perhaps at least <em>some</em> elements of the ensuing media spectacle were staged, to a degree, to create more effective propaganda, to push various agendas (e.g. pro-war, pro-surveillance, increased Islamophobia, gun control / citizen disarmament agenda, etc). Though I wouldn&#39;t doubt the false flag hypothesis, that to is to say that there were actual victims gunned down by a patsy or asset, with the body count inflated (as we saw with Paris) again to strengthen the effect of the psyop / propaganda.</p>

<p>This hoax vs false flag debate ultimately goes back to the planer vs no -planer 9/11 debate. I&#39;d be curious to see what portion of the hoax supporters here are no-planers vs what portion of the false flag supporters here are planers.</p>

<p>Even though 9/11 was a mix between a hoax and a false flag, those who have accepted the truth about no-planes are aware of TPTB&#39;s approach to psychological warfare. </p>

<p>Anyone suggesting that the hoax is the least likely scenario is clearly out of loop with what happened on 9/11, through Tucson, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Paris, etc...</p>

I think this is a set-up to vilify conspiracy types after the community convinces the world it&#39;s a hoax and someone acts on that information (staged, of course) and then here comes limitation on &#39;dangerous speech&#39; which might &#39;mislead or otherwise interfere in a terrorist investigation&#39; and on and on.</p>

<p>Basically you&#39;ve nailed it. This is going to be the false flag that silences anybody who tries to scrutinize what the government does from here on out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a hoax, people died, everything we are being fed is just wrong information from the media, so they are to blame if we get the idea it&#39;s a hoax. It&#39;s like a psyop layer cake. They are all probably like that, actually, this one just has easier to spot layers.</p>

Not to mention that thousands of people would have to be involved on this huge conspiracy. The more realistic option is that there were multiple shooters.

I don&#39;t see how one man could get the gear into the club and begin his spree. Seems like you&#39;d need some help</p>

<p>I&#39;m all about the white flag, and there is some scetchy stuff here in this event. I&#39;m from Orlando, I&#39;ve driven by the club thousands of times, I did that Saturday/Sunday, literally 30 minutes before it happened. I met with some people at the bar who I&#39;ve shared drinks for a few years and they had people die, so I know people DID die, but the reason is the lie, the details will be blurry as always </p>

But I&#39;m sure had I not had it on my shoulder it would have been easier. And he was an adult man and the machine gun probably doesn&#39;t kick that hard. I&#39;m saying he could have shot from the hip and just sprayed side to side. I have fired a .38 special and had pretty good accuracy (the same day as the 3030 but before it) I fired a 357 magnum once but it was too loud and I couldn&#39;t do it again and I fired a .45 long colt and I fell in love with it. It felt like it was made for me except the barrel was a bit heavy after a while. Guns don&#39;t require that much training to use unless you&#39;re sniping.  </p>

<p>With how bad journalism is today I wouldn&#39;t put much stock into that, at all, he could very well have told someone that the count is up to 202 shells.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that, as I already said, again it states that a &quot;police source&quot; told them that 202 rounds were fired. There&#39;s no official statement on it. You can&#39;t on one hand say the media lies to protect a narrative then turn around and say that an unknown source is a credible source when there&#39;s a flurry of reporters trying to get the information out there first rather than fact checking.</p>

<p>These errors occur countless times in shootings, and some of the conspiracy theory world writes it off as &quot;tidying up the story&quot; while others write it off as accuracy versus knee jerk journalism.</p>

<p>The count is up to 202 shells does not mean a total of 202 shells were fired, the conclusion that 202 shots were used to kill X amount of people based on that statement is a poor conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He would not have had to get a kill shot on every person. A lot of people could have bled out in 3 hours. Tumbling bullets are still dangerous, and .223 can easily overpenetrate a person. If he fired his first five rounds into a crowd he could&#39;ve hit 10 people. It also isnt hard to hit something that isn&#39;t shooting back at you. He was basically shooting at moving targets. Much different than a combat situation. The vest he supposedly had on can hold 6 magazines easily. That&#39;s plenty of ammo, not counting how much else he had not counting the vest. Also it wasn&#39;t exactly like he was new to firearms. He was a security guard. He has to have had some experience firing weapons before.</p>
