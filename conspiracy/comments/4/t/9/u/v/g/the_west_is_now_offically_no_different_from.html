        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have to say that the West (USA, Europe, Japan) is no different from communist china in this state. The following are my points.</p>

<p>Battered Landscape fit for a wasteland or third world country, NOT a first-world country</p>

<p>Gone were the days where the infrastructure of the west is good enough to be regconizable as a symbol of high living standard. Now, all of the countries are having the same type of battered infrastructure.</p>

<p>The last time i went to Japan (Tokyo), it felt like a street from china save for all the anime stores or restaurants. Remember, Japan = One of The West. If not for the Anime stores and Japanese restaurants (Which i had never seen in China), it is barely recgonizable.</p>

<p>At the last time i went to Canada, the infrastructure is better but i saw only a few white canadians there. Lots of Asians however, and i never saw a Muslim.</p>

<p>And France is literally in disrepair from what i ever heard of because the government is busy turning that hellhole into a police state. </p>

<p>America, from what i heard of is in disrepair just like the rest; The remaining actual americans are rarely seen in big cities; In the big cities anybody can be seen (Can be Mexican, Jew, Asian, Muslim or whatever); Anyone but the American worker. </p>

<p>The disrepaired streets are basically what i see in the most abundant streets of Shanghai or Guangzhou.</p>

<p>Improverished Population</p>

<p>Sooner or Later that you will realize that in all western countries, the locals are poor while the select few, or legal immigrants are rich. </p>

<p>In China, the &quot;Rich Boom&quot; is a lie; The majority of people is still poor, and really very poor. In the west, the media seems to be able to trick the masses into thinking that their economy is booming while the depression is in. The typical western citizen has no choice other than spending in Walmart or the Convenience Stores. These 2 are basically very similiar since all of them deceive their population into thinking that they are rich.</p>

<p>Media Mafias</p>

<p>In china, the Media is well known for posting misinformation. In the West, the media does nothing other than posting WORSE misinformation. The CNN, BBC, Washington Post, Guardian, Huffington Post and other media moguls is becoming no better than the chinese communist television channel (CCTV), and often worse.</p>

<p>Thoughtcrimes</p>

<p>In China, saying the CCCP one bad word, and you are off to a good jail sentence (Although CCCP dissendents, from my knowledge are often false opposition controlled by the US). In the west, say one thing bad about liberal ideas or anyone save for your everyday, humble person (I mean anyone who acts like a sane person and not a puppet slave) and you are off for the &quot;rascist&quot; or &quot;sexist&quot; card and you are off to jail.</p>

<p>Dictatorships</p>

<p>In china, the government is a bona fide dictatorship with a lifetime president. In the west, there are elections, but all of them are controlled by diebolds, which are electronic gods that tell you who is the president. And even so, the one of 2016 will very likely be the last election before the dictatorship is in.</p>

<p>I forgot that the higher echelons of western society are communists too which makes the 2 more eerily similar.</p>

<p>And there are two things that the west does &quot;better&quot; than CCCP.</p>

<p>Murderous Police</p>

<p>The CCCP sends people into jail for thought crimes and/or miscourses and often does big sentences for little stuff. In America, look at the police or talk to the police, or hold a TOY GUN (Or make a gun-like posture), OR possibly run in front of the police and you can get shot. And don&#39;t even talk about France; France is worse than china.</p>

<p>False Flags</p>

<p>the CCCP rarely does false flags from what i saw. This month alone the west made 3 false flags in 2 weeks and there is more to come. </p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>The west is basically turning from representatives of freedom and peace into copies of Communist China.</p>

<p>Welcome to the New World Order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious what state are you in? There is a lot of bad infrastructure in all five states I&#39;ve lived in. Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin and Arizona. Although most is not noticeable, it&#39;s still there though. Look at the lead in the water stuff that&#39;s happening all over the USA. That is bad infrastructure that is in disrepair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense Ohio is a pretty nice state with lots of revenue from what I&#39;ve seen. Cedar point alone probably pays for a lot of infrastructure. It&#39;s also a pretty low population comparatively. Any States with really big cities though are hurting pretty bad and those big cities are where the worst infrastructure is. Trains and bridges being a major example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;America, from what i heard of is in disrepair just like the rest; From what i heard you won&#39;t see actual americans save for outside wal mart&quot; </p>

<p>This is so far from the truth. It makes me laugh. You clearly don&#39;t know what living in America is like at all. There are &quot; actual Americans&quot; everywhere granted there are a lot of Mexicans in big cities and the southwest. Walmart is full of all kinds of weird people but mostly poor working class Americans and Mexicans. Although I do see a lot of Muslims and Asians at Walmart too.</p>

<p>As far as our infrastructure it&#39;s in disrepair but, you wouldn&#39;t know in most cities. They keep everything painted and looking nice. For example Chicago&#39;s El train tracks and bridges downtown are probably from the 1930s they just paint over them every year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never once said &quot;real american&quot;, OP said &quot; actual americans&quot; but, i would consider anyone a &quot;real&quot; American that wants to live here or contributes to this countries economy and society. Lots of people come from Mexico with no intention of living here. They work here and send all their money back to Mexico. While they are here they treat Americans and America with disdain. Why do you think people want to close our borders?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, maybe I should plan a trip up there sometime. Yeah the suburban sprawl is sickening. My home town in Missouri was like 10,000 people when I was in middle school upon returning a couple of years ago it was like 50,000 people. All the old abandoned farms and forests I would play in as a child were housing developments.</p>
