       If nothing else, it's helping to develop a 3-D,4-D map of activity. There's also the idea that in lieu of advertising companies would pay to have rare Pokemon at or near their business

       Personally while I agree it's a perfect nsa gov way to track people and stuff. But. All the information that is given when playing the game is already known by the cia/nsa. They can always get ur Gps signal even with ur phone with a battery removed. They know ur email. Shit they can look at you through the camera if they wanted too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like playing it gives them anymore of a way to find you iffff they wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is they probably don't. And then knowing your location because ur giving it away will just let them know where u have been more often is the only thing I can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the game is fun as hell. And very awesome but I don't have it running everywhere I go. I'm in Alaska. So my town has one store. And that store has pidgey lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I just turn it on when I want to play for a bit. At a place I wouldn't cAre if I yelled that I was there. "I'm at Walmart I'm. A terrorist ".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don't see it being s huge advancement or game breaker

       Of course NSA will use this game for their 'data/records' but they're recording so much of everything they are drowning in data.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, augmented reality games will be trending like crazy via cellphones and VR goggles. This new subculture was predicted a few years ago and this game is the first to blow it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also seen this game bring races, genders, age gaps together and unite them under one common interest which is good for everyone.

       It needs access to GPS because it's a location-based game. Its fundamental game loop is "get outside and walk around and do things at different places in the real world". People have been futzing around with this sort of thing since smartphones had GPS; this is the first one to marry it with a powerful enough brand to get a ton of people playing an otherwise-not-very-compelling game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amusingly enough it owes a hell of a lot to Niantic's previous game "Ingress", which is themed with secret conspiracies. Niantic is a spin-off of Google, and one of their admitted goals with Ingress was to get people to document and photograph a lot of points of interest so they could make Google Maps better without hiring a ton of people.

       What they do with all your photos, I dunno. Anyone want to start snooping on its network traffic?

       We all know it's evasive privacy wise, however what kills me is the sheep mentality and everyone acting like a fucking zombie. It's a huge distraction for young and old alike. For the fact we are talking about it tells me the distraction is real.
      </p>

       We the planet in a huge shit pile this is perfect to keep people occupied while the powers that be do their shit which goes unnoticed.

       It's very fucking sad how one game can come out of now where and then bang, every mother fucker is chasing VR characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking more, its another huge experiment on how to control people, specifically young people. We know what governments are capable of but they have now found the week link with the younger generation and hats off to the bastards even if I hate the idea.

       While I do see the invasion of privacy. We've been invaded for a while. And it's just the nature of the game.  Being it a planned program or not. It's nothing that's changing anything. And tell me. Please how u think otherwise. I'm just sayin my opinion

       From a few comments on this game over the past week it sounds like people are starting to accept the invasion of privacy as the norm.  In my opinion that is the scariest thing about it.

       Well the game just happened to come out the same week that a US court ruled unwarranted GPS surveillance unconstitutional, so there's that as well.

       For some reason all I can picture is cops riding around with a similar program, except instead of Pokemon it's all of us citizens they need to collect.

       If you knew anything about the game then it would be blindingly obvious why it needs your gps as that is the entire way the game works, you walk around and find pokemon. It needs your Google so you don't have to make another account (which gets annoying)

       Plenty of other ways you could be tracked anyway

       You came here just in time. It is very insidious for some very good reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        It is basically spyware that allows the CIA/NSA to know your location. It also keeps track of gmail and thus if your gmail is used for stuff like conspiracy boards, you can get caught very easily when the big communist purge strikes america, which i believe is these 5 years.
       </li>
       <li>
        It serves as a very effective distraction tool considering that this july is illuminati season due to all of the days that add up to 777. When everyone is converted into pokemon-capturing zombies, the illuminati throws numerous attacks  worldwide. I believe that there are still 2 more attacks to go before the end of the month.
       </li>
       <li>
        Pokemon go's development HAS direct comnections with the CIA. This alone is very fishy and proves that it is a distract ops and tracking; Basically the mark of the beast, aside that you can choose not to download it, and if you uninstall it, from what i heard they can no longer track you and your gmail via the app.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So yes, very fishy and dangerous, and is very likely the zombie apocalypse, only more like cyber, pokemon catching zombies this time.

       You're really reaching man. It's actually pretty obvious Nintendo targeted the pokemon generation from the 90's and early 2000s, people who are all young adults today. I've played quite a bit and 95% have been adults.

       Have you played it? Why do you think it's silly and immature?

       It's actually an amazingly unique game. A world-wide mobile hyper connected augmented reality game based around one of, if not the most popular video game franchise of all time?
