<p>Yep.  Working as intended.</p>

<p>I think that racism is utterly idiotic, personally.  If there has been one thing that has convinced me that black people and white people are fundamentally no different, it is the fact that both groups kill each other.  Blacks can shoot each other in gang wars, and as long as the sender of the bullet is the same colour as the recipient, it&#39;s all just fine.  Likewise, if one white man kills another, then sure he might get the usual 25 to life, but it won&#39;t be dressed up as a hate crime or sensationalised in any other way; it&#39;s just background noise.</p>

<p>The only time any of you care about it, is if it crosses racial lines, and that is because it violates your Utopian Marxist bullshit, not because you actually care about whether or not someone continues breathing.  If you truly gave a shit about the loss of life, you wouldn&#39;t keep fanning the flames, while a government which is long past needing all of you to get together and violently overthrowing it because of the amount that it is collectively sodomising you, sits on the sidelines and laughs its&#39; head off at you.</p>

<p>You idiot Klansmen and Black Panthers (and yes, I&#39;m going to address both here, because neither of them are any better or worse than the other, as far as I am concerned) need to stop attacking <strong><em>each other</em></strong> for the five minutes necessary for you to figure out who your race war really benefits.  If it is true that 95% of the American prison population are black, as is claimed, then figure out a way to change that and get it fucking done; and get it done <strong><em>for the sake of both sides.</em></strong>  Whites are less likely to get shot by blacks, if they cease unfairly discriminating against them.  This isn&#39;t rocket science; it&#39;s just that most humans are juvenile fucking morons.</p>

<p>Seriously.  I am not an SJW or &quot;progressive,&quot; in any way or by any real means, other than maybe drug reform and the environment; but the American race issue is beyond idiotic and pointless, and it has gone on for far, far too long.  It is just making America look like a Neanderthal disgrace in the eyes of the rest of the planet, and you people like to hold yourselves up as this great international moral authority.</p>

<p>Clean up your own back yard, before you criticise any of the rest of us over the state of ours.</p>

<p>It should be more common knowledge that most of us carry Neanderthal genes, and/or those of other archaic ancestral groups.  They were Human.  Up to 40% of their gene pool is still alive today, scattered amongst living Humans. To me this is so fascinating and awe inspiring that it defangs much of the bickering, and just makes it look sad.  The real story is so much deeper.  There must have been love for this to happen.  The love of mother for her child.  Tolerance, at least, from the tribe.  We&#39;re all mutts.</p>

<p>Another barrier to advancing our understanding is the simple dialectic polarity of black and white.  When we habitually speak in these terms, we don&#39;t often realize something: it has a tendency to distill our perception into opposing extremes.  Nobody&#39;s <em>actually</em> black or white.  We all have a colour.</p>
