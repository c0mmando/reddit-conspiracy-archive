        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading lately on the history, and future, of economic development, and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that capitalism is a weapon of TPTB to suppress and divide us.<br/>
In one way, it seems like an obvious statement- most of us work jobs that feel meaningless to buy stuff that we don&#39;t need- a sentiment expressed in the most rebelliously pre-pubescent-aimed pop culture (<em>Fight Club</em>)- whilst the capability to sustain everyone in the world equally and comfortably is a fully realizable idea- a reality.  </p>

<p>In another way, like all forms of deception and supression, capitalism has become so ingrained in western society as a right, our manifest destiny, that anything that opposes that idea is a chaotic evil, set out to destroy our very nature of existence.  </p>

<p>Since the conception and implementation of socialism, the western powers have been starkly opposed to it- and rightly so, we can&#39;t deny the horrific events that have unfolded at the hands of authoritarian dictators- but it&#39;s not out for humanitarian reasons or to preserve democracy.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s to preserve the elites capability to enslave the majority of the population and to use them to increase their wealth- in all forms, including monetary, capital and outright power.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently being reading Noam Chomsky&#39;s <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> in which he provides an assessment of the medias role in protecting the interests of the powerful and privileged elite.  In it he addresses the media legitimizing third-world elections, and in every case of the media completely demonizing a third world election, the United States has been involved, funding and supporting groups rivaling the prevailing political party- even if it is in direct opposition to what the indigenous population wants.  </p>

<p>Oddly enough, in the majority of these countries from Venezuela and Vietnam to Colombia and Nicaragua, the US has opposed socialist governments at every turn, even going as far as to arm rebels to defeat our enemies (for example, arming and training Osama Bin Laden to fight the USSR in Afghanistan- we can see the direct implications in the destabilization of the Middle East today). Most of the countries the US opposed were backed by or influenced by the USSR.  </p>

<p>Essentially you have capitalism vs. socialism.  </p>

<p>According to Merriam-Webster capitalism is &quot;<em>:  an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market</em>&quot;.  </p>

<p>Socialism is &quot;<em>any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods</em>&quot;.  </p>

<p>In my view socialism is the appropriate extension, or evolution of capitalism. Capitalism, historically being the answer to feudalism, where the Lords and Kings owned the means of production and ownership; allowing the ownership, production, and distribution of goods to be centralized among entrepreneurs. Capitalism has been great for the advancement of humanity, and equalizing the distrubtion of wealth- raising the standard of living and bringing many, many millions of people out of poverty.  </p>

<p>If we can forego the inclusion of &quot;governmental ownership&quot; and insist that socialism advocates &quot;collective&quot; ownership, then socialism is the logical evolution of capitalism, bringing the means of production down another level of the societal hierarchy, so that it&#39;s no longer just entrepreneurs, but communities as a whole, controlling the economy.   </p>

<p>The new &quot;Lords&quot; and &quot;Kings&quot; are obviously opposed to this- they want to retain their power, and so they want to discredit and destroy socialism at any opportunity. And they have, very successfully.  </p>

<p>But I believe the western image of socialism- authoritarian and oppressive in nature- is exactly the nature of modern capitalism- that&#39;s where we get the term Neo-Feudalism.  Capitalism is being presented as the highest means of freedom and self-actualization, yet it&#39;s exactly that idea that is keeping us enslaved to the system.  </p>

<p>Keynes put forth the idea that technology would increase productivity, whilst reducing the need for workers- thus the work week would be reduced to 15 hours and people would have more free time, yet enjoy a life of luxury never before seen.<br/>
I would argue that we are enjoying a standard of living no human has ever had the privilege of experiencing, yet we&#39;re working longer hours then ever before and our jobs have become more menial.<br/>
Keynes did not predict that our rate of consumption would increase, and this is where his theory has derailed for the moment.<br/>
I do believe his theory will fulfill itself within the next century as automation replaces swathes of occupations- then the problem will be how we address distribution, and the rapidly increasing amount inequality.<br/>
Technology will either be our savior or own downfall, and it&#39;s up to the people to take back the means of production.  </p>

<p>There are people who are far smarter than myself, far more politically and economically aware that have thought about this long and hard, but I&#39;m sure we all have had a conversation with someone who has denounced the idea of socialism and welfare and that people have &quot;earn a living&quot;, it&#39;s especially poignant in the 2016 presidential election, because those of us who oppose the corrupt system are seen by lazy as those who have managed to succeed in it, not realizing they&#39;re not only luck to make a living, but also manipulated into viewing anyone who has the opposite belief as lazy. 
I don&#39;t think the idolization of capitalism is that far from the idolization of the military, government, celebrity culture and media that TPTB force upon us.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s completely orchestrated, and modern capitalism is just a modern form of oppression and slavery.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more I could go into, regarding advertising and capitalizing on peoples &quot;needs&quot;, the spiritual and mental side-effects caused by menial jobs, the fact that the majority of our luxuries, like this laptop I&#39;m writing on, come at the expense of, essentially, another persons life, and the disastrous effects on the environment that capitalism has extolled trying to expand its bottom line.  </p>

<p>What do you guys think?  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>...capitalism is a weapon of TPTB to suppress and divide us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just take a look at any decently sized business (ie. capitalist enterprise) and the people who work for it. Who really benefits the most and by how much?</p>

<p>The owner/s definitely do. Chances are that the owner (or major shareholders) are millionaires or better. So capitalism really works well for them. </p>

<p>Next comes the top level executives and managers. They actually have a fair bit of responsibility and the stress that goes with it. But the pay is usually 6 figures or better and the benefits are pretty good as well. So capitalism is working well for them too.</p>

<p>Then come the rest of the employees. What you find is that the greatest number of people who do most of the actual work are the ones who get paid the lowest amount, have the least benefits and the least job security. Capitalism doesn&#39;t work nearly as well for them. Remember too, that these people usually make up over 95% of the workforce in a typical business.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got system that works extremely well for maybe 1% of the people at the very top. It works OK for maybe another 5% who are closer to the top. Then you&#39;ve got wage slavery for pretty much everybody else.</p>

<p>So really, it&#39;s not a very good system. The people who will debate this (in defense of capitalism) are usually those who have been educated in (and indoctrinated by) a capitalist system. </p>

<p>Most people would probably chose an alternative if they were given a choice. They don&#39;t get that choice because those in power are the same people who benefit from the system. This means they have the access to power and resources and they use them to maintain the status quo. This is where the part about &quot;suppress and divide us&quot; comes in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not natural for a system to exist where only a tiny minority benefits from that system. The majority, given the chance, would happily overturn such a system and come up with one that works better. But as long as the majority of people can be split up and pitted against each other, and distracted by various means... the wealthy minority can maintain control.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how capitalism really works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for writing out how I&#39;ve felt about the system as well. I totally agree with what you&#39;ve written, but the key is to inform others about how we&#39;re all being duped by the Government (cause the govt is being bought off by corporations &amp; banks). It&#39;s going to take a monumental effort of showing others the truth, as sometimes I feel people know the truth but just want to continually live as &quot;domesticated cattle&quot;. The propaganda and $hilling is so thick in the world right now that people are too exhausted from the spin they&#39;re fed on a daily/hourly basis. The best we pleibians can do right now is just be aware of th spin and bullshit lame-stream-media pundits, and then find the truth from the garbage they spew out on our own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an oversimplification to say that the western powers have always been opposed to socialism. Socialism is a German concept to start with, and the ideas amassed in Europe long before they spread to Asia. The US adopted socialist principles with FDRs New Deal in the 30&#39;s, and post-war most countries in Europe turned to democratic socialism in some regard, including the UK. This is why European societies have stronger social security, tax-funded healthcare, cheaper or sometimes free education etc. This is now challenged by the elite but up to the early 1980&#39;s many European nations were quite socialist by American standards, even though they of course retained a free market. It&#39;s important to differentiate between socialism and communism, which has been the main crux be the US where there of course was a huge effort to vilify all types of socialist thinking and equate it to Russian communism. The US also had a powerful labour and union movement with socialist motivations that was pretty much squashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres obviously a well executed operation by the elite, through the media,  to misinform and influence the general population on their role in a free market society. It might be obvious to some of us on here but it goes unotices amongst a large majority of the population, which I believe falls within the general guidelines of this sub.<br/>
Not to mention the manipulative nature of the US government which has played a large part in the failure of socialism. The notion that our government is operating om behalf of the elite isnt that far-fetched. 
What better way yo destroy an ideology than to demonize amongst the constituency?  </p>

<p>In regards to your post I would say weve already reached oligarchical fascism, as a manufactured economy to further solidify the elites power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that anything you are claiming is far fetched. Your analysis is spot on actually.  However, I do think that categorizing your analysis as a conspiracy does it a disservice.  I don&#39;t think that every actor is as nefarious as to bring their actions to the level of calling it a conspiracy.  Human nature is not a conspiracy.  </p>

I do think though that manipulation of the mass population to operate against their nest interests is grounds for conspiracy,  not to mention the seemingly unrelated evemts of the past century (like the rigged elections and US funded regime changes) that could have been enacted im part to enable and perpetuate the scheme.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once I started studying the history of labor in this country, I saw fairly quickly that&#39;s exactly where racism originates from. Gotta make sure one group is thought of as lesser in order to exploit them for cheap labor. Gotta make sure all other cheap labor hates each other so they don&#39;t unite together to demand what they&#39;re rightfully owed.</p>
