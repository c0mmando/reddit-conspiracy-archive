       Look, I'm not someone who is generally into conspiracy theories but I'm deeply troubled by what I've found. Like, I've legit been losing sleep over this.

       The nightclub was broken into a few nights ago, and they explicitly state there is no CCTV footage for the break-in, but where is the footage of the shooting?

       I do searching and find articles like, "Sickening CCTV from inside" which only leads to a snapchat someone made. Following the link for CCTV it only brings you to a collective page of info.

       Watching "How the Pulse nightclub shooting unfolded" why did they feel the need to let off "explosives" in the rear of the building, when the assailant was supposedly armed with explosives? Have you ever seen search and rescue missions before? These people are masters of their craft, they know how to operate hostage situations that involve forced entry.

       Orange County Florida Live Audio Feeds, feed is missing for 6-12-16 from 00:00 hours to 02:57. Look for yourself. They say it was a "technical error", but these seem like too many circumstances to be true.

       There were 50 wounded, and 50 killed in this event, and no coverage except for short blips that don't tell any kind of story. These things aren't adding up. God I'm pulling out my hair here. Have we been lied to? I am having doubts in our government for the first time in my life.

       The Media worked very hard to cement in American minds a particular narrative. There is no desire to see that undone by the research community casting doubt, legitimate or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the American people at large aren't clamoring for the footage, so you'll never see it. Americans are almost totally operating on autopilot now;
       <em>
        they don't want to know the truth

       Heres what I believe: If anyone died, it was Omar Mateen. But I'm not even convinced someone was killed. The survivors they paraded on TV werent injured and weren't in the nightclub for the attack. The Pulse was probably closed that night - its website didn't have any events listed.  Why did the event last so long? Maybe Omar realized he was being set up and there was a confrontation. Maybe nothing happened at all, and this is just the beat they can do to serve up a scary story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The witness / victim accounts are too similar, like they're following a script. Too many people claimed to be piled in a tiny bathroom where Omar shot random people, except for blacks. Then weird stories about escaping out the patio, and how couldnt more people escape out the many exits instead of the bathrooms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single victim they paraded on TV had any gunshot injuries. No one genuinely distraught or crying real tears either. Angel Colon was supposedly shot in the hand, but he didn't even have a bandage on his hand! Victims doing TV interviews from the car and home within days of being shot up? With full mobility? Everyone interviewed with any relation to the attack was acting--one friend of a victim is clearly caught acting as he bickers with his handler (this part of the interview is so bad, it's edited out of CNN's online video). And you know why they all can't stop smiling? Because they're getting a big payday. You can see the dollar signs in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you analyze the official story and timeline of events. It makes zero sense! Cops were on the scene within minutes, got in a gunfight, then let Omar retreat into the bathroom where he shot off people and waited hours until explosives were used to breach the bathroom?
      </p>
      <p>
       Man I'm completely with you on this. It's outright depressing that we're being so blatantly lied to. Then you piece together some of the other recent hoaxes/false flags, you really start to question where this world is headed.

       I wonder if there is some island they take these people to live out the rest of their lives on?  You figure once they were paid off the government wouldn't want them mingling in with the rest of society.  There has to be some sorta witness protection type program they all go into afterwards.  My best guess?  Dead men tell no tales.

       You false flag guys never take into consideration that it's easier to just kill innocent victims then  create people out of thin air. Let's say this retarded kid in Connecticutt didn't do Sandyhook ( entirely possible), it's still easier to just have a Merc going in and shoot up the place and drop a dead armed retarded kid after it's over.

       I can actually understand his demeanor. Sometimes, surviving a really close call actually does put you in a good mood afterwards. Some people focus on how incredibly lucky they are to have survived something that could have killed them. Also, he's a young guy, he's alive and now he's getting interviewed on TV.

       Here's another fun excursion for young conspiracy theorists: surveillance video of the shooting of Alton Sterling was stolen by police without a warrant after detaining the shop owner for four hours in a police car. They made the poor man pee on the side of his building rather than let him into his own shop. He's suing. Interestingly, their body cameras stopped working during the event. And they arrested the man who did film the shooting at his place of work for traffic tickets in another state BUT they said he looked like someone who had committed a crime that would have gotten him sacked. His boss was cool and laughed it up. But obviously there's a conspiracy to hide evidence here and retaliation.

       Now imagine how large and powerful the federal government is. Think about how transparent our government is (haha) and how rife corruption is. Soooo, my only question is "how many of these shooting events are faked," not "could one be faked." I'm not a jaded asshole, ok, I am, but really, look at how the media is pushing the gun control agenda. Look at how reacting to "terrorism" justifies everything questionable and unsavory our government wants to do. Recall that false flag events are well established in our history and that the police, military and private security outfits have a history of firing on US civilians to protect the assets of the wealthy.

       All of the links you posted seem like damning evidence save for the smiling survivors. It's something that's brought up a lot to bolster a 'crisis actor' scenario but to me (assuming it at least happened) a human being's demeanor when reacting to stress is not useful evidence for anything. The human brain is crazy complex and to take the position that upset and traumatized people will always act upset and traumatized seems ridiculous.

       Well I wasn't there so I can only speak for the videos I've seen, and I admit most people do look really shocked/horrified. There's the occasional weird reaction (smiling cop video), but my point is in super traumatic situations (Sandy Hook, Orlando, etc...) more horror doesn't necessarily translate into more emotional outpouring.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a common reaction to be dissociated during a traumatic event (e.g. the girlfriend of philando Castile) or even to exhibit paradoxical emotions. Another important thing to consider is that they're not interviewing the people immediately after the event, that complicates things quite a bit as far as predicting their demeanor. I would personally expect an interviewee hours or minutes after experiencing the trauma is to have a flat emotionless tone when recounting the event.

       I get if a small percentage of a group are not acting in line with how we expect.  But when almost everyone that has gone through a tragedy is
       <em>
        acting
       </em>
       strange?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the way I see it.  When I look at how people act after something that definitely could not have been staged (like a Tsunami) they act one way, but in some of these questionable events they seem to be acting a completely different way.  It's weird.  Is it proof?  No, but people should at least admit its at a bare minimum odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same deal with evidence.  After some events that couldn't have been faked we have all kinds of video evidence.  After questionable events you are simply told the evidence exists, but you never actually
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       it.  Again, odd.

       People die in these events, at least the recent ones. The descriptions of the victims and their jobs are way too detailed to be fake. It doesn't mean the people interviewed on national television aren't faking it and going along with the fictional narrative of what happened.

       I agree that there are definitely reasons to think Orlando is not fake.  Its way to big of an operation, with way too many loose ends that would need to be taken care of.  For instance, what did they do - shut down the club that night?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do however think the lack of footage is a bit weird, and what little footage I have seen doesn't look quite right.

       I usually lurk to see what you crazies are up to, but I think you hit the nail on the head. From interviews with police and hearing about the shootout, it seems that they were knowingly firing blind at some points for the sake of suppression. I don't doubt that there were blue on green casualties.

       it seems like you would describe yourself as "non-crazy" judging how you described commenters on this subreddit as "crazies" but all the completely blind people out there would for sure call you crazy for suggesting cops killed innocent people that night.  i haven't listened to any of the interviews so i can't comment on that topic, but yea, you seem pretty positive on it and i bet at least 90%+ of american public would say you are insane for suggesting that.   i'm not attacking you btw

       Just like with Sandy Hook, until I see the shooter, on site, with the weapons they said, I'm not buying it. I don't need need gore or anything. Just prove to me these guys were even there.

       My thing about faking these is there are way too many loose ends.

       Why can't they?  What natural law exists that forbid this?  We had the CCTV for the Columbine shootings and that was really what kicked this whole thing off and, I think, put the seed in the head of the Leftist Elite who want to push fear and gun control.  After that it's been a string of shootings.  Some verified, but many not supportable with anything other than "witness statements."

       Probability would suggest you're right - they're not all fake.  But are most fake?  I don't know.  I choose to believe a good number of them are because, as another poster said, when the CCTV supports the narrative that's all you see, the CCTV.  But when it doesn't, the CCTV is mysteriously gone.  And I don't recall seeing any CCTV footage of any of these recent shootings.  Have you?

       They might not show the CCTV footage because the shooter isn't who they claim he is, or there may be multiple shooters. It doesn't mean the whole thing is fake and no one died.

       I agree and I didn't mean to imply the entire thing would be fake.  I believe people died in many of those instances (not sure about Sandyhook still), but a lot of times I think the FBI either sets this shit up or they know about it and let it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       IE:  They find a guy who hates gay people.  They set him up with an undercover FBI agent who provides him with explosives and guns.  Guy commits terror.  Government capitalizes on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that example the event was real, people died, but it was still a set up.

       A lot of shitty bars and what not don't run CCTV.   Or they have it but it's off, or there's no tape in, or something else stupid.  People who run bars are not world class thinkers, it might surprise you to know.

       The assertion that they are fake comes with it the burden of proof.  It's not on me to prove they are real.  Logic and probability dictate that they can't all be fake - but this is exactly what conspiracy theorist claim, often with the weakest of "evidence".  Something simple like missing CCTV footage is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       enough evidence to prove anything.

       I'll concede that a lot of smaller places like bars and stuff might not have CCTV working.  Just sort of a show.  But the Newtown school?  Schools have fairly extensive CCTV from what I recall.  At least my schools always did.  And after the shooting at Columbine more schools added CCTVs.  It's just too suspicious for my tastes.  Our government operates much too in the dark in a lot of this stuff that should be handled a bit more publicly.

       To me this conspiracy doesnt hold water.  The gov is shooting up school kids for what?  To ban/take your guns? To get the gun laws changed?  The gun laws never change after shootings.  Everyone still has their guns.

       I'm a little sick of that too. Maybe more conspiracy theorists than you'd think are just guessing and hoping one vague theory will be true. No offense, like keep researching stuff like this for information.

      <p>
       What I think is happening is increased media coverage and awareness overall. This leads to more media lies, more conspiracy theories, and perhaps more opportunities to stage something to force an agenda.

       Back in the day when we had real mass shootings we got footage. Columbine is a perfect example. Tons of footage, no debate on the perps and how they operated. No one arguing the American public isn't grown up enough to see children being shot.

       Welcome to the club, friend. Part of you hopes for clear-cut evidence of the legitimacy of the attack narrative, but eventually you begin to expect the bogus conflicting reports and stories full of logical holes. It creates a certain melancholy feeling to know that you're being lied to.

       Here's my sentiment. The Dallas shooting (granted was outside) was leaked the same day but somehow Sandy hook and Orlando , etc has nothing. It's obvious. Some are fake to start a cause and the real ones are effect of their doing.(as in cause and effect). They are very opportunistic and are playing chess.

       I have a feeling that one of the reasons why they didn't have cctv/security cams in the club was to protect the privacy of their patrons.  Not all gays are out of the closer,after all. Such film could ruin their lives if it got out.
 That said, it is kinda strange that there is no cell phone footage. Makes me wonder if the fops were erasing it when they were removing the bodies and evidense afterwards.

       I've been thinking about this problem in general. Seems to me there is only one ultimate solution. We basically have to end privacy. I know that sucks, but for the average person that's more an annoyance than anything else; for the government however it's a very big deal. Imagine if every word every government official uttered was required to be made public in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases like the pulse shooting, someone needs to invent a cheap 360 camera that records 24-7 and distributes its content to other such cameras and the Internet in real-time, so there's always a backup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secrets are the handmaidens of evil, and governments have far too many. Of course, the end of privacy will also require a change of mindset among the general populace. We'll have to learn to be more forgiving. Everyone is prone to error. And if everyone's errors are on display, there won't be much of a society left if we condemn everyone harshly for every poor action.

       Something I wouldn't mind having explained is that if these sorts of events are "staged" and the people "actors" surely one of them would speak up at one point or another? Maybe one night they get too drunk, or suffer from a guilty conscience or whatever. You couldn't keep this many people quite for that long, someone has to crack.

       I enjoy conspiracy theories, and often think there is some truth to them, but this is where I feel a lot of them fall down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is stopping any one of these smiling "actors" from speaking up? Sure they know they would end up dead very quickly, but I imagine there would be at least one person with the balls to put their life on the line to expose this knowledge to the general public?

       The reason why there's no CCTV footage is because the shooting happened in another dimension, it's not reality. The Orlando shooting took place in another universe along with Sandy Hook, the Nice massacre, Baton Rouge (unless you believe one Marine took down 6 officers without strategic position) and countless other hoaxes. If they release CCTV footage it will prove that nothing happened. Americans don't care, if you tell them something happened then they believe it happened just because you told them it did. Luckily, I've convinced my family that it's a hoax. So I feel satisfied.

       All of those videos are fake LOL. I'm going to make a topic explaining why all of the videos are fake with copy and pastes of the hundreds of posts I already made and then link truth videos that expose the videos. I want someone to debunk it. It makes no sense in telling you why they're all fake right here, I need to make a topic. You're a damned fool.

       Which I saw your post and you clearly know nothing about anything medical
      </p>
      <p>
       Most those injuries are consistent with blunt force trauma (which is what a truck is considered) with flesh wounds by the metal. You wouldn't see "blood splatter" everywhere unless the truck reached more of the 40-45mph range and even then it'd only really come from the head hitting the truck or the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask about not seeing intestines everywhere. Unless there was something sharp to eviscerate the stomach, you wouldn't see intestines everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, a lot of injuries and even some of the deaths weren't even from the truck but from the stampedes of people going over one another to run.

       Fucking bullshit. Look up pictures of people ran over by trucks. They already said the truck was going at 40 mph you imbecile. People were supposed to get ran over by the tires. If they're ran over by tires I should be seeing intestines regardless off the speed. If there's not a single person ran over by the tires then it's automatically a hoax. If people were stampeded then they wouldn't be automatically dead like the dummies in the videos you retard. Please, spare me your bullshit. I've taken forensic classes, I know a staged crime scene when I see it.

       "Doesn't matter what speed"? Bullshit on that. Peole have gotten run over 20-30mph and walked away. The body is a mysterious thing, sometimes seemingly indestructible and other times fragile. It could only take a 160lb adult to step on your Cspine for you to die instantly. Which they could step two inches higher or lower and you'd be fine but sore.

       Are you mental? I'm saying if the tires hit them then it will rip their body apart regardless of the speed. Show me evidence of someone getting hit by a truck and walking away. These people got run over at 20-30 mph and they apparently died instantly, that's proof in itself that you're wrong. Also, show me evidence of the 160 lb shit because that's actually an extremely effective way of killing people that would lead to an impossible killer to catch. In all of my studies I have NEVER heard of such a case and I've studied the most famous and intelligent of serial killers as well as low level street criminals.

       I was a paramedic. All this shit is very possible. Doesn't meant it's reliable to occur every time. You could die by lodging something up your nose. Doesn't mean you should start attempting to kill people that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen people be hit by cars and walk away, hell even someone struck by a penske moving truck and had only a fractured wrist, all because the way they were facing and they way they were hit. I've also seen people be killed presumably instantly (I was a paramedic so didn't get the autopsy) at low speeds because their neck or head snapped causing serious brain bleeds, despite having no intestines hanging out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can save your breath. I'll be done responding at this point. Clearly impossible to have a conversation with someone who has zero clue what they are talking about, and feel the need to rant and rave about serial killers (completely irrelevant to this topic)

       I wonder if there is some island they take these people to live out the rest of their lives on?  You figure once they were paid off the government wouldn't want them mingling in with the rest of society.  There has to be some sorta witness protection type program they all go into afterwards.  My best guess?  Dead men tell no tales.

       A lot of shitty bars and what not don't run CCTV.   Or they have it but it's off, or there's no tape in, or something else stupid.  People who run bars are not world class thinkers, it might surprise you to know.

       The assertion that they are fake comes with it the burden of proof.  It's not on me to prove they are real.  Logic and probability dictate that they can't all be fake - but this is exactly what conspiracy theorist claim, often with the weakest of "evidence".  Something simple like missing CCTV footage is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       enough evidence to prove anything.
