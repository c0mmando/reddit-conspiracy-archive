       People look at news networks like fox and others and complain about whatever agenda they are pushing, and who they are endorsing, or what side they are on... But it's not about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those with the real agenda know that this speaks to a certain bunch, creating the demand for it, because this will have an audience, who feel strongly about this, and those who disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the key, its not about catering to loyalty, it's about creating sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people are divided, they are more susceptible to distractions, and when the people are distracted, it's easy to do whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been witnessed numerous times across many military operations, many attacks, many elections, many law changes, and so on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trivial events that have been nursed into  controversial topics are bled into the news to Capture headlines for the purpose to divide and as corny as this sounds, but ultimately conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the majority who are ignorant to this, but  the number is always enough to keep the wheel turning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing is, I don't see that wheel stopping any time soon.

       If you are worried about Melenia Trump's speech, then you are not thinking about how many Syrians were murdered by Hellfire missiles fired from unmanned aircraft. They push garbage on the mass media to keep up occupied with shit, so we don't have the time or energy to think about important things.

       Cultural marxism 101...divide the people up in any way possible to prevent them from forming powerful groups that can influence the socio-political landscape...cultural marxism 201...then create your own groups that give the masses the illusion of power when they are in fact being controlled and used for political purposes way beyond the petty concerns of the group. The Frankfurt School of cultural marxism is firmly embedded in the media at every level. Look it up...it's a real thing.

       Because they literally all push the exact same agenda.

       As opposed to simply having the RIGHT sides.
