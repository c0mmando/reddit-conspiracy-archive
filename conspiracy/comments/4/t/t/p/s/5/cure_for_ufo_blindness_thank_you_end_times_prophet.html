<p>The illuminati had brainwashed me. How many hours of my precious life did I waste with the Roswell &amp; alien garbage that the illuminati fed me all the years I was blind.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until after Last Prophet Matt Marriott exposed how the illuminati fooled millions by just using a simple computer program to let them believe that two planes crashed into the World Trade Center that I could see again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to admit that you wasted your time. It&#39;s the addiction mechanism that the illuminati use to keep the human cattle blind.</p>

<p>Because the longer you refuse to open your eyes, the more difficult it is to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe in God or evolution it is a testament to our own ego and ignorance to think that there isn&#39;t life out there in the universe.</p>

<p>If you believe in evolution, the sheer number of infinite stars with their own planets would give rise to life somewhere else.</p>

<p>If you believe in God, how small minded do you think he would be that he could only take care of one planet and guide a single story.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by thinking you know the truth of everything, because no one can ever know absolute truth. Constantly challenge your worldview. Take everything for a grain of salt. Absorb as much knowledge as you can. Look at many differing opinions. Finally, come to your own conclusions based on the filtering of thousands of sources.</p>

<p>&quot;The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>In one sentence: 10 out of 10 times life does not come from non-life.</p>

<p><strong>Evolution Theory - the illuminati&#39;s most important hoax and weapon for the destruction of the natural values.</strong></p>

<p>Religion is an explanation of who created all forms of life. There are two basic exclusive explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>God (creationism) or an accident (evolution theory).</li>
</ul>

<p>Believers are people that believe there is some evidence to prove that a religion is true. There are two types of believers:</p>

<ul>
<li>true (without doubts) and partial (with doubts).</li>
</ul>

<p>Believers without doubts are those who believe there&#39;s no evidence to prove that his or her religion is impossible. From my definitions we conclude that partial believers might believe in more than one religion.</p>

<p>Evidence proving that a particular religion is impossible leads (logically) to abandoning that religion. </p>

<p>I am a TRUE believer in God and YES, I do have a evidence. Plenty of evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In one sentence: 10 out of 10 times life does not come from non-life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay let&#39;s take this and expand on it. </p>

<p>All of the elements are different levels of energy based on the varying types of subatomic particles that make them up.</p>

<p>Different elements can be combined together to created molecules of varying complexity. We know this because we can manipulate chemistry to create different things.</p>

<p>The building blocks of life, RNA (and eventually DNA), are made out of combinations of molecules.</p>

<p>You are saying that the sheer odds of this coming together are impossible and that life could not start on its own, but let me ask you a more fundamental question.</p>

<p>If &quot;10 out of 10 times life does not come from non-life.&quot;, then how does energy (The stuff that makes up everything) come from nothing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Time to get the 10 KEY facts about God, known ever since Day 1</strong></p>

<p>1) God is the <strong>creator of all forms of life</strong>.</p>

<p>2) God is the <strong>creator of the Universe</strong>.</p>

<p>3) God is <strong>omnipotent</strong>.</p>

<p>4) God is <strong>omnipresent</strong>.</p>

<p>5) God is <strong>omniscient</strong>.</p>

<p>6) God created <strong>all forms of life perfect</strong>.</p>

<p>7) God created <strong>only one of those forms with Free Will</strong>.</p>

<p>8) God will <strong>judge each Human</strong> for what he did with his Free Will.</p>

<p>9) God will <strong>judge Humankind</strong> for what they did with God&#39;s Creation on Earth. That day has been known as Final Judgement Day, the last of the LAST DAYS. The last day for Mankind on Earth.</p>

<p>One of the KEY questions is the apparent contradiction between fact #5 (God is omniscient) and #7 (God gave Free Will to Humans).</p>

<p>Not a contradiction but a consequence of one more fact, that was proved from day 1 to the first of the FINAL DAYS:</p>

<p>10) God created Humans <strong>without the capacity to have ANY glimpse into the HOW for ANY of those nine facts</strong>.</p>

<p>There is only ONE new fact ever since. Something that was predicted to happen only in the LAST DAYS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>UFOs &amp; Co, like most illuminati cover-ups, are multi-purpose weapons</strong></p>

<p>Step 1. - Their mass media serves just as much UFO stuff as needed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to keep the naive wasting their time on the subject;</p></li>
<li><p>while letting the less naive understand it&#39;s a cheap forgery.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2. - To confuse the less naive the illuminati use agents that are in charge of propagating certain facts that don&#39;t make it to the mass media but nevertheless are quite obvious, adding to those facts a good dosage of UFO &amp; Co stuff. This has the effect to discredit those obvious facts in the eyes of the less naive.</p>

<p>Step 3. - When the less naive read these kind of stories, that any person able to add and multiply understand, once again the illuminati agents suggest that the authors must be UFO believers. Again this proves to be a very efficient weapon in keeping the less naive from understanding these simple facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>&quot;Brainwash children and naive with UFOs&quot; agenda: Measure how important it is with Larry King and Wikipedia</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<em>The UFO cover-up by Mainstream Media</em>&quot; is now one of the subjects where the Web of Disinformation became totally useless, since as explained first by Matt Marriott, the &quot;serious&quot; illuminati media now pushes that agenda to the utter limits.</p>

<p>The lengths to which &quot;Larry King Live&quot; &amp; Co will go to sell it or how quick the illuminati censorship will delete it from Wikipedia - two equivalent thermometers to measure how important the subject is to advance the illuminati agenda. (1)</p>

<p>Confirm how important the illuminati &quot;brainwash naive with UFOs&quot; agenda is: <strong>how quickly did the illuminati censorship delete the truth?</strong> (2)</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<p>(1) Roswell UFO crash &amp; alien autopsy celebrated with illuminati joke at Fox News Channel 2007 to CNN&#39;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; 2008: repeating the old record the illuminati media has been playing for more than 70 years.</p>

<p>(2) Deleted after how long? The text added to Wikipedia:</p>

<p><strong>===Allegations of government propaganda to convince naive===</strong></p>

<p><strong>Matt Marriott in 1998-2007 published a series of articles claiming that the secret society controlling the political system in the US and the EU is responsible for keeping naive segments of the population interested in aliens. The strategy would be:</strong></p>

<p><strong>- the government releases material, e.g. faked photos, supposedly to be previously classified.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- the controlled mass media, in particular tabloids but also &quot;serious&quot; shows like Larry King Live, suggests a government cover-up of evidence and print hoaxed material as possible proof. There will be no broadcast of any documentary debunking all the hoaxes used to suggest sightings of aliens spacecraft, i.e.</strong> <strong><em>reminding the public that there is no verifiable UFO evidence whatsoever.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>- iconic &quot;scientists&quot;, e.g. Stephen Hawking [to Michio Kaku and Neil deGrasse Tyson], repeat how high is the probability of aliens visiting Earth.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- last and most important, since the main audience, children, is the most important target segment for anchoring the belief in UFO sightings: Hollywood and TV series relentlessly produce movies suggesting extraterrestrial contacts.</strong></p>
