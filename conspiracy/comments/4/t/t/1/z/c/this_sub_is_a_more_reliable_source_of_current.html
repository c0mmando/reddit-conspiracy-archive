    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this today before reading this post. I was all like &quot;man I haven&#39;t visited world news or news subs since I subscribed here. </p>

<p>That being said this subreddit has also caused me a lot of anxiety. I&#39;m finding it difficult lately to cope with life and the direction the world is going. The Nice attacks in France really fucked with me. I mean the graphic videos I shouldn&#39;t have watched really fucked with my mind. </p>

<p>I just have a really bad feeling about the remainder of 2016 and beyond. Nothing is what it seems. This recent air strike in Syria killing 140 innocents made me think. We are all watching our leaders murder and pillage from afar and there is nothing we can do about it. I feel so helpless and can&#39;t help but think this is all going to eventually hit home. </p>

<p>I tell you right now when shit hits the fan I am packing up and going camping in northern Canada for a few years. Just can&#39;t handle it anymore </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only answer to all of this lies in your ability to focus alone on your emotions and bringing the battle back to the objective feelings rather than their source.  Once you are able to take care of that then the knowledge you are acquiring can further expand the options of what is real rather than overwrite previous thoughts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all go through that. It&#39;s sort of like going through the stages of death acceptance, there&#39;s an anger, bargaining and acceptance phases.

<p>We all benefit when people start doubting more, and being more critical of mainstream information, and looking at alternative sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. On the bright side, at work my day goes by super fast because im just thinking about everything trying to decypher whats actually happening rather than looking back and forth at the clock!</p>

<p>Ive had anxiety my whole life so its nothing new. Just the live videos of the Nice, France attack really hit home for me being Canadian. This shit is going to hit home eventually and when it does i will have a sign that simply says &quot;Not in my name&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it gets too overwhelming, take a break. Avoid the news, social media, and conspiracy forums for awhile, and use the time to relax. Spend some time outdoors, read a book, visit some friends; whatever you decide, make it sure it doesn&#39;t involve dwelling on bad news. I guarantee you will feel recharged and regain some perspective on the things in your life that truly matter.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been into conspiracy theories most of my life. I&#39;m not ashamed to admit that I&#39;ve had to take long breaks from the news and conspiracy forums in order to maintain my mental health. The world does not deserve our emotional sacrifices. Take a break and focus on the things that truly matter in your life. It helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its almost addictive. My escape is video games and music. I make music to soothe my soul and play games to take out my anger! lol. Whatever works right!</p>

<p>Ive also been into conspiracies my whole life but this subreddit changed a few perspectives. Before this subreddit it was casually  watching conspiracy documentaries and what not, this sub is just 24/7 every 10 minutes new evidence to another conspiracy is posted lol. And they are all current conspiracies that are directly affecting the entire world around us as we speak. Its very troubling man!</p>

<p>Then you have debunking of terrorists events yet in the same breath they are anti Islam because terrorism.</p>

<p>The worst was this week when the whole sub was running with Turkish coup as an inside job just like the rest of reddit and the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Sometimes however you get the odd one or two postings that are on point, there is less censorship than anywhere else and you get a much wider variety of topics that no one else would dare discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly would not classify Trump as being nearly as bad as Clinton. To look at how Trump will run his presidency you have to focus on his VP. Trump is just 100% publicity. That&#39;s it thats all. When people have low intelligence they follow whoever they see the most. America is full of folks with very low intelligence thanks to the whole fluoride and lead in the water thing!</p>

<p>If Trump is actually running for President, which i dont think he is...But if he is, he has run a genius campaign. Like it has been pure genius! He is a shitbag cuntface prick but he is a master at appealing to the masses of dumb fucks across America. It&#39;s actually unreal how well his &quot;Publicity stunts first, politics second&quot; approach has got him the support he has.</p>

<p>If you are a republican who thinks the government is your friend by keeping drugs out of your hands and watching you pee so that they can determine heuristically whether or not they should advertise Depends to you, (erm: &#39;Depend&#39;), while taking your taxes to kill your kids in the desert in the name of honor which is really for enriching halliburton and raytheons&#39;s shareholders wealth, using your kids overseas to guard the producers of the drugs you aren&#39;t allowed to have and/or for pharma companies, then you&#39;ll probably not like my posts one bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the points you made are precisely all that&#39;s good and holy about this sub. The fact that you have hyper-critical knit-pickers with opposing views on pretty much everything is exactly what ensures everything is picked apart and critical thinking gets applied to everything. Sure there are people pushing agendas, but when the posts aren&#39;t super ridiculous, the community is a somewhat self-policing watchdog. That it contains contributors biased in every direction is crucial to meaningful function and analysis of events. </p>

<p>There are certainly some BS agenda pushing baseless posts daily, but they usually don&#39;t get much traction, and when they do, you get an indicator of other users&#39; credibility. Just have to look at the big picture and stay critical. </p>

<p>Totally agree with your points, just another way of looking at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One hope i really have is that the military is on the side of the people. But...brainwash. What the world needs is for our military folks to wake the fuck up and refuse orders. We need police officers to put down their riot shields and pick up signs. We need to abolish the IMF asap and implement a government controlled system. </p>

<p>The solutions are so obvious but the media has everyone completely brainwashed man. Like i dont know how to get through to people. Too many people are content with their lives and dont understand it is about to get flipped upside down on them. A large portion of Americans have lost all forms of empathy due to media brainwash. A bombing in Syria killing 140 civilians is just the norm on the news at this point. </p>

<p>Ill tell what really scares me. The Obama Administration appears to be pushing to disarm America while at the same time instigating world war 3. It just doesnt make sense unless there is an evil fucking treasonous plot behind it all. I mean who removes the defenses of their civilians and starts a war at the same time? It doesnt make any sense not even considering how fragile the global economy is currently.</p>

<p>The best (or should I saw the only) info I got was that the bars here will have a much later last call during the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly true.  Some of it <em>is</em> though censored by downvote brigades.  If you complain, people will say, &#39;well your post wasn&#39;t that good&#39;, and then over time, you&#39;ll start to see comments like &#39;wow another underrated post&#39;...&#39;this is the best post ever, i wonder why it has such low karma&#39;</p>

<p>Or anything related to freemasons, jesuits, jehovah&#39;s witness conspiracies, any legit and not horseapples conspiracies related to monarchs; or even anything related to Hillary that has not yet been hit by the mainstream....all those get downvoted to nothing also.  And yet, you know that people here are <em>quite</em> interested in new muck dug up on Hillary.</p>

<p>And anything related to </p>
