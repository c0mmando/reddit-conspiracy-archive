    <div class="md"><p>I been collecting non-perishable food items and i feel a lot better about things now. A massive 8kg bag of rice is only 5$ here. Been buyin a couple a week for a while now. Should have enough rice for years if i dont get robbed. Was actually thinking about burying some in my back yard lmao. Call me paranoid that my fellow man wont want to try and jack my rice.</p>

<p>Honestly we are at a point in time where we cannot take our essentials for granted. Last weekend i bought a bad ass Axe, a compass, a filet knife and a fishing rod! I plan to keep adding to it just in case there comes a time where i have to survive off the grid which keeps looking more and more likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most dangerous myth of all, is the idea that taxes fund government spending.</p>

<p>We are literally living in a post-scarcity economy, the shops are filled with food, robots do most of the heavy lifting and we have enough building materials to house everyone.</p>

<p>But why are we so miserable and zombie like?</p>

<p>Ignoring more obvious conclusions like poisoned food, internet addiction and lack of physical exercise, there is a huge economic burden that has been placed on our shoulders which for the most part goes unnoticed.</p>

<h1>TAXES</h1>

<p>What is money? Well, the next time you watch a basketball game and you see the points go up every time a team scores, think of money. </p>

<p>Just as the numbers on the scoreboard can be changed at will by the stadium managers, the numbers on our deposit accounts can be changed at will by the currency issuer, allowing for all legal/accounting procedures of course.</p>

<p>When the government spends, the money supply increases, when the government collects tax, the money supply <a href="http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf">decreases.</a>
(page 14)</p>

<p>So what are the implications of all this?</p>

<p>Well we are being taxed to death. Not only do we pay income tax, but we pay taxes in more hidden/covert ways. </p>

<p>Interest payments, corporation tax and toll fees are all examples of secret taxes, and remember, even if you personally don&#39;t pay any tax, you still suffer from the <strong>loss of economic activity caused by taxation.</strong></p>

<p>Taxes do NOT fund spending and they are only imposed on us to impoverish humanity.</p>

<p>The only taxes a country needs are taxes on exporters, as this allows the central bank to acquire foreign currency.</p>

<p>But domestic taxation is absolutely without justification...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much this!</p>

<p>I just read a decent article talking about how what if money was unlimited? Then it goes on to say...IT IS! The only real problem is we dont have a system in place to deal with it properly. It CAN work, you just need to rethink the entire system. You also need to convince our Lord Almighty Federal Reserve to make changes benefiting the people. They totally have a history of that!</p>

<p>My other thought on taxes...Income tax to me is theft. I never signed up for this shit. I never gave any sort of consent to take money directly out of my pocket. IF there is going to be taxes it should be 100% on consumption. Spend more? you pay more taxes. Spend less? You pay less taxes. This makes so much more sense compared to our current confusing convoluted different income bracket system of bullshit theft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No upvotes?! This is the reason behind ALL the injustices! THIS IS WHAT AUTHORIZED DICTATORSHIP IN DEMOCRATIC NATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD. LOOK HERE. READ ME. This should be top of the page.</p>

<p>State of Emergency loopholes in MOST countries around the world which authorize the dilution and deprivation of the rights of the citizenry as well as the use of military force against the domestic populace; all separation of powers are usurped and given to the commander-in-chief in each country, which is essentially a dictatorship.</p>

<p>For example, the U.S. has been in a perpetual &#39;state of emergency&#39; since at least 1979, which is what authorized the mandatory military draft (revoking our freedom of choice), the clampdown of the civil rights movements of the 1960s, 1990s, and of current event as well as the use of FBIs illegal activities outlines in OPERATION COINTELPRO, which involved the infiltration and sabotage or discrediting of political movements in the U.S.; the state of emergency legislation is also what authorized the use of military gun confiscation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the anti-privacy surveillance laws, and most other U.S. injustices of the past century, such as the war on drugs.</p>

<p>The same tactics were used in the Weimar Republic during WW2 as well as by the KGB in the Soviet Union in the 1990s which is now referred to as &#39;War of Laws&#39; (look it up) which led to the 1991 Coup, the 1993 Constitutional Crisis, and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union due to &quot;confusion of law&quot;. All NATO nations are imposed by these laws, as well as dozens of other countries, which, again has loopholes which authorize dictatorship when given the pre-text to declare emergencies, however most countries abuse this by manufacturing the pre-text to declare an emergency in order to continue abusing human and civil rights of the populace as well as to war on the municipalities to put them in debt to the centralized governments (during state of emergencies the commander-in-chief can charge whatever costs he/she deems necessary to the local region facing the emergency without approval by the citizenry).</p>

<p>Most abuses of the rights of the public in most major countries across the earth stem from these state of emergency loopholes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really kills me is the pharma conspiracy - almost everyone I know is on some kind of psych drug, and all of these drugs can have violent/suicidal side effects when mixed with other drugs/alcohol, when too much is prescribed, or when withdrawing.</p>

<p>If you do a close reading on pretty much every murder-suicide, every mass shooting/axe-wielding/truck or car running through crowds, these meds are involved.</p>

<p>But because so many people are already on them, or make money off them, or get campaign/research/etc contributions from their makers, or just are ignorant (which is ridiculous, the side effects are well-documented and even included in these meds&#39; documentation!), we just sit back and blame guns, terrorists, hothead cops, crazy people, etc. while people continue to die.</p>

<p>(Also, so many drugs have psych effects that shouldn&#39;t - Tamiflu, anti-epilepsy drugs, nerve pain drugs, etc.)</p>

Who disarms their country while instigating a World War at the same time? All while the economy is being propped up with a toothpick. I have this idea that American people have been sold.

<p>To me it seems the exterior &quot;space walks&quot; were filmed under water in NASA&#39;s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (pool) as it is outfitted with chroma key blue screen over all the gear in the pool so as to superimpose the backdrop of the distorted earth imagery; the laboratory even has a television studio control room where they film the space walk illusion. It is very plausible that the interior shots aboard I.S.S. are filmed under high magnetic field on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much this!</p>

<p>I just read a decent article talking about how what if money was unlimited? Then it goes on to say...IT IS! The only real problem is we dont have a system in place to deal with it properly. It CAN work, you just need to rethink the entire system. You also need to convince our Lord Almighty Federal Reserve to make changes benefiting the people. They totally have a history of that!</p>

<p>My other thought on taxes...Income tax to me is theft. I never signed up for this shit. I never gave any sort of consent to take money directly out of my pocket. IF there is going to be taxes it should be 100% on consumption. Spend more? you pay more taxes. Spend less? You pay less taxes. This makes so much more sense compared to our current confusing convoluted different income bracket system of bullshit theft.</p>
