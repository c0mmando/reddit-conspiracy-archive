       Watch this video. Notice how from 0:07 to 0:14 none of the clouds in the bottom left corner are affected by the shockwave of the nuclear blast.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all simply stay in the same place, evidence that this video is a composite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't the explosion cause the clouds to move, by compressing/pushing the surrounding air?

       I think the clouds were much higher than the blast. Given a few more seconds I imagine you might have seen an effect on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW I wasn't aware that the existence of nuclear weapons was questioned by anyone. I've never seen one go off, but if they didn't  exist it would be very hard to explain the end of the war in the Pacific and the following 5 decades of US/USSR relationship.

       The clouds are higher than the blast yes. But the pressure wave from the explosion should still move the clouds by a considerable degree.

       Not until the blast wave hits. Blast waves IIRC move at the speed of sound which at sea level is around 340 m/s. If the clouds were at an altitude of just 3000 m the blast wave would have taken 8 point something seconds to hit them. Even more due to the fact that the speed of sound decreases with altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a super skeptical person, but never once have I considered that nuclear weapons were faked.

       My point is that even if the blast wave itself doesn't hit the clouds, all the air around the explosion should
       <em>
        push
       </em>
       the clouds, and yet even that doesn't happen.

       The blast wave
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the energy of the explosion as it expands outwards. Nothing before the blast wave will affect the clouds. The blast compresses the air around it, and this compressed air expands outwards, at the speed of sound, transmitting the force of the blast.

       It's due to a combination of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiroshima was an air burst, meaning much less radioactive fallout. I can't say off the top of my head what Nagasaki was, but I doubt it was a lay-down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bombs used were almost microscopic in the grand scheme of nuclear weapon design. All the claims made about radiation warnings and such back in the cold war were made on the assumptions that the average size of the nukes would be in the range of 50-100 times stronger than either bomb used in WW2.
Both sides fielded weapons several hundred times stronger as standard, and it was these that people were worried about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chernobyl is a completely different and incomparable situation, and you're showing a lack of comprehension of such when you use it in an argument.

       I don't usually bother posting to reddit (can you guess why?) but anyway some of you with long attention spans might like to watch 'Lords of the Nukes', here:--
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHjohmgOh2M">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHjohmgOh2M
       </a>
       It explains the Manhattan project and Jews, the reality behind the Cuba crisis, Jewish spies supposedly giving valuable secrets to 'the Russians' (i.e. Stalin), Vanunu, scares such as EMP bombs, the 'Doomsday Bomb', radiation deaths.  And an understanding of so-called nuclear power. And how the Hiroshima bombs were faked (real b/w footage!), why the Japanese surrender was ignored until the hoax decision was made, what happened with the 'Lucky Dragon', a Japanese fishing boat supposedly caught by radiation, and how it was used. And plenty more, such as why Stalin pretended (or was told) that the USSR had an H-bomb, and how the media's lies were backed up by censorship in Japan.  Only if you'd like your mental map of reality to be more true.  Lots of pictures, film, video, books, illustrations, drawings and explanations. Even cartoons. Complete with running book-style headings and descriptions, so parts you remember can be relocated.

       I've seen a lot of questionable footage of supposed nuclear bomb footage. The explosions are on such a massive scale, yet certain things don't add up, that it's hard to know what to believe.

       OP, why do you insist on making these posts? Literally every single time you ask the most ridiculous question and then act like a video is evidence because you don't understand it. "Are atoms a hoax" "is war a hoax" etc, you seem to think everything in existence is a hoax, go take some physics lessons or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, nothing about that was suspicious in the slightest, those clouds are very far away but look close due to lens compression, they have to be using like a 2000mm lens on a plane 10 miles away to video it, it's not possible to judge distances like that.

       Ok, whatever you say, doesn't change the fact that the OP thought war was fake because of a video that showed soldiers shooting at people a couple of miles away too small to show up on camera. That is just his recent post, decided the look through his history to see the other ridiculous shit he said and he has made several threads with the same claims and was shut down by people, he's been told several times that him not understanding a video doesn't make it a hoax and he continues to think it does, I'm guessing logic is a hoax? I don't care about whatever conspiracy theories you believe or whatever but the OP's doesn't have theories, it's just complete stupidity.

       Do you disagree with general smedley butler? Do you think you know more about what goes on in war than a general? If a general says that war is a racket; a illegal or dishonest scheme then it is... So we have established that we are lied to about wars. where we go from there could get pretty weird. The truth is classified.

       I couldn't give a fucking shit about what some cunt of a general said and I couldn't give a fuck if war is a racket, even if it is that doesn't mean it's fake no matter how many delusions you have about it, and what about all those other generals? I guess they are just paid off right and somehow aren't telling the truth?. Regardless I am talking about the OP here but the fact that you need to inject your ridiculous concepts into this only really proves deep down you know your full of shit.

       I mean i know this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       but i would assume people would have an even high school level understanding of physics. More than half of what you all state as things that bother you about footage can literally ALL be explained if you just read a textbook, there are literally uncountable volumes of texts regarding not only the chemistry and physics of nuclear detonations but on the aerodynamic and local aerospace effects of them. You all make yourselves look actually by definition STUPID by making such huge statements about things being false, based upon your own Ignorance on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       TO OP, there is no displacement of anything untill the blast itself hits it. In your video can you point out even one time that shows the blast hitting clouds, the footage lingering and showing clouds not moving? no, because you lack a basic understanding of what you are criticizing. Go read a book friend, really.
