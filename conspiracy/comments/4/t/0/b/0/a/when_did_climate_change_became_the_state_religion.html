    <div class="md"><p>Have you bothered to look into the science at all? It&#39;s absurdly simple physics at base. The reason the dummies who pretend climate change isn&#39;t happening are called &quot;deniers&quot; is that there is such an incredibly huge amount of data confirming anthropogenic climate change that a person truly has to be in <em>denial</em> to ignore its existence. Same with the holocaust, which is why holocaust deniers are deserving of the same label.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I say that? No. I said the <em>basic physics</em> behind it is absurdly simple. The greenhouse effect is something a high schooler could understand, even on a quantitative level. It&#39;s sad that most deniers don&#39;t even do the basic work to figure out the underlying mechanism to the thing they so strongly believe is fake. From an understanding of the greenhouse effect, the basic idea of &quot;more CO2 --&gt; warmer surface temps&quot; is revealed to be physically inevitable. Then things get more complicated what with all of the other fun variables involved, but that basic physics is undeniable and very simple.</p>

Of course if you look back millions of years to periods during which many, many other aspects of the atmosphere were different, there won&#39;t be a clear correlation.

    <div class="md"><p>haha obviously you meant something other than you wrote. Whatever bro, I think your high school physics is being slightly overtaxed. You go on calling anyone with a different opinion a denier because your grasp of the &quot;simple physics&quot; behind climate science is obviously so superior. I can tell from our brief interaction you have done almost no research or reading on the subject and that you have certainly never studied physics in any meaningful way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the condescension, but it&#39;s misplaced. I&#39;ll admit to only being an undergrad, but I&#39;m studying Geophysical Sciences at one of the most rigorous universities in the world currently. I&#39;ve got college physics through Quantum Mechanics under my belt, I&#39;m currently conducting research with a well-respected professor on developing models of the early thermal evolution of asteroids (specifically how the porosity in meteorite parent bodies changes over time as they accumulate more mass and internal pressures increase), I&#39;ve taken several atmospheric/earth science classes, I read the textbook &quot;Global Warming&quot; by David Archer (a professor with over 10,000 citations) purely out of interest in the subject, and I helped Archer proofread the code he uses in his MOOC on Coursera that&#39;s intended to teach people the fundamentals of global warming. I&#39;m not trying to claim that I&#39;m an expert (far from it), but I definitely know something about the science behind global warming, and I&#39;ll reiterate: the physics of the greenhouse effect is very simple. Increase the concentration of a greenhouse gas, and you bounce more of the infrared radiation that the earth is emitting back at the earth. This knocks the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation for the planet out of whack, and the earth&#39;s temperature has to increase until it&#39;s emitting enough radiation to be in balance again. Simple simple simple. There&#39;s room for debate about what the effects of the temperature increase will be, as there are a lot of not-well-characterized feedback loops that could change things up, but the fact that earth&#39;s temperature is increasing is truly not up for debate anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude do you actually have any arguments against the validity of climate change? Or do you just blindly deny it because &quot;the gummint&quot;? You really don&#39;t come off like you know shit about what you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;d imagine that your complete lack of an education in science kind of hurts your ability to have an informed opinion on this issue. Also, I thought it was funny that I proved you completely wrong about my level of &quot;meaningful research&quot; into the area and you still clung to your first notion about my ignorance. You&#39;d think that, being such a skeptical, critical thinker, you&#39;d revise your viewpoints as new information was introduced. Like, doesn&#39;t it give you pause that almost every single person who actually bothers to rigorously learn the science behind the claims about climate change comes out accepting that it&#39;s a reality? Do you really think you know more about the atmosphere than basically every single PhD holder in any physical science? That strikes me as such an arrogant and, to be honest, hilarious opinion to hold of yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah-the old frame it as &quot;people deny climate change&quot; gambit..</p>

<p>No one who seriously looks and writes about climate change denies it exists. That is just dumb.</p>

<p>The climate changes all the time. Just stop.</p>

<p>We all understand what a feedback loop is and how it works. But this is by no means where the discussion ends..  </p>

<p>The point is, are manmade CO2 concentrations making the planet warm and if so, should anything be done about it.</p>

<p>Be warned this is going to be long...</p>

<p><strong>The ice cores show that CO2 lags temperature</strong> 
<a href="http://joannenova.com.au/2009/12/carbon-rises-800-years-after-temperatures/">http://joannenova.com.au/2009/12/carbon-rises-800-years-after-temperatures/</a></p>

<p><strong>CO2 is miniscule in amount and water vapor already absorbs most of spectrum that CO2 would absorb.</strong>  <a href="http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/595px-atmospheric_transmission.png">http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/595px-atmospheric_transmission.png</a></p>

<p><strong>CO2 had already saturated its heat trapping effects long before human industry.  More CO2 would have absolutely negligible effects on the greenhouse effect.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nature Acknowledges &quot;The Pause&quot;, says Oceans May Act As Negative Feedbacks, Models Wrong, Future Global Warming May Be Overestimated</strong>
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-the-case-of-the-missing-heat-1.14525">http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-the-case-of-the-missing-heat-1.14525</a></p>

<p><strong>Is global warming exceeding natural climate variability?</strong> </p>

<p>No.
<a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image0024.png">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image0024.png</a></p>

<p><strong>Is consensus among climate experts scientific?</strong></p>

<p>No. And there isn’t one anyway. A recent paper by paid propagandists trying to prove that there was a consensus inadvertently proved that there was not. Cook et al. (2013) claimed that 97.1% of 11,944 papers on “global climate change” endorsed the consensus, which they defined in their introduction as the “scientific consensus” that “most current warming” is anthropogenic. However, setting aside the fact that there has been no “current warming” for getting on for two embarrassing decades, the authors’ own data file shows that they had marked only 64 papers out of 11,944, a dizzying 0.5%, as endorsing the “consensus”.</p>

<p><strong>Are we all guilty of increasing CO2 concentration?</strong></p>

<p>No, not necessarily. True, our emissions of CO2 and its atmospheric concentration are rising, but anthropogenic CO2 represents only 3% of the total free CO2 in the Earth-atmosphere system. But in logic – it cannot be repeated often enough – mere correlation does not necessary imply causation.</p>

<p>Professor Murry Salby, late of Macquarie University, Australia, has established that it is the time-integral of temperature changes that causes changes in CO2 concentration, leaving little or no room for any detectable anthropogenic contribution. He is not alone in his findings. If he is right, there is no need to posit any role for CO2 or other anthropogenic influences. On that analysis, climate sensitivity may well be zero. <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image006_thumb2.jpg?w=304&amp;amp;h=220">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image006_thumb2.jpg?w=304&amp;amp;h=220</a></p>

<p><strong>Is CO2 concentration rising to dangerous new levels?</strong></p>

<p>No. Mr Bailey says CO2 concentration is 30% higher than the 800,000-year peak. So what? <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image0104.png">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image0104.png</a></p>

<p><strong>Will greenhouse-gas emissions cause much warming?</strong></p>

<p>No – and, on the evidence to date, certainly not as much as the IPCC predicted. <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image012_thumb4.png?w=603&amp;amp;h=277">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image012_thumb4.png?w=603&amp;amp;h=277</a></p>

<p>Near-term projections of warming at a rate equivalent to 2.8 [1.9, 4.2] K/century, made with “substantial confidence” in IPCC (1990), for the 303 months January 1990 to March 2015 (orange region and red trend line), vs. observed anomalies (dark blue) and trend (bright blue) at less than 1.4 K/century equivalent, taken as the mean of the RSS and UAH satellite monthly mean lower-troposphere temperature anomalies.</p>

<p><strong>Do temperature feedbacks amplify direct CO2 warming?</strong></p>

<p>No. Measurements suggest feedbacks are negative, attenuating direct CO2 warming. <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image014_thumb4.png?w=541&amp;amp;h=410">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image014_thumb4.png?w=541&amp;amp;h=410</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, the range of mean global surface temperature change over the past 810,000 years was just 3.5 Cº either side of the long-run average – about the same as the range of temperatures permitted by an ordinary household thermostat. It is difficult to alter the Earth’s temperature, because the atmosphere is sandwiched between two vast heat-sinks: the oceans below and outer space above. <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image016_thumb4.png?w=579&amp;amp;h=438">http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/clip_image016_thumb4.png?w=579&amp;amp;h=438</a></p>

<p>Global surface temperature change over the past 810,000 years, obtained by halving (to correct the result for polar amplification) the temperature anomalies inferred from atmospheric δ18O ratios in ice cores from Vostok station, Antarctica. Absolute global temperature has varied by little more than ±1%.</p>

<p><strong>Will warmer worldwide weather be dangerous?</strong></p>

<p>No. A growing body of papers in the literature finds climate sensitivity low – about 1 Cº per CO2 doubling. That is not enough to be harmful.</p>

<p>And this last one is big..</p>

<p><strong>CO2 has never driven climate.</strong>
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11659-climate-myths-ice-cores-show-co2-increases-lag-behind-temperature-rises-disproving-the-link-to-global-warming/">https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11659-climate-myths-ice-cores-show-co2-increases-lag-behind-temperature-rises-disproving-the-link-to-global-warming/</a></p>

<p>The question is why, in the teeth of the scientific and economic evidence, nearly all of the global governing class were so easily taken in or bought out or both by the strange coalescence of powerful vested interests who have, until now, profited so monstrously by the biggest fraud in history at such crippling expense in lives and treasure to the rest of us, and at such mortal threat to the integrity and trustworthiness of science itself.</p>
