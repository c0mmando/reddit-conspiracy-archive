       And you don’t fucking get it at all. They’re not dividing people of disparate groups. They’re dividing people within the SAME GROUP. They want EVERYONE to come together, forcibly, and they can’t do that if we’re divided along PROPER, SCIENTIFIC, GENETIC LINES as things should be.

        how is that happening?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Phase 1: Cultural marxist indoctrination of children in all schools. Children are taught to hate their own culture and that they are the “oppressor” and the world is the victim, merely because they are white.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 2: A coalition of minorities, communists, and radical feminists in every white country achieves a 50.1% majority and therefore a lock on political power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 3: With their tenuous lock on political power, they will import minorities from around the world who will automatically vote for more left policies and more immigration. Political hold on power is now solidified and guaranteed. This part must be accomplished quickly (due to inevitable backlash). You can see that this is happening right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 4: Now that whites can no longer exercise political power in any of their countries, they will be slowly stripped of all the rights guaranteed to every other country under the UN. They will not be allowed to defend themselves if attacked (already happening), they will be seen by the criminal justice system as the “oppressor” in any situation, they will not be allowed to school their own children, “racism” will be outlawed, freedom of speech outlawed, police forces will be federalized so that white people can longer protect their own communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 5: White countries/communities are so weakened that open genocide begins. There’s no longer any way to stop it because whites are a minority, or at least whites who wish to remain a race to themselves, are a minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~:~
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1. Question and minimize the statistics.
       </strong>
       “Whites are the majority in white countries; their population is going up, not down.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2. Attack the motivations of the truth-tellers.
       </strong>
       “These are just crazy claims by white supremacists and racists.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3. Claim that the deaths were inadvertent.
       </strong>
       “There is no coordinated plan to eliminate the white race. That is just a conspiracy theory.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        4. Emphasize the strangeness of the victims.
       </strong>
       “White people have historically enjoyed disproportionate social privileges. Now their countries are becoming just like the rest of the world.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        5. Rationalize the deaths as the result of tribal conflict.
       </strong>
       “White people are just worried that they will no longer enjoy the privileges of being an ethnic majority.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        6. Blame ‘out of control’ forces for committing the killings.
       </strong>
       “Most immigrants are peaceful and hard working. Islamic extremism is a very small minority and does not represent the immigrant population.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        7. Avoid antagonizing the genocidists, who might walk out of the ‘peace process’.
       </strong>
       “Reconciliation is the first step toward solving issues of race in the West. We must learn to live together.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        8. Justify denial in favor of current economic interests.
       </strong>
       “Immigrants are crucial to our economic recovery. Immigrants perform jobs most people do not want and spend money that helps grow the economy.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        9. Claim that the victims are receiving good treatment.
       </strong>
       “White people today are still well above average in terms of education and financial success.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        10. Claim that what is going on does not fit the definition of genocide.
       </strong>
       “Mass immigration is not the same as genocide. Genocide is the destruction of a people.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        11. Blame the victims.
       </strong>
       “White people should atone for their history of racism and privilege. Accepting refugees and immigrants from less fortunate countries is crucial to this process.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        12. Say that peace and reconciliation are more important than blaming people for genocide.
       </strong>
       “The most important thing is that people from all cultures can learn to live together peacefully. There is no reason for a crazy ‘white genocide’ witch hunt.”

       I think I figured it out, whether you realize it or not you're so idiotic and distasteful in general that I think God must have put you here to be an example of what everyone else should never be. All I can say is Bravo, you're like a martyr by accident.

      <p>
       When future children look back in time and see you telling random people they're on the wrong side of history they will know in their innocent little hearts that you are in fact the textbook definition of what was wrong with America.

      <p>
       I believe that you are quite literally too stupid to understand the logical and compassionate side of Eugenics. It isn't about creating a carbon copy "master race" but an idea that all genes are important and we should use them to achieve absolute health in all individuals. Then when we are more responsible we can get into the superpower aspect, but that's probably not going to be an option for us any time soon. I guess until then we'll all continue bickering about stupid topics until we drop dead and make room for the innocent.

       So you're saying your not a polite person and don't want to be polite? This leads into why I created the post in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       People might be right but you can still be polite in letting other people know and help them understand, if they aren't receptive to that, then let the conversation go, but you don't have to be rude.

      <p>
       You also don't think there is a divide in society?

       Mongrelization: to subject (a breed, group, etc.) to crossbreeding, especially with one considered inferior. What are you talking about?

       Ah then he definitely doesn't get it AT ALL! It seems that he believes in God and if the bible is correct we all came from Noah and race isn't real because where we come from.

       Race doesn't exist we are all human. It's our environment that creates these seemly divisions. If I lived in a tropical place, I don't think I would be a pasty white person...

       Black Americans are a hybrid race of around 22% white ancestry. (17) This 22% ancestry is the cause of multiple negative health effects due to genetic incompatibility. Indeed, consistent with Haldane’s Rule, unmixed blacks from Africa and white Americans do not have the same rate of birth problems that hybrid American blacks have: “In 2005, the mortality rate for black infants was 4.4 times higher than that of white infants… African women who come to the United States and have babies experience the same low rate of infant deaths as white American mothers.” John R. Baker, in his book Race, says, “Indiscriminate interbreeding between distinct forms, whether ‘species’ or markedly different races, is not generally beneficial. The defect may show in a change in the sex-ratio of the offspring, probably caused by the early abortion of members of one sex, generally the male in the case of mammals.” LTA4H, or “leukotriene A4 hydrolase” is found on chromosome 17. An allele of this gene increases the risk of heart attack (the #1 cause of death in America) in blacks by more than 250%, but only 16% in whites. The 30% of whites with this allele have counteracting genes, while the 6% of black Americans who obtained it through miscegenation do not. (18)

       The average rate of success for mixed race couples is around half that of same race couples, 0.127 compared to 0.213. (19) There is evidence that the more similar the two people are, the happier their marriage tends to be. (20) A study in Iceland showed that 3rd cousin marriages are the most fertile and successful. This suggests that mating within one’s ethnic/racial group would be more beneficial than outside of one’s ethnic/racial group. (21) One study showed that people tend to find their own face–morphed into the opposite sex–most attractive, even when he/she doesn’t know it’s his own face. This strongly suggests that people typically prefer those who look like themselves–in other words, their own racial/ethnic group. (22)

       Hybrid vigor (heterosis) does not seem to apply to humans, as we are already very heterozygous, at 0.776. (23) Compared to dogs, for example, at 0.401. (24) Some argue that race mixing “averages out” traits. They claim that since average faces are considered more attractive, mixed race offspring would be more attractive. This, of course, is fallacious, as it assumes we are designed for perfect symmetry. In fact, the magnitude of asymmetry is the correct measurement and this random component fluctuates–also called “fluctuating asymmetry”–so a lower level of asymmetry correlates with increased attractiveness, not symmetry. (25) But does increased heterozygosity cause lower asymmetry? A meta analysis of 118 datasets in 14 studies revealed a very weak inverse correlation between the two, showing that increased heterozygosity has no beneficial effect on symmetry or asymmetry. One study on the craniofacial morphology in white-Indioe mixed race individuals found that over half of the 52 shape variables deviated from the mathematical average, completely shattering the above argument. (27)

       The neurotransmitter oxytocin “makes people more cooperative, benevolent, loyal, generous and trusting of others. It is involved in the parent-child bond–new mothers and fathers have raised levels of oxytocin. Production also increases when people hug and when they have sex and, recent research suggests, when they receive psychological warmth.” However, oxytocin has been alleged to “foster racism.” (28) The study found that “intergroup bias that fuels prejudice, xenophobia, and intergroup violence… may be modulated by brain oxytocin.” This suggests that the instinctual desire to pursue the interests of one’s own ethnic group to further ensure the existence of one’s people is linked to racial bias, coinciding with the observation that diversity is a weakness, not a strength. (29) One study found that during the menstrual cycle when women have a higher likelihood of conception, racial bias is increased–especially when the likelihood of sexual intercourse was increased. “Increased conception risk was positively associated with several measures of race bias. This association was particularly strong when perceived vulnerability to sexual coercion was high.” Although egalitarians suggest that only a racist would consider race when it comes to reproduction and mate choice, this study observed a general, innate tendency to prefer one’s own race especially when most likely to be impregnated.

       In the immune system, how important is race? “If Nick Glasgow were white, he would have a nearly 90 percent chance of finding a matching bone marrow donor who could cure his leukemia.” The reason that mixed-heritage patients are so hard to match can be found in the immune system. Different races have developed certain proteins, or markers, that are part of the body's natural defenses. These markers help the immune system determine which cells are foreign and should be rejected. A match between two people who share more genetically in common significantly reduces the risk of the donor and recipient cells attacking each other. (read: cells from people of two different races will attack each other as though they are a virus) The more people of different backgrounds who produce offspring, the more types that are harder to match. Multiracial patients have uncommon profiles and since there can be many possible racial and ethnic combinations in multiracial societies, finding a match can be extremely difficult. (31)

       As an example, a white mother of a mixed-race child would have more genetically in common with a random white person on the street than with her own child. If such a dramatic and fundamental alienation from your own parents is not horrific enough, every member of the family of a mixed-race child diagnosed with leukemia is an incompatible donor for a bone marrow transplant, and finding a compatible donor is unlikely. “One obstacle to finding a matching donor was her mixed ethnic background. Her father is black, with West Indian and Panamanian roots. Her mother is white, with Russian-Jewish roots. In addition, only 5 percent of registered donors are black.” (32) Compared to organ transplants, bone marrow donations need to be even more genetically similar to their recipients. Since all the immune system’s cells come from bone marrow, a transplant essentially introduces an entirely new new immune system to a person. Without genetic similarity between the donor and the patient, the new white blood cells will attack the host body. (33) Race matters when a patient needs a stem cell or marrow transplant. (34)

       A seasoned cancer researcher would never set up a study in which all the ill patients were, say, Canadian, and all the healthy controls were Japanese. And yet cancer researchers risk making a similar mistake if they overlook genetic information that fleshes out what many of us like to think of as race or ethnicity, some experts say. Fortunately, awareness of how ancestral genetics might contribute to risk of disease and drug response in people has risen over the last several years. Studies that look directly at the problem are on the rapid rise, and this increased interest has biotechnology companies lowering the cost of tests that determine genetic ancestry, thanks to a little competition. However, experts have yet to decide on how to genetically define ancestry, suggesting examining anywhere from a handful to hundreds of gene variants. Not including information on the race or ethnicity of study volunteers could skew disease risks as stronger or weaker than they really are. “Alzheimer’s is the poster child for this problem,” says pharmacogeneticist Esteban Burchard, MD, of the University of California in San Francisco. A variant of the gene ApoE4 is a strong genetic risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer’s, and the characteristic most likely to raise or lower that risk is race. “It occurs in about 20% of the black American population, and it means nothing. It occurs in about 6% of the Japanese, and it makes their risk six times higher [than that for white people],” Burchard said. “Something about being Japanese unleashes the wrath of the gene, and something about being black American attenuates it.” (35)

       The FDA have approved a heart failure drug called Bidil, but only for blacks, as blacks do not benefit from conventional heart failure drugs. (36) Sickle cell anaemia is a condition found almost exclusively in blacks–about 1 in 4 West Africans carry the gene for it while almost no whites do. Any whites who carry the gene most likely have a black ancestor. As a result of population growth in African-Caribbean regions of overseas France and immigration from North and sub-Saharan Africa to mainland France, sickle cell disease has become a major health problem in France. SCD has become the most common genetic disease in this country. (37)

        A Harvard study done for ten years involving over 26,000 people.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that–when the data were adjusted for class income and other factors–the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities “don’t trust the local mayor, they don't trust the local paper, they don't trust other people and they don’t trust institutions,” writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that “…we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us.

       Even Halyard knows this is all a pile of “feel good” shit. Like a religion, it relies on persecuting those who don’t agree to keep itself mainstream thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the study was released, Putnam was intimidated and harassed because he was accused of helping racists. He later came out and gave a very vague statement saying diversity “had problems but was worth it in the long run” to keep these morons appeased. This statement gives no indication of the “long run” and, in fact, is not quantified by anything.

       According to conflict theory, distrust between ethnic groups rises with diversity, but not within a group. Putnam describes people of all races and socioeconomic statuses, ages, and both sexes as “hunkering down,” avoiding engagement with their local community–both among different ethnic groups and within their own ethnic group. Even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates–two factors which conflict theory states should be the prime causal factors in declining interethnic group trust–more diversity is still associated with less communal trust.

       Putnam’s study was published in 2001. Genetic cluster analysis of the micro satellite markers produced four major clusters, which showed near perfect correspondence with the four self-reported race/ethnicity categories. Of 3636 subjects, only 5 (0.14%) showed genetic cluster membership different from their self-identified race/ethnicity.

        Good Fences: The Importance of Setting Boundaries for Peaceful Coexistence

       We consider the conditions of peace and violence among ethnic groups, testing a theory designed to predict the locations of violence and interventions that can promote peace. Characterizing the model’s success in predicting peace requires examples where peace prevails despite diversity. Switzerland is recognized as a country of peace, stability, and prosperity. This is surprising because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the world lead to conflict and violence. Here we analyze how peaceful stability is maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well-defined topographical and political boundaries separating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle (sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where such boundaries do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population distribution either guarantee sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict. In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate linguistic groups and violent conflict has led to the recent creation of the canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread ethnic violence, existing political boundaries did not coincide with the boundaries of distinct groups, but the peace prevailed in specific areas where they did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the world.

       Did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe, the Bible is more right than atheists and jews tell you it is? Look at the order of Creation. Nothing, light, heavens, Earth, water, land, plants, animals, people.

        Look familiar?
       </a>
       Look at the separation of races. Look at The Flood, for heaven’s sake. Do you really think that every single civilization that “never had contact with anyone else” would have the same story about a global flood on their own?

       You're saying people are inferior to you because of randomly selected gene sets that they didn't chose. You act like an arrogant middle class white kid that lives in the suburbs and complains about how much more they struggle everyday meanwhile they have a subscription to Netflix. You got off real easy, know that.

       You provide all the evidence of being an idiot specifically because you believe that peoples actions are sourced only from what is in their DNA. Your entire argument is in fact a big Genetic Fallacy that you're so proudly accusing me of. You my good sir are an uneducated hypocrite.

       Kindness is for fools. They want to treat the modernists with oil, soap, and caresses. But they should be beaten with fists. In a duel, you don’t count or measure the blows, you strike as you can. War is not made with charity; it is a struggle–a duel. If Our Lord were not terrible, he would not have given an example in this, too. See how he treated the Philistines, the sowers of error, the wolves in sheep’s clothing, the traitors in the temple. He scourged them with whips!
