<p>Apparently there used to be solidarity between white indentured servants and black slaves...both lead lives of enforced servitude and hated &quot;the Man&quot;. Racial slavery was thus created to keep those two factions separated.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s always how the few control the masses. Keep them fighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something similar happened to 2nd and 3rd waves European immigrants during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were often  seen as 2nd class citizens (close to newly freed African Americans) and not white (i.e. WASP) and had limited job opportunities. This started to changed during the 20th century as they blended into &quot;White America&quot; while making concessions to their ethnic roots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to that, I&#39;ve read that during that time period there was also a lot of negative sentiment towards the influx of Chinese. Those European immigrants leveraged this and declared themselves as &quot;white&quot; thus aligning themselves closer to WASPs. I guess the race card has always been a good card to play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN definitely has an agenda and are pushing it but there is plenty of racism and hate coming in from both sides now, whereas it was much quieter before this election cycle, the media is providing the spark but I&#39;m not sure what will be the ignition but we&#39;re getting close to something bad happening and we need more good ideas to bring us <strong>all</strong> together rather than more divisive crap like scapegoating playing the blame game.</p>

<p>BLM sucks as an organization but it has a legitimate beef against the criminal justice system as a whole, however resorting to racism and calling for the death of people rather than justice is the worst way to go about things.</p>

<p>On the flipside all of those jumping on the BLM hate bandwagon are either being sucked into what the media is pushing and the pundits and the alt-right propaganda, this is what they want, the media wants those that support BLM to go after the intolerance some on this side has shown and vice versa. </p>

<p>We need to compromise that all lives matter and move forward, the real problems are with those at the top, anything else just divides us, and that&#39;s what they want. These problems are real, they affect all of us despite only one side getting attention about it, and unless we unite they aren&#39;t going away.</p>

<p>I would actually argue that black people don&#39;t have it any worse than any other race at this point in western civilization. I have not seen any statistics that show there is anything unfair about how the justice system treats them. If you want to see an unfair discrepancy then look at how females are treated vs males.</p>

<p>It is very easy (also lazy, and misled) to say that a higher percentage of black males are _______ compared to white males, but that is the only thing that our rulers ever spout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen statistics regarding things one way and statistics regarding another, the bad thing about statistics these days is they&#39;ve been so manipulated and so distorted and so cherry picked we really can&#39;t formulate a real concrete argument to either way at this point. </p>

<p>So I unfortunately and unreliably have to go with experience, and on witness testimony, which is also unreliable at times. From my experience and the shared experience of my father a Riker&#39;s Island CO who was often in the courts as an escort for the prisoners, he has some really interesting observations from someone whom for a long time felt that his brothers in blue could do no wrong, and one of those observations definitely falls into what you&#39;re trying to say, where if the jury saw a defendant dressed like a bum the person was going to jail, if the defendant was dressed like Nino Brown he was probably going to jail as well but he said he felt they were less likely, but if they were dressed like any other Wall St. suit not anywhere near so much, so the disparity definitely does seem to fall back on the class divide.</p>

<p>As for women, you&#39;re right, outside of the whole earning disparity discussion women get the shaft all over the world but when it comes to the family courts dudes get rocked, I&#39;m lucky I&#39;ve only been married to one woman, but she was married to a piece of shit before me, so I had to go through her crap along with her, I think the court system actually failed us completely, they let her ex get away with pretty much parental kidnapping while we were still paying, and now we have a pretty fucked in the head eighteen year old that just moved in with us after having disappeared completely from our lives for nine years, and she&#39;s been on her own since she was sixteen, her brother, my step son, is now in the army and still hasn&#39;t reached out to us, but her shitheaded ex still tried to push for more money every single year, his wife would harass my wife over terminating her parental rights every year, and we were just too far away and too broke to ever really do anything except what we&#39;re doing now, picking up the pieces of this young girls fucked up life. So yeah the court systems suck in those regards as well, and that seems to be a huge kick in the lower income brackets nuts as well.</p>

<p>The more I talk through this thing I get a feeling that it&#39;s never been race that&#39;s the issue, it&#39;s been income inequality, but blacks mostly fall into the income bracket that is getting screwed for everyone, and that&#39;s where everything goes bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about how, in general, women are treated differently by the courts. For murder, burglary, assault, breaking the arbitrary laws, etc. This also goes for family courts, but i&#39;m just pointing out that you will hear that &quot;black <em>men</em>&quot; get it so much worse in the justice system than &quot;white <em>men</em>&quot;, but if you compared black men to black women, or white men to white women you would see a much larger difference. that&#39;s not part of the narrative they are pushing though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, I&#39;ve seen <a href="/r/pussypassdenied">/r/pussypassdenied</a> and all of the other &quot;I&#39;m really angry at women&quot; subs and I get that there is a difference in how we&#39;re treated compared to them and I agree it is wrong but once in a while it does swing both ways, but women generally do get a break in the system, not always, but often enough that it does fall into being an inequality.</p>

<p>Another story from my personal life, so my wife is a paranoid schizophrenic, I&#39;ve mentioned it before on the site and on more than one of my accounts, she&#39;s all of 4&#39;10&quot; compared to my 6&#39;3&quot;, she was raped in the military by one of my co-workers while we were all out at a club off of base before her and I became a thing, so cop catches it all in the parking lot because she was screaming, arrested the dude, military takes over and his and my officer are collaborating together with both legal officers, the case gets tanked he gets away free and clear, years later rapes another chick and gets kicked out, but that&#39;s not the story I meant to tell just some background, so yeah female/male disparity in the military is completely different than in civilian courts, women really do get screwed over and pushed out when they start trying to push for any kind of accountability, just like they tried with my wife. </p>

<p>Anyway back to the main story, so we became friends she fell in love with me and I her and we&#39;re still married obviously bunch of kids, animals, etc. we&#39;re doing great, but before she was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic she was abusive as fuck, fortunately for me I was not only a big guy who figured I could take it and handle her, and I did, but it was always scary because if I hurt her in anyway and she was still feeling vindictive and spiteful I could go to jail at any given time, there was a time when we came down on leave to my mom and stepdad&#39;s place here in FL. with another couple we were friends with and our infant daughter, my buddy had a nice big <em>Expedition</em> so the deal was he drives I gas and what not, so the weekend went great but I was stuck with paying for every thing, and I mean every thing, so I start running out of money and cutting back so this dick of a friend gets pissed at me when I tell him he needs to get the next tank of gas, starts driving super fast in this big truck, my wife gets scared. So we&#39;re at the first rest stop in SC coming North and she and I start arguing about his speed, she wants to walk off into the unknown SC area and find a bus because she&#39;s freaking out he&#39;s going to kill us, and she&#39;s trying to take our daughter, it&#39;s in the middle of January, we start arguing and some lookey loo in a car near us calls the cops, I go to jail, didn&#39;t even get a chance to say there is no problem or calm the situation down or anything. </p>

<p>So years later we were still dealing with her issues she isn&#39;t always bad but eventually it got to the point where I almost left her completely, we eventually talked about it and I got her to talk to someone and now she&#39;s healthy and happy, she still gets scared of her phantoms and what not but no where near as bad and most of the anger is gone, but there was a time when every single time she would start her crap I would just deal with it because it would be better than going back to jail for accidentally leaving a mark on her while trying to calm her down or something.</p>

<p>So that is my reality and why I understand where you are coming from with this, you&#39;re right it&#39;s not fair to us, but there are some pretty crazy stalking and domestic violence cases out there, my sister in laws ex broke into her house and stabbed himself seven times right in front of her in her kitchen, my niece has some piece of shit stalking her and busting out her parents windows every time he&#39;s back around and they can&#39;t do shit to him because he&#39;s seventeen. </p>

<p>The list can go on and on, but eventually we have to figure out that portion of our problems, but this deal with the racism has to come first before we can delve deeper into our relationships and start fixing the problems between males and females within our society, but those problems definitely need addressing and soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compromise is always possible, it&#39;s essential, if it isn&#39;t possible then that&#39;s when the ethnic cleansing and genocides begin. The adults in the conversation need to stop letting the immaturity get in the way of the problems and the messages, we need less reaction and more proactive approaches. </p>

<p>I say all of this completely knowing none of this shit will happen but I&#39;ll be saying it until I&#39;m blue in the face because this is what we need and what works, otherwise this will just keep spinning out of control until really bad shit happening starts becoming a daily occurrence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is culpable in manufacturing this race war because like I said, until they reported Alton Sterling&#39;s death, no one gave a shit about police brutality and it was going on every day. it&#39;s not like a black person wasn&#39;t being killed every day before the death of Alton Sterling. Who protested for those blacks? I guess until Hillary Clinton gets in hot water, these police brutality issues are not worthy of any press? All of the people in Black Lives Matter are ignorant hypocrites and the black people who get provoked by this are worse. The white people who get fueled by this are no different. The media is propagandizing police brutality to instigate a race war and the masses are too stupid to read between the lines. We are witnessing the division of civilization through an ominous, invisible, non-existent threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both the cops and the media work for the establishment.
Police reinforce laws and rules made by TPTB. Media reinforces the narrative that they want the public to see. They also control academia which nurtures all these fucked up ideologies and legitimizes the movement leaders by giving them a degree and credentials in bullshit.</p>

<p>The cops are just people but the media portrays them as a collective group that&#39;s just out to harm, which is factually incorrect. It is true that the cops do target lower income black people much more than white suburban people and that leads to higher prison rates. That&#39;s not the cops being racist. They&#39;re just doing what they&#39;re told.</p>

<p>The prison industry makes a fuckload of money off poor people doing stupid shit. Taxpayers hoof the very expensive bill to lock these guys up under the premise of being tough on crime.</p>

<p>The cop was right that the media isn&#39;t objective. They don&#39;t report black on black crime because that&#39;s not the narrative they want. I&#39;ve been interested in this topic since before Rodney King got his ass beat back in 91 so I&#39;ve been watching this crap play out for the last 25 years.</p>

<p>In academia, they teach PC ideology that splits US national identity into smaller groups using pseudo &#39;scientific&#39; terms like black or white and turns everything into these psychotic little &#39;tribes&#39; that are trained to hate each other.</p>

<p>The media is the killer here. They make a shitload of money off exploiting black people and filling people&#39;s heads with the idea that black Americans are either victims or villains.</p>

<p>The media did all their best efforts to present the Zimmerman incident as an African American vs Caucasian American conflict, even though Zimmerman is of Afro-Peruvian descent and has identified himself as Latino throughout his life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one way of looking at it.  If you watched no news at all you wouldn&#39;t even know about the problem other than in vague terms (and from friends who watch news).  Race has always been a problem, but we all do our part to help. Except for the news. They fan the flames.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race war has been talked about for a long time.  I really don&#39;t see different races getting that pitted against each other to where there will be a war.  Not yet at least.  Most people realize that we are the melting pot of the world and if we want somewhat of a semblance of a free life we better try and get along, even if we can&#39;t stand each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The push in the media was against whites. For years whites have been mocked and ridiculed in the media, especially white men, but a couple of years ago this shifted over to outright hatespeech against whites, not only in the media but in the schools as well. This finally caused whites to react. Being mocked didn&#39;t do it, but being accused of things we didn&#39;t do got us angry. The  so-called race war is: (a) the media, the schools, and blacks in general start targeting whites with hatred, violence, and accusing us of all the evils in the world, and (b) whites see what is going on and react to it.</p>
