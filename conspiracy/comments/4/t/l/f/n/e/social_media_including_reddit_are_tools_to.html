        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The elite use reddit, twitter, etc. to control the issues we discuss. They choose what we spend time and effort focusing on.</p>

<p>We think everyone on social sites are other typical people when the reality is that advanced bots pretend to be humans and shift the topics and issues per the elite.</p>

<p>whatever distraction they want us to waste our time debating, their bots will spew it out.</p>

<p>reddit will show 6,000 upvotes for a discussion topic and real people flock to it to chime in.</p>

<p>But why?  So we don&#39;t discuss issues which threaten their control.  Like this fucking Monopoly money and banking system they&#39;ve setup since 1913.  </p>

<p>instead we discuss less important topics, like (insert highly controversial, red vs blue, highly politicized topic which, while important to many people, doesn&#39;t really affect most of the citizenry and their livelihood).</p>

<p>EDIT:  M. Knight Shamalamadingdong Twist: I am a superbot controlled by 1 of the main partners who own the federal reserve money cartel.  And I&#39;m posting this to rub it in all you fucking serfs&#39; faces, at the behest of my master. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on man. This will go down as the Ashley Madison theory of fake posters controlling idiots. The same thing can be said of YouTube where you think you arrived at something independently by chance, when in reality there were limited options that directed you to a network of videos.  Beings I&#39;m pulling shit out of my ass we can call this &quot; The 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; theory. </p>

<p>Most of the shit in conspiracy theories is just controlled opposition (think Alex Jones). So when something obvious like this happens it&#39;s instantly discredited because of being linked to shape shifting lizard people or something.</p>

<p>And yes, it used to infuriate me that my lengthy and thoughtful (ie: time consuming to write) text posts would get under 100 karma while some dickhead tourist would make their first post which is something like &#39;oh look jfk was maybe a conpsiracy&#39; link and it would have 2500 upvotes.  That&#39;s an exaggeration but you know what I mean.  The disproportionality of level-of-effort versus karma; strongly suggesting if not proving vote brigading.</p>
