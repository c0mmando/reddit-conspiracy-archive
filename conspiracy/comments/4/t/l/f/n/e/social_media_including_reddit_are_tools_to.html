       The elite use reddit, twitter, etc. to control the issues we discuss. They choose what we spend time and effort focusing on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We think everyone on social sites are other typical people when the reality is that advanced bots pretend to be humans and shift the topics and issues per the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       whatever distraction they want us to waste our time debating, their bots will spew it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit will show 6,000 upvotes for a discussion topic and real people flock to it to chime in.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why?  So we don't discuss issues which threaten their control.  Like this fucking Monopoly money and banking system they've setup since 1913.
      </p>
      <p>
       instead we discuss less important topics, like (insert highly controversial, red vs blue, highly politicized topic which, while important to many people, doesn't really affect most of the citizenry and their livelihood).

       Interesting refutation. Care to address the points? I know he's brash, I know he's overconfident but I don't care because he's right. I put style behind content in an age where mainstream media is all about style and sorely lacking on content, I just look for someone to tell me the truth. I don't care how he tells it to me.

       What claims? I have only claimed he is a gatekeeper, which is not a claim that requires any other evidence above him being a gatekeeper when 9/11 is mentioned.

       That should be all the evidence you really need concerning this much. However, the document goes into much further details discussing Noam's "merits" to our community.

       I take you don't agree with Chomsky, that there is no substantial proof of government foreknowledge or involvement in 9/11, and that the probability of that evidence existing is quite low.
      </p>
      <p>
       He initially addresses the "qui bono" question. Do you agree with those, or disagree with it all, and still think he's a gatekeeper?

       Spot on man. This will go down as the Ashley Madison theory of fake posters controlling idiots. The same thing can be said of YouTube where you think you arrived at something independently by chance, when in reality there were limited options that directed you to a network of videos.  Beings I'm pulling shit out of my ass we can call this " The 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon" theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the shit in conspiracy theories is just controlled opposition (think Alex Jones). So when something obvious like this happens it's instantly discredited because of being linked to shape shifting lizard people or something.

       I like your twist.  Sometimes in the more subversive posts I'm accused of being a bot also.  Welcome botmate
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, it used to infuriate me that my lengthy and thoughtful (ie: time consuming to write) text posts would get under 100 karma while some dickhead tourist would make their first post which is something like 'oh look jfk was maybe a conpsiracy' link and it would have 2500 upvotes.  That's an exaggeration but you know what I mean.  The disproportionality of level-of-effort versus karma; strongly suggesting if not proving vote brigading.

       the idea that social media is a tool of control was old when you where still in diapers.  as you can clearly see however, no one cares, and would much rather continue only discussing how bad something is, instead of what they are going to do to fix it.

       You obviously don't pay attention. Alot of people are doing a lot to change the current situation. But you won't hear about it on tv or online. The revolution will not be televised. Your boss isn't going to tell you how to take that fat dick out of your ass.

       I see that same dumb ass comment over and over again and it doesn't nothing but put people in defeatist moods. If nothing will be done by anybody, why do you even read into these kind of subjects?

       lol, the revolution isn't going to be on the front page eaither.  too bad everyone you need for a revolution is.  these chucklefucks have been bred, trained, and fed the lie that real action is worse than kissing hitler.  we can have this conversation again in 5 years, assuming you're alive and i can find which FEMA camp you were forced into.

       The elite couldn't give a fuck about reddit, twitter, etc. The whole userbase of these services is nothing in the grand scheme of things and you are delusional if you think you are important enough that your opinion on anything needs to be manipulated.

       Whatever you say bro. And before you say "but a million is nothing to these people." Maybe, but I just call it a good value. At this point and time social media is approaching a similar level of influence than TV, maybe more.
