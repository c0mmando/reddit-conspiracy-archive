       At some point you've got to believe in something.  I am as critical as they come, look at my post history.  But separation of the body and mind is a  destructive thing and you must trust your instincts to be whole.  That means listening to something that at times can be irrational.

       For what? Are you asking me for evidence of a negative? That's not how this works.

      <p>
       You made a claim (Trump Jr.s speech is a reflection of Trump seniors personality and ability to be president). So the burden of proof rests with you.

      <p>
       So I ask, where is the evidence that supports

       I agreed with much of the content of his speech and I felt he was sincere.  You are claiming that is foolish.  But I would like to know how your high powered brain works and how you came to the conclusion that Trump Jr.'s speech was bullshit.

       A nicely crafted speech but all his claims about work ethic and such just don't match his dad's past and present actions.

       Family this much involved as a power behind the strongman usually ends up as a nepotistic force that leads to corruption. I can imagine this guy's pals (not blue collar workers, for sure) already licking their fangs with the promise of access to power.

       I have to disagree and heres why- what if he expediates our decline? Hes advocated for  foreign policies that would only escalate the situations in tge Middle East and around the world. His domestic policies arent much different.
       <br/>
       But thats not the real danger of his presidency, the real danger is the emboldening of the people who agree with his sentiments.  Maybe he doesnt really believe what he says, its just theatrics to garner media attention- thats a possibility. But the possibility that someone in his cabinet equally denounces and despises people of certain races or religions, agrees with his agressive foreign policy and nationalist domestic policies sets a dangerous precedent. We could see decades of his continued beliefs and sentiment. It wont just be a flame that burns down the whole dustem all at once, it will be a slow burn that flickers for decades to come-especially considering he could appoint several supreme court judges, we would see a conplete shift in our country completely. And to be honest it wouldby be too dufferent from some Muddle Eastern country either, because alot if the decline in the past decades has been due to an increase in radically charged regime changes,  like Afghanistan, Turkey abd Iran- those places used ti be more progressive than they are now.
       <br/>
       Not just that but his election means that his beliefs reflects the majority of our country. People are angry and hurt but its not mexicans or muslims faults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take fir example thw wall he wants to build- sure, illegal immigration is (potentially, theres no dara that actually suggests it) a problem, but building a wall doesnt actually solve any of the issues that cause the immigration. A more appropriate term fir these immigrants are "economic refugees", people leaving thwur homes as a last resort ti survive- imagine what It would take for you to leave your home, probably alot, if not anything. 
Anyways, my solution would be to end the drug war, which has among other many horrible things,  legitimized the cartels who basically own all of the border towns in Mexico, and have alot if power in ither Latin American countries.  People flee because the only option other than working for the Cartels is death.
       <br/>
       Of course the situation is more conplex and nuanced, but ive never heard this idea proposed by any serious politician- theres always an extreme idea that doesnt address the cause of the problem,  and if you spend enough time around here, you'll find alot of the problems in the world have been manufactured.

       The alternative, Clinton is just as bad, IMO. But I feel like if everyone who said they would vote third party, if it mattered,  voted third party, it would matter.

       Your being negative for the sake of just making a point. I just want to say what's the harm? You got two evils with this election. So best just try to roll the dice.

       Lol the Republican party has just crowned Hilary by nominating Trump.  They are openly mocking their supporters with the vp nomination.  Just look up the definition of Trumpence.

       Im not sure what bias youre referring to I dont vote down party lines. Of which Trump doesn't even have the support of true conservatives in the Republican party. Just useful idiots who I imagine also believe that pro wrestling is unscripted.

       The Bush's, McCain, and the rest of the Republican establishment are NOT true conservatives. Them not supporting Trump is a good sign.
