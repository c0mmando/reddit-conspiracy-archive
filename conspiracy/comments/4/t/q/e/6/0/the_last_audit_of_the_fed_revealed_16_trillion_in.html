<p>I have just started learning about global banking and Rand Pauls&#39; audit the fed bill got my curious, this was one of the first things I found which shocked me and for me raised a number of questions:</p>

<p>Why is another audit needed/what was the purpose of the GAO audit?</p>

<p>Why on earth did the banks need so much money? surely they only need to cover money deposited if we were to let them fail? and who even puts money in the bank anyway?? surely if you are wealthy you tie up your money elsewhere I doubt anyone with financial clout is tempted by current interest rates?? so many damn quetsions</p>

<p>I am constantly frustrated by the banking situation, it makes no sense and I am told because i am not an economist I don&#39;t understand.. crock of shite the lot of it</p>

<p>Edit: $16 Trillion is adjusted with interest included not all of which was paid as the loans we repaid faster from what I gather, also one last question!</p>

<p>If the banks create money, and the money given to the banks was all digital - who created the money and why did the people and government have to get involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>completely agree! money is needed by us though and we suffer because of it. Im trying to simplify it as much as possible, i recognise that might not be the best thing to do.</p>

<p>what liabilities do the banks have that mean they are too big to fail apart from the deposits they hold? anything else is just a loss in value of assets right? </p>

<p>I did a quick calc but im aware its not all the figures but average amount in JUST a US checking account is $4500 x Population = roughly $1.6T </p>

<p>I know the $16T is higher than the actual amount paid as that is with interest included but still doesnt seem to make sense?</p>

<p>Im with you I think its largely enginereed mostly tracing back to the banks so anything I can learn is all good</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way before I forget. If you want to understand economics, you must know that taxes do NOT fund spending. </p>

<p>Even Ben Bernanke admitted this in 2008, during an interview about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odPfHY4ekHA">bailout.</a></p>

<p>Go to 8:00.</p>

<p>SCOTT PELLEY: Is that tax money that the Fed
is spending?</p>

<p>CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: It’s not tax money.
The banks have accounts with the Fed, much the
same way that you have an account in a commercial
bank. So, to lend to a bank, we simply use the
computer to mark up the size of the account that
they have with the Fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the 16T bailout money mostly entered the financial economy instead the real economy. So a lot of the money was used to buy derivatives, commercial bonds etc., essentially to keep things going.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it would have any impact on the dollar value. The US economy is very large and with private debt levels being as high as they were/are, not all of the money would enter circulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Federal Reserve&#39;s finances are audited <em>every year</em>. The audited financial statements are on their web site. All of the Fed&#39;s emergency lending programs were announced beforehand and the Fed reported the balances of each program every week.</p>

<p>The Fed tried to keep the names of the banks getting the loans secret, but Bloomberg successfully sued the Fed under the Freedom of Information Act in order to get the Fed to release the names. In addition, Congress passed a law requiring the Fed to release more information and ordering a special review by the GAO.</p>

<p>This was not the first time nor the last time that the GAO reviewed the Federal Reserve. There&#39;s a list of GAO reports involving the Fed here: <a href="http://www.gao.gov/browse/a-z/Federal_Reserve_System%2C_Independent_Agencies">http://www.gao.gov/browse/a-z/Federal_Reserve_System%2C_Independent_Agencies</a></p>

<p>The GAO is blocked from reviewing certain aspects of the Fed relating to monetary policy. Sen. Rand Paul wants to remove those restrictions since he wants the Federal Reserve to be less independent.</p>

<p>The $16 Trillion figure is a <em>transaction</em> total and, as such, does not represent a quantity of money. For example, suppose you had two sisters, Alice and Barbara. Alice borrows $100 from you every Friday but repays it the next Monday. She does this every week for a year. Barbara borrows $2000 in January and doesn&#39;t repay you until the end of December. According to the transaction totals, you loaned Alice $5200 and Barbara $2000. Obviously, those numbers don&#39;t mean very much and accountants don&#39;t generally report them. </p>

<p>The largest outstanding balance of the loan programs was still very large (about $1.1 trillion). See Figure 11 in the GAO report that this article is referencing: <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/GAO%20Fed%20Investigation.pdf">http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/GAO%20Fed%20Investigation.pdf</a></p>

<p>16$ was funnelled into the European banking system through the Bank of Scotland here is a member of the house of Lords talking about this stolen money:</p>

<p>And before you say it wasn&#39;t stolen why is it claimed to be backed up by an amount of Gold that doesn&#39;t exist?</p>

<p>This money was stolen from a large fund that was created when America  collapsed the Soviet Union.</p>
