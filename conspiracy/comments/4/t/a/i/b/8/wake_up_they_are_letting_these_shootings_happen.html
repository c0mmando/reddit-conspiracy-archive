    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been waiting for this for awhile now. I remember a while back, when I use to be heavily secure about how I got on the internet and what I searched up. I had burner phones, switched out my sim card every chance I got just so I wouldn&#39;t be tracked, but you can never go off grid completely. Back in 2015, since I live in a relatively small town, I would see military vehicles being pulled on train conveys (no bases in our area for 50 miles, so don&#39;t shot me with that bullshit) fuck, I&#39;ve even seen a few of them driving on the streets at like 2AM. I&#39;m talking about fully armored vehicles; once seen a tank, I shit you not. Restriction of weaponry? Get a fucking bunker or some shit out in the woods away from your house and stockpile supplies and ammo in there when shit hits the fan. Call me a shill or edgelord, idgaf, but its here and we better prepare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the terrorist act involved swaying the U.S. public into disarming themselves before a foreign invasion?</p>

<p>Ever hear of yellow journalism? Sensationalism?</p>

<p>Either way, before you BELIEVE what the news tells you, be sure that it is proven, or at the very least not easy to disprove. Many of the stories the media runs can be disproven. Do not blindly believe what they say just because they say it; therein lies the fallacy.</p>
