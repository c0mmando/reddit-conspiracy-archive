        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s simple, really. </p>

<p>Erdogan was struggling with approval lately, thus he orchestrated a coup during which, inexplicably, a lot civilians were injured, killed or at least fired upon (in contrast to the past 4 coups, where the military focus was solely on government). </p>

<p>Now he has a legitimate reason to cut civil liberties even more, suppress all opposition and become a de-facto dictator with little resistance from the international community. </p>

<p>And since he smack down a coup by dangerous psychos killing civilians and not a legitimate opposition, he will walk away the hero protecting his people. </p>

<p>Edit: Also consider how quickly this ended and the small part of the military that was involved. All past coups have been orchestrated nation-wide by huge portions of the military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don´t think it was entirely staged. I think it was partly staged, to get total power AND root out opposing military</p>

<p>This is the most imbecile coup ever, to be staged when Erdogan is in a location unknown.</p>

<p>What was the first thing they did in Egypt? Capture Morsi. In Chile? Capture Allende?</p>

<p>In Turkey? Capture the bridge.</p>

<p>Come on.</p>

<p>My pet theory:</p>

<p>1 - Erdogan convinced top allied generals to spread news of a coup
2 - Anti-Erdogan army officers, hearing about the coup going on, &quot;join&quot; the coup and mobilized their soldiers, believing they are part of a majority of the army and will win
3 - Anti-Erdogan officers discover they are a minority. Worse. They were rooted out. EXPOSED. Cornered, some of them decide to fight anyway, but it´s a lost battle
4 - Now Erdogan knows officers that not only are against him, but that would also participate in coups. Good excuse to arrest or kill them.
5 - All this trouble just to root out such officers? Of course not. Erdogan now has a good excuse to increase his powers (he already did so before). Martial order will allow him powers to do many changes to increase his powers. 
6 - Not only that, but he gained even more popularity. While most army on the streets seems to have been not violent and surrendered peacefully, some have massacred civilians. That may have happened as a REACTION, after all, Erdogan itself clamored for his supporters to take arms and FIGHT the coup perpetrators. (really, ask civilians to fight with bricks and handguns to fight tanks and choppers to protect HIS POWER?). Cornered officers and soldiers. A single shot against them, may have mass panicked and run the tanks over people. Plus some that may have done so out of pure cruelty.</p>

<p>Self coups are extremely common. The fact this coup was so badly timed, that Erdogan was in an unknown location the entire time, that the entire coup was a mess, makes be suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way to complex. Quite simply you just need a few in the chain of command to order troops to mobilise, who have no idea at all what is going on and just believe they are on normal army exercises. To best hide this you grab and execute a bunch of officers who knew the orders were only for army exercises and then blame them for the coup.
Due to the current critical role of Turkey, Erdogan will not survive this attempt for total power, neither the Americans nor the Russians nor the EU nor China want him. All on his own and a dangerous trigger for a hugely expanded war, a nuclear war, extremely dangerous indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that up to now he has been following the same playbook as most past tyrants, arresting journalists, controlling the media, putting loyalists into top government positions, pushing for a new constitution to grant him substantially more power.   Doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out what comes next when the guy is talking about the coup being a blessing from God and that he was going to cleanse the military.   </p>

<p>And now they are already starting the crack down.</p>

<p>&quot;Turkey&#39;s state-run news agency says authorities have detained 10 members of Turkey&#39;s highest administrative court as the government appeared to press ahead with a purge of judiciary officials with alleged links to a U.S.-based Muslim cleric.</p>

<p>The Anadolu Agency said Saturday that arrest warrants were issued for 48 administrative court members and 140 members of Turkey&#39;s appeals court. Earlier, Anadolu said a body overseeing judges and prosecutors in Turkey has dismissed 2,745 judges across Turkey.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the standard script in this kind of situation.  While it may be true, it is still very suspect for all the reasons being articulated here, chief among which is that the very first step of any real coup is to arrest or otherwise neutralize the current leader, and to limit his ability to return to his power base <em>before</em> exposing the folks orchestrating the coup. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are they being arrested?   For the same reason most wannabe tyrants purge the judiciary, they want the courts under their complete control.   This is nothing that Hugo Chavez, Saddam Hussein and many others didn&#39;t do.</p>

<p>You can buy Erdogan&#39;s propaganda about Ghulenists popping out of the shadows everywhere but he is simply not letting this crisis go to waste, it was almost entirely too predictable that he would start purging the judiciary as well as the military of any potential opponents.    He&#39;s simply using the usual M.O. to give himself unquestionable and incontestable control over the state.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t suddenly remove thousands of judges the day after a coup attempt and claim that every single one was connected to it.  That is laughable.  They&#39;ve had this list for awhile and finally had a pretext to justify it to continue the charade of democracy.   </p>

<p>And yes the military was involved in prior coups and particularly in 1980 it was largely due to people similar to Erdogan pushing for more power and a religious state.   Ataturk grew up in the last remnants of the Ottoman Empire and he did his best to prevent the rise of fundamentalists and a departure from a strong, secular democracy.   With Erdogan having nobody left to challenge him and talking about being around for the Turkish centenary, that finally appears to have failed.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turkey has had military coups before. Perhaps Erdogan is/was getting a bit paranoid that his transformation into a strongman might eventually trigger a coup by the military.</p>

<p>So he staged one of his own? It makes sense to do this. Stage a coup that is designed to fail quickly. This would make Erdo look even stronger to the general Turkish public. Even more importantly, it would make any genuine plotters think twice about trying a coup of their own. A false coup could also serve to draw some of his enemies out into the open.</p>

<p>Most coups depend heavily on the element of surprise in order to succeed. Also, if you&#39;re a participant in a coup, it can go one of two ways. Succeed and you rise very quickly. Fail... and your career and your life are both over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree - why?</p>

<ol>
<li>It was over too fast (coups in other countries last for ages)</li>
<li>The military doesn&#39;t work that way (if they push government out of power they are well prepared and don&#39;t start something they won&#39;t win, they don&#39;t chance it...no a real coup would be launched differently: They&#39;d wait for Erdogan to speak before the full parliament then shut of the power, close of all exits (including stuff like helipads and subterranean exits), take out security (either lethally or not, special forces are trained to do both after all) and then storm the place (all that while they have close air support and while regular soldiers take over the city infrastructure, cellphone-networks and internet are shut down (total communications blackout!) and local TV and radio stations are taken over)</li>
<li>The military wouldn&#39;t retreat from the airport if the person they want incarcerated or killed is flying in on a plane (either they don&#39;t authorize a landing (threat of shooting the plane down) or they escort the plane to a place where they can arrest who they want arrested - or: They&#39;d shoot the plane down from the start (worst case scenario!))</li>
<li>They take over the rest of the country (after they&#39;ve arrested all members of parliament and have put their people in key places all over the capital city!)</li>
<li>They form a military government, re-establish law and order, restore the constitution to power and call people to vote for a new parliament! (at least that&#39;s what the Turkish military did in the past...they&#39;ve never held on to power, they just safeguard the constitution &quot;against all enemies - foreign and domestic&quot; (that&#39;s the job of a soldier!))</li>
</ol>

<p>If this was a coup:</p>

<p>It was badly planned, badly (too early? rushed?) executed - which again:</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how the military works, they&#39;ve all incorporated Sun Tzu into their tactics (a military will only strike if victory is more or less assured - that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t lose, but it significantly lowers the chances)</p>

<p>ps: They might even start by using special forces to knock out power for the whole city (not just the parliament building!) and seize (or kill) key players not on their side!</p>

<p>pps: He gave and interview via CELLPHONE, didn&#39;t he? Cells can be TRACKED (and every half way decently equipped military has that equipment!), so they&#39;d have found him very soon if he somehow got out!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been my theory from the start.  Coups are not exactly rare in this part of the world and Turkey itself is no stranger to this sort of uprising.  </p>

<p>The very first step of pretty much any uprising is to arrest or eliminate the current leader, who in this case was in the country at a seaside resort with basic presidential security squad who would have been no match for soldiers with tanks and attack helicopters.  They then allowed him to travel unchallenged back to Istanbul when they controlled at least some air assets that could have shot his plane down or forced him to land at an airbase they controlled.</p>

<p>This looks more like an action orchestrated by the ruling party to justify eliminating whatever little personal liberties remain and to consolidate all power to the presidency.  It&#39;s a very old trick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, disagree.  Curiously, this is the message CIA operatives were selling to the media.  (i.e. Erdogan has low public support, Turkish military is with the people, etc...).  The reality, in my view, is that Turkey was moving closer to Russia.  Erdogan apologized for downing the Russian jet last November and was moving closer in ties to Russia.  The coup was most likely a CIA backed attempt to oust Erdogan.  This is the predictable pattern.  Watch a nation move closer to Russia or China (which are perceived as political enemies of the US) and wait for a coup or a revolution to happen there.  Similar as Ukraine in 2014</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The coup was so badly planned and executed that it raises suspicions that it was orchestrated as an excuse to grab even more power on the pretext of defending against foreign sedition. It&#39;s not like there are no templates for successful coups in the region (e.g., Egypt 2013 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat</a>) </p>

<p>The biggest clue here is that the organizers failed to arrest or otherwise neutralize Erdogan as the very first step.  They also missed their chance to stop him from flying back to Istanbul after the coup had already started.  This is pretty much Coup 101.</p>
