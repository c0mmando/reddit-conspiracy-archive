         Why would they not take the president hostage or kill him outright?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How did police forces "capture" a large part of the ARMY that is attempting a coup?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did it seem like the gunfire in the videos was aimed at nothing?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How would an army attempting a coup, that has access to tanks/helis/jets just up and lose? I've been following the live feed since the beginning, they seemed to be totally dominant, with shows of force in the air, gunfire, etc... And now the president shows up, and it's over?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why is the president now giving a speech, after an "attempted coup" with the military still in control of weapons, and a lot of the country still wanting his head?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There was also the obvious bias that all news sources had when reporting this, they were all pro-government and anti-military. Even Clinton chimed in and said she was very pro- Turkey government, and we ALL know what she is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked through all the threads, saw many many Turkish people post that this coup was a good thing, yet when you look at the news, it's ALL pro Turkish government, and the live feed ONLY posts things that are pro Turkish government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has to be one of the sloppiest false flags I've ever seen. It's terrible what is about to happen to the Turkish civilians, the iron grip is about to get a lot tighter.
      </p>

       I know
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       has been overrun, but I've taken a break from the conspiracy scene altogether, this is just way too juicy to pass up, and maybe before this topic becomes "overrun", we can have a nice discussion. I am just simply in shock at how sloppy this one is, usually the false flags are, in general, pretty well thought out.

       How did the military not intercept his place when everyone could see where it was on fucking flightradar?

       How were they able to out tanks in public places, and yet fail to secure private news network(other than cnn turkey) and cut off the internet? Sounds like soap opera plot

       Wtf was the endgame? They didn't have erdogan; they didn't have full or even broad military backing; they didn't cut off media; they weren't willing to kill civilians. Wtf kind of coup was that?

       This is a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possibility is, they're saying the coup has failed, because they can use it to take out anyone they want. Some guy in an opposite party giving you issues? Have the "coup military" take him out, if someone finds out, blame it on them.

       Did you watch the broadcast when they took CNN? It was an empty studio with THOUSANDS of pro-government supports heard on the audio cheering for the president, along with propaganda messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't they get on CNN and send a message? Why wouldn't they at the BARE MINIMUM destroy the equipment or cut the feed?  Nope...let's just broadcast pro-government messages....
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently the soldiers are saying that they were told it was a training exercise. This makes a lot of sense, considering the initial videos of the tanks show the crews driving through the streets without a care in the world until they actually get attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military not firing on the protestors also makes sense. They didn't use ANY FORCE to stop the pro-government people from approaching and just told them to get back...then when they realized "Fuck...the police are here. This probably isn't a training exercise...we've been set up" they gave up their guns and jumped into police custody as fast as they possibly could.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the opposition leaders were arrested alive, because they were all arrested before this ever began...
      </p>
      <p>
       The very few bodies on the streets are all within 2 feet of a brick wall...almost as if they were anti-government guys who were lined up and shot to look like victims.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is extremely unlikely, probably impossible. Yes on primary radar all aircraft look the same, but most modern radars, especially military ones, incorporate secondary radar to overlay identification data over the primary radar contact. The primary radar serves as a back up and to track aircraft without a transponder. Otherwise the military would have a difficult time tracking which aircraft are hostile and which are friendly. And Erdogan's plane must have had the transponder running, otherwise they might have been shot down as a unidentified flight or they would not have showed up on flightradar24's ADS-B coverage if all electronics were down. Of course, anyone could have used other systems to track the plane, including the non-radar based ADS-B tracking system.

        This is the crucial question.

       <br/>
       Either the "coupists" were clueless or they were duped.
       <br/>
       What  I find hard to believe is that the pilots flying his plane did not turn its transponders off if they believed he was in danger.
His plane was circling for hours roughly between Bandirma and Balikesir, and would've been a sitting duck for any military plane.
       <br/>
       This fact, and the fact that Erdogan immediatelly sacked 2700 judges pushes me to belief that coupists were duped and that this was in fact Erdogan's ploy to remove remaining opponents on his way to establish a full control that he was not able to achieve through parliament.

       They should have captured him, not kill him, because that wouldn't win them a lot of supporters. But it is very strange why they held a coup when Erdogan wasn't in the country.

       They didn't capture a large part of the army, the army withdrew because of all the civilians surrounding them and their cause seemed pointless. At least that's what I thought at the end of the coup.

      <p>
       They only held parts of the two most important cities, it was not the entire army. There is no point in fighting for a cause when most of the citizens don't support you and rather defend the president they chose during elections.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A soldier for the most part learns to follow up orders, at the end of the day, the generals decide what the army is going to do. And the masterminds behind the coup were killed when their helicopter was shot down. That is what I could gather from the livefeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I believe all this was very suspicious and Erdogan has strengthened his position with this coup, but your points are easy to counter.

       Holding a coup when the leader isn't in the country or in the capital is pretty common. It puts them on the outside and makes communication with key officials tougher.

       Chaos isn't the goal. Coups want to establish legitimacy as quickly as possible both with their domestic populations and with the international community. Hence taking over key assets like TV stations and government buildings which aren't tactical combat points but establish the rebels as the group in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case it seems the argument of the military rebels was that they were restoring democracy and order. Staring off by executing the still-popular president would absolutely destroy that narrative. Not to mention any new government would have to assimilate quickly into the international community (eg NATO) and curry favor with Turkey's allies. The international community would absolutely condemn such a violent uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better to arrest the President and try him for whatever crimes they can muster or force him into exile if possible. I'm sure something like that was attempted (maybe assassination was too) but clearly it failed. I expect we'll get more details in the coming days.

       Establishing chaos is the last thing a coup would want and something that would benefit the government, and this situation generally applies to any Coup d'état. People support a coup as long as it seems they can cause direct political change without too much bloodshed. If there is too much chaos people will want to return to having the government in charge, because they'd rather live under a dissatisfied government than an anarchy.

       I'll agree. Just to play devil's advocate here and to propose a theory as to why this didn't work but what if it was because the military was trying to not get on the bad side of the common man and decided to not run them over and whatnot? What if it's because Erdogan called the people to take to the streets?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is all speculation as I don't know the exact favorability of Erdogan among the population; this definitely doesn't answer all the questions.

       Hearing about the "training exercise" thing makes sense. Most of the military just got confused, then when the police showed up they laid down their arms and PRACTICALLY JUMPED into police custody. One tank crew panicked and tried to GTFO...that civilian guy was probably under the belief that the tanks weren't going to touch them, but was incorrect....

       I saw that same video too. I'm explaining it away as poor driving skills by the tank driver, if you watch the video again the tank doesn't appear to veer into the crowd of people suddenly, it's just driving fast in a straight line for some time and only adjusts after hitting the guardrail (killing a couple of people).

       I'm talking about the guy who straight up stood in front of a tank and got plowed down. Thinking similar situation, tank crew just wanted to get the hell back to base, didn't see the guy and plowed him down. I'm not a tank driver, but I'd assume driving them is pretty hard and with limited visibility.

       If this was a real coup then I think you are right.  There is also the possibility that part of the plan failed and with that part failing they would never be successful.  They could of tried to take out Erdoğan but then failed.  I mean that is coup 101, to take out the leader.

         He was out of town, plus his guards evacuated him as soon as they heard about the coup. On top of that, the military weren't sure where Erdogan was to begin with, which would have made capturing him pretty difficult.
        </p>

       <li>

         The police force
         <strong>
          are
         </strong>
         Erdogan's military. The state military recruits via conscription, therefore a lot of military personnel haven't joined out of any sense of civic duty, national pride, or love for the government; they're there because they have to be. There's a lot of hate for the current government in the military, and everyone knows it. Erdogan has feared a military coup since he came into power, and has been outfitting the police with the weaponry and training to deal with that inevitability.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Soldiers often deliberately miss their targets when the enemy is not someone they hate or want to kill. This was a massive problem in Vietnam, where young men with near-perfect accuracy on the shooting range would miss constantly in action, since they felt no real resentment toward the Vietnamese people. The Turkish military don't hate cops or civillians. They weren't going out there to mow down innocent people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It wasn't the entire army. It wasn't the entire air force or tank battalion. Also, what were they going to do with those tanks and jets? Without capturing Erdogan, and/or other important government officials, the planes and tanks are useless. It's not like they're just going to start shooting and bombing things indiscriminately, just because they have the weaponry to do so. That wouldn't achieve anything other than increasing support for Erdogan. Why didn't someone in a jet just kill Erdogan during his speech or when he was in his private plane? Chaos was not the goal. Killing Erdogan would not have increased support for the military coup, it would have riled up Erdogan supporters and led to a
         <strong>
          very
         </strong>
         bloody transition; possibly a small civil war. The goal was not to kill Erdogan, it was to capture him, hold him accountable for his crimes, and replace him with secular, fair, theoretically not corrupt leadership.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because it makes him look like the clear victor. He wasn't taking a particularly risky risk. He was in a location with a building behind him, and aides and guards all around him, protecting him. He was also surrounded by a huge crowd of pro-Erdogan supporters. Nobody in that crowd would even get a chance to pull a gun before he/she was torn apart by the mob.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This coup d'etat was a total botch job, but I don't, personally, believe that it was a false flag by Erdogan himself. This has been a long time coming. Unfortunately, Erdogan has been diligent in rooting out dissidence in the military and government. The dissidents haven't had the resources, time, freedom, government insiders, or secrecy to prepare adequately, and so the coup, as far as we can tell, will most has failed.

       These tweets were all included in the live feed, and that's just a handful I grabbed quickly. I can go back and grab some more if you'd like? Also all the neutral tweets such as stories reporting on the things Erdogan is saying or the people injured in the coup are not pro-Erdogan, they're just relaying facts. I'm not denying pro-Erdogan tweets and articles were posted, but to claim that it's only (or even mostly) pro-Erdogan is hugely disingenuous.

       Is killing the current leader something that usually happens in a coup? What precedents are there for something? When I think of presidential assassination by shootdown what I think of is the event that sparked the Rawandan Genocide. And this is something that a coup would definitely wanna avoid, and avoid excessive violence in general.

       No, it's not, and i'm glad it's not something they attempted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was kind of frustrated at the coup's loss when I typed this, so I wasn't really thinking 100% logically. I was more like ''you're going to lose unless you blow him out of the sky! Just do it!'' But, you're right, chaos was not the goal. Arresting Erdogan, holding him accountable for his crimes, and restoring the country to a secular, democratic nation under new leadership was the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing Erdogan would have done nothing except created a massive amount of hatred (more than there already was) for the military among the religious, right wing, and/or indoctrinated. When restoring the country to a peaceful secular state was the goal, killing Erdogan would have been one of the worst moves they could make, and may have sparked an all out civil war, or, at least, a
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       bloody transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll edit it out of my original post now. Thanks for pulling me up on that.

         He was out of town, plus his guards evacuated him as soon as they heard about the coup. On top of that, the military weren't sure where Erdogan was to begin with, which would have made capturing him pretty difficult.

       The one thing which seemed odd to me about this was that one minute he was on facetime to CNN and the next he is outside his front door talking to whole bunch of media. How did the press know and not the military?

       Because he's the president and he has a direct line to the media. He asked them to assemble and they did. I'm sure the military knew where he was when he was giving his speech, but their intention was to safely capture him, not kill him, which would have been impossible in that situation. Erdogan had a building behind him, a huge crowd of pro-Erdogan civillians in front of him, and guards surrounding him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there was almost two hours between the Facetime and the speech, not a few minutes.

       He was 'moved to a safe house' according to the reports last night. That is why it seemed odd to me.

       Well he was democratically elected. Also often times the news try to stay on the winning side.  So if the coup actually worked you most likely would of heard much different news casts.

       It's interesting that he would say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He sounded like he was fumbling around, but a person in his position knows EXACTLY what he is saying, the fumbling is a common tactic to make it seem he is uncertain to not drastically change public opinion based on his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that so many people believe this is a false flag, that they're actually going to call it a false flag themselves to save face? I never thought I'd see the day, then again, it's another country.

       Yeah I saw this live aswell. Did you notice I think when homedude took over for Bill Oriely? He was talking about Turkey and something happening, kinda forgot what it was about.. It was something about do you support coup or not or something I cant recall.. But you could see someone was talking to him on his ear piece and he turned sideways to listen and then cut off what was being talked about and changed the whole conversation, sketchy. I really wish I remembered what it was about.

       If you add everything we know from what's been reported, none of this makes any sense.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The lack of urgency from the military, they didn't even execute basic coup tactics i.e., arrest the president and his closest officials.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Erdogan 'heroically' flies back in to Istanbul to make a speech when the situation is still out of control?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We have info from the 1,300+ soldiers being arrested,  many of them are claiming they were told this was a military exercise.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I believe Erdogan has played his country as well as a large part of the world and in doing so gained an enormous amount of support and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, let's not forget Erdogan was busted in 2014 attempting to stage a false flag to invade Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Another thing I'd like to add, at no point did the military ever come out and say they were staging a coup and 'have control of the country', like the news agencies have been reporting. Most of Turkey's top military officials are missing at this moment.

       I'm going to say that this attempted coup had some covert, alternate motive behind it on the basis that it has accomplished NOTHING. I don't have anything to say, I don't have a theory, I don't know enough. However, this coup was taken down way too easily, way too fast, and way too conveniently. Seriously, what have they accomplished? How and who is taking them down? Civilians? Give me a fucking break. If they were serious, they could have easily ran all of those people over and then make them disperse. We did not see the confrontation between the police and military, so how did they get stopped? I'm supposed to believe that they did so much planning and coordination so that they weren't unmasked but as soon as they execute the coup, they get taken down in a couple of hours? Really? How could they have miscalculated so horrendously bad? They did not take affirmative action.

       ive been watching this all night, so far this is all fog of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       we arent getting much of anything reliable on what is actually happening their.
      </p>
      <p>
       turkey has a long history of cutting the internet during things like this so its going to take some time for anything reliable to really spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as i can tell given what i have seen, its a pretty sizeable chunk of the military attempting to fufill their constitutional role of being the last line of defense responsible for maintaining the government of turkey as secular.
      </p>
      <p>
       erdogan wants a muslim state run with islamic law, obviously he is running afoul of that constitution and this appears to be the military trying to put an end to Erdogans dream of reviving the ottoman empire, and his backroom support of ISIS.

       Well, if you look at all millitary coups from the beginning, such as the ones in Libya, Yugoslavia or Venezuela (oops, sorry. Wrong country), they are almost always started by student protests (Can be throwing molotov cocktails or peaceful protests that quickly disgenerate). Heavy millitary are basically absent at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also from my knowledge this coup only lasted for a few hours and stopped after the president appeared (Followed what seems to be a Reichstag Burning clone).
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually the president appearing in a coup is a flag to ask himself to be killed, Yanukovych secretly left in the middle of a coup while Ghaddafi was found and killed by mercenaries. So yes, if there is a real coup the "coup targets" won't show themselves face up, lest be making a speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, unlike most coups against third-world governments, this is clearly staged to consolidate power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and also today is 777 day again. One more false flag to go before we end this month it seems.

       What if I told you, 2 days from now, is July 17.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 years ago on July 17, flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flight 17 was a Boeing 777 downed on July 17.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, 18 years before that, on July 17, 1996, a TWA flight 800 flying out of JFK international to Paris exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Boeing 747 is considered by some to be a shootdown that was covered up, others believe it to be the first mass casualty false flag taken by the US government.

       Sorry, was supposed to say "student protest". Most coups don't instantly go throwing molotov cocktails. they will always begin as a mask of a "peaceful protest", then quickly the molotov cocktails kick in. Then when the police takes action, the coupists will say that there is "police brutality" and begin to take further action, and usually there is little the government can do by this point.

       My guess is that Erdogasshole had the inside information, and possibly even people in many key positions, letting him know about the coup days, weeks or even months prior to its realisation. Having all the data he needed, he made from what could be his downfall to killing many birds with one stone:
- Coming back as a hero,''stopping'' the rebellion
- Getting rid of inobedient, higher ranking officers without being suspicious (i mean what the hell, over a thousand got arrested along with them)
- Having a high chance of reinstating death penalty
- Throwing a bad light on one of the last forces devoted to good old Atatürk.
But that's just my guess. I would love any contribution or correction, as I can't be sure about any given info at the moment.

       That's pretty risky. One thing is sure, the french kne about the coup and probabaly helped. They closed their embassy the 13th, two days before it, they even banned the french celebration on 14th. On 15th it happenned. They knew and the diplomacy was very slow to react to the coup compared to other nations. The french were waiting for a success and they would make a comment afterwards, they didn't want to condemn the coup. The US comment weren't condemning the coup either, only went it failed.

       I'm so glad some people are seeing this and realizing something might be up.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I spoke to one of my Turkish friends, the first thing she said to me was that something smelled fishy about it. It just very well may be a false flag to allow Erdogan sweeping control of the country and allow him to squash his substantial opposition. Although when news first broke, I also had also thought that it may have been a self-fabricated coup to replace Erdogan with some other puppet ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, it's scary that these sorts of theatrics are being used in the current day - but I guess they've always been used haven't they? Perhaps we the people are finally figuring it out?

       It could be that the entire coup was staged to consolidate Erdogan's power, while the lower ranking soldiers on the streets were just fall guys.

       The soldiers on the street were obviously young conscripts. No one knew what they were supposed to do. When the people rioted, they tried to scare them away, then got into police custody as fast as they could. Even German newspaper "Die Welt" doubts the "coup":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What kind of coup is this, with five tanks and two planes? This country has seen many coups, but nothing like this. Apparently the air force is involved, but the President can fly to Istanbul in the middle of the coup?

       It is a complete joke that Erdogan was basically in the firing line the whole time.  His plane was visible on FlightRadar sites and the "coup" leaders could have scrambled a fighter jet to shoot it down - it was a regular Turkish Airlines Boeing, not some Air Force One military craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like he
       <em>

       he was at zero risk whatsoever, just waiting for his cue to walk on stage.

       They don't have to shoot, but those guys pulled out of tanks- you mean to tell me they have no latches to secure the hatch down? I might not want to shoot you, but I would be damned if I am going to make it easy for you to pull me

       The president is trying to push sharia law in a country that doesn't support it. Some believe the coup was to try and stop this. Of course the west is pro the government because in the future they can attack a Muslim government much more easily than a secular one

       Turkey had recently made a $50billion deal with the EU to house Syrian refugees who were going to Greece and then on to Germany. They got paid for every 'refugee' they stopped crossing into Greece/Europe
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT as this Syrian mass exodus to Germany is the plan of George Soros it had to be stopped, which he tried to do with his financial influence but that didn't work so another form of intervention was required ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Becoz 81yo Soros, who has long held a grudge against Germany want's revenge for the shit he went through growing up Jewish in occupied Hungary, IIRC his father was badly treated, so Soros has little love for Germany, and now as a very rich (Old, time is running out and money isn't everything!)) man he has the power to buy situations that manipulate economies.
      </p>
      <p>
       He knows that sending 2+million Syrians and assorted ME people will totally disrupt the German system and I bet he's rubbing his hands in glee at the chaos he's slowly creating, and what's worse is he's not alone, there are a number of rich old powerful men like himself with crazy personal agendas
      </p>
      <p>
       Very simply, war is extremely profitable for a select few. Bankers like Soros are one.  And these people have absolutely Zero interest in stopping conflicts that are the source of their profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tentacles of the Military Industrial Complex spread far and touch a huge percentage of corporate America. The amount of businesses that are directly or indirectly beneficiaries of the money spent on "defence" is frightening, becoz their 'ideal customers' are people who are at war ...
      </p>
      <p>
       And now as the 'enemy' is some nebulous thing called a 'terrorist' and the "wars" are basically 'civil wars' between factions
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       a country (e.g. Syria, Afghanistan) it's really nothing to do with any other country, especially the US, which is why we won't see any US or UN intervention in these places until the 'fire is so bad it can't be put out',
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       you'll hear the chest thumping rhetoric of "something must be done"!
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if you subscribe to the idea that groups like Al qaeda and ISIS are constructs of the CIA et al then none of this shit is very surprising. IIRC the US has been
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       involved in over 40 'regime changes' since the 1970's!
      </p>
      <p>
       C.I.A. aka Capitalism's Invisible Army and Soros' "mates" are it's commanders!

       He was on holiday at the time apparently, so he wouldn't have been in Ankara or Istanbul. That's probably why.

       Some police will be armed as well, surely?

       <p>
        Why did it seem like the gunfire in the videos was aimed at nothing?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Look at combat footage from Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine or pretty much anywhere. You often can't see the enemy they're firing at, even though they are firing towards enemy combatants. The gunfire in the videos from Turkey will have been at something, you just can't see what. Especially as the videos I saw were at night and the gunfire was in the distance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How would an army attempting a coup, that has access to tanks/helis/jets just up and lose? I've been following the live feed since the beginning, they seemed to be totally dominant, with shows of force in the air, gunfire, etc... And now the president shows up, and it's over?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some in the army opposed the coup as well, and they also have access to many tanks and aircraft. It wasn't a coup by the entire army. So "the president shows up and it's over" is not what happened.

        Why is the president now giving a speech, after an "attempted coup" with the military still in control of weapons, and a lot of the country still wanting his head?

      <p>
       Is it really surprising for a politician to make a speech during a crisis?

       So, why would a military coup decide to act when the president is still in the country, but not easily available to the coup?
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes no sense. The whole point of a coup is to either start it when the leader is actually out of the country and take over completely and don't let him back in...or kidnap him while he is there.

       Just some internal cleaning and aligning political ideas. The world knows Hillary will be president so they are trying to erase the people in opposition so the politicians can sit on top of the military. It's going to be crazy defense spending, inventive chaos events, a surge in legislation and global adherence.

       An entire battalion was stationed outside Erdogans vacation address. Probably to prevent snatching. So he knew something was going to happen that period. Now that my friend, is something fishy.

       I figure there's two possibilities for this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Erdogan's purges weakened his opposition in the military enough for them to try a last ditch effort to take the country while he was away on vacation. This would explain the limited resources, lack of support in the upper ranks, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Equally plausible is a false flag by Erdogan meant to consolidate power. He uses this as an excuse to execute anyone in opposition to him and shut down political rivals as now he can claim they're "traitors".

         that is a good question, usually you would want to take out leaders before anything else.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The military units could of not been that confidant about the plan.  This gets into number 1 as well.  There was a report I read about an attempted attack on  Erdoğan.  If true then this could of played out just like the attempt coup in Nazi Germany that tried to take out Hitler.  Basically without taking out Erdoğan the plan had no chance.

       <li>
        <p>
         Warning shots?  I mean the last thing you would want to do in a coup would be to start killing mass amount of civilians, you would need them on your side.  Or I could see it as a way to strike fear into the minds of the people they where  going after.
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         It is hard to say if all those thing were actually maned by the people trying to pull off the coup.  There were jets that shot down helicopters occupied by the coup units.

       By the way, being so "sure" that the "script" is exactly how you say it is makes you sound like Alex Jones, nobody is going to believe someone who acts like that, the best way to get people to start asking questions is to provoke them to well... start asking questions, rather than giving them the answers.

       I know you're trying to help, but I've seen a million and one posts like yours where you're so sure that you've figured it all out, and a million of those have been wrong.

      <p>
       Get people to ask questions, don't give them answers. If you give someone answers, and you turn out to be wrong, you're only hurting the cause.

       Be very careful in thinking that you're right about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to think to yourself how you gained the knowledge that you have, was it by someone telling you everything, or was it you questioning things and doing research yourself?

       Everyone has to figure it out for themselves, you screaming like Alex Jones only hurts the cause, it causes people to turn away and call us loonies.

       How long have you been in the conspiracy scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been since 2006-ish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've lived through so many end of the worlds, times when I was supposed to be thrown into a fema camp, times when martial law was supposed to be inacted, times when I was supposed to get nuked, 2012, etc... I ignored them, refusing to be paranoid, it's all to keep you living in fear, they have NO intention of removing us, why would they remove such a great system where they take the spoils? Would be completely moronic on their part.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between the amount of people asking questions in 2006 and now is absolutely massive, if you have been in the scene for as long as I have (only 10 years), then you know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give in to the fear, get people to ask questions.

       Then you should have got the basics long ago:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why those aware that 9/11 was an inside job and that Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax will not react
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main reasons: the truth is too horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cognitive dissociation will make people refuse to live with the admission that the same people who they pay taxes to and get news from are part of the same gang that forced people to jump-off windows or vaporized first responders at the WTC towers in 2001 and is now crucifying christians and carrying out mass beheadings now in Raqqa, Syria and Sirte, Libya.

       Judging by my thread vs yours, my thread reaches more people. It's all about how you say it. I've done a lot of work posting on several conspiracy sites over the years, I've learned to how to get people engaged.

       Like I said before, sounding like Alex Jones when you relay information, right or wrong, will make people disinterested. I promise you if you don't see that now, you will in the future.

       See, this is your issue, you jump to conclusions then try to let the world know what you think, rather than getting them to think.

       By the way, saying "End Times" is a fear tool, and you're spreading it just as much as they are.

       As I've said before, as scarce as truth is, the supply has always been in excess of the demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you would expect from the Laws of End Times Reductionism, the process representing how the masses are confronted with the HORRIBLE TRUTH about their last days in Illuminatziland, involves only five entities and resumes to only three steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Five Entities involved in the Process
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Matt Marriott, the last End Times Prophet;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kyoon, the first and so far only one to echo the TRUTH;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Google, the path allowing to access the TRUTH;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the illuminati media;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the audience, i.e. the sheeple who formally accepted the Mark of the Beast and now simply wait to be slaughtered.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Three Steps involved in the Process
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         TRUTH is revealed (WHAT happened and what is going to happen; WHY it happened or will happen) by the last End Times Prophet and echoed by Kyoon. The Laws of End Times Reductionism are found at the basic layer of the TRUTH.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anyone who thanks to Google has been confronted with the Truth will refuse to accept it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once the predicted TRUTH begins to unfold, there are three possible cases:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       a) Illuminati media pretends that it is actually not happening;
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Illuminati media uses the "
       <em>
        back into the future
       </em>
       " technique to announce it will happen at same point;
      </p>
      <p>
       c) Illuminati media uses the "
       <em>
        shock and awe
       </em>
       " technique to officially announce it.

       You're completely missing my point. You want to reach people but you don't know how to reach people, so all of your efforts are in vain, the only people you're reaching with the way you're talking is people that already know whats going on, and even then, you're turning away those.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be like you, like I said, in time you'll learn.

       I'm talking to you like a human, and you're turning around on me with bullet points. You have to learn how to communicate, regardless of how much knowledge you may or may not be able to offer to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you're calling EVERYONE "fools" in your spam post is pretty telling. I'll repeat, be very careful in thinking that you know everything, it'll cause you far more harm than good.

        hangs up phone

      <p>
       USA then calls Turkish miltary officers
      </p>
      <p>
       USA - So we know you hate Erdogan, wanna overthrow him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Miltary - Sure
      </p>
      <p>
       USA - Ok, go ahead and we'll recognize you and help you out like we do the Syrian rebels
      </p>
      <p>
       Miltary - Great, on our way
      </p>
      <p>
       USA waits a couple of hours then calls back Erdogran
      </p>
      <p>
       USA - So about that request
      </p>
      <p>
       Erdogan - Ok, ok we submit, we'll do what you want
      </p>
      <p>
       USA - Good, fly back to the capital, you'll be safe

      <p>
       USA then calls the miltary officers

      <p>
       USA - Yea so about that coup, we've decided not to get involved, the situation has changed, you're on your own...&lt;click&gt;
