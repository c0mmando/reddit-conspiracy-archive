       As we suspected: "The 28 pages" tie former Saudi Prince US ambassador Bandar "Bush" and his wife to terrorists which is a direct link to then President G W Bush who classified these pages, provided exit aircraft to Saudi suspects during the airspace stand down and later received hundreds of miilions from Saudis through Carlyle coinvestments profits in exchange for taking out Saudi oil competitor Iraq and thus keeping Saudi oil profits exorbitant for another decade.
       <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/declasspart4.pdf">
        http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/declasspart4.pdf
       </a>
       link to the pages look around pages 17 and 18 .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush's engaged in high treason for oil profits laundered through Carlyle. At the LEAST the Bush's were freindly and provided post facto cover and escape for those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the USA  and received enormous compensation for it through Carlyle and Saudi coinvestments. (Saudis gave Carlyle members money to invest in companies which Carlyle then sold at enormous profits allowing all partners like George Bush's family to make millions. (Nice laundry just like the Clinton Foundation now. And remember  Tony Blair was also in it and john major and former secretaries of defense etc etc )
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember former Presidnet George H W Bush was literally at a Carlyle meeting with Saudis and relatives of Bin Laden at the Ritz hotel when 9/11 happened. Ambassodor Bandar ... whom matron Barbara Bush reffered to as another Bush son they were so close.. was reportedly called to the White House and given priviledged info immediately after 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now remember that Hillary Clinton's foundation received huge sums from Saudi Arabia and Hillary's number one assistant Huma Abedin's family is from the home of the 9 11 terrorists Jeddah, Saudi Arabia were numerous members of Huma's direct nearest family are linked to known terrorist organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The saudi bribary of most elected us congressmen and others has been documented in books going back to the 70's. It was also a huge focus of Michael Moore's (sorry) movie Fareinheit 9/11 which you can watch for free here
       <a href="https://freedocumentaries.org/documentary/fahrenheit-911">
        https://freedocumentaries.org/documentary/fahrenheit-911
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump  will need to first root out all Saudi bribed or placed officials in the US government from decades ago.  If you include those such as Comey and Loretta Lynch who were placed and approved by both democrats and republicans into positions of agency you begin to see how those bribes worked across the aisles to get both republicans and democrats to work togetherto place people in positions to cover the money flow up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion the level of inflitration by Saudi paid people into the us government far exceeds the threat feared of old soviet spies sleepers decades ago.  The Saudi control clearly has reached at least two past presidents( g h w bush and g W bush ) and nearly included both probable nominees for president this year Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.

       Begin quote
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To begin, let us give you a little background. Huma Abedin was born in Michigan in 1976, but her father moved the family to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 1978, to start the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, in co-operation with the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, an organization started by Abdullah Omar Naseef, an Al Qaeda financier (with whom Huma later served on the board with). Her father was active in the Muslim Brotherhood, while her mother was active in the Muslim Sisterhood, a similar organization (more on her later). In 1993, her father passed, and 1994, Huma returned to America to attend George Washington University. There, she became quite active in the Muslim Student Association, the collegiate arm of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 1996, she first interned for Hillary Clinton, becoming a full time assistant in 2000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Huma’s brother is an interesting case. Hassan Abedin served on a fellowship, the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies, under the supervision of Abdullah Omar Naseef, the founder of Rabita Trust, a Designated Global Terrorist Entity which had its funds frozen in 2001. Hussan served on the Board of Trustees of OCIS from 2004-2006, and remained a member until at least 2010, serving concurrently with Naseef.
       </p>
       <p>
        Huma’s mother, Saleha Abedin, is an avowed member of the Muslim Sisterhood, and a stout proponent of Sharia Law.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       End quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeddah is the heart of all the 9 11 hijackers. The heart of ossama bin laden. The heart of the Saudi support of radical Islamic terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       How has that woman been anywhere close to the US Government?
      </p>
      <p>
       They must have Hillary and bill blackmailed with the congress that the Saudis have paid off and they must tell her to do what they want or all those Saudi paid off  congressmen will start calling comey and telling him to make her jail time real.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems the Saudis have successfully done what people in the 80's  always said the Russians would do...plant deep sleeper cells or moles in the usa in order to have them rise to high government positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We simply have to bankrupt the saudis. They control our country with their oil money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it seems like right now Hillary Clinton is the Saudi's chosen mole to take over the usa presidency at least since Trump defeated their double down candidate Jeb Bush.

       Man, I was just thinking about old uncle Bandar and the Bush crime family this morning. And the Clinton crime family, and wondering what they had on Lynch, and how it all ties together. And the Saudi royal family and its wayward nephew Osama. Funny how our guys found old Osama and didn't even want to talk to him. Just rushed in and blew him away and threw his body in the ocean before anyone could say let's have a look. Sure, that makes sense.

       Its not sleeper cells, your a little off on that. Its straight business deals. If you look at timelines it started in the late 70s right after the Vietnam war. Bush Sr was part of the JFK assassination and Bay of Pigs(Operation Zapata). The family made billions for the Military industrial complex building US bases in Vietnam from their company Brown &amp; Root( Brown Brothers Harriman) . They new they needed new wars so this is the pivot from Vietnam and Cuba to the Muslim world. Its about the same period we started putting people like Hussein and others in power over there. The Saudis are loyal business partners who gave Bush Bin Laden ( actually their most loyal son) to fight Russia in Aghganistan by 1979. He was then turned on the west for the new terrorist wars and the Saudi government did their part helping destabilize the region. Your right Iraq was the major payoff to them for their help and they knew they were running out of oil there so one last big payday. Now that oil is dying their only use is continued destabilization of the region but they are loosing money quickly so they are being thrown under a bus before they Narc on the Bushes which they have actually been doing lately. The Bushes have been part of the game since Prescotts father awarded the largest ever small arms contract to Remmington for WW1. The Clinton's are Bush loyalists since Mena airport and look Clinton becomes President only a few years later.

       Saudi oil money is still more abundant than any other source even at depressed prices. But remmeber they have always been able to count on a bush to get in power to wipe out their competitors and get the oil price high again for them.

       Fracking showed that at $100 a barrel  the usa becomes self sufficient and market dominant but there is a big space between  $30 and $100.

       This is my first post in this sub, because I usually think of 'conspiracy theories' as being on the level of Big Foot sightings and alien anal probing stories, but damn have I become disillusioned.  It's not like Nixon would ever sabotage Viet nam peace talks just to win a fucking election,
       <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/yes-nixon-scuttled-the-vietnam-peace-talks-107623">
        right?
       </a>
       And even if he did, it's not like any later presidents would ever do anything nearly so evil, right? (/s)  Given all the shenanigans pulled by the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Saudis, et al, I find OP's version of reality more plausible than the official narrative.  Maybe Bush didn't know 9/11 was going to happen, maybe everything really is as it seems, but all the ignored warnings, his My Pet Goat delayed reaction, flying the bin Ladens out of the country, the Saudi connections, Cheney's oil connections, the 28 pages being classified for so long, Sibel Edwards' treatment alerting superiors about the Turkish translations, it's all an enormous amount of smoke, and it gets harder and harder to believe there's no fire underneath it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the official reactions to Snowden's revelations (traitor! spy!) I used to think the US was largely "the good guy."  After seeing the nonstop drumbeat of 'fuck the 4th Amendment because terrorism' by the Feinstein-types  in Washington and 'there's no problem we can't solve by bombing it' by the McCain-types, I find it much easier to understand why
       <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/gallup-poll-biggest-threat-world-peace-america-1525008">
        the entire planet considered the US the greatest threat to world peace.

       Bush jr was a puppet for his dad who is a criminal mastermind.  Jr was basically on the phone with dad the whole 8 yrs.  The lump on Jr.'s back during the first presidential Debate was a hidden headphone to get fed lines cyrano de bergerac style.  Dad, Cheney and Rummy went way back and they perpetrated Iran Contra.
