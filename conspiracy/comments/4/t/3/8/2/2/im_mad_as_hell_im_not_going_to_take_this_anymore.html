Everybody&#39;s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel&#39;s worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there&#39;s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there&#39;s no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen terrorist attacks and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be! We all know things are bad -- worse than bad -- they&#39;re crazy. It&#39;s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don&#39;t go out any more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we&#39;re living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, &quot;Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my smart-phone and my PC and my Pokemon-Go, and I won&#39;t say anything. Just leave us alone. Well, I&#39;m not going to leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don&#39;t want you to protest. I don&#39;t want you to riot. I don&#39;t want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn&#39;t know what to tell you to write. I don&#39;t know what to do about the debt and the corruption and the terrorists and the crime in the street. All I know is that first, you&#39;ve got to get mad. You&#39;ve gotta say, &quot;I&#39;m a human being, goddammit! My life has value!&quot;So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,&quot;I&#39;m as mad as hell,and I&#39;m not going to take this anymore&quot;!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all comes back to the same thing. The Federal Reserve. In order for us to change and truly get to the root we need to abolish the monetary system and execute anyone involved with the Feds. </p>

<p>We live in a world where one family is sitting in a room with their finger on the &quot;collapse the economy&quot; button. Until we break free from their grasp we will never change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. I think a lot of people are waking up and transfering their wealth (if they are lucky enough to have some) into things which are not fiat currency. </p>

<p>Step 1 is educating ourselves. I&#39;m currently reading &quot;The Creature from Jekyl Island&quot; but have also watched  Money Masters and Yellow Brick Road by Bill Still as well as &quot;Federal Reserve: a century of enslavement&quot; on youtube. I think those are good starts but the next step is organising to a level where people can be actively informed en masse of these things. Holding screenings, book clubs etc is a good way. Even if you just join a book reading club and wait your turn to choose the book. Anything helps.   once you understand the level of fraud the Fed and its cabal has inflicted on not only the USA but the world for hundreds of years there&#39;s no going back to ignorance.  This is the struggle of our times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the main problems we face is not just the monetary system itself but all the laws being put in place to protect it. Things like not being allowed to collect rain water, farmers being put out of business by corporations, water being drained from our lakes, reliance on fossil fuels the list goes on. EVERYTHING is in place to protect the Federal Reserve. When you cant grow your own food, cant collect your own water, cant travel where you need to go, suddenly the monetary system is a necessity. I am actually of the opinion there is nothing that can be done. It is depressing but i just cant fathom not only waking up so many people but convincing them to live an Amish style life until we sort out a new system. Because that is what will happen. I am sort of in fear lately about some of OBama&#39;s executive orders. I feel we are entering an extremely dark time where the Feds are actually going to press that collapse button at the same time as starting a world war forcing America into slavery or a possible U.N. or Chinese invasion. It sounds crazy but things are playing out exactly as many people suspect it would.</p>

<p>I think our first step needs to be for military high ups to realize what they are doing and join forces with the people not the establishment. A coup is needed not just in Turkey, but globally, especially in the U.S. We need a shift of power as the folks in power now are modern day slavers. Soldiers need to think about their children and the direction they are leading them. One of the biggest illusions of our time is that we feel we need to convince politicians of our needs but the truth is we need to convince our soldiers and law enforcement. THEY are the ones that can change the tide of this uphill battle. Growing up i always wondered why police are against the people standing up for civil liberties and freedom of speech. Like...Drop the riot shield and stand with us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a duty to disobey corrupt laws. Their immoral laws and blatant attacks on liberty reveal the true nature of this government. You have two options. Fight them with everything you have or escape to another country. IMO USA will collapse in the next 15-30 years at the latest.  Personally im going to move to Africa as soon as I can. Get some land far away from anything and have a small farm.  I know it&#39;s dangerous compared to living in the suburbs of a western town, but only for now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome :) If you&#39;d like to read a novel to switch it up, I&#39;d read Atlas Shrugged.  Its a little rant-y and really beats a dead horse sometimes but you can skim those areas. It helped me get some insight on the though method (how people justify themselves) that keeps this &quot;death economy&quot; rolling.  Also if you want to check out the podcast Congressional Dish, she does a great episode that runs through Puerto Rico trying to file for bankruptcy and why they can&#39;t &lt;&lt; good background for economic hit man.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your passion for the issues is warranted I agree, but a vast majority of the people here in the USA anyways don&#39;t want more violence. That is what we will get with an uprising.</p>

<p>The police have shown what lengths they will go to in order to restore the &quot;peace&quot; by using a robot to kill a man without the courts to decide his fate. People said meh its ok he had it coming.</p>

<p>Its like they have given the rights away to those with the least regard for human life. Now before you say well he shot cops. I ask did he really? I mean we don&#39;t have anything but the cops saying he said all that shit. </p>

<p>I have always believed that our government was set up for the people in the beginning, and slowly it devolved into what we have today. Its why we have different branches is so that no one branch can take over. </p>

<p>I try to engage people in discussion at my work on current issues, but they always side with the outcome saying it was the best course. Many of us here have seen enough killing within the branches of armed forces to know that simply killing your opposition doesn&#39;t solve the problems that were there to begin with.</p>

<p>Someone said educating ourselves is the first step. Yeah sounds great but how can you tell someone that everything they were told is a lie? They don&#39;t accept it nor will they even with evidence seeing as that is how their personality is formed?</p>

<p>Then you say RIOT, and PROTEST the current political structure. LOL they won&#39;t cause they have never experienced what is any different. They have no clue because so many have never left this country. </p>

<p>When you encourage them too they always find reasons as to why not. Like Australia. I lived there for two years. Sure they have their problems with current structure as does everyone else, but the majority of the population there is different. They have this quality of life aspect we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I was there when the housing bubble burst. I saw the tent cities and the people living in their cars within parking garages with a family. When I called back here to the states not one person knew what I was talking about. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t believe a word I said about the state of fucked it really was cause it didn&#39;t effect them. What we need is a tv channel that would expose all this shit.</p>

<p>The media propaganda machine is the most powerful weapon we have ever had because it can sway the public to your side so quickly. </p>

<p>Soon we will have a class war within the USA. I used to think it was going to be a race war because of this black lives matter thing. Now we have so many waking up to how its all just horse shit.</p>

<p>These people by the majority don&#39;t care about anyones lives but their own and how they can trivialize real issues to be part of the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good points.  I think discussion can only go so far and unfortunately violence is unavoidable thanks to how far this situation has progressed.   </p>

<p>It seems like at this point that violence can either be a violent removal of those who seek to degenerate and destroy society or a violent civil war between different groups pushed towards conflict by an unseen hand.  </p>

<p>I think the internet is that new media you mentioned. We are here talking about this. It would have been impossible 20-30 years ago. This is a totally new era of history.  I think we can overcome tyranny just through doing things like trying to improve our own communities.  No one is against that , and once communities are unified they will eventually run into the same hurdles (debt creation, banks, corruption etc). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. I think most people on this sub know.  Gotta get off the grid, become self-sufficient. Actually organise into those &#39;well regulated militias&#39;.  People say &#39;it doesnt matter if you have weapons coz the government has Jets, tanks etc&#39; but they dont understand that if a few citizens are holding their block or land and the government does an air strike on US soil. It would be a biiiiig problem for the government. They would lose control of the military and get ousted by opposing government forces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Network is misread. This speech is big, but take it&#39;s context ...</p>

<p>an insane man who is suicidal being tapped from above to rant like this. He ushers in tabloid journalism and fake news. Look at his friends: &quot;Sybil the Soothsayer.&quot; Then you have radicals working directly with the media or the media working directly with radicals? Like some fake agent provocateur operation mockingbird shit.</p>

<p>Then the end point is that nations no longer exist, and corporations and the market rule the world.</p>

<p>This speech is an example of controlled opposition (though he doesn&#39;t know he is controlled, so that + useful idiot.)</p>

<p>The movie shows people WANTING this to be true. They NEED this to be true. However, it accomplishes nothing. It&#39;s packaged and sold to them by the same corporations that are ruining their lives.</p>

<p>Network is thus a warning about the realities of Late Capitalism, though given the time period it has a bit of a Late Capitalism/1984 feel, while what I think we ultimately get is more of a Late Capitalism/Brave New World thing.</p>

<p>For an explanation of how this corporate sin/salvation ended up playing out see:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a great movie, but I think it&#39;s often misread.</p>

<p>Also, think about the title &quot;Network&quot; not just in relations to TV, but to corporations and the new world order. I&#39;ll put the &#39;nwo&#39; in lower case. You can believe in some vast panned conspiracy there if you like. However, it&#39;s just as possible that the invisible hand of the market itself rearranged the world itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Help me please. How can I begin finding my own truth in this tsunami of false info, half truths, and utter bullshit being stuffed down my throat and back up my ass? </p>

<p>Can someone make a composite or a forum of places to start with REAL info on how these devious plans came to fruition and are implemented today? </p>

<p>I know only what I read and I&#39;m sick and tired of being misinformed about the facts because everyone has their own agenda and bias. A page of 100% facts that aren&#39;t supporting any faction would be nice. </p>

<p>I know many will say do your own research, but how can one starting their search find truth when many sites are disinfo, catering to the elite&#39;s agenda, or just completely absurd. </p>

<p>What are some conversational strategies to use to get the skeptics thinking critically? I all ready know it&#39;s useless being blunt about what&#39;s going on. How does one get another to think outside the box tactfully? </p>

<p>I too am fucking sick of feeling feeble to TPTB when I know none of us are. There&#39;s this knot twisting and turning in my gut telling me to get the fuck up and let your people know you&#39;re being fucked at every conceivable angle. BUT HOW. </p>

<p>Please guys. I want somewhere to start. I need concrete facts and reliable sources to back up everything. It sucks stumbling on my words and not being able to clearly communicate what is really happening. </p>

<p>Thank you guys. I know there are some genuine people here wanting the world to move in a direction of absolute freedom. Love and know thyself. Love and know thy neighbor. Never falter. </p>

<p>YES!  First step is realising its the problem!  Fortunately for you and for all humanity we have a system of formal logic which can help you determine truth. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking">Critical thinking</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">propositional logic</a>  Will give you the ability to tell if an argument is logical or not. Try to avoid using or being mislead by <a href="http://www.relativelyinteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/LogicalFallaciesInfographic_A2.png">these</a> tricks.  You have to decide the facts for yourself. I would say never to trust any media source to give you unbiased information. Look at both sides and form a synthesis. </p>

<p>Look in the side bar for a list of confirmed conspiracies.  IMO you should focus first on improving your own community and building trust and relationships with people who are also on that path. Volunteer to help the homeless or to help veterans or soemthing like that.  When those people know you, and know you are genuinely concerned with making society better then you can start to mention things. Step one is to find out which power group they trust, be it mainsteam media, the government, a political ideology and slowly reveal that there is misinformation pushed under that name.  I think the most important one is waking people up to the debt slavery from the Federal Reserve &quot;bank&quot;. </p>

<p>Does that answer your questions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say before getting mad, get love....love and peace in the mind can stop any negative energy at the door.  In the end what matters the most is your emotional state since all of the conditions in the world can&#39;t take away the choice to love.  (The things you listed make it hard to love, but the challenge makes it more beautiful when you overcome.) I&#39;m not preaching ignorance to achieve happiness.  I think awareness brings out possibilities that shouldn&#39;t complicate our existence.  They make us aware that the possibilities are endless at this point.  </p>

<p>Anger is cancer and it&#39;s what they sell.  Love is the only constant that can bring positive changes.  That energy is real.</p>

<p>Otherwise you&#39;ve hit the nail.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>High level comment.  Yes this is definitely the best path for individuals and for our species. Love, unity, awareness.    Unfortunately though there are individuals in this world who are incapable of love or kindness. They cannot be reasoned with by words alone. It&#39;s not wrong to destroy those people so that humanity might prosper. In the Vedic/Hindu religions there is the concept of Shiva the destroyer. It&#39;s not destruction with a manic purpose but similar to how we knock down an old unsafe building to build something new like a hospital. Sometimes destruction of evil is necessary and part of this test of being a human being.  </p>
