        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know my post history isn&#39;t <em>always</em> a unique perspective, nor do I consider myself an incredibly talented writer. I do usually try to take my bias&#39;s out of things when necessary... But I digress.</p>

<p>I am going to be starting a website soon, in an effort to both spread information and unite people. I know, I know, there are a million different sites like what I am proposing. I believe that I, along with my team of people have a unique perspective on things, we come from different backgrounds and have varying experience in journalism/writing. Save your &quot;Everyone does that!&quot; shit. I don&#39;t want to hear it. </p>

<p>What I am asking is what would you guys suggest to make this a better site than the others, one more appealing to the general population? I already have told my people that no biases allowed, and we are going to go <em>outside</em> the typical left/right black/white us/you paradigm. What else would you suggest?</p>

<p>Also, the main question I have, is what would you suggest for a name? I have had suggestions of Vox Vulgaris (latin for common voice), or using that in other languages, or possibly something along the lines of Peace Anarchy. Not sure how I feel about those, but they give the general feeling I would like to convey.</p>

<p>Please, again, save your shitting on the idea I don&#39;t want to hear it. If you truly want things to change, help me do that. If I get things up and running I will keep you guys updated, and although I am <strong>not</strong> trying to get donations, that is not the point of this post, eventually that may be something I will need so I can purchase a domain. I will keep that discussion out of here though and only message anyone that has explicitly stated they would be interested in contributing. </p>

<p>One last thing. If you think that you would like to possibly join, let me know. Shoot me a PM with some sort of semblance of a convincing reason why you should be included.</p>

<p><strong>I am serious about this. This is not some BS idea, this is something I have been working on and brainstorming with my people for a little while now.</strong></p>

<p>One last thing. Anyone with experience in building a website, buying a domain, etc, I would love any advice you have as well. </p>

<p>Thank you all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some one who would be a very good idea to try an emulate was stormcloudsgathering</p>

<p>he did a great job, but has since dropped off the face of the earth working on some sort of sustainable compound i south america or something.</p>

<p>he was very focused on giving you the sources and then providing a monologue that pushed you to ask the right questions of an event rather than feeding you answers.</p>

<p>people are much more open to being lead to answers than given them wholesale.</p>

<p>the focus imho should be pushing people to ask their own questions after you have pointed them to a rock to look under.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! I totally agree. I realize that in all my social media presences I do inject my bias and personal opinion, but I do that minimally while almost always providing sources, quotes, etc. The Socratic method is what I strive for, and on the website it will be heavily moderated to avoid too much opinion.</p>

<p>That being said, some things do call for a more human approach, although those times are fairly rare, and even then it is best to be kept to a minimum. I just do not want to have myself or the others working with me feel as if their free speech is being restricted, because to me, what I stand for is the foundation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights... but I digress. I&#39;ve been drinking lol.</p>

<p>Was stormcloudsgathering their exact username? I&#39;ll look them up if it is, see if maybe they&#39;re just lurking now.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, if you see this tonight, you seem like you&#39;d have a good idea of the general workings of this sub, what would be the best time to post at topic like this? I see it&#39;s already going to be mostly ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://stormcloudsgathering.com/">http://stormcloudsgathering.com/</a></p>

<p>thats his website, hes been mia for about 4 or 5 months now</p>

<p>on the whole bias thing, its impossible to have no bias, we are a product of our upbringing etc.</p>

<p>i may be an atheist, but i was raised as catholic (which imho is why i am now an atheist) so i have a world view framed by all the years of sunday school and sermons that i had to listen too.</p>

<p>no matter what i do their will be some bias that is based on those fables and stories i was raised with even though i now believe them all to be bullshit.</p>

<p>the best you can hope for is to catch your personal bias, and expose that yourself. having an Editor who has a different bias to you is always a good thing for that reason.</p>

<p>so if your group is say 90% conspiracy supporting, have your least supportive person act as your editor and tell them to call you out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really like that website, although I do see flaws in it. The general message of it though, at first glance, I <em>really</em> like.</p>

<p>On bias, I know that it is impossible to remove. I&#39;ll spare you the details of my personal life, but I would say out of the people I have there are people ranging from full out anarchy to (somewhat regrettably) someone who supports Hillary (with acknowledgment of her shit). That person also shows me more in other areas though, like what you&#39;re saying - as an editor. They are the best in regards to grammar, spelling, professionalism; although we all have that quality to an extent. </p>

<p>Right now, the idea is to have limited posts, basically have a topic given to each of us, have us write something with sources, present to the group, then have time to form counter arguments, check that - and then, agree on the best parts of each piece from all of us and compile it into one. Of course we will have individual pieces as well, but I want quality, not quantity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well from sounds of things you&#39;ve got a pretty diverse group, what might be a good approach given how you want to divy up topics, is to do profiles (annon like with a tag name or whatever) where you can sort of highlight any bias&#39;s the team may have.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t have an issue with a biased article as long as the author is aware of and up front with what their bias is.</p>

<p>just be sure when you vet your sources you get the whole team in on that. your shillary fan, is actually quite helpful, they will be able to make those knee jerk assumptions before you publish which should help you address those peoples spin before the article is posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is basically the plan, highlighting the bias in an effort to eliminate it. I know we all have biases, but like you said, if you are up front with it, then it is obvious and people can make their own assumptions based upon the actual content of the article.</p>

<p>That is my thoughts exactly on the shillary dude. The others have questioned me on inviting him, but I know what I want, and he is helpful for the reason you gave - opposite opinion. I am aware I am by no means a genius or revolutionary when it comes to writing, but at the risk of sounding nihilistic, I believe that my <em>vision</em> is revolutionary. No, the ideas aren&#39;t necessarily something that hasn&#39;t been thought of before, but the way I see in my mind of presenting them, along with how I would like to unite everyone, and include anyone who shows me a reason they should be, and...well, other things in my head that are hard to explain other than just saying my vision... I think it is revolutionary. God knows we need it.</p>
