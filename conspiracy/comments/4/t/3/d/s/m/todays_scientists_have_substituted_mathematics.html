    <div class="md"><p>For those interested in learning more about anti-institutional perspectives in academic mathematics, I would highly suggest <a href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/%7Ezeilberg/OPINIONS.html">Doron Zeilberger&#39;s opinions page</a>. Professor Zeilberger provides a very fresh perspective on what mathematics <em>ought</em> to be, rather than what it is. He also gave me feedback on a paper I wrote, despite being an amateur <em>and</em> an outsider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many aspects of science should relegated to philosophical theorizing anyway. Take the following example: </p>

<p>&#39;This sentence is false.&#39;</p>

<p>The above statement is both false and true simultaneously, however the rigid confines of materialist science which requires some repeatable, observable, and taking only 1 position (true or false but not both) is the &#39;only&#39; way in can be.</p>

<p>The limits of scientific method are also self evident in that the end result has to be proven to be objectively true, and yet this &#39;true objectivity&#39; is always 100% experienced by everyone through the lens of subjectivity, and if you want to claim, say a subjective experience of something, its always thrown out the window as anecdotal and unimportant because science can&#39;t really enter into subjectivity, even just 25 years ago the study of &#39;consciousness&#39; was seen as woo, lol</p>

<p>Then the method requires &#39;repeatability&#39;, however look at reality itself, the present moment can never ever be repeated again in terms of this split second right now, by the time you try to measure it, its gone, and yet measuring the present moment, the way all the atoms/stars/winds/dust/light have all their specific locations in that present moment, by the next moment everything has already moved quite a bit so your &#39;repeatability&#39; is moot.</p>

<p>Regardless, the method of mathematics to predict possibilities is actually very critical, genuine, and awesome in its ability to do so. However it can all easily breakdown in situation of additional dimensions or other Universes on the other side of blackholes that may not operate the way our universe does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your critique reminds me of my own problems with sociology. Despite the importance of recognizing subjectivity in our methods and developing an empirical basis for arguments, most of my fellow students never got past the core ideas of functionalism and conflict theory.</p>

<p>What you said anout repeatability is very similar to Einstein&#39;s critique of early applications of quantum systems in physics - essentially the best we can do is analyze it over and over through as many perspectives and experiments as we can until we have enough information to conclude what the behavior of systems as a whole are like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read &quot;The Electric Sky&quot; by Donald Scott or &quot;The Electric Universe&quot; by Talbot for an example of how mainstream science doesn&#39;t always bring us to the best explanations.  Aside from this, the discoveries in Quantum Mechanics has turned science on its head as it proves that the materialistic worldview is just plain wrong.  Though the sciences still avoid and ignore these implications, as much as it can.  The next revolution in our understanding of the universe is being hampered by stubborn academics who can&#39;t handle the truth.  (Conspiratorial view: new discoveries may be suppressed by certain megacorporations like the petroleum industry who don&#39;t want anything to change.) Consciousness may be the key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That too.  But mechanistic physics will never fully explain the universe because the material world is most likely an illusion, if a persistent one in our eyes.  But scientists just can&#39;t seem to give it up.  I also recommend &quot; The Holographic Universe&quot; by Talbot for a take on this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize it&#39;s hard to tell when someone&#39;s joking on reddit, so: I was joking. </p>

<p>At the same time, there&#39;s some truth in jokes. The sciences are so rarefied and specialized these days, the lay person is hardly in any position to evaluate their claims and findings. Physics in particular models levels of reality not accessible to the human sensorium, whole worlds that are inhospitable to human cognition.</p>

<p>It all sounds a bit loony tunes. The physicists say, that&#39;s because the universe is fundamentally loony tunes, by human standards. Ok, I&#39;ll buy that. </p>
