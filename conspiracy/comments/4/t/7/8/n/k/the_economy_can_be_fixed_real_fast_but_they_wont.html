        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory. In a corrupt government (most on earth), the economy has to grow faster than it leaks. </p>

<p>Why does an economy leak and what does it leak? The economy leaks money. Money is taken out of the economy through the combined effort of government and massive corporations. The only way an economy can grow is if it brings in more than it leaks. </p>

<p>If we were to create an equal opportunity system (true equal opportunity), there cannot be any leaks. Leaks are a total waste and they screw up the whole system. Cancer cells are similar. Cancer cells actually take a lot of energy and they don&#39;t offer anything back to the body like normal cells do. The cancer cells leach of the body until the body dies or a cure occurs. </p>

<p>There are trillions that have leaked out and money is being leaked as I write this here. They leak the money and hide it in tax free havens. </p>

<p>The bigger the leak, the worst off a country is. Some of the worst 3rd world countries have a disastrous economic pipeline full of leaks. It hasn&#39;t gotten that bad in America yet but it will eventually unless a cure is found. </p>

<p>The 2 cures are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Voluntary secession of illegal activity related to leaking money. </li>
<li>A system upgrade that has mechanism to prevent leaks. </li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of good people out there voluntarily restrict themselves from scams that screw the country. Ben and Jerries is a great company that represents this type of person. Others are always looking for ways to leak money out of the economy and into their own tax free havens. </p>

<p>We need to stop these leaks and restore the economy because this is the precise solution to our economic problems. We can keep growing the economy fast enough to stay ahead of the leaks but that only means the economy has to move faster and faster to keep up with all the financial loss so eventually this method will crash. </p>

<p>The only choice is to get into the engine and fix the leaks. If we can at least agree on this, then we can work our way up to fixing the system. Some people would say this is a daunting task but this is how life has always been. We always worry about daunting tasks and eventually figure it all out. </p>

<p>The bottom line is a leaky pipeline will not delivery water efficiently to homes. As long as the leak gets bigger, the future looks dim because there is a point where nobody is getting water anymore due to systemic failures caused by the leaks. This will go on and on until people get so fed up that they unearth the soil and get in there to fix the leaks. It will take some elbow grease so people get worried about that but hey, such is life. Sometimes we gotta get in there and use some elbow grease. Try to have fun with it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my theory. All countries have money. Its the flow of money that determines economies. As long as the money flows quickly in a circular motions throughout the population, every willing person will get a fair share in exchange for work. Money passes hands and the faster it passes hands, the more work is needed thereby lowering the unemployment rate. People keep working and earning and spending some more. Its like a train that comes full circle on itself regularly. However, if people from outside the economic system are outright looting the money from the pipeline, the system no longer functions at high efficiency like its supposed to. </p>

<p>People involved in the leaks are now trying to turn billion dollar countries into trillion dollar countries. Money makes money for sure so this is inevitable. </p>

<p>One idea I heard that would actually slow down many leaks for sure is an income cap of 25 million a year. Every sensible human being can agree that 25 million a year is plenty. This will prevent any one person from siphoning billions out of the economy legally and it will prevent any one company into expanding into a monopoly. There is no reason to monopolize an industry if there is no profit in it except the first 25 million worth. This would create opportunity because what one company doesn&#39;t control, another new company will. This will give people a chance to open shop in local communities without competition from massive trillion dollar corporations. </p>

<p>This is just one idea. We can keep coming up with plenty to fix the leaky pipeline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the gap between the skills needed to be productive in the new economy compared to the skills by most University grads? Lack of and aging infrastructure, we still use rail/Amtrak and don&#39;t have at least one bullet train. Japan&#39;s on the third iteration of the technology, while China&#39;s light rail high speed trains facilitates trade and the disbursement of knowledge workers. America has become the cocky kid that thinks their the best but when he steps to the plate strikes out. Why? He didn&#39;t practice. He didn&#39;t improve. &quot;Our&quot; great country rest on it laurels too often and waits for catalyst of change to come out the blue sky either from the government or one or two great companies (of the moment). Yes there are leaks and cracks in the system, but we can&#39;t keep patching this system. We need to upgrade and improve so that we can be competitive. If we did so,  blue collar workers would be working on higher level projects with a more marketable skill set applicable for the future and not complaining about their jobs being off shored to low cost manufacturing centers.</p>

<p>Currency traders began short selling the mark by borrowing marks from the central bank and using those marks to buy dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The speculators, however, did not believe that the Reichsbank
would be able to hold this rate of exchange rate for any length of
time, and bought dollar after dollar. This speculation was not only hostile to the country&#39;s economic interests, it was also stupid. In previous years such speculation had been carried on either with loans which the Reichsbank granted lavishly, or with emergency money which one printed oneself, and then exchanged for Reichsmarks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly.  There is no doubt about that.  </p>

<p>Knowledge, such as present in a world of high transparency, would allow us to fix things even with the highest amount of corruption.  People would not take it.  Transparency would be my biggest goal.</p>

<p>Decentralization is yin, and centralization is yang.  The good in one eventually grows, but there is always some evil to it.  They switch positions constantly.  </p>

<p>Consider that we have larger achievements together, which does not always occur through decentralization.  But on the other hand, high centralization does corrupt, insulate, and prevent great change.  </p>

<p>An ideal system uses both decentralization and centralization in a symbiotic way and accounts for these changes.</p>

We also see it in the branches of US government and in the vote and will of the people that keeps the other 3 branches in check.</p>
