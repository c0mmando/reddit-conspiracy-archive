    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a fact mentioned often in the public narrative, but good find. It most likely falls back on the idea that the Veterans we are seeing today are often disenfranchised and suffer from psychological issues and they want to tie it to the &quot;lone-wolf/extremist patriot&quot; narrative because they are in the midst of nullifying anything resembling the original constitution.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might sound crazy, but what if... combat vets are more likely to be suffering from mental illness, combined with extensive weapons/combat training? So... you have a group of people that are prone to mental illness, and have been trained to kill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found myself wondering lately if maybe we are witnessing the chickens coming home to roost in America. It may be be a beautiful dream but in the light of day it&#39;s a country founded on colonisation, exploitation, genocide, subjugation, death, murder, slavery, theft, racism blah blah blah. My point is that it started off on the wrong foot, to say the least. Could it be that the insanity we&#39;re witnessing is that the rot has now set in so firmly, and the county&#39;s psyche is so damaged, that a sort of collective hysteria is manifesting itself through acts of random violence? I guess that&#39;s sort of what The Shining is about. Only instead of a lone hotel built on an Indian burial ground, you lot put your whole country on one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lest we forget that a lot of these mass shooters have all been on SSRI class of drugs. The veterans with PTSD have definitely been on SSRI because that&#39;s what the VA doctors prescribe them. These patients are most at risk when they mess with their dosage amounts....such ass quitting them altogether or upping their dosage....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the same logic, we would&#39;ve had hundreds of thousands of veterans from World War 1 or 2 coming back home (on either side) and slaughtering the fuck out of society. Didn&#39;t happen and by God were the stressors in those days much, much worse than what they&#39;re going through today. </p>

<p>The worst cases from the world wars were shell-shocked individuals (who were subsequently brutally &#39;treated&#39; in psychiatric wards), guys with extreme PTSD (flashbacks) and people who gradually became schizophrenic (psychotic). </p>

<p>Nowadays, when they come back and feel off (PTSD) they&#39;re being either pumped full of brain melters or discarded from society entirely if they don&#39;t continue like nothing ever happened. That&#39;s what the basis is for all of this is ... people being betrayed over and over and over again for being better, bolder, braver etc. than anybody else, especially the thundercunts who sent them into harm&#39;s way. </p>

<p>When they finally seek help and slowly get murdered by the very same industry that&#39;s supposed to help them out of their misery, they&#39;ve had all of the possible abuse a person is able to handle before completely melting down. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s much more to the entire story. I&#39;m quite sure they single out the ones who are likely to be divergent individuals, the ones sensible and sensitive enough to seek justice for wrongs perpetrated by an ignorant society, the ones being verbal and brave enough to demand the attention they deserve. Those are the ones who are being relentlessly undermined and forced to do things they&#39;d never do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government employs blackwater mercenaries to this job, not lone wolf mercenaries. </p>

<p>Also, there is a good chance that the person might just be a friend of the government and he never made the shooting at all. To be exact, in this case there is no shooting at all, only endless amounts of police cars and crisis actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are only hearing about the most successful ones.  </p>

<p>We have trained a subset of our population to be effective killers.  It should follow that when these people kill people, statistically, more people die.  Lots more.  Thus we should expect the most visible shooters are ex-military.  This is exactly what we are seeing.</p>
