    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely agree, the people who believe the moon landings were a hoax have only done a glancing amount of research into the overwhelming third party evidence for the landings.  Each year new evidence piles upon the heaps that already exist, while hoaxers wave it away then ask &quot;why don&#39;t we ever go back&quot;.  </p>

<p>While the goal of new space missions obviously isn&#39;t to prove hoaxers incorrect, the people actually conducting relevant work have better things to think about, I&#39;m certain that some hoaxers will continue to believe whatever they want even if we do go back, broadcast it live while simultaneously displaying all of the data and shining a million-lumen laser from the surface of the moon.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t it wave?  In order to plant it you have to move it, which would cause the fabric to sway/wave.  Things in a (near) vacuum and in reduced gravity still feel the effects of momentum transfer.</p>

<p>So, because a rocket <strong>of a completely different design</strong> failed, that automatically means that SpaceX can&#39;t do what they do? Do you even think about the crap you spout before you post it?</p>

<p>And your proof that this is &quot;pre filmed&quot; is what, exactly? You make the claim that all video is faked without providing justification of it. By your pathetic attempt at reasoning, all video of planes flying is faked just because it is possible to fake a video of a plane. </p>

<p>The only thing there isn&#39;t proof of is the crap you spout on a regular basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, a video of a grainy and blurry space scene or moonlanding backed up by  Elon or secretive NASA at langley does not prove space travel the same way a video footages of aliens on youtube do not prove aliens are visiting earth or are real. Now when it comes to plane flight ,  videos of planes aren&#39;t proof they fly or that air travel is possible. Rather the experience of traveling on a plane is the actual proof. Most humans can get on a plane today, or learn to fly themselves and operate a plane. We can both agree watching a video of a plane flying  doesn&#39;t mean the plane  a) is real or a physical object b) actually flying c) a model that is actually manufactured in real life.</p>

<p>So even though plane travel is possible now, a video of a plane traveling in air may not be real.</p>

<p>Hence videos are not proof of existence of anything. Because video content can be fictional,ie faked.</p>

<p>Do you understand my point here? A video is not proof of anything that can&#39;t be demonstrated or experienced in real life terms.  It is then just theoretical nonsense or fiction like time traveling. So just because some guy posts a video of him traveling from Paris to Japan in 10 seconds doesn&#39;t mean it proves time travel. I didn&#39;t bother answering your question because it seemed odd you don&#39;t understand this basic concept.</p>

<p>So to me, Elon Musk&#39;s blurry dark images of a light blurring what appears to be some Rocket is not proof he launched  a rocket and landed it backwards. 1. The videos are clearly edited. 2. No independent verification of this flight and landing are available
 3. I didn&#39;t see a public place where civilians can watch this rocket take off or land in real time, what we see is it&#39;s playing on a screen, how do we know that is live? We don&#39;t! </p>

<p>For example the video of Armstrong coming down the latter on the moon was filmed off a tv screen using another video camera and then shown to the public. Was it real? Who fucking knows? </p>

<p>You really are oblivious, aren&#39;t you? The launches are publicly scheduled, and the launches are observed by thousands from around Florida. So, <em>yes</em>, actually we <strong>do</strong> know that the launches are happening real time. And the landings are visible (from a distance, granted) as well. It&#39;s pretty damned hard to hide a launch and landing when both happen in the same place. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I think both the videos and the observations from the general public are why these launches and landings are happening and are evidence of the truth. </p>

<p>At least <em>try</em> to do your research before spouting off about something like this in the future. Demonstrating how little you actually know about the topic only makes you look even more like a fool. </p>

<p>Do provide details of this &quot;drone or some such other fakery&quot;. A &quot;drone&quot; that acts, looks, and sounds <em>exactly</em> like a rocket.</p>

<p>Oh, and not only did people see the launch <strong>and landing</strong> of the rocket, they also had to deal with the sonic booms when it was coming in for a landing. </p>

<p>Once again you demonstrate just how poor your research is. Both the first (back in December) and most recent (just a week ago!) landings by SpaceX were RTLS (Return to Landing Site) landings. Meaning they landed <strong>on land</strong> within a couple miles of where they launched from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why anyone would fake something like this, the only reason to land a spent rocket is to save money on the next launch by reusing the old. What gain do you have by spending money to fake saving money? Its pretty easy to prove his claim (if it were real).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are assuming NASA is lying, so no, it&#39;s not circular.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve researched almost every facet of the moon landing hoax and can find real reasons why the ideas presented by the moon hoaxers are incorrect. This is one of the easiest disinformation campaigns to exposeâ€“if you went to high school and learned Algebra 2, you can do the physics equations for basic orbital mechanics. You can verify the delta-V required for various orbits. You can use math to prove just how easy it is to get from the earth to the moon using the Apollo flight path. Literally everything posed by these shamsters is easily refuted using real science or logic.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s discuss the link I posted. Regardless if the information there is 100% accurate, what do you think makes more sense, that (a) NASA faked the moon landing even though they could have easily done it, or (b) the moon hoax theory is disinformation?</p>

<p>You understand I am using <strong>logic</strong> to evaluate the claims from the moon hoax crowd and determine that they don&#39;t hold up to scrutiny, right? Why then is my argument &quot;circular&quot;?</p>

<p>Maybe your ego is hurt from buying into it? That&#39;s okay. That&#39;s when you resolve to find the real truth. I&#39;ve gone through the process before, I&#39;ve been fooled by other misinformation, only to figure it out later, after approaching the subject from a different angle.</p>

<p>I really want to help people here, and if you have any questions or reservations about the hoax theory, ask away. I will do my best to walk you through it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are the components of the radiation and what are shielding requirements for the different types? You need to understand more than &quot;radiation is bad,&quot; it&#39;s the type of radiation and the dosage received over time that can kill. In this particular case (Van Allen Belts) the primary type of deadly radiation is ionized protons, but this is also easily shielded. </p>

<p>Let me ask you a question. Everyone knows low voltage electricity doesn&#39;t kill, but that high voltage does, as long as it has enough amperage. What if I told you I could build a power supply that put out 50,000 volts DC, with enough amperage to kill a human instantly? What if I told you I could do this in such a way so to have it be mostly harmless and all anyone would feel if they touched it would be a little burning sensation? Would you call me a liar, fraud, charlatan? What few people realize is that it&#39;s <strong>more</strong> than just voltage and amperage that kills, the physiological effects are dependent on frequency. Over 20,000 hertz, electricity is mostly harmless. It&#39;s line voltage frequency (60 Hz) that&#39;s a killer. Take a deadly voltage, say 480V at 20A, and change the frequency to 20kHz, and it would be safe to touch.</p>

<p>Please read this, it&#39;s the type of research that is necessary when trying to ascertain truth regarding conspiracies involving technology.</p>

<p>You really are oblivious, aren&#39;t you? The launches are publicly scheduled, and the launches are observed by thousands from around Florida. So, <em>yes</em>, actually we <strong>do</strong> know that the launches are happening real time. And the landings are visible (from a distance, granted) as well. It&#39;s pretty damned hard to hide a launch and landing when both happen in the same place. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I think both the videos and the observations from the general public are why these launches and landings are happening and are evidence of the truth. </p>

<p>At least <em>try</em> to do your research before spouting off about something like this in the future. Demonstrating how little you actually know about the topic only makes you look even more like a fool. </p>
