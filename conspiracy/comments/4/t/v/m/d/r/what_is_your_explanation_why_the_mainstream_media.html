       Reddit is too busy bashing Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also surprised by the lack of coverage.  This was without a doubt an innocent black man who was shot by police while trying to help an autistic patient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the officer also black?  Just a guess it could be why this story isn't being widely covered.  Strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe when I first heard this story it only mentioned patient and doctor shooting.  I dont recall hearing about police being involved but I could just be confusing this with another story.

       How is it rude? I'm not picking on anyone, merely pointing out that BLM has no interest in picking up this event because the cop was latin, and the guy is a respectable member of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "rudest" thing about my statement if you are grasping for straws is me insinuating the fact that "Hands up don't shoot" is based off a lie.

       These are the people that know their neighbor might beat his wife, so they  plug in headphones before bed to purposely ignore it and pretend it doesn't happen. When the wife shows up with black eyes and bruises, they can say "I didn't hear any fighting, so it can't be true."

       Seriously. Of all the police shootings we have heard about on the news in the last couple years, this is the only one (well, except Philando) where I'm outraged and no one is talking about it!
      </p>
      <p>
       This poor guy was not doing something illegal in the first place, he clearly was communicating with the police, he wasn't making sudden movements, he wasn't attacking anyone, he was unarmed, his hands were in the air, and he still got shot. An officer who can't handle a situation with a disabled person and an extremely compliant black man (of any race for that matter) has no business being on the force. I don't really think this was racially motivated, I think the cop is just shitty. And unfortunately with all the dumbasses killing police as of late and all the negativity towards the profession in general, we're not going to get the best and brightest signing up to be cops. So it's not going to get better.

       I thought the entrance test they take specifically filters out the best and brightest, anyways? They only want mediocre applicants, since the smart ones are confirmed to be a waste of training and resources since they're too smart to stay on the job

       I Googled "Charles Kinsey" this morning around 7am EDT to see how old the story was and got over 5 pages of different results, among the top of which were ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC, WSJ, NYT etc. It doesn't get much more mainstream than that, but the reason I searched in the first place is I noticed on all the social media posts where I saw it, they were all really mundane 'news' sites, to the extent I was suspicious of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       A better question might be, didn't a nearly identical story happen a couple months ago with an autistic person, except in that version, the cop "risked his life" and approached the autistic guy and sat down in the road in front of him to avoid upsetting him? Stories seem sort of similar except this time the guy shot the caretaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, this is conspiracy thread, so how about the fact that according to the victim, when asked why he shot him, the officer's immediate response was "I don't know" - so wait...you just shot a guy lying down with his hands up and you have no recollection as to why? Hrmmmmm...

       I don't believe the MSM is ignoring it, at least not on the online side of things. It was the first thing I saw this morning right below the everyone hates Donald Trump articles, I even found a Fox News article on it. Here's a conspiracy, why is there no video of the actual incident, just a before and after shot?

       I have a conspiracy theory prediction. Just a wild idea I'm throwing out here. Could it be that this thing will go right along with a liberal narrative that was formerly a well propagated lie. So maybe the reason they are releasing before and after but not the actual incident is to troll the RNC. It wraps up here shortly, so on the one hand if someone is stupid enough to take the bait and try to support the cops, then they release the rest between conventions and we have campaign ads of whatever Republican was idiot enough yo try and speculate on justification. OR, the Republicans are smart enough to just not mention it at least in any detail, then they release a very damning full video between conventions that shows a clearly unjustified shooting. Then every speaker at the DNC calls the entire Republican party racist and talks about how this happened right before the end of their convention and they didn't even mention it or whatever. It's a win-win for the liberals if they hold back the facts then bring them out between conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it was probably an unjustified shooting, and though I already said in my earlier comment that I don't think the MSM is ignoring it at all, I've seen precious little of the common mundane facts, 'experts,' victim was an angel type stories we normally see this far in. Could be just because he didn't die, but I have a feeling it really happened, was really unjust, and facts and video are being held back so that it can be better exploited during the upcoming DNC. What say you all?

       Plot twist .. Cop was aiming for the autistic man. So not only is he a nervous cop, he's a bad shot. Seems like he made a bad mistake and not malicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        UPDATE: A police union representative said Thursday that the North Miami officer, still unidentified, who fired three shots was actually aiming at a 23-year-old autistic man, who the officer believed was somehow placing behavioral therapist Charles Kinsey in danger. The representative said the officer is sorry, and wished Kinsey a speedy recovery.

       This man was very obviously doing nothing wrong before, during or after the incident. With many of the other incidences that I have seen get popularized in the media, the police are called for a reason that is not stated, leaving the criminality of the individual ambiguous. Much of the country, due to the stats on black crime, will assume the individual was doing
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       wrong, but still did not deserve to get shot or have his life taken.

       The media will dig up any dirt on a black victim to make them look deserving of death. All they could find on Philandro Castille was traffic citations. Brock Turner raped a passed out girl and the media made sure to use a well groomed image and note his swim times.  I want to blame the media, but in the age of information, it's too easy to disprove propaganda...I just wish people took the time to use critical thinking instead of believing what the tv told them.

       My s/o and I have this discussion all the time. Yes, people should use critical thinking, however, the public school system, well, most school systems don't teach critical thinking, they teach 'hear authority and regurgitate' which is something I think millions have taken into their adult lives. That is why I at least blame the media in part. They know full well what they are doing, they know they can do it and they know why they can  do it.  Still, we also learned to get more than one source and how to research so, I'm not entirely sure what's wrong.

         The cop was very likely black, not white. Doesn't serve the narrative.

         The video edits out the actual shooting. MSM probably has a copy of the whole video that
         <strong>
          may
         </strong>
         show Kinsey doing something that would warrant being shot. And if that leaked, their narrative gets destroyed again.

       I understand your second point, but did you watch the video? What could he possibly have done, short of pulling out a gun and pointing it at the officers, to warrant being shot? He was very compliant in the video that we saw and personally I don't have any reason to believe that his story is a lie. And I usually don't believe the stories that people tell in these situations ("Hands up don't shoot!" Michael Brown comes to mind). The cop even apologized for shooting him... Cops don't do that if there was a reason to shoot someone.

       I don't know, thats why I am reserving judgement either way.

       If anything, youd' think the pro-black BLM folks would want the full video in case it shows him literally not doing a single thing and still being shot. Don't you think that would be a piece of evidence and talking point that they would love to have? The fact that they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       have that, leads me to believe there is more to the story.

       He didn't die and the cop wasn't white. That's all there is to it. It came out early that the cop wasn't white. I'm pretty sure Philando wouldn't have gotten so big had people known the race of the cop early on.
