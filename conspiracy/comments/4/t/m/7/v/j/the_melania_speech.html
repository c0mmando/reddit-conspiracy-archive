       This post is for people who recognize that the speech was, at least on some level, plagiarized.  Anyone saying this wasn't plagiarized is delusional.   But what I'm more interested in is why and how.  There are a few options we have at hand, as far as I can tell:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1) It was totally accidental
       </strong>
       :  I can't believe this.  It's too similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2A) It was intentional by Trump/Melania
       </strong>
       :  They took huge pieces of Michelle's speech and figured no one would notice.  I also can't believe this because as much as I dislike Trump, he's not dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2B) It was intentional by Trump/Melania
       </strong>
       :  They knew their plagiarizing would be found out, but they wanted it to be because it'd generate more buzz.  And like the saying goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity.  This is possible, but eh... I'm not sold here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2C) It was intentional by Trump/Melania
       </strong>
       :  Trump has been a Clinton ploy from the very start.  When the world of politics is "the lesser of two evils" and you have Hillary in one corner, you need someone worse.  Bill Clinton made a call to Trump, weeks later Trump runs for President.  Trump doesn't actually want the job.  His mission is to be such a massive disruption in the GOP that Hillary gets the Presidency, so he intentionally sets himself up, hoping it'll cost him votes.  I could see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3) It was sabotage
       </strong>
       :  Someone in their camp intentionally and maliciously copied Michelle's speech.  Melania looked it over, thought it looked good but didn't know it was Michelle's speech.  (She should have checked it out herself, but that's water under the bridge now.)  I could also see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the Trump camp isn't coming out with a quick apology gives credence (in my eyes) to 2C.  He could have quickly come out, blamed a speech writer and even played the victim card.  He could have attacked Clinton for using agents to try to sabotage him and would have scored some sympathy points.  Instead, he continues to deny it when it's terribly obvious it's damn near the same speech.  This just makes me think he's trying to cost himself votes -- which he wants.  He does not want to win.  He doesn't want to be the President.  He's been a Clinton ploy all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       And frankly, if Trump is a ploy, that scares me even more about a Clinton Presidency.  That she'd be so desperate to win the Presidency that she'd actually go through the trouble of setting up a fake opponent in Trump, lying to the American people, giving us the perception of "fair, real elections and competition," and otherwise misleading everyone into voting for her over Trump as "the lesser of two evils" when it was she who set Trump up to begin with.  It underscores her dishonesty, her nefarious nature, and the fact that she truly is crooked, corrupt, dishonest and not suited to the Office of the President.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if this is true, then God help us.
      </p>

       This is some great analysis. The kind of thing we should really see on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with truly figuring things out is that the game being played is so complex. To quote Frank Herbert's "Dune":
      </p>
      <p>
       "Knowing where the trap is - that's the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale - a feint within a feint within a feint... seemingly without end."

       Absolutely.  Most if not all of these folks have dedicated teams, professionals who sit around all day thinking of political tricks and traps and maneuvers.  It's far too complex for any layperson to really grasp but sometimes, when they're sloppy, we can see the outline of their works and at the very least we know things aren't quite what they appear.

       What if Melania was more or less left to form her own speech, and this was her stab at it?  I mean, the explanation could be that she just royally fucked up and plagiarized because public speaking is difficult, and she wanted to impress people in her naivety.  It certainly wouldn't be the first time, and Trump may not have been aware of it until after the fact.

       That was my immediate thought, yes.  I was thinking there is no way they would have done this to themselves.  But if it was sabotage why not just come out and admit that the speech was tampered with and then use that as a way to attack Hillary and her "conspiring agents"?  Instead they just keep holding to the fact it wasn't plagiarized.  Very odd.

       I sure hope not, even though if 50 years later this came out as true I wouldn't be surprised.  Because if 2C is true, then it means that the Clintons are even more underhanded than even I gave them credit for.  And that's scary.

       I'm pretty sold on 2C in general.  But I don't think that negates 2B from also being a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trump campaign is one some weird marketing.  they know that their base is an authoritarian circlejerk who will argue and deny until the end.  either they had a specific plan with getting caught in the plagiarism, or they figured their base would come up with the excuses and justifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was watching last night, before she even got on, i thought it was interesting that the media kept talking about her process of writing the speech.  My reaction was- "there is no way this speech she is about to give wasn't written by a professional speech writer...".  Then she was a giving a great speech full of buzzwords and talking points and I thought it was even more ridiculous that they were trying to get us to believe that she wrote this herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then i realized her supporters are exactly the type of people to ask for "proof" that she didn't write it, if you make that accusation.  They're authoritarians and rabid ideologues.  IF the narrative is that they wrote it, they'll push that.  If the narrative changes, they'll push that.  They don't care about the truth- they care about yelling louder.

       To be honest, I haven't made up my mind on this one. Sabotage seems the most likely option.

      <p>
       However, regarding 2B), there's another post which suggests that Michelle Obama's speech was itself plagiarized from another source. The Melania speech was perhaps designed to draw attention to that?

       That'd be curious!  I didn't see the post you're talking about but I was certainly wondering if Michelle's speech was original.  It's just so generic.  "Work hard, values, morals," that it seemed unlikely to be 100% unique.  I know Obama has been accused of plagiarizing before too.  Not sure of the results on those accusations.

       It was sabotage by one of the writers. Trump's people said she has a 'team' of writers. One of them, or more, is a mole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here's my main beef...after 18 years of living in the US, why does she barely speak English? What language does she normally speak? Of the 5 languages she allegedly speaks, it's too bad English isn't one of them.

       Everything said in both speeches were very genaric.

       I haven't gotten to examine the speeches side by side yet. Does anyone know how similar the progression of the speeches were? Were the similarities in the same order?

       3) sabotage... but by whom?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that on the AM talk shows, just 12 hours after the speech was given, trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewindowsky said that somebody in the campaign should take responsibility, and the current manager should resign. Remember, there's a lot of bad blood because the current manager got Corey fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       So did Corey have an old lackey plant this copypasta verbiage into Mel's speech, so that he could then go call for the campaign manager's head the next morning? That sounds legit to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supporting the inserted language theory, is Mel essentially rickrolled everybody at one point, saying that trump will never give them up or let them down.

       4) Melania had been practicing for the speech for five weeks, using Michelle's old recordings as a guide, then when she wrote the speech, the pieces she liked and knew verbatim were rehashed into her own speech.

       2C is partly right, it was intentional. But if you think it was Bill and Hillary pulling the strings and getting Trump to play along, you're sadly mistaken. The people pulling Trump's strings are the same ones pulling Bill and Hillary's. It's just more fuel on the flames of generating one of the most divisive elections in memory. More divide and conquer. Same old, same old.

       Trump sold out the minute he picked Pence (if not well before then). He's no man of the People, and even on the off chance he is, he would be killed and Pence would take over.
