I do not often comment on r/news as it is. All I can figure is I was banned because of the content of the story. When simply submitting the politically wrong story causes a ban there is really something wrong. </p>

<p>Are the liberals of this site,of which I consider myself one,so afraid of differing views that they must silence them? Sadly it seems yes.  Below is the notice I got,my reply and a link to the story. I am pretty crappy with computers so don&#39;t really know how to screen shot,though if needed I will happily read up on how to and do so. </p>

I was banned for submitting a news story to the news site?
Why? Did you not like the content? I violated no rules. I didn&#39;t even comment on it. When I submitted this there was another posting on another subreddit with no comments or votes. It was 9 hours old and since I had never heard of that sub it is simply impossible for me to have known it had been submitted.
Most likely you didn&#39;t like the content. Thats just childish. Enjoy your fishbowl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Been reading here for some time now. I think most of it is batshit crazy. But as stated earlier this is how you learn and educate yourself. </p>

<p>I see to much of this bleeding over into real life. This will be an unpopular opinion but it is based off my experiences in the last 3-4 years. Almost every millennial I work with or encounter acts this way. They are never wrong and you are an asshole if you are not in lockstep with their beliefs,whatever the topic may be. The rudeness,self entitlement and unwillingness to see other views sickens me. Of course these does not mean ALL are this way. But in general,in my own experience,this is the case.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are glad for dentistry,  books,  and the wheel.    Granted,  there is much in our world that is disillusioning.   But there is a possibility that information is the battleground these days,  even more than oil,  food,  and water.   Eventually,  those who now use secrecy for power and gain will be forced by technology to disclose all business that is public in nature,   all information that relates to shared resources:  roads,  parks,  air,  rivers,  etc.   At that moment,  their ability to exploit private information will shift.   Obviously governments and corporations are scarred shittless of this.    Obviously the wealthy have a lot to hide,  that is going to get harder and harder to hide.    What if the source of their income:    guns,  narcotics,  interest on the national debt,  etc.  was suddenly disclosed?    What if every conversation by public figures sworn to defend the constitution, that shafted Bernie Sanders campaign was disclosed?   What if every dime that passed through the Clinton Foundation,  including the selling of state secrets for money,  was disclosed?    That would change a few things for the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a warning, the more you stay in forums like this with an open mind, the farther down the rabbit hole you will tumble, and things that seemed crazy to you a year ago will suddenly seem as self evident and amusingly obvious.  Your consciousness will expand and your mind will break free of the chains of conditioning you have been programmed with all your life.  This will increasingly remove you from the general society until one day you realize that most of the world now thinks you are crazy.  But you will be free.</p>

<p>I think people have too much information, and they&#39;re mentally shutting down. </p>

<p>Also the US has a Stasi comprised of perhaps millions of authoritarian-styled informants. They&#39;re being paid to turn on their neighbors. Once they&#39;ve accepted that blood money, they&#39;re unwittingly motivated to see enemies everywhere. Americans are being groomed to be suspicious, angry, violent and intolerant by the deep state. I suspect Trump&#39;s support is at least partly those bottom-feeders looking for validation in their own corruption. This is irreversible damage to the nation.</p>

The lady feels it necessary to remind me that these, and i quote &quot;Chinese need to go back home&quot;. The kids were terrified. And I swear from the bottom of my heart these kids are pure, absolute gems. They were born in Canada and god dammit, they don&#39;t deserve this kind of shit.</p>

This was supposed to be a temporary ban for breaking the submission guidelines on the sidebar. I&#39;m not sure why it wasn&#39;t. I am also not sure why you think you were censored when your submissions are flaired with removal reasons. You last submission was already on the front page, for example.</p>

As I stated I looked and did not see it. I did not comment on my submission. I did nothing at all to warrant a ban temporary or not. You could have just closed the post and let it be...as has happened in the past when I submitted something that was already there. I don&#39;t claim I was censored. I do think this is a weak excuse.</p>

<p>Most of your submissions have been removed because they did not follow the submission guidelines. They have been marked as such, except for those removed by automod.
Also from the sidebar:
Extreme or repeat offenders will be banned.
You didn&#39;t even wait for a response to your message before you publicly accused us of censorship. Good work!</p>

Keep me banned I will not lose sleep over it. But do not pretend that an honest mistake is worth a ban.

You were banned for repeatedly breaking the rules listed in the sidebar. You weren&#39;t banned for one &quot;mistake.&quot;
Is there now a time limit before I can make my case to the masses?
There is no time limit, but usually people wait until they actually have a case to make. You are asking us to be reasonable, but you don&#39;t extend the same courtesy to us. I&#39;m not sure why you hold us to higher standard than you hold yourself.</p>

Repeatedly breaking the rules......bullshit. If you enforced your rules that sub would be crickets. Some of the most vile comments on this site are posted there daily with no action taken.
I do not ask anything of you for you can grant me nothing. I do hold you to a higher standard though. You ask for money on here. You are a business. Damn right I expect more from you than myself.</p>

<p>[–]subreddit message via <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>[M] sent 15 days ago
You have been banned from participating in <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>. You can still view and subscribe to <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>, but you won&#39;t be able to post or comment.</p>

<p>Note from the moderators:
You have been automatically banned for participating in a hatereddit. <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> systemically harasses individuals and/or communities, including this one. An overwhelming majority of subreddits in this list have already been &quot;quarantined&quot; or banned by Reddit.</p>

<p>Regardless of context, contributions you provide to the hatereddit is a material form of support. We are willing to reverse the ban only if you plan to stop supporting these hatereddits. If you do not, then do not contact us. We will ignore any other response.
If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a> by replying to this message.</p>

<p>Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

I&#39;m confused, I am not even subscribed to that subreddit. Have I been banned for a comment made? Even if it was not a hateful comment? Also, if you are banning me because of what I chose to do off your subreddit, you can eat a dick and keep your sub. Thats some totalitarian bullshit right there. Ironic, the sub you are banning me from.

    <div class="md"><p>I bet you it is because that guy, Milo, gets paid to do that stuff. And they want to keep it on the down low. I&#39;m sure most if not all of the racists tweets were on purpose to generate more publicity for Ghostbusters. That story was in my local paper (but with no mention of Milo). The story made is sound like thousands of racists were tweeting, without actually giving any specifics whatsoever. Sony has become so desperate, it&#39;s really sad. But what do they expect from people like Paul Feig and Amy Pascal? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all very, very simple when you get right down to it.</p>

<p>Marx was a relative of the bankers.  All of his ideology was worked out in closed meetings, and then disseminated to the public.  The entire point of Marxism is to discredit the idea of real mutually beneficial symbiosis in the minds of the public; to make it seem evil.  In operational terms, what they call &quot;Capitalism,&quot; and &quot;Communism,&quot; are both the same thing, because they won&#39;t allow anything else to exist.</p>

<p>The only point of the civil rights movement, in any of its&#39; manifestations, is control of people&#39;s minds.  Political correctness means controlling what anyone is or is not allowed to say or think, and that is all.</p>

<p>The game they play is setting up two ideologies which appear to be diametric opposites of each other, but adherence of which both ultimately lead to the same objective; what they want.  So if you become either a Democrat or a Republican, you will end up getting the same thing from whoever you vote for, regardless of how different you might think the parties&#39; perspectives are.</p>

<p>They want you to have the illusion that you are free, but the most important thing to remember is that, while they will give you multiple choices, they will never give you a choice that harms them.  So if you want options which will actually benefit you, that means going outside of their pre-generated menus entirely.  That means no mobile phone, no Twitter, no Facebook.</p>

<p>This is also why services like Netflix, Siri, and Spotify exist.  They learned from the killing of the free prototypes like Napster and Grokster.  Now they have mockeries of the free applications, with subscription or whatever models, but the only thing that matters to them is that one way or another, they get their few millilitres of blood per transaction from you.  That is what advertising and marketing is about, as well.  It&#39;s about them having the attitude that money is the only thing that matters; that making money is literally more important than being alive to spend it.</p>

<p>The truth is the opposite, and always has been.  Wealth is antithetical to humility and self-restraint, and therefore not only basic positive morality but also long term survival.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.</em></p>

<p>-- Agent Smith, <em><a href="http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/sw4qw/index.shtml">Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars</a>.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p><em>It was forbidden them [Spartans] to be sailors and to fight on the sea. Later, however, they did engage in such battles, and, after they had made themselves masters of the sea, they again desisted, since they observed that the character of the citizens was deteriorating sadly. But they changed about again, as in all else. For example, when money was amassed for the Spartans, those who amassed it were condemned to death; for to Alcamenes and Theopompus, their kings, an oracle had been given:</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Eager desire for money will bring the ruin of Sparta.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Yet, nevertheless, when Lysander had taken Athens, he brought home much gold and silver, and they accepted it, and bestowed honours on the man.</em></p>

<p><em>As long as the Spartan State adhered to the laws of Lycurgus and remained true to its oaths, it held the first place in Greece for good government and good repute over a period of five hundred years.  But, little by little, as these laws and oaths were transgressed, and greed and love of wealth crept in, the elements of their strength began to dwindle also, and their allies on this account were ill-disposed toward them.</em> </p>

<p><em>But although they were in this plight, yet after the victory of Philip of Macedon at Chaeroneia, when all the Greeks proclaimed him commander both on land and sea, and likewise, in the interval following, proclaimed Alexander, his son, after the subjugation of the Thebans, the Spartans only, although they dwelt in an unwalled city, and were few in number because of their continual wars, and had become much weaker and an easy prey, still keeping alive some feeble sparks of the laws of Lycurgus, did not take any part in the campaigns of these or of the other kings of Macedon who ruled in the interval following, nor did they ever enter the general congress or even pay tribute.</em> </p>

<p><em>So it was, until they ceased altogether to observe the laws of Lycurgus, and came to be ruled despotically by their own citizens, preserving nothing of their ancestral discipline any longer, and so they became much like the rest, and put from them their former glory and freedom of speech, and were reduced to a state of subjection; and now they, like the rest of the Greeks, have come under Roman sway.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an anarchist/liberal and I can tell you I left <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> about 3 yrs ago.  I was getting harassed, getting my stuff [removed], getting things [deleted] and other forms of crazy-level harassment from there.  I&#39;m not some kind of extremist...these were just links, or &#39;minor text posts&#39;.  Nothing like my compositions I do now.  Just like 3 links and then a paragraph of discussion.  I had to dispose of 2 beloved accounts and start this one.</p>

<p>I believe it was the subversive &quot;continuity of government&#39; links that were removed by mods/admins and that set me off.  I was like, &quot;<a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> has become the face of suppression&quot;, so I left.</p>

<p>Same happened with ELI5 and askreddit.  I am basically unable to post anything on askreddit without it being autoremoved.  Same with <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>I found that this sub has been my go-to for news.  Regulars here are smart, skeptical, critical thinkers, open minded.  And sometimes autism-level in their researching ability (ex:myself): which is wonderful actually.  The public it turns out, just can&#39;t keep up.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the real reason they hate conspiracy theorists and avoid this sub---or sometimes come here and harass us (conspiratards/topmind).  We make them look like zero information people with no grasp of history or context or subtext and are devoid of any skillfulness in analysis or social critique...basically they are stupidheads with a charisma rating of zero.  And they don&#39;t like being schooled by people who entertain the possibility of UFOs. </p>

<p>So that means they just avoid the issues and avoid the facts and verified documentation; they don&#39;t listen to their experts; they don&#39;t listen to eyewitness testimony of people on the street.  They feel safer in their infant sandbox of fox news where their reality models are handed down to them like an older brother&#39;s jacket. Instead of buying or stitching their own.  They get mad at us because they are lazy and stupid.</p>

<p>You should have a key on your computer that says &quot;Print Scrn&quot; near the F12 key. If you press Ctrl + Print Scrn at the same time it will copy your screen, to copy just one application/window click it so it&#39;s the active window, then pres Ctrl+Alt+Print Scrn and it will capture just the active window. You can then paste this to Paint or any other program what you can draw on, same with Word too.</p>
