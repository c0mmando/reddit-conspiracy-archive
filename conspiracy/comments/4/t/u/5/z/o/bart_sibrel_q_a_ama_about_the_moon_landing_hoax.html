    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the AMA Bart--I think you&#39;re a very brave researcher...</p>

<p>I was wondering about the spacesuits and how the suit kept the astronauts from boiling in the 250 degree F temps on the moon--why don&#39;t we now have T-shirts which can keep us cool on earth in 100 degree days?</p>

<p>Also was wondering about Gus Grissom&#39;s family--the lawsuit which they had had to keep the US government from destroying the craft Gus Grissom died in--any info on that in terms of when this took place, what city/state, etc? How long ago was that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although the technology allegedly used to “put a man on the moon” was not classified, because the missions were “supposed” to have been done by a non-military “civilian” government agency (NASA), the specific details of the hypothetically miraculous machinery, according to NASA, are nevertheless “unavailable”. This is because all of the flight telemetry data, as well as all of the technical specifications of the “Apollo” spacecraft, were deliberately destroyed by NASA after the “moon missions”! You would think that such important, one of a kind, and supremely valuable design at a cost of FORTY BILLION DOLLARS, would be kept for just short of all eternity, in case such expensive to attain information would be needed again in the near future . . . Yet the exact opposite is the case.</p>

<p>How did the lunar lander power air-conditioning against an outside temperature of 252 degrees Fahrenheit (122 C) down to an amazing 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 C) inside for three days nonstop with a bank of, essentially, car batteries? No one will ever know! All of the schematics and electrical diagrams of the lunar lander were deliberately destroyed! How did the “moon” rocket go 1000 times farther than the space shuttle with less advanced engines? No one will ever know! The rocket diagrams and blueprints were removed from the archives and are nowhere to be found! All of this was done so that if a curious and astute propulsion or electrical engineering student in the future were to do the actual mathematical calculations, they would be able to expose the fact that the “moon” vehicle, in reality, did not have the electrical battery capacity necessary to power the air-conditioning down 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 C) from the outside temperature, nonstop for three days, nor did it have the fuel necessary to leave Earth orbit to begin with, as the newly uncovered video evidence clearly proves by the crew’s falsification of being half way to the moon!</p>

<p>In regard to the Grissom family&#39;s lawsuit, I was asked to not discuss it further in further detail than I already have until their case has been settled.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What has &#39;advancedness&#39; got to do with it? Its only about size.</p>

<p>The Saturn V is the biggest rocket ever built, with the biggest capacity by a country mile. It doesnt need to be 1000 times bigger than the space shuttle, as most of the fuel requirement is getting off the ground.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re in low earth orbit, the fuel requirement to get to the moon and back is significantly less. I mean, we routinely send robots to the moon and even to Mars, so this argument seems fairly silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so whenever I&#39;m responding to a specific point, actually I&#39;m required to go over every single point of oddity in the entire Apollo program? I have no idea about those points, I don&#39;t give a shit, which is why I didn&#39;t address them. I saw OP make a moronic claim and so responded to it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 60/40 on the moon landings. I was thinking OP was bringing up some good points and was considering delving into the topic once again. But then I see something so ridiculous as &#39;how was a rocket that wasn&#39;t as advanced as the space shuttle even make it to the moon?&#39; and it completely invalidates everything good that OP has said before it, because quite clearly he hasn&#39;t done proper research and is a moron. I see someone else in the comment chain has explained the air conditioning, which further shows that OP is a moron. </p>

<p>I assume OP is a full time moon landing researcher, yet clearly he doesn&#39;t know the answer to some very basic questions. This tells me that he doesn&#39;t really care, he likes repeating the points because it helps him sell more books/website hits or whatever he&#39;s selling. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll trust my own research that still leaves me at 60/40. </p>

<p>For the love of God, in future, when someone replies to a comment and completely invalidates the point made (as I did) don&#39;t come in and go BUT WHAT ABOUT THE AIR CON. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STARS. Especially when you don&#39;t even know the position of the person you&#39;re replying to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems fairly cut and dry based off Kelly Smith&#39;s admission that the technology to transverse the Van Allen Belts does not exist yet. Combine that with the unmanned &quot;Orion&quot; mission in 2014 to measure the Van Allen Belts radiation levels and I find it hard to see how anyone can believe the landings were real. </p>

<p>No one ever said that, and before you link me the Orion video, I&#39;ve already seen it. That video is about the ongoing development of a completely different spacecraft which has nothing to do with Apollo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean he does say that and regardless which spacecraft the video is regarding the problem of crossing the Van Allen belt remains exactly the same... But setting that aside, what about having to send an unmanned mission to the belt in the first place? Should they not have already had those measurements? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what measurements they already had, if any, maybe they needed new measurements. Anyways the point of the Orion test flight mentioned in the video is not primarily for measuring the radiation belts but to test the spacecraft itself in general.</p>

<p>I think the Van Allen belts issue in entirely overblown anyway, as a spacecraft travelling away from earth would be moving at a very high speed (the Apollo missions had a top speed of ~11km/s), so they would be through the worst of it pretty quickly. I&#39;m no expert but I&#39;d guess the fairly short exposure time combined with adequate shielding should be enough to travel through the belts safely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) it has not been a consistent program, and yes much experience was lost literally due to the engineers dying/retiring </p>

<p>2) are you even remotely familiar with how electronics are manufactured? When I say &quot;28nm process&quot;, does that mean anything to you?</p>

<p>Computers today are manufactured using fantastically advanced technology. If you and I were at lunch right now I could literally talk for <em>hours</em> about this stuff, from the semiconductor physics to the intracacies of silicon crystal production (the most pure material mankind can manufacture).</p>

<p>Modern feature sizes are orders of magnitude smaller. Hell, we have to deal with <em>quantum tunneling</em> between traces because at the scales we make stuff now the way the universe works starts to get fuzzy (simplification but it works). </p>

<p>New tech constantly encounters new problems. Remember composite aircraft wings? Wings were a &quot;solved problem&quot;, yet this new tech had the lovely feature of separating in mid air or not being flyable in 120F Phoenix heat on a black Tarmac (wings literally would droop).</p>

<p>The Apollo missions were build and tested to work with the methods and technologies used at the time. New stuff, while better in almost every way, still has to be tested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes like my i7-6700k was built on 14nm die shrink. The way that Kelly words it makes it sound much more like they need to solve the problem of getting people past the Van Allen belt and way less that they need to test their new equipment.</p>

<p>Also curious about your opinion on why they brought the shittiest video equipment possible? And why they refused the media&#39;s requests for a higher quality broadcast. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s projection on denier&#39;s part. Modern tech has its own issues, again LCDs can freeze where &quot;steam guage&quot; layouts can&#39;t. So then you have to design it such that if your heating element goes bad your screen still works or you have a backup. Making modern gear handle radiation is definitely an engineering challenge, From what I saw in the video it seemed pretty clear to me that&#39;s what he meant.</p>

<p>Also, they took great cameras to the moon:</p>

<p>Live broadcasts will of course be lower quality </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;To avoid this, NASA opted for a camera the quality of a 7-11 store, to not show too great of detail of a false scene. In fact, they deliberated re-photographed the television images FOUR TIMES to DEGRADE THE QUALITY (fourth generation), and would not allow the television network a high quality direct feed as they repeatedly demanded.&quot; </p>

<p>Why would they degrade the quality and deny a high quality direct-feed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more concerned with why they bothered to pack food. By my math they brought ~30 lbs of food, that&#39;s a non-trivial amount of weight. Couldn&#39;t they have just eaten the cheese on the moon? Sure it would have gotten old but hey it&#39;s moon cheese. </p>

<p>(See, I can post unsourced nonsense too)</p>

<p>The better question is why you believe they &quot;re-photographed 4 times&quot; because some crackpot author promoting a video he made told you so with no proof.</p>

<p>I will never understand why they went to the moon during the Nixon years and then just never went back? </p>

<p>Also why they would ban China from taking pictures of the lunar landing sites that would be so cool?</p>

<p>Why they wouldn&#39;t go back with modern video broadcasting technology? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s laughable. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no proof or evidence that they re-recorded 4 times. He literally just made that up, and now the burden of proof falls to those who disagree?</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not how it works. If I claim NASA did some shady stuff I need to provide evidence. My word isn&#39;t enough. Almost anyone with a basic education can write paragraphs upon paragraphs of &quot;accusations&quot; against almost any organization from Apple to the yellow pages. </p>

<p>To answer your other questions: </p>

<p>1-we went as a spectacle, a defining achievement to beat the soviets.</p>

<p>History will likely consider the lul in manned space flight as uneventful. Remember there were 100+ years between Columbus and the mayflower. </p>

<p>We could easily go back to the moon with today&#39;s tech, it&#39;s just nobody wants to write the check to. It costs tens of billions per year, and there&#39;s little economic reason to. At Apollo prices there could literally be bars of gold stacked openly on the moon and it wouldn&#39;t be profitable to go get them.</p>

<p>2- NASA can&#39;t &quot;ban&quot; China from doing anything. If China has an orbiter and wants to take pictures, assuming they&#39;re even capable of taking sufficiently high resolution images, no one can stop them. Think about it, what would NASA even do? Also, is there even a source on this? Sounds like more made up crap. </p>

<p>The government has treated NASA like a jobs program since the 60&#39;s, underfunding them and changing their goals with every new administration. It&#39;s been colossally mismanaged for decades. </p>

<p>Look what SpaceX has done on a shoestring budget. Imagine what they could do with $10 Billion/year in moon-only funding. Their new rocket (falcon heavy) which is supposed to fly this year will be capable of one-way payload deliveries to the moon and Mars. Even then it&#39;s many times smaller than the Saturn-5 (you need a ton of dV to get a return-capable craft anywhere, see: BFR SpaceX concept)</p>

<p>So in short, nobody wants to go back. The political will isn&#39;t there, the money isn&#39;t there, and NASA has been defunded and mismanaged for so many decades it&#39;s a shell of it&#39;s former self.</p>

<p>Also, if you like space definitely consider keeping up at <a href="/r/SpaceX">/r/SpaceX</a> </p>

<p>It&#39;s a great community</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like a long shot 60&#39;s tech would have been good enough to get them to the moon especially the computing tech at that time. Also it doesn&#39;t sound like NASA is so sure that they could &quot;easily&quot; go back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) trajectories are not compute-intensive things. The math is hard by hand of course but a wristwatch these days could be made to operate the tin can they sent them up there in. You don&#39;t need &quot;modern&quot; computers for trajectory control.</p>

<p>2) One astronaught gave out a fake moon rock, it doesn&#39;t mean much about the 135 countries that got samples. Russia brought back samples from a robotic lander, if the US never went it would mean keeping a conspiracy active between all 135+ countries for &gt;50 years. </p>

<p>3) it&#39;s not &quot;easy&quot;, just <em>easier</em> than it was. It would still cost tens of billions of dollars. There&#39;s no political will or reason to go back right now besides national pride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read about a joint Russian-US moon mission so obviously there is some political will and reason to go back. Some contradiction here, I mean you were the one who said we could easily go back with today&#39;s tech haha. Based on NASA&#39;s admissions about the radiation it seems like this isn&#39;t exactly the case.</p>

<p>One fake moonrock does mean something unless all of the others have been tested as authentic. But that is just personal opinion I guess. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t NASA make the flight telemetry data and the specifications of the miraculous Apollo craft available? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be more verbose: with an inflation-adjusted budget so that NASA has the same insane budget they got in the 60&#39;s it would be &quot;easy&quot;. Still a lot of work, but today it could likely be done far cheaper.</p>

<p>I saw that post, but that&#39;s scientists not politicians. The smart people have always wanted to go back, the issue is the ones who cut the checks.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got the source code for the computers than ran it on github. There&#39;s plenty of technical data about the Apollo missions available. The lander wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;miraculous&quot; beyond it&#39;s computer. The equipment onboard any recent rover is far more impressive. The lander itself was basically a tin can with a single use ascent/descent engine, life support, and cargo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on my analysis of electrons, protons, and bremsstrahlung, the predicted total dose received by the Apollo 11 astronauts as a consequence of their transits of the Van Allen radiation belts was only about 32 mrem, or 0.016 rads (all from protons ≥100 MeV). This shows that the Apollo trajectories though the VARB were not only survivable, but that the radiation doses received were inconsequential. Of course the VARB were not the only source of radiation to which the crews were exposed. To record the actual skin doses, the astronauts worn dosimeters. These dosimeter measurements for all the Apollo missions are summarized in Table 8 (Apollo 7 and 9 were Earth orbit missions).</p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t be more wrong. The amount of kerosene that had to be carried to sustain those engines was merciless. Rocket engine design has changed dramatically. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Again, think about what you are attempting to say. Do you have any idea why the rocket was so large? It was inefficient when compared to the rockets we have today. Have you even considered the fuel being used? No you haven&#39;t. The mother of all rockets was required to carry the mother of all gas tanks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh dear. Steam engines had their strengths and their weaknesses. Boilers needed to be physically maintained at a certain temp with near constant refueling by hand. They might have been powerful but they were in no way able to provide the efficient and reliable power of an F150 engine. Are you daft? Why don&#39;t you compare the fuel required to sustain a steam engine versus the fuel tank on an F150? Do you see why your examples are silly? </p>

<p>The rockets engines were large because trans-lunar injection of that much mass takes an absurd amount of thrust. </p>

<p>The F1 was a behemoth of an engine, the only thing that&#39;s going to maybe beat it is SpaceX&#39;s Raptor for the BFR and even then it will probably be smaller (with more engines)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha you&#39;re still not getting it. You claimed the F1 was vastly less efficient, and it&#39;s not. The ISPs, the CRITICAL VALUE for rocket engine efficiency, are comparable. The F1 is a larger engine, producing much more force. Your claim that this was needed because of efficiency was wrong, it was needed because of the huge payload mass and high dV needed for said high mass payload. A modern engine would be able to produce the same thrust with superior ISP, meaning you&#39;d burn less fuel to get the same acceleration, but the gain would be in the 10&#39;s of percent. </p>

<p>And I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and undergrad physics from one of the best universities in the world. Let&#39;s see your ITT tech diploma bro.</p>

<p>ISP can be compared between modern and old engines, even of different types (ion for example has insane ISP and low thrust), even jets have an ISP rating.</p>

<p>No but seriously, the moon landings, while so bold in executions as to literally coin the term &quot;moon shot(s)&quot; are pretty well established fact. Nothing but reasonable skepticism to deny them in the 60s-70s, and all science and evidence since then only reinforcing the events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.  They also could have simply taking pictures of the stars by themselves, which they never did.  A telescope was surely the most important piece of scientific equipment which they could bring to the moon, yet they did not, as it might see so far, with no atmosphere, that &quot;new&quot; galaxies might have been &quot;discovered&quot;, which could later be proven non-existent.</p>

<p>Instead, they took a car?</p>

<p>Why would they drive far way, in an untested vehicle which might break down, from their only means of survival?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Selective.</p>

<p>Albedo is different but the lunar surface is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. This means that it appears significantly brighter than would be suggested by simple Lambertian analysis.</p>

<p>How can you possibly know what albedo is and NOT know that the lunar surface (as most astronomical bodies) cannot be compared to earth simply by albedo?</p>

<p>Nonsense, clearly these people have more than just a passing resemblance. In fact both Scobee, Smith and Resnik have very distinctive faces that make them easily identifiable. Not to mention the fact that they have all aged the appropriate amount.</p>

<p>No, no they don&#39;t. Nowhere outside of that one often-reposted picture do they look anywhere similar beyond hair or skin colour. Not whatsoever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. Scobee, Smith and Resnik have very distinctive faces that make them easily identifiable</p>

<p>Features their &quot;counterparts&quot; mysteriously lack... Almost like they&#39;re different people.</p>

<p>Go ahead, post a picture of dick scobee (there are many available). Then post his &quot;doppleganger&quot;. Not the same. You see it because you want to see it.</p>

<p>Hilarious that you think they&#39;d overlook keeping the same name and work in highly visible jobs like  CEO with a publicly visible linkedin.</p>

<p>Post a blond girl. Any blond girl.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll find a picture of another blond girl where given that it&#39;s sufficiently low quality, and one picture and one picture alone, that looks the same.</p>

<p>Keep throwing turds at the wall, you&#39;ll strike gold eventually.</p>

<p>Are you serious? You think it&#39;s suspicious that there is a dude holding some coffees at a vigil? And you think it&#39;s suspicious that there happens to be a DD nearby to the pulse club, even though there are like 10000 dunkin doughnuts in this country?</p>

<p>You gotta drop the coincidence theory.  They stage these events the same way a crew would film a movie.  Nothing is there by accident.  They chose the Pulse nightclub partly for its name, partly because it was on Orange ave in Orange county, but also so they could get that shot of the actors in front of DDs.  D is equivalent to 4.  DD is paying homage to our esteemed 44th president Barack Obama.  That&#39;s why they made sure to show you a clip injured people being dumped into a <a href="http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/06/23/ORL-OPD%20OFFICERS-NEWS%20CONF_20160623233802640_5010304_ver1.0_640_360.jpg">4x4 pick up too</a>.  This is actually one of two scenes with a 4x4.  Those are the only ambulances that showed up apparently.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a mountain of evidence showing these events are fake.  The product placement and number games are just the icing on the cake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always ask myself, &quot;What would I do if I were them?&quot;  If the &quot;moon landings&quot; were fake, they had the choice of either hiring the General of the Media Department at the Pentagon, to get ample security, yet amateur results, or they could hire the best filmmaker on the planet, Stanley Kubrick, who just happen to be shooting a film about going to moon at the time, &quot;2001 a space Odyssey&quot;.  Seeing how the most important thing was the short-term benefit of convincing photography, this would have had to of have been the choice that they made.</p>

<p>In reagrad to the most convincing evidence of the moon landing fraud, or the &quot;smoking gun&quot;, my film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">“A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon”</a>, which contains newly discovered video evidence of the moon landing fraud, then they would see, with their own eyes, recently uncovered unedited behind-the-scenes outtakes of false photography of the “moon missions”.</p>

<p>The scene contained therein has never been broadcast to the public.  In it, Neil Armstrong is using a one-foot diameter model of the earth, from low earth orbit, to create the illusion for the television viewers, that he and his crew are half way to the moon, when they are, in fact, still in earth orbit. This is absolute proof that, though they were on the rocket in low earth orbit, the crew never went any further, due to lethal space radiation.</p>

<p>This revealing footage is even dated by NASA’s own computer clock as having taken place two days into Armstrong’s flight, when he is supposed to be half way to the moon, or some 135,000 miles away from the earth, yet he and his crew are clearly shown (in these newly discovered unedited outtakes of the broadcast) to still be in earth orbit, and are instead, falsifying the television photography to deceive the viewing public of their real location. The CIA is even heard on a private, third audio channel, prompting Armstrong to respond to Mission Control’s questions, only after four seconds have elapsed, in order to create the false impression of an increased radio delay, so as to appear to be much farther from the earth than he and his crew actually were. Jump ahead to time 32:02 – 40:50 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">“A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon”</a> if you do not wish to view the entire forty seven minute documentary and only see the newly discovered unedited out-takes of Neil Armstrong falsifying mission photography during the historic and now infamous mission.</p>

<p>It&#39;s terrible. What you have is legitimate video overlayed with claims from a narrator that are unsupported by the video evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Here they&#39;re putting a piece of paper by the camera to make it look like the earth&#39;s shadow&quot;</p>

<p>Umm no, there&#39;s nothing like that there at all, just blurry video of the earth. It&#39;s not like you see someone with a piece of paper line up the shot or something.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we see the date, it was filmed two days after they left!&quot; </p>

<p>No shit, it was filmed mid-flight. </p>

<p>The claims they make are not supported by the video evidence. They could just as easily try and say the earth is flat or something from that video. And before you say anything I&#39;ve argued with people here who think the ISS is fake and yes flat earthers are real (and they sometimes come here)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A poorly made video showing multiple shooters would, in fact, support the lone gunman theory.  </p>

<p>This is a known disinformation technique.  Its called poisoning the well I think.  </p>

<p>It works like this.  You have incident x that happened a certain way.  You want to discredit the idea that incident x happened that way. So you release easily debunked evidence that contradicts the theory you want to support.  Then later when people say incident x did happen that way - you say &quot;no, that is just a notion that was put in place by that debunked piece of fake evidence.&quot;      </p>

<p>The Killian documents are a good example of this:<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy</a>    </p>

<p>Everyone knows that Bush didn&#39;t serve honorably in the military.<br/>
Someone gives Dan Rather easily debunked &quot;evidence&quot; that Bush didn&#39;t serve honorably.<br/>
Then later they debunk this evidence.<br/>
Now, everyone has it in their mind that the idea that Bush didn&#39;t serve honorably in the military is based on faulty information.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In August of 2009 it was reported, albeit as a news oddity (and it certainly was) that a “moon rock”, personally given to the president of the Netherlands by Neil Armstrong in 1969, who supposedly hand picked it off of the “moon’s surface” himself, was opened forty years later from its hermitically sealed container by a curious museum curator after they had watched “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon”. Following microscopic examination, the rock was verified to actually be a deceptively authentic looking piece of petrified wood instead! Yet again, not a single journalist, except for myself, asked the question, “If the moon rocks are fraudulent . . . What about the moon missions?”</p>

<p>This is why it is a federal crime to be in possession of a &quot;moon rock&quot;, because doing so would prove the fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My life story regarding the “moon landings” is a conversion story, much like an ancient religious leader who persecuted the Truth, whom then he became their leading advocate. My father was in the Air Force. I grew up around the latest aviation and technology. I loved it! On July 20th, 1969, I was only four years of age, quietly asleep in bed. My father, as a celebrated military officer, was given a VIP package of commemorative photographs of the event, which he gave to me as a cherished present. From the age of about four to fourteen, these pictures covered an entire “sacred” wall in my bedroom. It was a shrine (like a religion) to the intellectual prowess of humankind. I saw these images, every day, three hundred sixty-five days a year, for ten years. This means I propagating the desired belief in their authenticity, three thousand six hundred fifty times before I even considered the possibility that they were misrepresentations of reality . . . That’s a lot of brainwashing!</p>

<p>Fortunately, at the age of fourteen, I saw an enlightened television program featuring an interview with William Kaysing, a NASA contractor during the Apollo “moon missions”. He asserted, quite confidently, from first hand experience, that the impossible Apollo flights were staged to increase the prestige of the United States during the height of the Cold War, and in the pit of domestic discontentment because of tens of thousands of young American boys dying needlessly in an ambiguous foreign war in Vietnam. Nixon himself said that the Vietnam War protests were the Number One cause of American strife.</p>

<p>After watching the program, I went to my enshrined bedroom “wall of infamy” and looked, for the first time, with new eyes, at theses surprisingly telling pictures. Sure enough, just like the man said, stunning evidence of photographic anomalies were hidden in plain sight! (They say this is the very best place to hide something investigators are looking for!) I just had to have “eyes that see”, after all, a famous prophet notably said that most people “have eyes that do not see, and ears that do not hear”.</p>

<p>I equate this with a saltshaker always being placed in the left kitchen cabinet, on the third shelf, on the left side, for ten years. If your spouse inadvertently moves it to the left kitchen cabinet, on the third shelf, on the right side . . . you don’t see it, even though it is right there in front of your eyes! . . . There you stand, with the cabinet door wide open, the salt shaker right in front of you only inches away (though on the right side of the shelf rather than the left, where you were trained not to look), and you do not see it! . . . There I was, looking at the same pictures of the alleged moon landings over and over again for a full decade, yet not seeing quite obvious inconsistencies and abnormalities that would quickly give away the deceptive criminality of the event, if only I would look beyond my programmed response!</p>

<p>In a way, like naïve Adam and Eve, you can’t blame people for initially being deceived, after all, which is a more pleasant realm to live in, one in which your country or world continually lies about science, integrity and spending, or one in which your country or world is scientifically unsurpassed, honorable and financially honest? Naturally, people almost always seem to see the latter, simply because this is the kind of realm they would rather live in.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at the age of twenty-four, I had become a filmmaker, and happened to be editing a movie one day for the very producer of the show I had seen as a fourteen year old, ten years earlier, about the moon landing fraud! “Do you remember that man you had on your show who said the moon landings were fake?” I asked, “What was his name? I’d like to talk with him.” The rest is history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was proven in 1962 that a laser can be bounced and calibrated off of the moon without a manmade reflector thereon, simply due to the reflectivity of the lunar surface.  Secondly, Russia put a manmade mirror on the moon’s surface during the time of the Apollo missions for this same claimed purpose, using instead an un-manned probe that would not have to suffer the biological ravages of lethal space radiation.  (See the March 1959 issue, Volume 200, Number 3, of the magazine “Scientific American”, article entitled “Radiation Belts Around the Earth”, to see how deadly and impenetrable space radiation is beyond the safety of low earth orbit where the space station currently resides, at an altitude of merely 205 miles above the earth . . . The moon being about 239,000 miles away.)</p>

<p>Thirdly, seeing how all of these lasers have their data computer controlled, it would only take one computer hacker, if they so desired, to manipulate the data shown on a scientist’s viewing monitor, which they could completely manipulate, making the very employees of NASA ignorant of the facts. This was precisely the case at “mission control” during the “moon missions”, where dozens of computer “operators”, actually just read the preprogrammed data screens like news anchors, who do not write their own words, openly admitting afterwards that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a flight “simulation” and a “real” flight.</p>

<p>Actually about the data, it&#39;s interesting because I have never found any raw data, every single file i have found was compiled results. This is problematic to prove that the experiment is what it claims to be, we need the raw data for statistical analysis, and we also need the calibration data to prove that what they consider positives are in fact positives... But as it stands, there is nothing to prove any of it makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As various nations and private enterprises finally, after nearly fifty years, have the capability to send microwave oven sized probes to the moon (still no men), NASA has quickly drafted regulations to keep their alleged manned landing sites of the Nixon administration completely off-limits. They have said that any flyovers of the coordinates, or ground incursions thereof, into these areas by probes of other nations, to prove or disprove their authenticity, are strictly forbidden. (Since when does the US government own the moon?) You would think that they would gladly welcome independent proof (which there has never been) that their outrageous scientific claims of 1960’s technology were real (even though the feat cannot be repeated today), especially in the face of growing universal doubt to the contrary, yet the exact opposite proves to be the case. (It is like a murderer who boasts of his innocence, all the while refusing to give a DNA sample, when he well knows that incriminating DNA evidence was left by him at the crime scene.)</p>

<p>China, a trillion dollar trading partner of the United States, recently sent a probe to the moon. As all of the moon is uniformly desolate and one landing site is just about as good as any other, I would think that the perfect and most logical place to land would be that of the United State’s alleged first “moon mission”, to prove to the world that their probe was really on the moon. Yet if the “moon landing” artifacts are not there themselves, this might be biting the trillion dollar trading-partner hand that feeds them. Subsequently, China steered clear of any supposed NASA “moon landing” sites for any of their lunar probes, even thought these were the most logical places to land.</p>

<p>Astrobotic Technology, a private firm, had planned to land a probe precisely at the claimed “Apollo 11” landing site, as they too saw this as the most logical choice to prove that they were really there, yet because of pressure from NASA not to do so, and subsequently embarrass the organization and nation for not having really landed on the moon in the 1960’s, the president of the company, John Thornton, caved in and agreed not to land there as originally planned, even though the moon is owned by no one and he was “free” to do so. (Is it freedom when scientific exploration is completely altered because of political pressure from a government agency?)</p>

<p>I do know that if &quot;Gilligan&#39;s Island&quot; was made in color four years earlier, and NASA surely had much more technology and money than they, that NASA would have surely had high-resolution COLOR camera on the moon to showcase their technological prowess.  The problem was, the cameras were so high of resolution that they might have shown unwanted detail in the untested fake &quot;moon landing&quot; sets.  To avoid this, NASA opted for a camera the quality of a 7-11 store, to not show too great of detail of a false scene.  In fact, they deliberated re-photographed the television images FOUR TIMES to DEGRADE THE QUALITY (fourth generation), and would not allow the television network a high quality direct feed as they repeatedly demanded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because when you take a photograph it needs to be adjusted for exposure, that is, setting the aperture to let in the right about of light to create a representative image of what the eye sees. Taking pictures of the moon will drown out the light from stars. If you wanted to take star photos from the sunny side of the moon, you would need to create a light shield around the lens, point it towards space, and shoot a long exposure.</p>

<p>What I posted is easily researched by learning about photography, the moon need not be involved.</p>

<p>An experiment you might try is trying to take pictures of a small indicator light (like on a DVD player) while standing on a reflective surface under intense flood lights. It will be hard to do without shielding the camera.</p>

<p>It&#39;s different on earth because we have the atmosphere to disperse sunlight and rarely is the landscape as reflective as would be similar to the moon.</p>

<p>Edit: Another, easier experiment would be simply trying to take pictures of stars at night, from your back yard. It&#39;s really hard to do, and especially with film.</p>

<p>Well, if 135 countries get moon rocks not one decides to test them? You don&#39;t think once one finds out they&#39;re &quot;fake&quot; others wouldn&#39;t start to test them?</p>

<p>You want to keep this going for 50 years in 135 different countries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most repeated argument against the fraud, is the reported hundreds of thousands of people throughout the industry who contributed to the “moon missions”, who, allegedly, would have had to have been informed of the fraud and kept it secret. Again, seemingly a good argument, yet it is not with only a little extra thought and investigation.</p>

<p>Do you really think the CIA was stupid enough to tell hundreds of thousands of contractors the goings-on of a top-top-secret project? Would the CIA really be so careless as to tell the person making the rocket’s door handle, the glove, or the boot of the spacesuit, that they were actually faking the moon landings? Do we really think the CIA is that stupid to tell so many low level people something they wanted to keep secret? Furthermore, to say that because my uncle worked at NASA and believed the moon landings were real, is proof that they were real, is like saying that because my uncle worked as a vender at the Super Bowl and believes that the game was honest, that this is proof that the football players didn’t cheat to win!</p>

<p>Just like a pyramid of power in any business, what the employee, the manager, and the regional manager knows about the business’ actual agenda, is completely different than what the CEO at the very top knows. Remember, there were only three people (“trusted” government employees) who were actually there at the time. As you will see in my film “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon” (linked below), the three crew members were indeed on the rocket, they did launch into earth orbit on July 16th (to attain realistic “zero gravity” flight photography), they did splash down in the ocean eight days later (to add to the realism), yet the rest, everything beyond earth orbit (which is only what they can do today), was completely contrived, like a masterful illusionist, by satellite data manipulation, complete media control, and professional movie sets. After all, what is easier to do, to actually build a rocket and travel to another planet with 1960’s technology on the very first attempt, or simply make a movie about it? The age old argument “The simplest explanation is the true one“, which many “Apollo proponents” use to suggest the “moon missions” authenticity, actually proves the fraud instead!</p>

<p>The simple fact is, it is easier to fake a moon mission than to actually do one . . . the exact reason why the film “The Martian” was filmed in an earthly simulated television studio, rather than on Mars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I was even once invited to the NASA launch headquarters in Florida as an official member of the press, with personalized credentials, a formal written invitation, and a scheduled appointment, yet when I asked an “Apollo” astronaut to confirm that he actually left Earth orbit, because I had newly discovered evidence to the contrary, I was promptly, and forcibly, removed from the property by security forces, with the threat of arrest if I persisted with my questions.

<p>One argument against the Apollo missions is the radiation caused by crossing the Van Allen belts. What&#39;s your take on that argument and <a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm">this article that tries to debunk it</a> based on the trajectory of the Apollo missions through the &#39;thinnest part&#39; of the Apollo missions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your kind words.</p>

<p>Some of the best evidence supporting the fraud is the fact that in 1998, when the space shuttle flew to its highest altitude ever, three hundred sixty-five miles, one third higher than they normally flew, they were asked to descend to a lower altitude by mission control due to lethal space radiation they encountered, by approaching too close to the “Van Allen Radiation Belts”, which don’t even begin until one thousand miles altitude (and continue for an additional twenty-five thousand miles). That is to say, they were six hundred thirty-five miles away from radiation that was so intense, that the crew reported they could see the radiation with their eyes closed as sparks of light hitting the retinas of their closed eyes. When this happened, CNN inadvertently reported of the moon landing fraud.</p>

<p>“The radiation belt surrounding earth is more dangerous than previously believed.”</p>

<p>Apparently, not a single journalist on the entire planet figured out, except for myself, that this statement totally contradicts the authenticity of the moon landings! . . . here’s why . . .</p>

<p>The only time in world history when human beings are said to have traveled through the twenty-five thousand mile thick radiation field called the “Van Allen Radiation Belts”, which unbeknownst to most, surrounds earth starting at an altitude of one thousand miles and extending twenty-five thousand miles beyond that, the only claimed transversing is during the alleged moon missions.</p>

<p>Why is it then that astronauts some six hundred thirty-five miles away from this radiation, twenty-nine years later, know more about the radiation than the Apollo astronauts who claimed they were in the middle of it eighteen times to the moon and back?</p>

<p>Remember, the recent discovery proves that the radiation is . . . “more dangerous than previously believed”. What is “previously believed” if not based on the previous reports from the “experts” of the radiation, the Apollo crews, who were allegedly the only ones in all of world history to have ever traveled through this radiation (and eighteen times at that, to the moon and back), all with no ill effects and no reports of any kind of the visible sparks of radiation being seen, as were later reported by the space shuttle crew from hundreds of miles away, not even in the middle of it as the Apollo crews supposedly were!</p>

<p>Of course, this is simply not possible.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>It means that the people who claimed to have previously been inside the radiation field lied about being there! Of course too, if the “Apollo” crews never went through the Van Allen Radiation Belt, as this contradictory report reveals, then they certainly could not have gone to the moon either, which the traversing of this radiation would require!</p>

<p>Why does no one connect the dots with this very revealing information except me? Because the dots lead to a horrific truth that would break the spirit of the entire American nation, proving that most people would rather believe a pleasurable lie, than a painful truth.</p>

<p>In December of 2014, NASA sent their brand new “Orion” spacecraft, unmanned, directly into the Van Allen Radiation Belt, at a 3,600 mile altitude, and then u-turned it for a prompt return to earth.</p>

<p>What is worth studying at 3600 miles?</p>

<p>The purpose of the “Orion” was to . . . “to test the instruments”. What “instruments” were onboard the Orion spacecraft? GEIGER COUNTERS TO MEASURE THE RADIATION INSIDE OF THE RADIATION BELTS AT 3600 MILES.</p>

<p>Didn’t NASA already have these measurements decades ago from the Apollo moon missions, if indeed men actually went through the radiation belts 18 times? Why is it so important to “test the instruments” at a 3,600 mile altitude inside of the radiation belts? . . .</p>

<p>To see if humans can survive transversing it . . .</p>

<p>. . . for the very first time!</p>

<p>Apparently today’s new generation of NASA engineers, some in their twenty’s, have stumbled upon this significant NASA contradiction. Though they were probably led into the space exploration field by the motivation of the seemingly glorious inaugural “moon missions” of the 1960’s, the fact that such a feat cannot be duplicated even today with five decades more advanced technology, and that aside from theses alleged moon missions of the Nixon administration, no one has ever gone more than 400 miles away from the earth in the nearly fifty years ?</p>

<p>Kelly Smith, one of these twenty-ish engineers, was selected as the official “Orion” mission spokesperson in the following NASA video press release. Notice that at :43 seconds into the film, Smith confirms that the radiation belts are made up of “Extreme Radiation”. At time 3:06 he again refers to the belts as “Dangerous Radiation”. Finally at time 3:36, for the third time, Smith plainly states, “We must solves these (radiation) challenges before we send people through this region of space.”</p>

<p>The question is, if the solution to the dangerous radiation belt problem has yet to be invented (“We must solves these challenges before we send people through this region of space.”), then how is it that the Apollo crews during their alleged “moon missions” went through this dangerous and extreme radiation nearly fifty years ago when the necessary equipment to survive doing so has yet to be invented ? (“We must solves these challenges before we send people through this region of space.”)</p>

<p>When I asked NASA’s press office to interview Kelly Smith about this matter, they refused to grant him permission to talk with me. When I emailed a list of mostly harmless questions about the Orion mission, NASA politely answered all of them. When I submitted a more difficult inquiry about Kelly Smith’s three statements about the dangerous radiation of the Van Allen Belts and how the radiation problem must be solved before NASA sends astronauts through them, NASA refused to reply to these questions, as if I had never asked them. When I asked for the readings of the Orion spacecraft’s onboard Geiger Counters in REM, NASA said that such information was a secret and that I would have to file a “Freedom of Information Act” request to attain the measurements. When I asked why such information about the radiation belt’s strength in REM is a secret, NASA refused to answer and then terminated all further communication with me. (Just 1 REM per hour is five times a lethal dose, As you will read below, the Radiation Belts contain up to 100 REM per hour.)</p>

<p>When NASA sent publicly funded probes and spacecraft to measure the temperature of the sun and the amount of hydrogen in Jupiter’s atmosphere, this information was readily available to scientists and to the public, after all, why would a measurement of a part of nature be a secret? Likewise, the amount radiation in REM in the Van Allen Radiation Belts which surround the earth is simply a part of nature and, as such, there is no reason whatsoever why such elementary measurements of nature should be a government secret . . . unless disclosing such measurements would reveal the impossibility of the Apollo crews having gone through them and surviving with decades older technology, seeing how NASA just acknowledged, accidentally or otherwise, that such protection from this “Dangerous” and “Extreme” radiation has yet to be invented by the space agency and “must” be invented “before we send people through this region of space.”</p>

Shielding is the reason that the astronauts didn&#39;t die en route to the moon. They were well aware of high radiation, read this for more info.

Over the past 50 years radiation shielding has improved a lot but the new methods obviously need to tested. Even your &quot;NASA admission&quot; states that &quot;shielding will be put to the test&quot;. 
It seems to me that you hand pick pieces of information, even change the wording and make conclusions that everyone is lying. </p>

<p>The narrator is blatantly telling you what to see, while a video shows them looking out a window. It&#39;s so hilariously bad if you actually believed in the moon landings being fake you should consider this video disinfo. </p>

<p>No, I know exactly what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;ve studied optics, orbital physics, and a hell of a lot more at university. I know laws, and can intuitively reason through this stuff because of both experience and education. </p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/forces/imgfor/isqrr.gif">The inverse square law</a> proves you wrong. </p>

<p>Physics is a bitch!</p>

<p>Because this is so hard for you to understand, the astronaut is inside the cabin behind the camera as well as the light. The earth is on the other side of the glass. The cabin light (behind the camera) is producing enough light to create a reflection on the glass plane between the camera and it&#39;s view outside. </p>

<p>This locally generated light is indeed many times brighter than the earth appears to be as the earth is very far away. Again, <em>inverse fucking square law</em>. </p>

<p>Ever wondered why a $3 LED light from walmart can outshine a star in the sky at night. Now you know!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re young I&#39;ll let this one go, but if you&#39;re an adult you seriously might have some developmental problems. </p>

I&#39;ll have to surrender to the official story because after watching the longer footage the window has a diffuse blue light coming from outside and the glare from the interior lights (and newly revealed sunlight after the opposite window was uncovered) does block the view of Earth from coming in.

    <div class="md"><p>NOTE: I was replying to your DELETED COMMENT but I felt like I should just post this here.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening here is that Neil Armstrong is talking about being halfway to the moon in a video that turns out to be taken near an object that lights up Apollo with its brightness. If I am inside a ship that is halfway to the moon, how bright is Earth going to be? You say it&#39;s glare but when the camera had just had its iris almost closed we clearly see that it&#39;s the Earth causing the glare. Look at these pictures:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/CzaZVL.png">https://i.sli.mg/CzaZVL.png</a></p>

<p>First picture: Clearly Earth with the worklight to the top left</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/NMIHIr.png">https://i.sli.mg/NMIHIr.png</a></p>

<p>Second Picture: Same window, same worklight, now showing the cabin lit up and Earth shining many times brighter than the interior lights which light up the astronaut easily.</p>

<p>If you are halfway to the moon how bright is Earth going to be?</p>

<p>If the voices are faked or added from another source what are they doing trying to get this shot of Earth? Any ship in orbit could get the same view. If the tag on the video about the DATE of the video is correct, the whole WORLD were told they ALREADY WERE halfway to the moon while THEY WERE FILMING THIS?  Even without the voices it&#39;s a smoking gun.</p>

<p>Watch it again and again until you understand that what you are arguing is not what is shown. How can a reflection block the light from Earth? The astronaut floats in front of the window right before my second shot and blocks the white object. It&#39;s not a reflection he is in front of the window then moves away and it is so bright because the Earth is so close.</p>

<p>Nah. Look again- oh wait BS the liar didn&#39;t include all that other footage, which is easily available on youtube, which shows the interior of the cabin and its setup with the lights and camera- nor the other ones with a small earth very clearly in the background.</p>

<p>Strange that for a ship in LEO which would have been as bright as venus, no one saw anything on earth which matched a ship in LEO, as bright as venus and moving at considerable speed.</p>

<p>strange also that the weather patterns on the earth move- so now this is a magic &quot;transparency&quot; which can animate?</p>

<p>strange also that the weather patterns match exactly the readily available satellite weather data for the date and time- but I guess the government controls the weather too so they just made it all work...</p>

<p>Nah, I&#39;ve actually watched all of the footage and not just the few-second clip that the conman sibrel put in his little jerk-off project. The footage which shows the cabin, and the window, the earth and the lights.  The footage that the liar left out.</p>

<p>Because there&#39;s a very bright light right there.</p>

<p>Because the camera is put up against the window and its aperture stopped down.  This is stated by Armstrong in his voice communication.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You even see him adjust the aperture.  You can see more of this in the full, <em>readily available</em> footage which sibrel opted to leave it because it would shed further light on his moronic assumptions.</p>

<p>Somehow this magically light up transparency (how? what&#39;s lighting it?) both changes weather patterns, changes size, changes position, is visible the entire time during the ~45 minutes of recorded footage, but as soon as the aperture is adjusted on the camera to allow more light in, then somehow it disappears and fades away because the &quot;actual&quot; earth is shining so brightly, which no other image of leo has ever demonstrated earth in a viewport to shine so brightly- while the nearby light of the cabin, now much brighter on the camera as its aperture is wide open has zero effect on the reflection the window.</p>

<p>christ, he even says &quot;we&#39;re moving back from the window, to reconfigure for interior lighting&quot; does sibrel include that part of the footage? nope.</p>

<p>similarly, in the 30 minute reel, you see numerous movements of the camera past the window, with the aperture stopped low but not as low as when zoomed in. this shows the earth far in the background, with the cabin roughly half lit and with a small amount of glare in the window. glare + earth background. and guess what? the earth is tiny. you also see, as he&#39;s looking right out the window from the left side how much the &quot;reflection&quot; of the window changes as the camera adjusts. and no LEO earth bullshit. did sibrel leave this footage in?</p>

<p>nope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you mean the &quot;Saturn V&quot; rocket . . .</p>

<p>Are you suggesting NASA could have faked the moon landings without launching a rocket?</p>

<p>Just like David Copperfield, he uses a real elephant, yet it does not actually levitate without behind-the-scenes- trickery.</p>

<p>Although the technology allegedly used to “put a man on the moon” was not classified, because the missions were “supposed” to have been done by a non-military “civilian” government agency (NASA), the specific details of the hypothetically miraculous machinery, according to NASA, are nevertheless “unavailable”. This is because all of the flight telemetry data, as well as all of the technical specifications of the “Apollo” spacecraft, were deliberately destroyed by NASA after the “moon missions”! You would think that such important, one of a kind, and supremely valuable design at a cost of FORTY BILLION DOLLARS, would be kept for just short of all eternity, in case such expensive to attain information would be needed again in the near future . . . Yet the exact opposite is the case.</p>

<p>How did the lunar lander power air-conditioning against an outside temperature of 252 degrees Fahrenheit (122 C) down to an amazing 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 C) inside for three days nonstop with a bank of, essentially, car batteries? No one will ever know! All of the schematics and electrical diagrams of the lunar lander were deliberately destroyed! How did the “moon” rocket go 1000 times farther than the space shuttle with less advanced engines? No one will ever know! The rocket diagrams and blueprints were removed from the archives and are nowhere to be found! All of this was done so that if a curious and astute propulsion or electrical engineering student in the future were to do the actual mathematical calculations, they would be able to expose the fact that the “moon” vehicle, in reality, did not have the electrical battery capacity necessary to power the air-conditioning down 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 C) from the outside temperature, nonstop for three days, nor did it have the fuel necessary to leave Earth orbit to begin with, as the newly uncovered video evidence clearly proves by the crew’s falsification of being half way to the moon!</p>

<p>When the government told the man in charge of the “moon” rocket to adjust his numbers “a little bit” to reflect a fictitious way to reach the moon with the available resources and technology of the time, he immediately recanted on his fuel calculations by a factor of more than 32,000 percent! Did I mention that this man in charge of the “Apollo” program’s authenticity, Wernher von Braun, was a former World War Two Nazi whom our own government’s State Department is on the record for saying that, had he not prematurely died shortly after the “moon missions”, he would have been immediately thereafter indicted for War Crimes for overseeing the genocide, and the cover-up thereof, of hundreds of innocent people?</p>

<p>Another leading scientist at the time, James Van Allen, the discoverer of the radiation belts who so humbly named them after himself, originally said that the lethal radiation belts previously spoken of in this article, through which the “moon mission” crews would have been the only astronauts in history to have ever traversed in order to leave the safety of Earth orbit and reach the moon, if indeed their missions were real, would be “10-100 times more deadly than a lethal dose”! Under pressure from NASA, he too, like Braun, dramatically recanted his original findings in order to make it appear as if the moon landings were possible. Don’t believe me again? Below is the link to his original published findings in the respected national journal “Scientific American”, in which Van Allen spoke plainly about the radiation belts beyond earth orbit being an obstacle for practical space travel to the moon and beyond, just as Kelly Smith of the Orion mission did.</p>

<p>Van Allen himself said this, in an article published in 1959 in “Scientific American” magazine after NASA sent probes with Geiger counters into the radiation belts:</p>

<p>“Our measurements show that the maximum radiation level as of 1958 is equivalent to between 10 and 100 REM per hour, depending on the still undetermined proportion of protons to electrons. Since a human being exposed for two days to even 10 REM would have only an even chance of survival, the radiation belts obviously present an obstacle to space flight.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve asked this question many times but as yet there has been no answer.  Isn&#39;t all of space awash in radiation?  Isn&#39;t our Sun throwing out massive amounts of radiation in all directions at all times?  If so aren&#39;t the Van Allen Belts not just a strip of radiation but a barrier, inside of which the Earth is kept safe in outside of which is deadly radiated space?  I mean what does it matter what the thinnest part of the Van Allen belts is, when even if you were to get through them there would still be radiation to deal with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1) Do some actual research/take some classes on &quot;ray-d-aye-shun&quot; and figure out how dose/exposure works</p>

<p>Step 2) Understand the different kinds of radiation, your face is <em>awash</em> in &quot;radiation&quot; from your screen right now. It&#39;s called light. If your monitor was giving off alpha/beta/gamma rays on the other hand.... you might have a problem</p>

<p>Step 3) look up the recorded radiation levels at these various points. It is PROVEN UNCONTESTED FACT that we have sats in geosynchronous orbit aka 24k miles out or more. We have extensive measurements all over the place. </p>

<p>Step 4) compare these levels with what&#39;s known deadly to humans, and figure out the worst-case amount of time that would result in you getting a harmful dose. </p>

<p>When you do all that, you&#39;ll understand that even with minimal shielding one can pass through just fine with the kinds of speeds required by trans-lunar injection. </p>

<p>Now, if you happened to try that during a solar flare you&#39;d get cooked but these guys were military men and knew the risks. </p>

<p>TOO MANY PEOPLE go &quot;but but space has radiation!&quot; with little to know training or understanding for what any of that even means. Certain types of radiation can literally be stopped by scotch tape, others need 3 ft of lead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was proven in 1962 that a laser can be bounced and calibrated off of the moon without a manmade reflector thereon, simply due to the reflectivity of the lunar surface.  Secondly, Russia put a manmade mirror on the moon’s surface during the time of the Apollo missions for this same claimed purpose, using instead an un-manned probe that would not have to suffer the biological ravages of lethal space radiation.  (See the March 1959 issue, Volume 200, Number 3, of the magazine “Scientific American”, article entitled “Radiation Belts Around the Earth”, to see how deadly and impenetrable space radiation is beyond the safety of low earth orbit where the space station currently resides, at an altitude of merely 205 miles above the earth . . . The moon being about 239,000 miles away.)</p>

<p>Lastly, seeing how all of these lasers have their data computer controlled, it would only take one computer hacker, if they so desired, to manipulate the data shown on a scientist’s viewing monitor, which they could completely manipulate, making the very employees of NASA ignorant of the facts. This was precisely the case at “mission control” during the “moon missions”, where dozens of computer “operators”, actually just read the preprogrammed data screens like news anchors, who do not write their own words, openly admitting afterwards that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a flight “simulation” and a “real” flight.</p>

<p>In regard to the moon&#39;s temperature, according to NASA, it is about 252 degrees Fahrenheit (or 122 Celsius).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if those reflectors are there (as we have been bouncing lasers off the moon since lasers) it doesn&#39;t take a manned mission to put them there. I could draw you a diagram for a reflector cube that would work from any angle it landed in a few minutes... this is the same technology in tire reflectors you see on kid&#39;s bikes.</p>

<p>the moon is both boiling hot and freezing cold (allegedly) because of the lack of a real atmosphere. naked sunlight without the magnetic field and several layers of composite atmosphere to protect you would roast you in moments, even as far away from it as we are now (or would be on the moon)... Raw gamma, xray, cosmic, etc... and the transition from sunlight to shadow would cause this temperature difference more or less immediately... space is not a friendly place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the laser ranging experiment (allegedly) works...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>they send a bunch of formatted photons packets (particular wavelength) in a timed fashion at what they estimate to be the location of the mirror.</p></li>
<li><p>They receive some photons back, discard everything at a different wavelength and discard everything that doesn&#39;t fit the expected timing, and then if they have enough photons left they consider it a positive and the distance is considered.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This would be a scientific experiment if and only if: the raw data was public AND the calibration data was public (it isn&#39;t as far as i can tell, even got in touch with the french laser crew, no can do).
Without these two items, they can say whatever they want, no one can contradict them.</p>

<p>TL;DR: the laser ranging experiment lacks one of the most important attribute of scientific research: transparency (the other one is reproduction, and that as well is lacking since very few people have clearance to man the very few lasers)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I excelled in science and match in school, though found them too boring for a life&#39;s pursuit.</p>

<p>TRUE &quot;science&quot; is simply pursuit of the TRUTH.  This includes uncovering FRAUD.</p>

<p>Regardless of who killed Kennedy, whether it be Oswald or another, the president remains dead. Regardless of who orchestrated 911, three thousand remain dead. The uniqueness of the “moon landing” conspiracy, unlike the others, is that it is the only conspiracy that I know of which is positive. It was a lie that made everyone feel good. Trying to take that away from some is like telling them their home team cheated to win the Super Bowl. They are in no way interested in hearing such a thing, even if it is True. In the same way, I once asked a renowned college professor at a prestigious university what would he think about the issue if he heard Neil Armstrong himself confess to the deception. He replied, “I’d still think we went.”</p>

<p>When I was a child, believing in Santa clause was so much fun. When I found out it was merely a deception to make me feel good, I was devastated. Believing that we live in a magical world where men can fly to the moon on their very first attempt with 1960’s technology is fun too, even though the feat cannot be repeated nearly five decades later, by any nation on earth, including the one that allegedly did it first nearly fifty years ago, even though all truth reminds us that the South Pole, and Mount Everest, and First Flight, and the Light Bulb, was never, ever achieved on the first attempt, and certainly never abandoned once achieved, never again to be repeated.</p>

<p>Why do so many people believe this lie? Because they want to. They want to believe this lie. Believing this lie means they live in a better world than they actually do. Yet the fact is, they do not. They live in a world of deplorable million-man genocide, horrific rape, vicious murder, hateful racism, and unthinkable child molestation, and yet, for some reason, they think that in a world such as this no one would do such a dishonest thing as faking a moon landing. Believe it or not, this is the number one reason I hear from smart people, who in their longing to be part of a society of pride boosting Santa Clause science, cannot see the plainness of the simple fact that technology does not go backwards.</p>

<p>If it were so easy to go to the moon on the very first attempt with 1/10th less computing power than is found today in a ten dollar Walmart watch, then there would be bases there by now, nearly fifty years later. The South Pole has temperatures that reach below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (-73 C) and hurricane force wind speeds, yet there are bases there. Why? Because it is humanly possible. If it were humanly possible to reach the moon, there too would be bases there. The fact that there are not, is proof itself that it cannot be done.</p>

<p>After Columbus arrived in the “New World, within a year, numerous other European nations traveled to the new world.  After Lewis and Clark ventured to the American west, shortly thereafter, citizens everywhere traveled to the American west.  After the Wright brothers accomplished powered flight, within a year, numerous others repeated their technological accomplishment.</p>

<p>Charles Lindbergh first flew across the Atlantic in an airplane in 1927. Fifty years later, there were millions of airplanes flying across the Atlantic. Soon it will be fifty years since America allegedly had men leisurely playing golf on the moon in complete safety with 1960’s technology, all on the very first attempt. In comparison, the 747 aircraft, built after seventy years of successful aviation history and millions of manufactured aircraft, was developed at the very same time as the “Apollo” spacecraft, the first ever vehicle to take men to another planet, yet the 747 took one year longer to construct and endured over 160 failed attempts before it finally got off of the ground!</p>

<p>When it comes to perceiving the truth in a world full of lies, historically, the majority has always been deceived, and later proved wrong, by the minority of their contemporaries, whom they persecuted and considered deceived at the time, when in fact it was they who were deceived. Does a person know it when they are deceived? No, they do not. You see, you can be sincere . . . and be sincerely wrong.</p>

<p>The majority of scientists thought the world was flat. The majority of astronomers thought the earth was the center of the universe. The majority of physicians thought bleeding the sickness out of a person was a cure. The majority of Americans thought Nixon was honest. Likewise, a majority of scientists, astronomers, physicians, and Americans think the moon landings were real, yet their titles and majority do not equal truth, as history has well proven . . . and will prove again.</p>

<p>Why is it so difficult for to see the truth?</p>

<p>Very simple . . . Pride.</p>

<p>“The Pride of your heart has deceived you.”</p>

<p>-Obadiah 1:3-</p>

<p>Pride is simply the unwillingness to be wrong, just as humility is the willingness to be wrong. The great thing about being wrong, which is what I had to finally admit about the moon landings, is that I am learning something new, and I am no longer walking through life in error. The bad thing about being right all the time, is that I cannot learn anything new, and I am living my life in a self-deceived state, which is the very worst form of deception. When someone else deceives me, if I try hard enough, I can eventually figure it out, after all, I know that other people cannot be trusted all of the time. Yet when I am self-deceived, it is nearly impossible for me to overcome, because the person I am relying on for “facts” is myself . . . and of course I can trust myself! . . . even when I am wrong.</p>

<p>When someone considers themself smart, this is the first step towards their ignorance. They boast about their years of experience and degrees, and thereby pour concrete around their finite knowledge, unawaringly calling their stone mound of limited facts, the entire universe of truth. If you try to tell them they are wrong, they will defend their post to their emotional and intellectual death at all cost, all the while attempting to defile you with their venomous words for pointing out their mistake, even if you are right, just like those previously mentioned throughout history who believed in a flat world and a bleeding recovery.</p>

<p>Just like OJ Simpson’s lawyers, who later admitted they knew of his guilt and were only “doing their job”, no matter how plain the evidence, their deceptive lawyer-like minds have an explanation for why facts are fictions, and fictions are facts. With every evidence submitted as to why the moon landings were falsified, no matter how condemning, there is always a zealous pride-filled counter-explanation to throw away the truth and institute a lie in its place, just like OJ Simpson’s defenders with misplaced zealously.</p>

<p>Just because someone has an explanation for something,</p>

<p>does not mean that the explanation is true.</p>

<p>Rather than looking for the truth, at the cost of being wrong, the majority of people, because of their blinding pride in the accomplishments of themselves and like-minded others, instead “Gather around them a great number of teachers to tell them what their itching ears want to hear”. (2nd Timothy 4:3) In other words, rather than looking for the truth, they look for people to agree with what they already believe, so as to prove themselves right.</p>

<p>The real question is, if you had cancer, would you want to know? . . . Or would you rather have your doctor lie to you and tell you that everything was just fine . . . even though it really wasn’t? Sometimes you have to cut off a diseased limb to save your life. The same is true of the “moon landings” of the Nixon administration.</p>

<p>If the “moon missions” were real, then they hold a place of prominence in the annals of human history. If they were not real, and Billions of Dollars were embezzled from the taxpayers to lie to those who funded the missions, being told that they were genuine, then this would be criminal fraud, and the taxpayers would deserve reimbursement for the offense. In fact, the faking of the moon missions, because of pride and arrogance, would be more important of a moment in historically than if they had actually gone.</p>

<p>This Great Truth is being withheld by the minority of society against the vast majority.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because they think they are better than the rest of us.</p>

<p>What about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> currently orbiting the moon that has provided high definition photography of the moon including the Apollo landing sites? </p>

<p>To say that additional “new” photographs from the criminal NASA are evidence that “prove” the moon landings were real . . . is laughable.  They already faked high resolution, full body pictures, of an “astronaut” standing right on the “moon’s surface” nearly fifty years ago, so what is it to fake additional pictures now, with almost five decades better “Photoshop” technology, of such simple things as “tiny shadows” or “scratches” on lunar satellite photographs, which are supposed to be from human foot tracks or Apollo lunar landers?  These diehard believers are just seeing what they want to see, like a naïve spouse of a cheating partner, accepting the fox’s evidence that they didn’t steal a chicken.</p>

The movies of the Landing Module taken from the Command Module over the moon look real to me and I doubt remote control of these vehicles was possible at the time, although I could be wrong.  Maybe someone volunteered to take this footage knowing they were likely to die from it?  Maybe there are parallel public and covert aspects to the Apollo program.  Is your view these movies were all special effects?  Have you ever come across someone involved with the Apollo program who admitted aspects of it were hoaxed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The unedited &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; footage I uncovered, which proves the fraud beyond any doubt, shows the crew of the first &quot;moon mission&quot; falsifying their photography of being &quot;halfway to the moon&quot;, proving that they could not leave Earth orbit, otherwise they would not have no need of falsifying it.  Seeing how all of the &quot;moon missions&quot; used identical equipment, if the first mission could not leave Earth orbit, as the newly discovered footage proves by their falsification of it, then no manned crew never left Earth orbit.</p>

<p>The images of the crew allegedly &quot;orbiting the moon&quot; with a lunar landscape in the background, were filmed using a technique called &quot;rear projection&quot;, as was used in Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.  Film shot from an UN-manned probe was projected in the background of a small model of the &quot;lunar lander&quot; as it allegedly descended to the moon.  Upon close examination of this footage, you can see the high-resolution detail of the lunar lander model, and yet the much lower-resolution, quite faded and less sharp, of the false lunar background being projected behind it, as it is now recorded third generation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth?</p>

<p>When I started my quest into the moon landing lie in about 1989, I saw MANY times how those opposed to the moon landing fraud being exposed would put those who saw the truth of this NASA deception into the very same category with those who believed the Earth was flat, basically saying that people who knew the moon landings were false were just as &quot;crazy&quot; as those who believed the Earth was flat.</p>

<p>I have personally flown all over the world, east and west, with a window seat. The world IS round. I have looked out the window several times at the northern arctic region, over both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which airlines fly over to save travel distance across the oceans because the spherical shape of the Earth makes this region narrower, therefore shorter distance. If the Earth were flat, this would cost MORE fuel, not less, which the airlines would NEVER do.</p>

<p>Think about this . . . A person arrives at a party and says, &quot;Let me tell you why the moon landings are false&quot; (an event that would destroy the government if the truth came out), yet a moment later they say, &quot;Oh yeah, and by the way, the Earth is flat.&quot;</p>

<p>What would the other people at the party think of what the person just said about the moon landings being false? (Even though the moon missions were indeed false!) They would say, &quot;I almost believed them about the moon landings . . . . until they said that the Earth was flat!&quot;</p>

<p>The use of Scriptures to &quot;prove&quot; a &quot;flat earth&quot; is not possible. Those desperately attempting to do so are ignoring the simple fact that these scriptures are using POETIC terminology, like in Songs of Solomon. Take 4:3 of SS for example, &quot;Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon . . . The temples of your brow are like pomegranates.&quot; Are her lips ACTUALLY scarlet ribbons? . . . NO . . . Are her forehead temples ACTUALLY pomegranates? . . . NO.</p>

<p>Of course Isaiah saw the sun as a moving object and wrote of it as so, for that is how he saw it FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE as a man on Earth, not yet understanding God&#39;s amazing handiwork of the intricate clockwork of a preprogrammed moving universe, setup from the beginning of time to automatically show us the appointed seasons without any additional effort by God.</p>

<p>Go online and check out flights from South Africa to New Zealand. Look at a globe of the earth and then look at a &quot;flat earth&quot; map. If the Earth were flat, this flight would take five times longer than it actually does, as they are on &quot;opposite sides&quot; of the &quot;flat earth&quot; map, rather than nearby, as they are on our globe.</p>

<p>Those who in vain attempt to uses the scriptures to &quot;prove&quot; a &quot;flat earth&quot; use ZERO scientific evidence to prove their point, only POETIC terms that are used to express gratitude and awe toward God of things of His creation that man could not yet comprehend, and so thusly expressed them poetically, such as in Songs of Solomon, rather than in literal specifics, only proven centuries later with global travel and telescopes. If this were not the case, then Solomon would have been in love with a tree.</p>

<p>If God is EVERYWHERE, then He doesn&#39;t need a &quot;flat earth&quot; to appear to everyone at the same time when Jesus returns, as he is ALREADY EVERYWHERE! Additionally, this formula which they just admitted in this argument, contradicts their own &quot;flat earth&quot; model, which says that the sun (which is supposed to be above a &quot;flat earth&quot;) somehow perfectly darkens the other half of the Earth (which is ONLY possible on a globe), as their &quot;flat earth&quot; model would ACTUALLY have the sun brighter on one part of the Earth during the &quot;day&quot;, yet STILL VISIBLE (though dimer) on the other half of the earth, if indeed the sun was above a &quot;flat earth&quot; model! (Do it yourself with a tabletop model of the &quot;flat earth&quot;, at night with the lights off, and a candle as the sun on one &quot;half&quot; of the &quot;flat earth&quot; . . . There is still light on the other half of the Earth!!!) Only a globe can go from night to day!</p>

<p>Most importantly, it was the Beast Power Catholic Church Jesuit &quot;scientists&quot; who were the VERY FIRST &quot;christians&quot; to say that the earth was flat! If you rebelled against this false teaching of theirs, as with rebelling against any of their other false teachings, they would torture or kill you, as was the case if you said the Truth of the earth being round. The &quot;flat earth&quot; was, is, and will always be, a Jesuit false doctrine.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church is the house of LIES, not Truth. They only KILL and TORTURE people who believe the TRUTH (round earth), not people who believe lies (&quot;flat earth&quot;).</p>

<p>Additionally, just as a soap bubble always forms a sphere in the air, as does an air bubble always form a sphere under water, outer space works the EXACT SAME WAY.  &quot;Empty&quot; space is actually filled with a form of matter that has yet to be defined, which is very similar to trying to explain water to a fish.  &quot;What water?&quot; the fish would ask,  &quot;I don&#39;t see any.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Empty&quot; space is like water without anything in it.  It is still a form of matter itself, just as water is and air is.  Even though outer space might appear to be empty, it is really filled with a yet identified matter, this is why Einstein referred to space as being &quot;curved&quot;.  How could something which not not exist curve?  Therefore, &quot;empty&quot; space is actually matter.  You could also call this matter &quot;Gravity&quot;, which is not a magnet, rather a curve in the &quot;water&quot; of outer space, pushing back in on the objects it surrounds, just as water does.  This means that a parachutist is not pulled down by the Earth, rather they are pushed down by the curved mass of outer space which is above them.</p>

<p>The matter of outer space pushes in equally all around the objects it surrounds, such as planets and stars, just as water pressure under the sea pushes in equally around an air bubble under the water, which subsequently forms a spherical bubble because of the uniform pressure around it.  In the same way, air pressure, which also used to be considered nonexistent, forms a uniformly spherical soap bubble in the air because of the equal pressure around it.</p>

<p>Just as water in a bathtub expands, as shown by the rising of the water level as you submerge yourself into it, because the water is expanding or pushing out to make room for you, the &quot;water&quot; of outer space expands uniformly outwards to make room for the planets and stars that are developing in it.  Space also then pushes in uniformly and equally on all sides of developing planets and stars, thus forcing them, mathematically, to become spherical, just as a soap bubble in the air, or an air bubble in the water, ALWAYS forms a sphere.  This is why ALL the stars and ALL the planets, INCLUDING Earth, are SPHERES.</p>

<p>The Earth, therefore, IS spherical.  We might as well get used to it.  If the Earth were flat and the sun rotated around it, then everyone on Earth would be experiencing daytime and nighttime AT THE SAME TIME, which is not the case.  If you have traveled the globe or have friends half way around the world whom you can see over Skype with the opposite daylight behind them out their opened window, then this is apparent.  Please do not fall prey to a useful lie and diversion of the Enemy.</p>

<p>Why is it then that ALL OF THE SUDDEN there is all of this talk about a flat Earth from the VERY SAME PEOPLE who know that the moon landings are false, even to the degree that, without being aware of it, they include the two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT subjects TOGETHER in the same videos, emails, and comments?</p>

<p>Let me tell you why . . .</p>

<p>The reason is to DISCREDIT the RAPIDLY EMERGING TRUTH that the moon landings were falsified by the very same government that, if exposed, would probably go out of business.  This is why the NSA/CIA and their &quot;web trolls&quot; are creating all this false hype that the Earth is flat, when it is not, in order to entice &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, who are right about one thing, to look foolish about another, in order to DISCREDIT the former truth from being believed by others.</p>

<p>Do you see how this works to the advantage of those who still want to keep the moon landing truth a secret?  Are we such &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; that we now believe ANYTHING?  The NSA and the CIA must be very proud.</p>

<p>They have not only successfully convinced MANY people who know that the moon landings are false into believing ANOTHER GIGANTIC LIE in order to discredit the previous truth they just discovered, they have also REPEATEDLY tied the two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT concepts TOGETHER, so that now the &quot;new generation&quot; of the public at large may once again put those who see the truth about NASA&#39;s moon landing deception into the very same category as the &quot;crazy&quot; people who ALSO believe that the Earth is flat, thus discrediting the previous truth, which they wish to conceal by making the proponents of it look foolish!</p>

<p>I know we are to have an open mind, yet let us please be careful what we let into it !  Let us protect our mind like the cherished home it is, from outside intruders who wish to do it harm.</p>

<p>The government has on NUMEROUS occasions INTENTIONALLY leaked out FALSE &quot;secrets&quot;, about UFO&#39;s or WHATEVER, in oder to use a SALIVATING MORSEL OF MISINFORMATION to lead the &quot;conspiracy sheep&quot; down the pathTHEY WANT THEM TO GO.  Remember, there is a TRUTHFUL Shepherd AND a LYING shepherd, so be VERY careful what you believe, and ESPECIALLY PASS ON TO OTHERS, without FULLY INVESTIGATING THE MATTER FIRST, otherwise you may unintentionally be doing the LYING shepherd&#39;s work for him, by passing on LIES, which DESTROY THE TRUTH, to unsuspecting friends.</p>

<p>Even if a probe was sent to prove the fraud, how do we know NASA would,&#39;t zap it, like they of an earlier Japanese probe intending to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Regarding the radiation, James Van Allen, the discoverer of the radiation belts who so humbly named them after himself, originally said that the lethal radiation belts previously spoken of in this article, through which the “moon mission” crews would have been the only astronauts in history to have ever traversed in order to leave the safety of Earth orbit and reach the moon, if indeed their missions were real, would be “10-100 times more deadly than a lethal dose”! Under pressure from NASA, he too, like Braun, dramatically recanted his original findings in order to make it appear as if the moon landings were possible. Don’t believe me again? Below is the link to his original published findings in the respected national journal “Scientific American”, in which Van Allen spoke plainly about the radiation belts beyond earth orbit being an obstacle for practical space travel to the moon and beyond, just as Kelly Smith of the Orion mission did.</p>

<p>Van Allen himself said this, in an article published in 1959 in “Scientific American” magazine after NASA sent probes with Geiger counters into the radiation belts:</p>

<p>“Our measurements show that the maximum radiation level as of 1958 is equivalent to between 10 and 100 REM per hour, depending on the still undetermined proportion of protons to electrons. Since a human being exposed for two days to even 10 REM would have only an even chance of survival, the radiation belts obviously present an obstacle to space flight.”  Click <a href="http://www.americanmoon.org">HERE</a> to see the findings.</p>

<p>Some assume that if the Soviet Union or Chinese intelligence agencies found out that the American moon landings were fraudulent they would “spill the beans” to the rest of the world.  This is simply not true, and again, thinking only one step farther than programmed to do so, reveals the truth.  If wars are created for the profiteering of the “Military Industrial Complex”, as many forward thinking people including president Eisenhower now realize, then foreign “adversaries” of America may be merely created by the CIA, for profitable ends by the billionaires pulling the strings behind the scenes, who have been making money off of war, “cold” or otherwise, just as Eisenhower warned, since the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Think about it: America has been engaged in some kind of war for two hundred fourteen years of its two hundred forty year history, more thajn 90% of the time. As such, the Soviet Union and China are, in fact, in-league with the United States government, despite mainstream media appearances.  (Just imagine a fake wrestling match.) This being the case, these overseas entities would not bring the truth of such an American scandal into the light to injure their co-conspirator brother. Any “bad blood” the United States appears to have with foreign powers is merely staged for the very purpose of keeping their complicity a secret.</p>

<p>Even if these two “super-powers” were actual enemies of America, they still would not expose the truth about the moon missions.  For example, if I had a picture of the president with a prostitute, would it be more profitable for me to give it away free to the press, or to blackmail the president, year after year, with ever increasing tolls until the day they died?  If such countries really were enemies of America and had proof of the moon landing fraud, it would serve their interests much more to keep such knowledge to themselves and blackmail the United States, year after year, administration after administration, to get the behind-the-scenes negotiations to favor them, whether it regarded trade, arms, debt, or anything else they so desired.</p>

<p>There were, in fact, no “independent” tracking stations for the Apollo missions.  The only entities that had such capability were the United State’s own government agencies (who were complicit in the cover-up) and the aforementioned countries, who profited from keeping the secret. Additionally, NASA launched the “Tetra-A” satellite shortly before the Apollo missions to simulate transmissions coming from the moon so that their ground crews could rehearse the “moon landings” during their many simulations.  Conveniently, it was purported that the Tetra-A satellite “accidentally burned up” in the earth’s atmosphere just before the first moon mission, that way the government satellite could secretly still be in service, performing the same simulation function during the “moon missions”.  Furthermore, a retired ground crew member recently acknowledged that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a “real” and a “simulated” moon mission.</p>

<p>5)  I don&#39;t see how that matters.</p>

<p>6)  I think Jarrah White does good work.</p>

<p>7)  The answer is obvious: Because they never left earth orbit and faked the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure . . .</p>

<p>Phil Plait and his, aptly labeled, bad astronomy . . . </p>

<p>You can be sincere . . . and be sincerely wrong.</p>

<p>(Plait admitted to me privately, that he receives direct funding from NASA . . . So much for his &quot;independent&quot; observations.)</p>

<p>Just like OJ Simpson’s lawyers, who later admitted they knew of his guilt and were only “doing their job”, no matter how plain the evidence, their deceptive lawyer-like minds have an explanation for why facts are fictions, and fictions are facts. With every evidence submitted as to why the moon landings were falsified, no matter how condemning, there is always a zealous pride-filled counter-explanation to throw away the truth and institute a lie in its place, just like OJ Simpson’s defenders with misplaced zealously.</p>

<p>Just because someone has an explanation for something,</p>

<p>does not mean that the explanation is true.</p>

<p>Rather than looking for the truth, at the cost of being wrong, the majority of people, because of their blinding pride in the accomplishments of themselves and like-minded others, instead “Gather around them a great number of teachers to tell them what their itching ears want to hear”. (2nd Timothy 4:3) In other words, rather than looking for the truth, they look for people to agree with what they already believe, so as to prove themselves right.</p>

<p>When it comes to perceiving the truth in a world full of lies, historically, the majority has always been deceived, and later proved wrong, by the minority of their contemporaries, whom they persecuted and considered deceived at the time, when in fact it was they who were deceived. Does a person know it when they are deceived? No, they do not. You see, you can be sincere . . . and be sincerely wrong.</p>

<p>The majority of scientists thought the world was flat. The majority of astronomers thought the earth was the center of the universe. The majority of physicians thought bleeding the sickness out of a person was a cure. The majority of Americans thought Nixon was honest. Likewise, a majority of scientists, astronomers, physicians, and Americans think the moon landings were real, yet their titles and majority do not equal truth, as history has well proven . . . and will prove again.</p>

<p>Why is it so difficult for to see the truth?</p>

<p>Very simple . . . Pride.</p>

<p>“The Pride of your heart has deceived you.”</p>

<p>-Obadiah 1:3-</p>

<p>Pride is simply the unwillingness to be wrong, just as humility is the willingness to be wrong. The great thing about being wrong, which is what I had to finally admit about the moon landings, is that I am learning something new, and I am no longer walking through life in error. The bad thing about being right all the time, is that I cannot learn anything new, and I am living my life in a self-deceived state, which is the very worst form of deception. When someone else deceives me, if I try hard enough, I can eventually figure it out, after all, I know that other people cannot be trusted all of the time. Yet when I am self-deceived, it is nearly impossible for me to overcome, because the person I am relying on for “facts” is myself . . . and of course I can trust myself! . . . even when I am wrong.</p>

<p>When someone considers themself smart, this is the first step towards their ignorance. They boast about their years of experience and degrees, and thereby pour concrete around their finite knowledge, unawaringly calling their stone mound of limited facts, the entire universe of truth. If you try to tell them they are wrong, they will defend their post to their emotional and intellectual death at all cost, all the while attempting to defile you with their venomous words for pointing out their mistake, even if you are right, just like those previously mentioned throughout history who believed in a flat world and a bleeding recovery.</p>

<p>After Columbus arrived in the “New World, within a year, numerous other European nations traveled to the new world.  After Lewis and Clark ventured to the American west, shortly thereafter, citizens everywhere traveled to the American west.  After the Wright brothers accomplished powered flight, within a year, numerous others repeated their technological accomplishment.</p>

<p>Charles Lindbergh first flew across the Atlantic in an airplane in 1927. Fifty years later, there were millions of airplanes flying across the Atlantic. Soon it will be fifty years since America allegedly had men leisurely playing golf on the moon in complete safety with 1960’s technology, all on the very first attempt. In comparison, the 747 aircraft, built after seventy years of successful aviation history and millions of manufactured aircraft, was developed at the very same time as the “Apollo” spacecraft, the first ever vehicle to take men to another planet, yet the 747 took one year longer to construct and endured over 160 failed attempts before it finally got off of the ground!</p>

<p>Why do so many people believe this lie? Because they want to. They want to believe this lie. Believing this lie means they live in a better world than they actually do. Yet the fact is, they do not. They live in a world of deplorable million-man genocide, horrific rape, vicious murder, hateful racism, and unthinkable child molestation, and yet, for some reason, they think that in a world such as this no one would do such a dishonest thing as faking a moon landing. Believe it or not, this is the number one reason I hear from smart people, who in their longing to be part of a society of pride boosting Santa Clause science, cannot see the plainness of the simple fact that technology does not go backwards.</p>

<p>If it were so easy to go to the moon on the very first attempt with 1/10th less computing power than is found today in a ten dollar Walmart watch, then there would be bases there by now, nearly fifty years later. The South Pole has temperatures that reach below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (-73 C) and hurricane force wind speeds, yet there are bases there. Why? Because it is humanly possible. If it were humanly possible to reach the moon, there too would be bases there. The fact that there are not, is proof itself that it cannot be done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I can&#39;t seem to figure out is the &quot;slow motion&quot; jumping effects to simulate low gravity.  In order to simulate low gravity by slowing the film down the moonwalking would have to be pre-recorded.  There are some technical problems with this that are explained in a new-ish video that you have probably seen that says that video technology was too primitive to continuously tape for that long, but I don&#39;t really know enough to judge the validity of that argument and it seems rather weak given that the government often developed technology that is not directly released to the public anyways.  What I want to know is how could they have pre-recorded the moonwalks if the people at ground control were actually talking to them and we know that just about everyone in the control rooms had to be fooled as well or there would be too great a risk of someone blowing the whistle.  Alternately they could have used wires, but do you think that they could have hidden them effectively given that it was a live broadcast? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming that pretty much everyone in mission control can hear the people talking to the astronauts, so if they deviate from the prerecorded script at all it would give it away.  While it is possible that they could have pulled that off it seems like a risky venture and I doubt that the conspirators would have left everything up to such a difficult deception.  In order to fool people it has to sound somewhat natural and not be too obviously scripted.  Also, there is video of mistakes being made and <em>ad hoc</em> attempts to cover them up, why on Earth would they leave &quot;Easter Eggs&quot; for skeptics to find later and use against them?  Having a prerecorded event might possibly help achieve the low G effect, but I don&#39;t see why it would be the only way (though certainly portions could have been prerecorded without too much trouble).  Besides, if you are arguing for the landing being a hoax wouldn&#39;t you naturally take the stance that gives the most evidence for it?  While being prerecorded possibly solves the special effect problem of low G, at the same time it renders void the most damning evidence of the hoax which are the numerous bloopers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of who killed Kennedy, whether it be Oswald or another, the president remains dead. Regardless of who orchestrated 911, three thousand remain dead. The uniqueness of the “moon landing” conspiracy, unlike the others, is that it is the only conspiracy that I know of which is positive. It was a lie that made everyone feel good. Trying to take that away from some is like telling them their home team cheated to win the Super Bowl. They are in no way interested in hearing such a thing, even if it is True. In the same way, I once asked a renowned college professor at a prestigious university what would he think about the issue if he heard Neil Armstrong himself confess to the deception. He replied, “I’d still think we went.”</p>

<p>When I was a child, believing in Santa clause was so much fun. When I found out it was merely a deception to make me feel good, I was devastated. Believing that we live in a magical world where men can fly to the moon on their very first attempt with 1960’s technology is fun too, even though the feat cannot be repeated nearly five decades later, by any nation on earth, including the one that allegedly did it first nearly fifty years ago, even though all truth reminds us that the South Pole, and Mount Everest, and First Flight, and the Light Bulb, was never, ever achieved on the first attempt, and certainly never abandoned once achieved, never again to be repeated.</p>

<p>An experiment you might try is trying to take pictures of a small indicator light (like on a DVD player) while standing on a reflective surface under intense flood lights. It will be hard to do without shielding the camera.</p>

<p>It&#39;s different on earth because we have the atmosphere to disperse sunlight and rarely is the landscape as reflective as would be similar to the moon.</p>

<p>Edit: Another, easier experiment would be simply trying to take pictures of stars at night, from your back yard. It&#39;s really hard to do, and especially with film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A poorly made video showing multiple shooters would, in fact, support the lone gunman theory.  </p>

<p>This is a known disinformation technique.  Its called poisoning the well I think.  </p>

<p>It works like this.  You have incident x that happened a certain way.  You want to discredit the idea that incident x happened that way. So you release easily debunked evidence that contradicts the theory you want to support.  Then later when people say incident x did happen that way - you say &quot;no, that is just a notion that was put in place by that debunked piece of fake evidence.&quot;      </p>

<p>The Killian documents are a good example of this:<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy</a>    </p>

<p>Everyone knows that Bush didn&#39;t serve honorably in the military.<br/>
Someone gives Dan Rather easily debunked &quot;evidence&quot; that Bush didn&#39;t serve honorably.<br/>
Then later they debunk this evidence.<br/>
Now, everyone has it in their mind that the idea that Bush didn&#39;t serve honorably in the military is based on faulty information.      </p>
