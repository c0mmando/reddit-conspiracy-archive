       No, the argument is not based on the Bible. Read OP again, EVERY word counts.

       I'm asking the audience to start from the same point as me: someone that believes that the Bible is not literally the word of God but "just" a book with parts that were inspired by God more strongly than any other book in History.

       Kyoon, you are intensely wrong.  In particular, it is you who have fallen prey to Satan.  There is no disagreement between science and God's word: zero.  The earth is certainly round, and that is easily measured and proven by modern amateurs such as yourself.

       Oh I see you only claimed it doesn't rotate.  That's easily proven to be wrong.  I'm glad you at least realize it's round... which is a strange comvo.  You think it's round but doesn't rotate.... kinda weird.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Facts about the skies, known ever since Day 1 vs. the Heliocentric BIG LIE
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the beginning people knew
       <strong>
        the Truth
       </strong>
       , visible to naked eyes by gazing into the skies, i.e.
       <strong>
        Geocentrism
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         moon, sun and planets orbit the earth;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         earth and moon do not rotate.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       One of the obvious signs of God for the perfect Harmony of Creation and for the special role Earth and Humans had, were total solar eclipses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the illuminati begun fooling people into believing the opposite, i.e.
       <strong>
        Heliocentrism, the
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         mockery of the Truth
        </em>
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         earth and planets orbit the sun;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         moon and earth rotate.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Short after that, God allowed people, by letting them use telescopes, discover that in fact:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the sun rotates;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the other planets rotate;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the moons of the other planets rotate.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So the only visible planet or moon that does not rotate was our moon, a sign to help people understand the illuminati deception.

        Facts about God, known ever since Day 1 vs. the Evolution BIG LIE
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then (1) the illuminati begun fooling people into believing the greatest of all the lies they ever created,
       <strong>
        Evolution,
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>

        </em>
       </strong>
       (2).
      </p>
      <p>
       Very short after that, God allowed people, by letting them discover the dinosaurs, see that other worlds had existed on Earth before.
Later God allowed people, by letting them discover more about the dinosaurs, that in fact would Earth rotate that would be the end of their world.

       <strong>
        Theory of Relativity 1919 - the celebration of the Illuminati Triumph
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1919, the illuminati declared Theory of Relativity official, using a solar eclipse in Equatorial Africa. One of the goals was to complete brainwashing people that there is no line between GOOD and EVIL.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it was also a celebration of how successfully they managed to brainwash the sheep with their mockery of the Truth and of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular to upscale to the utter limits the acceptance of the
       <strong>
        invisible formula,
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         the mockery of Science
        </em>
       </strong>
       (3).

       <strong>
        Last Generation of Evil - the Last Signs
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       As the last generation totally brainwashed by the Illuminati was born, God again helped people understand the illuminati heliocentric BIG LIE, by letting them go into space, and later by letting them place satellites on space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short before the end of the Tribulation, 2004, God helped certain people, by letting them see sunspots with naked eye (4), understand that the cosmic equation for this world changed, i.e. that Final Judgement Day was upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally God changed the orbit of the Sun (5). Just enough to let everyone have one more chance to understand how completely they were fooled by satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even at this point people refused to accept the Truth. Once again End Times Prophet had to be the first to reveal it, long after the process begun. "Coincidentally" and "ironically" just as the illuminati "revealed" the "discovery" of a second "Earth"... (6), almost as far away as the stars. Oh, wait a moment, where are the stars in all of this? (7)

       The problem with your analysis is that the rotation of the earth is easily demonstrated, e.g., Foucault Pendulums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also problematic is your claim that the Bible requires a geocentric model.  You didn't cite any scripture, for one thing.  For another thing, scripture is true and the earth does rotate, so there isn't going to be a single place where the original language specifies that the earth doesn't rotate.  That would make scripture mistaken, and that's a fallacy.

       Maybe that stuff is true for you, but not for me.  Personally, I believe each of us lives in a timeline independent from everybody else, except when we are interacting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I.e., I believe that while you and I are talking, our time-lines are congruent and the same "things" happen to both of us.  E.g., the servers go down for both of us at the same time.
      </p>

        God (creationism) or an accident (evolution theory).

       Believers are people that believe there is some evidence to prove that a religion is true. There are two types of believers:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        true (without doubts) and partial (with doubts).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Believers without doubts are those who believe there's no evidence to prove that his or her religion is impossible. From my definitions we conclude that partial believers might believe in more than one religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence proving that a particular religion is impossible leads (logically) to abandoning that religion.

       <strong>
        Time for YOU to get the 10 KEY facts about God, known ever since Day 1
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) God is the
       <strong>
        creator of all forms of life
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       2) God is the
       <strong>
        creator of the Universe
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       3) God is
       <strong>
        omnipotent
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       4) God is
       <strong>
        omnipresent
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       5) God is
       <strong>
        omniscient
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       6) God created
       <strong>
        all forms of life perfect
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       7) God created
       <strong>
        only one of those forms with Free Will
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       8) God will
       <strong>
        judge each Human
       </strong>
       for what he did with his Free Will.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) God will
       <strong>
        judge Humankind
       </strong>
       for what they did with God's Creation on Earth. That day has been known as Final Judgement Day, the last of the LAST DAYS. The last day for Mankind on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the KEY questions is the apparent contradiction between fact #5 (God is omniscient) and #7 (God gave Free Will to Humans).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a contradiction but a consequence of one more fact, that was proved from day 1 to the first of the FINAL DAYS:
      </p>
      <p>
       10) God created Humans
       <strong>
        without the capacity to have ANY glimpse into the HOW for ANY of those nine facts
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only ONE new fact ever since. Something that was predicted to happen only in the LAST DAYS.

       If there were a god they wouldn't be so easily defined by the likes of ourselves.

        What TRULY separates the illuminati religion from ALL previous satanic cults
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The separator is as simple as the seventh commandment of the illuminati religion, which "coincidentally" is also the ultimately perfect fulfillment for the third commandment, "have human cattle repeat that Black is white".
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it also separates the illuminati religion from any other cult or religion in History.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the 7th commandment was revealed worldwide first 1998 by LAST PROPHET nobody has ever explicitly stated it as THE separator:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Make the human cattle believe that there is NO [_ _ _ _ _ _ _]
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Path to solve the riddle:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There is NO [_ _ _ _ _ _ _] is "coincidentally" the real first commandment of Evolution Theory, the only religion created by the illuminati for EVERYONE.

       First, thank you for being one of the few to ask questions.

       I do not feel the need to argue with others.

      <p>
       My posts are not primarily targeted towards individuals familiar with Christianity.

      <p>
       The illuminati scripts I explain are based on their satanic religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terms like satanic are used because there is no better word to describe the illuminati and their beliefs, i.e. TOTAL evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell the audience, YOU, the simple truth to help them realize to what lengths they are fooled, mocked, and humiliated before they will be slaughtered.

       And again...
You are putting a lot of work into these threads...
      </p>
      <p>
       Every few hours a new psycho operation thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice strategy... 
Post some CRAZY bs, call the sane posters shills, or DoD.... and ramble on about nothing important, taking the focus off of real topics. 
If  you would have spaced the threads out over a couple of days, your ass wouldn't have been caught.

       <strong>
        Time for YOU to get the 10 KEY facts about God, known ever since Day 1
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       1) God is the
       <strong>
        creator of all forms of life
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       2) God is the
       <strong>
        creator of the Universe
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       3) God is
       <strong>
        omnipotent
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       4) God is
       <strong>
        omnipresent
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       5) God is
       <strong>
        omniscient
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       6) God created
       <strong>
        all forms of life perfect
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       7) God created
       <strong>
        only one of those forms with Free Will
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       8) God will
       <strong>
        judge each Human
       </strong>
       for what he did with his Free Will.
      </p>
      <p>
       9) God will
       <strong>
        judge Humankind
       </strong>
       for what they did with God's Creation on Earth. That day has been known as Final Judgement Day, the last of the LAST DAYS. The last day for Mankind on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the KEY questions is the apparent contradiction between fact #5 (God is omniscient) and #7 (God gave Free Will to Humans).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a contradiction but a consequence of one more fact, that was proved from day 1 to the first of the FINAL DAYS:
      </p>
      <p>
       10) God created Humans
       <strong>
        without the capacity to have ANY glimpse into the HOW for ANY of those nine facts
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only ONE new fact ever since. Something that was predicted to happen only in the LAST DAYS.
