<p>If you are not able to use Youtube as a research tool because you can&#39;t discern the information being said for yourself then you have much to learn.  I&#39;m curious where do you get your &quot;research&quot; from?  Do you literally only use mainstream sources for your information??    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made the original claim about &quot;Foucault&#39;s pendulum&quot; being proof for a spinning ball and then I showed you a video explaining why the experiment is flawed and does not prove a spinning ball.</p>

<p>You then said that you could only watch 3 mins out of a 5 minute video clip.  After all that you still haven&#39;t explained your original claim and how it proves anything.  The only thing that it proves is that is what a pendulum does when you design it that way and then push or pull it.   </p>

<p>Gyroscopes (particularly the ones in airplanes) prove that the Earth is not a sphere if you want to look at an observable experiment that is using a precise and accurate instrument, instead of a pendulum being swung by different people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, my high school science teacher made the claim as did yours (assuming a simpleton like yourself went that high). Your youtube video needs to be more than some other idiot asserting that the experiment doesn&#39;t work I&#39;m afraid. Please provide evidence that gyroscopes prove your claims. Preferably not a video by some other guy just making idiotic claims with no evidence thanks. On second thoughts don&#39;t bother, my boredom threshold for interacting with retards has been exceeded. Mind you, I also strongly suspect that many of you morons espousing this &quot;theory&quot; are actually shills planted to make genuine conspiracy theory look stupid, just like Elinintards and Nibirutards.

<p>Wow I keep forgetting that I&#39;m dealing with someone that doesn&#39;t think for themselves and is only parroting what their high school science teacher said as the gospel truth. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I am going to go out on a limb and say that if your all knowing science teacher would have been asked about building 7 (or the twin towers) he/she would have said that fire could have brought the buildings down and that there wasn&#39;t a conspiracy.  That&#39;s what most teachers would say because they are conditioned to not question lies of that magnitude.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, every museum that runs this experiment is in on your biggest conspiracy evah! Lol. Occams razor is a bitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are not &quot;in on the conspiracy&quot; they are only repeating what they have been told.  Just like everyone that believes the official 911 story is not necessarily in on it.  I can&#39;t believe I have to explain this to someone that has supposedly learned of the manipulation and deceit that it being thrown at us everyday.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave it at that but next time please don&#39;t make a comment/claim if your &quot;boredom threshold&quot; is so low that you can&#39;t even defend that original claim.  Just admit to yourself that you haven&#39;t actually thought about any of it, you are only trusting &quot;authority figures&quot; to tell you what truth is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying. I am saying every government is actually made to control humanity, they share information, the NSA can go anywhere they want, why would almost every country allow that? Our governments are puppets who do nothing, the ones who manipulate our reality are the real ones in control. They own everything that will hit the biggest portion of the population, then they target groups of people and feed them different information. At the end of the day you have an infinite number of groups of people who believe things that contradict each other. Once that stage is set up it is really easy to manipulate people&#39;s thoughts and actions because in reality 90% of the people are just trying to &quot;fit in&quot;</p>

<p>Now you say things like, flat earth, vaccines are bad, global warming is a lie - pollution is not. Easily 95% of the population would say the earth is not flat, 90% of the population would say vaccines are necessary, and 99% would say you&#39;re an idiot for not believing in global warming on this hot summer day.</p>

<p>0 research into any topic and they have already made up their mind. Get a government to teach you the opposite of the truth but make it fit together very good and here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1, there&#39;s more truth to the flat earth theory than globe earth. You just have to let go of all the shit youve been spoon-fed since kindergarten.</p>

<p>2, after learning about NASAs lies and the suspicious activity in Antarctica, flat earth is easier to believe. </p>

<p>3, mounting evidence by fellow citizens asking real questions.</p>

<p>4, testimony of pilots, surveyors, engineers, and other professions who don&#39;t take the curvature of the earth into account in their jobs. A good example is the vast canals built entirely flat, level with the water.</p>

<p>5, personal judgement. Despite the flat earthers being in the minority, I can conclude that the flat earth evidence is far more legitimate than the bullshit spewed from the establishment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is speculative but here is a short list of reasons at the top of my head. I also should add my sources are youtube videos mainly. I don&#39;t believe in any science to be honest so I&#39;ll just add why I think it&#39;s all utter crap.</p>

<p>Round earth is fake because</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pictures all fake</p></li>
<li><p>moon landing never happened</p></li>
<li><p>size of continents constantly changing according to NASA</p></li>
<li><p>hack job of terribly edited pictures</p></li>
<li><p>Can see past the curve of the earth according to our new born religion of &#39;science,&#39; even in the ocean.</p></li>
<li><p>The sun looks close to the earth but apparently again science has some (bullshit) reason why it seems that way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can deem me insane short hair don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>Reasons why science is bullshit</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Humanity is getting fattter, dumber and completely numb to the senses. Backing up our way of living is our unholy religion, science.</p></li>
<li><p>Our will and consciousness affects experiments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As my final point I will just add, a higher power does exist in this universe and it&#39;s possible to tap into it with your consciousness. I learned more from it than I could have imagined the months prior. Some deem it insanity, I just know I&#39;ve been saved all the luck to the rest of you animals in human bodies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, this is a perfect example of how absolutely dense humanity can be. Like I am almost finding myself dumbfounded on how to explain this to someone on your level of thinking.</p>

<p>If the sun was a hundred million miles away then yes it would have to be very very big. I am not saying it like oh man it&#39;s just the size of a penny in the sky how could it really be that big and far away? No. I am not a retard, I am saying the sun rays beam in on angles that are way too sideways to be coming from 100 million miles away. Thanks for the laugh though, sphere earther. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and I agree it&#39;s possible we live on a sphere, just that the earth is actually like 10 times the size you believe it to be. I&#39;m going with flat earth though. The distance you can see is much much farther than they claim is possible. The sun is close to us. Use your senses stop listening to science it is literally killing you. Think with your heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who the hell knows, there&#39;s something you can tap into with your mind that tells you truths about the world you can&#39;t imagine otherwise. It also gives you the power of possibility. The world is like everything tells you to go one way at least 99%, then one day you get a tad of doubt and it turns out everything is inverted.</p>

<p>I realized it, which means I have a consciousness that can basically enter numerous realities, the old and the new.</p>

<p>My ways of thinking are science, which I don&#39;t listen to or trust at all.</p>

<p>And then the good way I use of thinking is love and happiness as the vibe I don&#39;t even think I just vibe.</p>

<p>Your mind is filled with holes, it can&#39;t perceive the universe. Your soul can perceive the universe and for that reason I use my mind as a tool for my soul instead of my soul as a tool for my mind. End the slavery. </p>

<p>Edit: For any wondering you basically gotta go insane to get it, insanity today will be normal in 100 years and sanity today will be insanity. Control your thoughts and emotions and you will always control your reality. </p>

<p>Also for anyone going through it right now, just know it gets better but just keep researching never stop. Illusions everywhere.</p>
