       I've noticed that when making searches, particularly on YouTube and Google, the suggested searches are sometimes eerily similar to what I had just been talking about. Things that I don't think I've ever searched for on my phone/other device.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best example was when my brothers and I saw an artist perform a cover of "Rocket Man" at a concert. On the car ride home, we were disputing the lyrics to the song. We finally decided to google the lyrics and after I typed "roc" the suggested search said "Rocket man lyrics".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think this was a coincidence. I don't think most people who start a search with "roc" are looking for the lyrics to Rocket Man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty much convinced that my phone is listening to my conversations and using the data to "personalize" my phone experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else have any similar experiences? Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure how to protect myself from it.

       No, but of the people who were at the concert with you, a lot of them would have googled the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyones locations are being tracked, thats no secret. Your search suggestion was based on your location and what others there were searching.

       this is the real answer. Your phone knew you were at a concert, knew others at the concert, saw they too were searching for rocketman lyrics, figured "hey, this guy was at the same concert with all these other people who are looking for rocketman lyrics, he's probably gonna be looking for the same thing" but in binary.

       Yes. And it's even happened to the extent that I've mentioned (and not searched recently) something at dinner table and then boom. Pandora ad that relates... It's fucked. Creepy.

       As someone that works in online ads I feel like it's only a matter of time until I turn over a stone that shows me, yes, it has in fact been happening.

       I made some lemonade once and got for an ad for it later that day. My GF bought some new converse(at a store) and was talking to me about them and I got converse ads. I don't shop for either of these items online and yet Google thinks I need these ads.

       It's definitely happening, I've tested it. I have a smartphone that I literally only associated with an account for this specific purpose and I tested it by only speaking about very obscure and idiosyncratic products in the presence of the phone. It's happening.

       Are you using Android? Make sure you disable OK Google, probably a lot of other things to disable, but that's a biggie.

that we are being confirmed.

       this is why discussions in open forums are important. yet again they are able to pay a lot of smooth shills too.

       My dad worked at Chevron gas station, every night he clocked off he had to type in this security code for his work for big bills. He went to text his coworker the security code for the safe and it was one of the first suggested words that popped up, it had a bunch of random letters and number. He was using Google Keyboard, never once typed the security code into his phone. He barely uses his phone other than call or text people. I find that quite odd.

       Yep. I was discussing how one now needs to get a boat licence in Norway to drive even small boats. I open fb in chrome and the first ad was boat licencing courses. Now the interesting part is that my phone was switched on, but not logged in. It had restarted itself and I just had it in my pocket with the password log in page open. I hadnt even put the password in when these conversations were being held.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit. may I add that I am not into boats. it was a random conversation. I have never typed anything into my google search engine about anything connected to boats.

       Yes, I have. I can't remember the exact ad, but I know it showed up on my FB feed minutes after he and I mentioned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It went something like this:
Me; I wonder where you could buy (whatever the item was)
Him: I don't know. Not sure where to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       We probably said a couple more sentences about it. I wanna say it was some kind of craft supply.
I opened up my phone, clicked chrome because I don't have the FB app, and the ad for the thing was right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really freaked me out. So much that I showed my husband my screen and I said to him "I didn't Google that. It's like my phone heard me."
      </p>
      <p>
       It has happened a few times since then, but never so creepily. Other times could be explained with other Google searches or posts on social media.  That one time though, it was eerie.

       I first noticed this on my kindle a few years ago. Our toilet was having issues and I had a brief discussion about it with my husband. The next time I picked up my kindle the home screen ad was for a toilet. It gave me the chills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've since been very aware of it and see ads that relate to what I was just talking about constantly.

       I was at a bar that had a devil painted on the wall. I took a selfie with it on "social media A" saying "hail satan". At another bar, a friend asked where I saw myself in 10 years, and I answered "machine learning projects".
      </p>
      <p>
       I log into "social media B", and I am met with two ads. One is for a Satanic group, and the other is for machine-learning. This is bullshit.

       Yes!  This happened to me twice yesterday.  I was driving and mentioned a type of animal several times to my wife and kids.  A few hours later when I brought up Google there was a search for that animal.  I just thought my wife had done it.
