        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that when making searches, particularly on YouTube and Google, the suggested searches are sometimes eerily similar to what I had just been talking about. Things that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever searched for on my phone/other device. </p>

<p>My best example was when my brothers and I saw an artist perform a cover of &quot;Rocket Man&quot; at a concert. On the car ride home, we were disputing the lyrics to the song. We finally decided to google the lyrics and after I typed &quot;roc&quot; the suggested search said &quot;Rocket man lyrics&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this was a coincidence. I don&#39;t think most people who start a search with &quot;roc&quot; are looking for the lyrics to Rocket Man. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty much convinced that my phone is listening to my conversations and using the data to &quot;personalize&quot; my phone experience. </p>

<p>Does anyone else have any similar experiences? Unfortunately, I&#39;m not entirely sure how to protect myself from it. </p>

<p>No, but of the people who were at the concert with you, a lot of them would have googled the same thing.</p>

<p>Everyones locations are being tracked, thats no secret. Your search suggestion was based on your location and what others there were searching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the real answer. Your phone knew you were at a concert, knew others at the concert, saw they too were searching for rocketman lyrics, figured &quot;hey, this guy was at the same concert with all these other people who are looking for rocketman lyrics, he&#39;s probably gonna be looking for the same thing&quot; but in binary.</p>

<p>This is still <em>fucking scary</em> when you think about it.</p>

He went to text his coworker the security code for the safe and it was one of the first suggested words that popped up, it had a bunch of random letters and number. He was using Google Keyboard, never once typed the security code into his phone. He barely uses his phone other than call or text people. I find that quite odd. </p>

I hadnt even put the password in when these conversations were being held. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have. I can&#39;t remember the exact ad, but I know it showed up on my FB feed minutes after he and I mentioned it.</p>

<p>It went something like this:
Me; I wonder where you could buy (whatever the item was)
Him: I don&#39;t know. Not sure where to look.</p>

<p>We probably said a couple more sentences about it. I wanna say it was some kind of craft supply.
I opened up my phone, clicked chrome because I don&#39;t have the FB app, and the ad for the thing was right there.</p>

<p>It really freaked me out. So much that I showed my husband my screen and I said to him &quot;I didn&#39;t Google that. It&#39;s like my phone heard me.&quot;</p>

<p>It has happened a few times since then, but never so creepily. Other times could be explained with other Google searches or posts on social media.  That one time though, it was eerie.</p>
