<p>He had fake grenades but had them so people watching the news can so &quot;thank god they were fake&quot;: confirmed hoax</p>

<p>Either way it&#39;s a hoax. I honestly think them revealing the weapons as fake was off script. For a while the news story was that the grenades were real. Any new information they add to these hoaxes a while after they happened is to cover up.</p>

<p>So, I think people died. The truck was going faster than 20 mph. Typically there are no videos of these things (sandy hook, San Bernardino) but with this one there are several vids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it&#39;s a small chance but still a chance. I live in Frisco Texas. The two Americans that died used to live 20 minutes from us in a town called Prosper. They moved to Austin.</p>

<p>My wife&#39;s clients know them. Again, unless the family is in on it, they died. Also, not saying the guy wasn&#39;t a patsy or 1/2 false flag.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of the truck running people over. If this was fake, they sure as hell go a lot further to making us think it&#39;s real than the American fakers do. </p>

<p>p.s. I think Sandy Hook was a false flag 100% with no dead kids so please don&#39;t call me a Shill. You can look at my history and realize that&#39;s dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The still images debunking the video are of extremely low quality and grainy. I&#39;m not sure how anyone can tell what is going on. The fact that you are so sure from such flimsy evidence tells me you&#39;re only willing to believe one conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you retarded? The still images have extremely low quality and look grainy because the original video was recorded in 144-240p. They did this on purpose. Even if it was in HD, the same problems would persist. I feel like a god damn robot repeating myself. This is the last time I&#39;m going to repeat myself about this video, you guys need to grow a fucking brain and stop being retarded:</p>

<ol>
<li>The people disappear into the truck. This can be concluded because:</li>
<li>You don&#39;t hear any noise when the truck hits them</li>
<li>The people don&#39;t fly forward, or go anywhere, but they disappear instead, obviously</li>
<li>You don&#39;t hear any of the people who got hit yelling</li>
<li>The camera oscillated away from the truck, as soon as it came, coincidentally</li>
</ol>

<p>This footage has the same qualities they used to fake real life events or movies back in the 1930s, a time when people did a lot of hoaxes. Back then people believed everything, but now we have so much technology we can see through anything. All the things the camera does imply that it&#39;s fake. There are MANY things wrong with this video. </p>

<p>So since you are so smart, why don&#39;t you explain why the people are moving or debunk any of my points? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure the stunt truck driver from The Fast and the Furious is the only person in the world who could&#39;ve pulled off this attack. Just think of how he steered his truck effortlessly down the road at top speed while those souped-up Honda Acuras were zipping in between his tires and another guy was grappling onto his windshield like Batman. Really has all the hallmarks of this latest ISIS attack if you think about it.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that a random truck driver had his body taken over by that Agent in The Matrix Reloaded who pulled a u-turn in an 18-wheeler to chase Trinity on her motorcycle through oncoming traffic. It would make sense that he could do something like this, since he has the experience and he also has superhuman powers. It would also explain why nobody could stop him since we know he can dodge bullets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering why nobody called that number on the back of the truck and complained that they didn&#39;t like this guy&#39;s driving. Really could&#39;ve spared everyone a lot of misery. Also since this guy was straight out of a fucking cartoon I&#39;d like to hear a good explanation for why he didn&#39;t just tie cables to the top of his truck and escape with a helicopter like the movie Swordfish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the same stupid video that people keep posting saying it&#39;s real when in reality, it&#39;s no different from the rest of the videos. It&#39;s low quality, you don&#39;t see anyone get hit, and the fucking camera man points the camera on the ground so you can&#39;t see anyone get hit. The people in that video are all disappearing in thin air: <a href="http://imgur.com/P4bqO4d">http://imgur.com/P4bqO4d</a></p>

<p>That dumbfuck had his feet disappear from what can be made out of that footage with simple video editor analysis. Apparently it really DID disappear because you would hear the sound of his bones cracking and there would be blood splatter everywhere if that truck hit him. It wouldn&#39;t sound like the grill/front of the truck hit him since the tire clearly hit him. Also, the truck has no engine? It sounds like they just swapped a fucking sample of a subway train into a pedestrian setting. I don&#39;t hear any engine on the fucking truck. This video has been debunked hundreds of times already, you&#39;re late.</p>
