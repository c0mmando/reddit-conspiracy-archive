        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, sorry if there are grammatical mistakes i&#39;m not a native english speaker and i&#39;ll try to make my point as understable as possible : </p>

<p>There was a comment here on this sub not too long ago which basically said : &quot;the best way to manipulate thoughts is to restrain the discussions within a small spectrum of ideas and endlessly discuss about them&quot;. This really struck me up because it&#39;s literally what is happening here daily, we keep circlejerking about : &quot;is this a false flag ? Is this guy a shill or controlled opposition ? Oh wow ! 29 pages of heavily censored infos about 9/11 ?? &quot;</p>

<p>How does any of these questions matters to the big picture ? Does knowing the truth about this will change the outcome in any way ? No, it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I keep hearing about &quot;truth seekers&quot; but the truth is we don&#39;t seek anything, these infos are delivered to us everyday just like CNN deliver infos everyday to the masses. And like idiots we&#39;re satisfied when a little piece of information reach us, we stroke our ego : &quot; Ah ! I knew it, i told you guys !!&quot;. Does the fact that you knew it or that you now know it change anything ?</p>

<p>I&#39;m deeply conviced we&#39;re getting manipulated into this whole circlejerk of &quot;truth seeking&quot;, simply in order to <strong>keep us thinking and prevent us from taking action</strong>. I mean, sure it&#39;s essential to gather informations but meanwhile people are dying, people are starved around the world, laws are slowly voted to take away the little freedom we have left, while we&#39;re here focused on meaningless details which again, don&#39;t matter to the big schemes of things.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m writting this but i don&#39;t know what to do myself, i feel powerless, i feel like we already lost. What kind of action can I take that won&#39;t lead me to jail or the grave ? There are none. The only choice I have is to stay neutral as much as possible... </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even take any action yet and still I could be taken to jail if this post is interpreted as a push for insurrection. That alone just say how much democracy is dead, it never existed. You&#39;re free to shut up and obey.</p>

<p>What do you guys think about this ? What can we do ? I tried to bring people back to reason, I tried way too hard for way too long, they are aware something is wrong but they are too scared to leave their safe space and do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to look into the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/79524680/The-Paranoid-Style-in-American-Politics-Richard-Hofstadter">The Paranoid Style in American Politics by Richard Hofstadter</a>. In a series of essays Hofstadter describes how some elements of the right adopted a conspiratorial tone to manipulate populist sentiment, causing members of the general public to assume a more reactionary outlook. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The distinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents see conspiracies or plots here and theren history, but that they regard a &#39;vast&#39; or &#39;gigantic&#39; conspiracy as <em>the motive force</em> in historical events.&quot; Hofstadter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hofstadter doesn&#39;t dismiss the idea of political conspiracies at all:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;One may object that there <em>are</em> conspiratorial acts in history, and there is nothing paranoid about taking note of them.&quot;</strong> Hofstadter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather, in his essays he is identifying a particular style of political rhetoric in the popular discourse. Perhaps the argument you&#39;re making is how this rhetorical style sways the public away from challenging the status quo or discussing meaningful ways to change things constructively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly, this is what is happening in present-day Rojava, where democratic confederalism, which is based on the ideas of anarchist Murray Bookchin, are being put into practice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rojava, in northern Syria, a Kurdish region straddling the southern Turkish border, is now a remarkable experiment of Bookchin inspired autonomous democratic confederalism. In the area&#39;s major urban areas-Aleppo, Kobane and Qamishli-popular assemblies and secular grassroots councils call the shots.....Put into practice, Kurdish self-government today has three central planks: the establishment of communes, the assurance of equal participation in all areas of decision-making for all faith and ethnic groups, and the strengthening of the position of women. Communes sort out everyday administration, provide electricity provision and infrastructure, advise on nutrition and liaise around ecological concerns. There are communal cooperatives, too, like bakeries and sewing workshops, like agricultural projects. Delegates from village and neighborhood communes form the basis of bigger city councils, and city councils are made up of representatives from all communes. There aren&#39;t any law courts either, but &#39;peace and consensus committees,&#39; which try to resolve legal issues in novel, consensus-finding ways.&quot; Out of Shadows by Andy Merrifield </p>

<p>People around the world are trying to create alternatives to the status quo that favor ordinary people. Maybe it&#39;s because we don&#39;t hear much about such alternatives?

    <div class="md"><p>When I first heard about the Orlando nightclub shooting, I said this is a smokescreen. Eyewitnesses said there were multiple people, but the news said he was a lone gunman. San Bernardino eyewitnesses said there were 3 men, in military gear, moving as a unit, but the news reported a husband and wife doing the shooting. They went to the couple&#39;s apartment and let&#39;s the newscrews go through their &quot;staged&quot; apartment. Sandy Hook, where were all the wounded? You mean to tell me that there were NO wounded? Every shot was a kill? Not a chance. This is all brought to you by the same government that couldn&#39;t find enough evidence to charge Hillary Clinton with any wrongdoing when she lied to congress. Sorry about ranting, I just get irritated when the 1% thinks we&#39;re all fucking morons. Not all of us like the Karwhorians (I like that my autocorrect comes up with that first 😂), consume the MSM as gospel, and think that the whole world admires the U.S.. </p>

<p>I personally would immediately volunteer to become part of a small group of early settlers. Would probably have to bring some skills with you though. It&#39;s only a conceptual project atm (probably cost a fuckton of money, while lacking any obvious ROI so there doesn&#39;t seem to be much interest in funding it sadly).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen how stupidly irresposible sheeple were behaving in Nice? Fucking whole flocks taking pictures with their cellphones and stampeding at the same time! 1 guy on a bike who tried to do something ... 1 damn guy and a bunch of underarmed coppers running behind the truck like it was a slapstick scene from a Zorro movie. That&#39;s what reality looks like: a whole lot of doing nothing then everything happening in a split-second, chaos, being paralyzed by fear, extreme selfishness and horrifying stupidity. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing on earth that scares me more than group dynamics, for it&#39;s always - ALWAYS - the vast hordes of barely cognizant system slaves with a sub-standard IQ forcing everyone else over a cliff like lemmings. Too fucking stupid to be alive, but just aggressive enough in all their selfishness to be purely unstoppable. </p>

<p>Get away from it all. There&#39;s no safety to be found in groups, much to the contrary ... All the more possibilities for doing what you&#39;d never do or would even want to consider doing. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a smart guy, the heart in the right place and a set of balls to match. People will resent you for that, so beware of that and don&#39;t get carried away, because they will betray you in the end, despite all of your very best intentions.

    <div class="md"><p>OP: &quot;I&#39;m deeply conviced we&#39;re getting manipulated into this whole circlejerk of &quot;truth seeking&quot;, <strong>simply in order to keep us thinking and prevent us from taking action.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>You have to wonder why there&#39;s so many YouTube hoax videos available for general consumption. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re created by &quot;them&quot;, (whoever &quot;they&quot; are), but surely many of the hoax YT videos can be taken down for national security reasons, copyright infringement, etc..?</p>

<p>There must be millions of people that now believe things like Sandy Hook was a hoax, probably many of them discovering or being directed to by search, on/to YouTube.</p>

<p>People that watch MSM are called sheep, maybe people that watch hoax media are &quot;hoax sheep&quot;? As you say, they&#39;ll never take action, the videos leave the viewer feeling smart and above it all/craving the next event to feel smug.</p>

<p>Perhaps those are all designed as a double-edge to seem real enough for the sheep, but conspiratorial enough for the hoax sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not being taken down because it&#39;s a form of entertainment. It doesn&#39;t have to be true or false, just that the idea itself of some grand conspiracy is enthralling enough to keep people busy wasting their time on the internet. They know out of the millions that subscribe to these ideas, that a miniscule number of them will do anything about it, and of that miniscule number of people, 0 of them will have the power or influence to actually completely disrupt and change the course of history. Entire supposed anti-establishment movements like Occupy Wallstreet were fucked from the start - either by the idiots participating in it themselves or subversive agents purposely spreading half-baked truths and ideas to uninformed people that had their hearts in the right place. Real change doesn&#39;t happen with words anyway, it takes power, and power comes by people willing to deal violence, and only people willing to deal violence. </p>

<p>So to answer your post, I would say that yes, people that watch &quot;hoax media&quot; are just as much sheep as the &quot;sheeple&quot; that they whine about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What conspiracy does for me is help me not to fear and to substitute fear with love. <em>They</em> don&#39;t want that. They want me to be afraid and attached and dependent. Every single terrorists attack or massacre is laughable to me because of conspiracy. But they don&#39;t want me to laugh. No, they want me to cry, then fear, then feel angry, then feel hate and then divorce myself from my own humanity as I entrench myself in some ideological group that is against another ideological group so we can keep fighting indefinitely. I believe their greatest tactic is divide and conquer. So I will do the opposite. I will unite. I will love. I will see your humanity and I will show you mine. </p>

<p>So conspiracy helps me to laugh, helps me to love, and helps me to unite. That&#39;s my action. You say we only think and take no action but my actions are clear. I live it everyday. When I see a Muslim, I feel no fear or hatred. I just see a human. They don&#39;t want that. When I see a man, I see a human. When I see a woman, I see a human. When I see a poor person, I see a human. When I see a black person, I see a human. When I see a white person, I see a human. This is against their agenda. This makes them piss themselves in anger because I reject identity politics and I laugh at them as I conquer them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you have to act like an activist lawyer.  Agreed with you OP that simply seeking the truth and treating it like each fact is in a vacuum causes it to fizzle away into nothing.  That&#39;s why I believe you have to make &#39;collections&#39; to provide as &#39;mountains of evidence used all-at-once&#39; to make the case.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m big on compilations, specifically I did a comprehensive 16pgs of links (16 pages of just links) on mass surveillance news.  And a dossier on pedophilia on the government. </p>

<p>Because when it&#39;s time to nail these bastards we need to have ammunition.  I want to print out all the stories and plunk down a big folder or box of folders and say, &#39;this is what we have against them.  It&#39;s all mainstream sources, fully cited, from privileged insiders in their organization, expert witnesses, expert authorities, witnesses and whistleblowers willing to testify&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get anywhere with violence any more.  You don&#39;t get anywhere with protest anymore.  They aren&#39;t listening.</p>

<p>The only things you can do is use the law.  Because if I&#39;ve learned anything, it&#39;s that litigation is how assholes communicate with each other in the united states now.   And if that doesn&#39;t work, you find someone to hack them and steal everything they have, destroying their life, their relationships and their work or even plant evidence against them; or you hire ninjas to start assassinating people, especially if the judges are corrupt also.  Basically you &#39;become the CIA&#39; to fight them, using all their dirty tricks.  Disclaimer, that&#39;s just a strategy discussion of what someone else should do in the event that suiing doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s not a recommendation, endorsement or suggestion to commit a crime.</p>

<p>Believe me people, not just the dialogues themselves but the very subjects we think about are being controlled by some of the smartest and most diabolical minds ever born.</p>

<p>Why do you think the ACLU constantly combats bullshit issues like school prayers and Christmas displays on courthouse lawns while over 90% of people accused of crimes are denied not just their guaranteed right to a jury trial, but even the simple decency of being able to appeal?  The reason is, our public discourse is being steered like a ship of fools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP you are probably right.</p>

<p>I recently heard about a field called &quot;learned helplessness&quot;. Type that on Google, and see what the first link (wikipedia) says about it.</p>

<p>From the wikipedia article :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at how many people in North America, Europe, probably other countries, experience depression. And it is growing big everyday. The wikipedia article suggests that depression and other mental related illnesses would be the result of a set of tactics of learned helplessness applied to the population. I don&#39;t exactly know about these tactics, but I would imagine they come in various forms, such as the type of news the MSM will spread (endless news about how unemployment is rising, news about attacks, about murderers who could be your neighbor etc...), additives in food (fluoride in water maybe, i don&#39;t know), etc...</p>

<p>After reading about this topic, I believe it is very real. It&#39;s in states&#39; interest to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since, as someone said, &quot;It&#39;s about the individual, not about the collective&quot;, perhaps then our own individual attitudes matter more than is usually considered.  I mean, for example a person could stay angry, resentful and bitter all day from something early one morning and have quite a crappy day over it, holding on to it, never letting it go--- or that person could get over it and intend to enjoy what remains of the rest of the day. Or analyse it, study it, learn from it, make amends, or forget it altogether as ever happening in the first place. Personal attitude matters. The &quot;approach shot&quot;, so to speak, needs to be setup good, or else we are just swinging wildly and randomly, hoping for the best and hoping for luck. </p>

<p>A small company I worked for in the past had a quote taped in various places in the little building that said &quot;Attitude can make or break a company, church, family, ...&quot; etc (or something close to that, a longer message that I don&#39;t remember in its entirety) ---  the individual&#39;s approach and attitude about an issue would seem to be quite relevant. I have read so many responses in this forum that end up saying things like:</p>

<p>&quot;We are powerless to change anything&quot;, or &quot;That&#39;s the way it is&quot;, or &quot;It&#39;s too late to change things&quot;, &quot;The game is rigged&quot; and on and on. Paraphrasing of course, but the idea it that the &quot;conditioning&quot; has been going on for too long and is so ingrained into us folks, that all we can feel now is powerlessness or fear. Nonsense! We are not at the mercy of our feelings and emotions, no matter if they are directed by us or directed by some outside nefarious agency. 
We have conscious minds for a reason. Some use them better than others, certainly. Some are specialists, experts in a field. Some approach genuis, some not so much. Some people, perhaps too many people, just &quot;go with the flow&quot;, but when that &quot;flow&quot; is considered to be directed by others who do not have the best interests in mind for the &quot;collective&quot;, that &quot;flow&quot; should be refused. It can be, when you know yourself and your moods and thoughts  and such. Someone said that someone said that this fellow said, &quot;Know thyself&quot;. Seems good advice, regardless. </p>

<p>If you think that you are at the mercy of the whims and decisions of others or any outside action no matter what, or if you think that you are lost and cast adrift through the highly-questionable motives of others, then you are &quot;playing the game&quot; by someone else&#39;s rules, and not your own. Whoever someone else or &quot;they&quot; may be. </p>

<p>I once wandered into the issues about the movie &quot;Patch Adams&quot; for example. How accurate was it, what&#39;s there for me to know, etc. (I had to question it since it came on television! )---With all that real fake money made from it, very little was given to help the clowning doctor in his cause. Actually, the ending message of the movie made it seem like he was well on his way in getting that clinic built to help folks. You can check into it yourself if you want of course, but the point is,  the clowning doctor&#39;s ideas about creating social change aren&#39;t too bad. Specifically:   </p>

<p>&quot;Start with your community--- work where you can make a direct difference&quot;. Or something like that. It may be too hard to change the entire world, or to even try, so start where you can. If that&#39;s your thing, that is. Change or start to change &quot;your&quot; world, not &quot;the&quot; world. Whether &quot;your&quot; world is a cubicle or garages, museums or the factory, with family or on the road, in school or in church. You know where the lack is, you see the holes, you know you can do some small thing that can make the world better, better in your point of view. So start small. Look for the snowball effect from that small act. Hope for it. Expect it. Demand it. Or do it over again and again until it starts. It&#39;s better than feeling powerless or helpless, overwhelmed by the world situation. It is an attitude. Again, if that&#39;s your thing, to &quot;change the world&quot; or to fix it.</p>

<p>It is true that some folks have really horrible and unspeakable things happen to them. Some suffer and suffer forever because of some wretched and  destructive thing that happens. But some few are able to somehow move forward and live through it and with it. Some however have absolutely nothing of a dire nature happen to them at all. Some live lives of desperation and despair. Some are joyful and are not lost in any rabbit-hole of noticeable size. Ignorance is bliss, knowledge a burden. This may or may not be true, but it doesn&#39;t justify being angry or resentful or hating those who have great lives or who are just clueless to the world situation, or demand and force them to awake and learn the world-situation and how bad it really is. They too have a right to live their lives how they can or how they choose (if that&#39;s even possible, to choose.) But some do just want to get through life the best they can, clueless perhaps, unknowingly asleep, or perhaps willfully ignorant. That is still their right. ----Freedom, folks, remember? </p>

<p>We can certainly list how far freedom has disappeared from daily life or is slowly fading away, but still some remains. It should be granted to everyone though, or to no one at all. And the worse thing to think is, even those sorry and pitiful power-brokers who spend human lives like so many tokens in a game of &quot;Who&#39;s in Control?&quot;, they would also have the freedom to do whatever they want also. (Hating this wretched and disgusting thought.) Only, if freedom is to exist, then it goes for everyone. Having allowed for whatever reasons the immoral and corruptible folks to &quot;have the reins&quot; of this mass-vehicle is something the entire world, from the far past up until the present time, has done. It was an agreement--- to be lulled to sleep and lied to, to be deceived and harmed, to be turned into passive voyeurs of false programs, and to have poor leaders and to give to them the power and control over our lives. Everyone agreed in some way, accepting what others declare without examining the truth of it, intimately and externally, taking the whole hook-line-and-sinker of it like mindless fish and then forgetting ourselves, or not using plain common sense and personal authority to make a decision on our very own--- because we don&#39;t trust ourselves, right?  Otherwise it couldn&#39;t have occurred. </p>

<p>Argue existentialism or fatalism, religion or science, the &quot;who- what- why- and how did we get here&quot; of it all, etc. Argue random evolution or planned creation, determinism or whatever ---- it makes us into either meaningless evolved sea-monkeys, or creatures blessed by a divine Creator. In any case however, can we trust ourselves? Can we trust our actions or the actions of others? Attitude, remember? </p>

<p>I read someone state on here, &quot;Try pissing in the corn in a supermarket&quot; or some such, as if a person doesn&#39;t have the freedom to do that. Sure you can--- go for it. The consequences might stink though, but still, you can do that if that&#39;s your thing. Don&#39;t know why you would want to ruin some perfectly good GMO-corn though---someone would eat those ears! </p>

<p>To learn of how bad it actually is around the world, absolutely yes, it hurts awful and is painful to hear any of it, it can cause nightmares and screams or worse---but maybe it should! That&#39;s the point. You can&#39;t heal if you don&#39;t know you are hurt. Unfortunately &quot;we&quot; as a people aren&#39;t hurting enough yet for the big changes to happen. I would venture that the amount or rate of &quot;awakening&quot; is proportional to the amount of &quot;pain&quot; and hurt that is being known about or felt in the world that we need to end or cure or help. But that&#39;s just an idea after all.  </p>

<p>Speechifying time is over--- off to the market for some corn! On second thought...</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/And_The-Teddy_Bach.html">And_The-Teddy_Bach</a> 2016-07-16</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I was in the exact same position as you. I felt helpless and powerless, because I turned away from establishment media and was consuming only conspiracy stuff. I switched from one extreme to the other. However, the reality lies exactly in between.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say robots. A lot of people on the establishment side think more or less about assisting robots, while people on the conspiracy side think that all robotic companies are there to create the next T1000. Not true, the reality is in between. There are companies that work as governmental contractors to create killer robots, while there a lot of other robotic companies that really care about people who need help.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>GMO&#39;s are another huge topic. A lot of people think it will benefit the human race, while another part believes that it&#39;s there to kill us slowly and put us under control. The reality is again a grey area. While there are companies that do a shitty job in order to get their profits up, there are other that really care about solving world hunger. Getting rid of GMO&#39;s might be a fatal mistake in the creation of a sustainable future. We can play god now and shape our own future. The question is, how do you ensure that the technology is not abused.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>You live in the digital age, you have access to a lot of information and different points of view, don&#39;t view a topic only from one perspective, do your own research and look at the benefits and negative applications. Take real live examples to see if technologies or methods are abused or used to benefit humanity.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Now to answer your questions in the end. You won&#39;t change minds by doing what conspiracy theorist are doing now. The reason why those people are ridiculous by others has nothing to do with the way they think, but in the way they present their ideas. There is no thought-leadership in the conspiracy circles. Your charismatic politician makes you give your freedom away, while a conspiracy theorist is perceived as Woody Harrelson in 2012.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in fighting fire with fire, but in this case yes. Over the past thousands of years humanity was programmed by the church, by monarchs, by media outlets and now even by corporations. It works, it worked for thousands of years and it will work forever, and as long we have emotions, we will be manipulated in any way possible. Running around in a tin-foil head and speaking the truth is not as effective as looking presentable and selling an image. A shouter like Alex Jones or a &quot;psychopath&quot; like David Icke are not really good business cards for the truth. You want to change something. Find a charismatic person, make him tell stories because this what human beings react to and build a following. Use PR and marketing techniques to spread your message. There is no other way around it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The analogy is spot on but I don&#39;t get what you disagree with ? Even if it&#39;s not rigged and there&#39;s no vote manipulation. How does enforcing a law voted at 51% is fair for the 49% other ? The problem is easy to see but except changing for another system, the solutions are non existant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but that&#39;s the natural outcome of any system where people have freedom.  </p>

<p>We have to compromise with each other in any society.  The issues we largely agree on will get laws/bills passed easily.  The issues we don&#39;t agree on will stick around and the ones with the greatest divide will get the most attention.  It&#39;s perfectly natural for issues like that to go one way or the other by only 1%.  </p>

<p>There is no such thing as absolute freedom for every individual, at least not in the objective reality. We all depend on each other and on a larger scale mother nature.  We just have to compromise and we don&#39;t always get what we want.  The alternatives are far worse.</p>
