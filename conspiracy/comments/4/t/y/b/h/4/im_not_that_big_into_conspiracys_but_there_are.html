       For example how was the Guccifer 2.0 leak not covered at all by the mainstream media?? Even Fox News didn't cover it! Other stories not covered include deaths related to the Clinton Campaign, Clinton being generally a garbage human as a lawyer in that rape case back in the 90's (80's?) . Anything that could in anyway hurt Hillary and the Clinton's is just not reported on. Why is this? Is the family so powerful that they can squash negative stories???? help.

       Thats not a conspiracy. They are extremely powerful. Everything you listed really happened. They just cant be touched. They have power and more so.. Dirt on many many powerful people. They are backed by not just rich americans but other powerful nations that are allies. Bill blatantly met Lynch on a tarmac. Then charges were dropped. Shes guilty as fuck but literally untouchable. Im surprised Assange released her emails. I bet he has a "heart attack" very soon.

       Ultimately, their greatest power is the power the "we" give them. This isn't something to be taken lightly. One of the best things you can do is to "unplug" from the giant psyop-media-propaganda machine. Start thinking. Stop buying. Make sure that your thoughts are your thoughts, that your desires are your desires.

       If more people did this, there'd still be criminals, but we would not be empowering them as much as we currently do.

       All I gotta say is be careful. The truth sets you free but it takes a long time to reach it, and I'd say you need some help from external forces to get to the end. Everything before that is just stuff that will literally drive you insane. The truth is so logical it kills that people can't see it. Based on Dad in your username I'd assume you're fairly old. Give the power to the children because the truth burns especially if you've lived through all the lies perpetuated in the past couple decades, or century. The public considers the truth to be insane, stupid and not logical. The ones who have found it know the public is insane stupid and not logical.

       The neoliberal system protects itself. They dominate the narrative and do not usually show tolerance or give much air time to opposing viewpoints.

       Consider this, what do you think when you hear the term "Orwellian"? Usually thinks like big government, surveillance state, official obfuscation, newspeak, etc. Basically the sort of things Orwell railed against. What you seldom hear about are the things Orwell was for:

       Your mistake is believing the media's job is to present relevant information, instead of providing meaningless distraction while delivering both government &amp; commercial propaganda.  Have you seen the documentary

       It's how it starts! I was looking into whitewater and everything followed from there, finding ourselves at this point its incredible the pair have never been indicted for any of it. You could write a list long as your arm about dodgy dealings, they can't all be true but then they can't all be false which leaves you with some kind of hard truth. One quote about the Clintons that always stayed in my mind was along the lines of 'When was the last time you saw the word naive associated with their actions' - They might commit criminal acts but they know exactly what they're doing and how to leave enough distance to be safe.

       Don't vote, we live in a dictatorship. Maybe one day so few people will vote it'll be the wake up call. Politics are bullshit because they say you can't have the best of both worlds.

       I think he believes is what he is saying and is attempting to change the culture in this country. I think America is an oligarchy run by corporations and Sanders see's and believes that. He wouldn't have done much to change it but at least hopefully more people would have been aware. I am also firmly anti-capitalist.

       Maybe it's more about the millions and millions of people at the grassroots level who propelled Sanders' message forward that is more significant. They've made the S-world acceptable and developed an effective crowd funding mechanism. That's quite an accomplishment. But where they go from there?

       You might find this an interesting read:
       <a href="https://indypendent.org/2016/05/19/they-lit-bern-what-comes-next">
        They Lit the Bern, What Comes Next?
       </a>
       It's about #feelthebern co-founders Winnie Wong and Charles Lenchner who made resourceful use of social media to propel the Sanders campaign forward. Wong shares some of her outlook:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WONG: I am not a Democrat. I’m not a Bernie or bust person. Bernie Sanders has brought the S-word, small or large, to dinner tables across America every night now for a year. No one has ever done that before. Still, he is a tactic. He’s a means to an end. I think he’s aware that he is a tactic.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wong is identified as an anarchist who used a grass roots approach to get out a message that resonated with millions in the U.S.. I would say both Wong and Lenchner were successful in that. We'll just have to wait and see where it goes from there.
