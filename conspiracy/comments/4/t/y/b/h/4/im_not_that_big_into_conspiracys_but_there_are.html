        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For example how was the Guccifer 2.0 leak not covered at all by the mainstream media?? Even Fox News didn&#39;t cover it! Other stories not covered include deaths related to the Clinton Campaign, Clinton being generally a garbage human as a lawyer in that rape case back in the 90&#39;s (80&#39;s?) . Anything that could in anyway hurt Hillary and the Clinton&#39;s is just not reported on. Why is this? Is the family so powerful that they can squash negative stories???? help.</p>

<p>Ninja edit: Am a Sanders supporter, and I feel if people had known some of these facts maybe we wouldn&#39;t be facing the worst two choices for president ever.</p>

Everything before that is just stuff that will literally drive you insane. The truth is so logical it kills that people can&#39;t see it. Based on Dad in your username I&#39;d assume you&#39;re fairly old. Give the power to the children because the truth burns especially if you&#39;ve lived through all the lies perpetuated in the past couple decades, or century.

It&#39;s about #feelthebern co-founders Winnie Wong and Charles Lenchner who made resourceful use of social media to propel the Sanders campaign forward. Wong shares some of her outlook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WONG: I am not a Democrat. I’m not a Bernie or bust person. Bernie Sanders has brought the S-word, small or large, to dinner tables across America every night now for a year. No one has ever done that before. Still, he is a tactic. He’s a means to an end. I think he’s aware that he is a tactic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wong is identified as an anarchist who used a grass roots approach to get out a message that resonated with millions in the U.S.. I would say both Wong and Lenchner were successful in that. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see where it goes from there. </p>
