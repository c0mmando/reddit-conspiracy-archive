       I find it interesting that most of these shooters are either active in the military or ex-military.

       Shady manchurian stuff going on or not, this seems to be a consistent pattern that needs to be explored.

       Once you have killed one person, surely the threshold of killing another is much lower, coupled with that someone from the military is going to be much more likely to be able to kill someone due to their training.

       Same with Myron May- the FSU shooter. He left hours of youtube videos detailing his experiences, asking for forgiveness for what he was about to do, and pleading his death wouldn't be in vain. Terrible.

       I have a letter from Jared Loughner, I wrote him a couple years ago. He wrote me back. He does claim this, but he seems legitimately crazy to me from the way he writes. So I'm not too sure I believe him.

       May not have been the voices. There's a good book on this, available free online, by a Dr. Robert Duncan who claims to be an ex-CIA scientist (I take everything with a grain of salt). The book's called "The Matrix Deciphered" and in it he speaks of a "Silent but instantaneous application of “electronic caffeine” signal, forces awake and keeps awake"

       Occam's razor is often misused. It's meant as a guideline not a rule. And if the theory doesn't quite fit the observations, it doesn't mean to ignore the anomalous details to make the simpler theory fit.

       Then there's the CNN Special Report on Radio Frequency Weapons. It's from 1985 and it's rather alarming. They hire an engineer who builds an "RF mind interference device" from Soviet schematics. They successfully transmit basic images into the mind of a CNN reporter. The stunned engineer said that, given 3 weeks' time, he could build a weapon that could take care of an entire town, causing people to see and hear things, do things against their so-called better judgement, etc. The Pentagon said it was, "too sensitive a subject to comment on."

        They successfully transmit basic images into the mind of a CNN reporter. The stunned engineer said that, given 3 weeks' time, he could build a weapon that could take care of an entire town, causing people to see and hear things, do things against their so-called better judgement, etc. The Pentagon said it was, "too sensitive a subject to comment on."

       I've rarely seen so much humbug condensed in one sensationalist, pseudo-scientific bullshit report not even using double blind tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Willam van Bise" doesn't get results on any reliable academic sources, and the other scientists involved don't allege anything other than being able to generate double vision or vision jitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't translate to "mind control".
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Robert O. Becker, for example, looks like the typical once promising scientist turned crackpot.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, nowhere, whatsoever is this claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We know subliminal or audible commands can be broadcast wirelessly to human brains.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...supported by scientific evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you understand how this works, it would be laughable and ridiculous to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, please explain how you would target specific individual neurons with RF? How would you locate and target in 3D coordinates an electromagnetic wave from a long distance? How would that wave interact in such a way that it could transmit information to a neuron or neurons in such a way that it would convert something as infinitely complex as thought or image, given the
       <em>
        enormous
       </em>
       complexity of the

       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       As the reporter admits, this nonsense was "ridiculed by established science" and rightly so.

       Microwave auditory effect - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of audible clicks
        <strong>
         (or, with speech modulation, spoken words)
        </strong>
        induced by pulsed/modulated microwave frequencies. The clicks are
        <strong>
         generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device
        </strong>
        . The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. During the Cold War era, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish[1] information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect.

       Audible solely in the head of the person affected, as opposed to subliminal. This is how the army described the weapon:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals. NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio subliminal messages. One application of V2K is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports.

       It would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body, raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction. When a high power microwave pulse in the gigahertz range strikes the human body, a very small temperature perturbation occurs. This is associated with a sudden expansion of the slightly heated tissue. This expansion is fast enough to produce an acoustic wave. If a pusle stream is used, it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5-15 kilohertz range, which is audible. Thus, it may be possible to "talk" to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them.

       Yes, 2.4 Ghz waves heat water. What is the power requirement? How would you target moving individuals within a crowd? How would you prevent catastrophic side-effects? How does that translate in obedience? How would you keep the target functioning as efficiently as the killer did without completely disrupting the senses (let alone any individuals within range)? Apply this to an isotopic radiator?

       The one thing that makes this sub tolerable and worthwhile to read, in my opinion. Not just the letter, but the spirit. The title of this post seems fine. The underlying sensationalist, far-fetched, unscientific nonsense, does not, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this rule didn't exist, I'm quite certain this would all devolve into a delusional sensationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation? Sure. But if one of the premises of the speculation in question is frivolous, that ends up wasting everybody's time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll speculate that this may be a method of confusion and distraction, and I have some 12 years experience under my belt witnessing these things firsthand. Not directly, but the source of the meme, that I question. It will spread eagerly without any additional help in many cases; without some duly-needed opposition, that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way to engage in anything worthwhile and interesting if 80% of available time is spent doing epistemological housekeeping.

       Hypnosis is scientifically proven... surprising so many people deny subliminal ads. (I peeked in a 1960-something book and used the internet to know about hypnosis; a recent book called "they got it wrong: science" talked about how a few tests didn't work, with one method of subliminal advertising.)

      <p>
       And for all I think the gangstalking claim almost always comes from paranoid schitzophrenia, when you go around spouting your paranoia, you draw attention to yourself.  and we know a lot of the mass shooters and anti-government rabblerousers claim to be experiencing this "delusion".

       Bullshit. I know people with schizophrenia and similar diseases. They're a diverse group of symptoms which could hide experimenting but none-the-less schizophrenia is very real. It corresponds to glial cell chances, a smaller brain mass, and increased space in the ventricles.

       I posted within the last couple days about a Marine who had recently returned from some tours overseas, understandably upset at what he had witnessed. He was forcibly taken to a psych ward and held there solely bc of what he had posted on Facebook. They've got a name for the "mental illness" conspiracy theorists have already- "Oppositional Defiant Disorder."

       Odd is used to lable sociopathic and socially deviant kids when they're too young to dx with anti social personality disorder. It's a very controversial "disorder." Clearly it was misdiagnosed on this gentleman.

       Interesting, especially with the recent push to get everyone to use a chip-activated credit/debit card (I have no clue whether those computer chips are the same/similar to RFID chips).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, one question I have is that if they currently have the means to activate any and all Americans within minutes... Then why don't they? It just seems like they would be using this on a wider scale than a few shootings a year.

        In an experiment described in a document entitled "SI and H experimentation [16] (25 September 1951)", two female subjects took part in an exercise involving the planting of a bomb. Both subjects performed perfectly and were fully amnesic for the exercise: "[Deleted] was instructed that upon awakening, she would proceed to [deleted] room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call. Upon receiving the call, a person known as "Jim" would engage her in normal conversation. During the course of the conversation, this individual would mention a code word. When she heard this code word, she would pass into a SI trance state, but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation. P. 37
       </p>
       <p>
        She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation, she would then carry out instructions: [Deleted] was shown an electric timing device. She was informed that this device was a bomb, and then instructed how to set the device. After [deleted] learned how to set and attach the device, she was told to take the timing device which was in a briefcase, and proceed to the ladies room [where] she would be met by a girl whom she had never seen who would identify herself by the code word "New York." [Deleted] was then to show this individual how to attach and set the timing device and further instructions would be given that the timing device was to be carried in the briefcase to [deleted] room, placed in the nearest empty electric-light plug and concealed in the bottom, left-hand drawer of [a] desk, with the device set for 82 seconds and turned on."

       I did, yes. Impressive. Saw another one where he had a video game rigged up to have the screen flash at a certain rate to induce trance. Then he carted a kid off who was playing it and put him in a reproduction of the game in a nearby warehouse and put a gun in his hand. Kid reacted by continuing to "shoot zombies."

       Mine as well, but the more I dug into NLP, the more Erikson came up. Did you see when he took his friend to the dog races and cashed in losing tickets? Or when he bought thousands of dollars of jewelry in NYC using blank pieces of paper the size of dollar bills? When he goes to pay the cashier, he's telling a story about taking the subway in New York, "I was a little hesitant to take it at first, but my
       <em>
        friend
       </em>
       told me-
       <em>
        Take it, Take it, It's fine

       Wow interesting stuff ... So I knew this guy who I met in a halfway house that use to claim this exact same shit . The halfway house was for drugs not mental illness so the guy got moved after a week an everyone talking about his claims... He told us in group that he had been being followed 24 hours a day by men in suits who were stalking him. The thing was he didn't seem crazy and he had this letter he carried everywhere that had been addressed to him before he went to rehab telling him he was a targeted individual .... I kinda brushed this off at the time but the guy seemed so genuine it's making me wonder if this poor fucker was telling the truth. I'm all spooked out now thinking about some of his comments. He had told us the people in suits wanted him to snap.

       Telling the truth is not generally acceptable.   People tell you to shut up when you question the lies.   The whole country is living a lot of lies,  telling a lot of lies,  insisting on a lot of lies,  and the US military is preparing to do a lot more bad stuff,  virtual mercenaries for corrupt and criminal leaders.    So,  how do you stop the next kook with a gun?    Probably would help if we put the war criminals on trial and elected someone who wasn't shat out of the DNC or RNC mafias.

       Some of Dr. Delgado's "accomplishments" with mind control, obtained through FOIA, are discussed here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brain electrode experiments were also conducted in humans. Dr. Jose Delgado, [51][52][53][54][55][56][57] a neurosurgeon and professor at Yale, received funding for brain electrode research on children and adults. He was able to control the movements of his animal and human subjects by pushing buttons on a remote transmitter box. In one paper, Dr. Delgado describes the cats as "mechanical toys." P. 87-89
       </p>
       <p>
        An 11-year old boy underwent a partial change of identity upon remote stimulation of his brain electrode: [58] "Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced feminine striving and confusion about his own sexual identity. The patient, an 11-year-old boy, said, 'I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl, which I'd like to be,' and 'I'd like to be a girl.' After one of the stimulations the patient suddenly began to discuss his desire to get married to the male interviewer. P. 89

       <p>
        We take up Delgado's research on electromagnetic fields and their effect on people. "I could later do with electro-magnetic radiation what I did with the stimoceiver. It's much better because there's no need for surgery," he explains.

       Look at what Delgado did and showed publicly back in the fifties. Then take into account the fact that the most advanced mind control tech has to be kept secret due to "national security" issues. Extrapolate the exponential trend from the fifties up to the current day.

       WTF does "electromagnetic mind control" mean? Is it something like programming someone to do something by using WIFI? Well if someone has that technological power to use it against us, then there is no point in worrying nor fighting, cause they are some orders of magnitude ahead of us, and we can do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they might be able to create obedient soldiers to do what they ask for (like killing people). But by the classical means of torturing, psychedelics, electrodes and some traumatic brain fucking for a period of time. It is nothing new, MKULTRA is a fact, and I don't think military forces or intelligence services have stopped researching in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
       But "electromagnetic mind control" is like saying "Cause MAGIC!". And it is also the theory I would spread if I were trying to avoid people and media talking about the possibility of mind altered people that carry out the killings.

       Exactly. But the problem with real (government) conspiracies has always been the pollution of the field of research by crackpots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big reason here for people believing this nonsense is scientific illiteracy. The notion of electromagnetic waves wirelessly controlling something as complex as the brain is utterly ridiculous. Disruption of brain function? Perhaps. Control? Absolutely not.

        Why Microwave Auditory Effect Crowd-Control Gun Won't Work
- Experts say you'd fry before you heard anything
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       22 July 2008— New Scientist magazine recently reported that Sierra Nevada Corp., based in Sparks, Nevada, plans to build what it calls a nonlethal microwave ray gun with the ability to beam irritating sounds into people’s heads.
       <strong>
        But experts in the underlying biophysics say it cannot work: the device would kill you well before you were bothered by the noise.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The gun, which is being built by Lev Sadovnik at Sierra Nevada, would take advantage of a phenomenon known as the microwave auditory effect. When microwaves are delivered in short pulses, the cochlear tissue in the ear expands. That expansion is heard as an audible click to anyone receiving the radiation, a sound much like that of two rocks being hit together underwater. The company says that the device, called MEDUSA (for ”mob excess deterrent using silent audio”), could be used for crowd control.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        However, experts say the gun wouldn’t work as advertised. There is no way the ray gun could deliver sound loud enough to be annoying at nonfatal power levels, says Kenneth Foster, a bioengineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania who first published research on the microwave auditory effect in 1974.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ”Any kind of exposure you could give to someone that wouldn’t burn them to a crisp would produce a sound too weak to have any effect,” Foster says.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Bill Guy, a former professor at the University of Washington who has also published on the microwave auditory effect, agrees. ”There couldn’t possibly be a hazard from the sound, because the heat would get you first,” Guy says.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Guy says that experiments have demonstrated that radiation at 40 microjoules per pulse per square centimeter produces sound at zero decibels, which is just barely in hearing range. To produce sound at 60 decibels, or the sound of normal conversation, requires 40 watts per square centimeter of radiation. ”That would kill you pretty fast,” Guy says. Producing an unpleasant sound, at about 120 decibels, would take 40 million W/cm2 of energy. One milliwatt per square centimeter is considered to be the safety threshold.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ”There’s a misunderstanding by the public and even some scientists about this auditory effect,” says Guy.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically, the gun could be used by the military, says James Lin, professor of bioengineering at the University of Illinois. ”With any weapon, the intent is to do damage,” he says.
       <strong>
        In this case, Lin says, the gun would be more likely to cause tissue damage, brain damage, or nerve cell damage than an auditory annoyance.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadovnik’s project received a grant from the U.S. Navy Small Business Innovation Research several years ago. The Navy awards grants in phases, and the MEDUSA failed to receive a grant beyond the first phase. Now Sadovnik is working on the project at Sierra Nevada. He declined to comment for this article.

       my biggest gripe about this sub is that you're expected to just go along with every theory posted here or you're called a shill or something
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in a certain level of conspiracy, but sometimes I feel like people here take it too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most extreme level of this are the flat earthers. There is a spectrum people, don't go too far to one side.

       Yes, but that is electric activation of certain general brain function like aggressiveness, having a connected implant. It is not a remote directed EM wave for remotely programming an individual to do a very specific and premeditated act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I bet there is some people researching EM brain function modification on animals. Or even human brain modification for mind control purposes. But that would be having the subject in their room, were the equipment is. That doesn't mean they are able to do it remotely from hundreds of meters or miles, via a directed EM wave who has to target the subject's brain with great accuracy, and getting to program the subject to fulfill an specific killing, in an specific location, at an specific time.

       You know what's a seemingly paradoxical parallel?
      </p>
      <p>
       People who buy into the illusions from those in power take any small bit of evidence to reaffirm their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people who believe everything is a conspiracy are guilty of doing the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       You stopped being blinded by one system to only blindly follow another. There are people here who believe everything in this sub without questioning it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lack of skepticism got the public into this mess to begin with. And it causes the same problems again when you believe every conspiracy you see, think every attack is a false flag, etc.

       Yeah. The accuracy for any pattern recognition method (and that is what intelligence is about) is measured by the number of false negatives and false positives; both affecting negatively in the same way. Being a false negative when people is unable to accept some true explanation, and a false positive when people believes some bullshit to be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like some people in the conspiracy world think that believing everything to be true is an effective method of detecting the truth. But for accurately detecting the truth, you also need to detect bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most effective way to discredit legit theories, is to make people believe false ones, undermining the credibility of the whole "conspiracy theorists".

       Yup, and you only get downvoted or ignored by the majority for saying this.
      </p>
      <p>
       People believe in so many things here that this sub effectively only sometimes focuses on important conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every good lead we get it'll be drowned out by 100 more trying to say the latest attack
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to be a false flag, without concrete evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wild speculation has lowered the level of intelligent discourse here, and what hurts is when people are so blinded by their distrust of the system that they
       <em>
        can't even see
       </em>
       that it's wild speculation.
People like that will get us nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like we should start a new sub that encourages only well-thought out posts that have solid evidence, so we try to change things intelligently.
