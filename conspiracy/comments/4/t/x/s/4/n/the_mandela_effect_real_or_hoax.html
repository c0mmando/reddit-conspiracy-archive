    <div class="md"><p>I have spent about a year studying it.</p>

<p>While some of the effects are failure in memory, I do not think all are.</p>

<p>Because of this, I believe there is something more to it. Science has not ruled out parallel universes at all. In fact, that is becoming a more acceptef theory.</p>

<p>A lot of people who &quot;jump&quot; timelines often have near death experiences of some sort. <a href="/r/dimensionaljumping">/r/dimensionaljumping</a> is an interesting place to go if you want to learn more about jumping timelines.</p>

<p>It could also be a psyop of some sort, but I am not totally convinced on that part.</p>

<p>Just know there are shills and trolls all over the mandela effect message boards all over...not just reddit. Ask yourself, why? If it is such a stupid theory, why waste their time?</p>

<p>I am going to continue to explore it. There was recently a &quot;happy&quot; video released by Cern that had references to the mandela effect if anybody is interested.</p>

<p>I have also written a lot about the effect and why I do not simply think it just false memories.</p>

<p>Notice when anybody posts about the topic, the false memory comment comes up right away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I look into it I am in agreement, most of it is just false memories but there may be something to some of them. The problem though is that it would be very difficult if not impossible to completely prove. </p>

<p>As for the Cern reference didn&#39;t that video originate in 2014? If so the little research I have done to try to find the origin of the effect and I did find <a href="http://mandelaeffect.com/about/">this</a> web site which allegedly originated in 2010. If that is all true that would have given some joker at Cern 4 years to come up with the idea to put a reference in a video to make people think they had something to do with it.</p>

<p>An alternate idea to the whole multi dimensional one would be looking at existence as if it were a simulation or a computer program. If I were coding our reality as software I would have a variable for each item that an individual could have as a memory. If a person does something to access that memory then instead of having a separate variable for every individual that ever exists just have a pointer to the one variable for each memory item. A side effect of doing it that way would be that if something changed that variable then it would change for everyone that had it. Like the computer that runs the existence program someone accidentally hit to upgrade it to windows 10 and it screwed up some of the variables. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually think that were living in a simulation its just another fun idea to think about, much like the one with multiple reality&#39;s that are mixing together. I watched sliders I thought it was a cool concept.    </p>

<p>If it is a real effect that is taking place then over time more things will probably come out. I am going to stay pretty skeptical about it until I wake up one day and suddenly the golden gate bridge is and always has been gold instead of red or something else like that happens. </p>

<p>Do you also think major things have been changed, more important than the tv related stuff? Mandela and Gorbachev&#39;s deaths are important, as is New Zealand/South America, but to me I think the pop culture stuff is thrust forward in our faces to deter and confuse us, to make us doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the problem with finding evidence is that evidence is this timeline would not exist. However, a lot of people find &quot;residue&quot; from the past that they post, and is honeslty a little creepy.</p>

<p>I think the pop culture stuff stands out the most because it is something we can all relate to, even those of us that are not into it. There are diehard fans who freak out when they see the &quot;shifts&quot;.</p>

<p>I think the best evidence for now is anecodotal, and I know people have issues with that. However, I have seen some good posts (despite the shills) on <a href="/r/mandelaeffect">/r/mandelaeffect</a>. One was about a guy whose street name changed! That one was pretty creepy because we all remember the name of the street we grew up on.</p>

<p>I would say keep exploring it and come to your own conclusions. As for me, there are just some I cannot shake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory creates causal paradoxes, as all time travel theories do.  It violates principles of causality that have been essential (though not always relevant) to the natural sciences for three or four centuries. This is sufficient reason to reject it, for most conventional thinkers. </p>

<p>But not so fast. Notions of retrocausality-- in which effect may be said to precede cause-- are inherent to certain theories that do have scientific legitimacy. </p>

<p>In addition, some researchers in fringe science fields claim to have demonstrated retrocausality. </p>

<p>So it <em>seems</em> strictly impossible, and a few years ago, I would have said so. These days, I&#39;m not so sure of anything, really. So I have to say maybe it&#39;s possible, and maybe it&#39;s true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve hit on it with retrocausality.  Actually, it&#39;s retrocommunication -- the supposedly &quot;paradoxical&quot; anti-telephone.</p>

<p>I read Wikipedia&#39;s entry on anti-telephone, and have to wonder if the presented paradox is deliberate disinfo, or if it&#39;s just another case of confusing mathematically between strictly-less-than with less-than-or-equal-to.  Whatever, the presented paradox there is a fallacy of reasoning, not an actual paradox.</p>

<p>The ability to change things in the past is the most challenging aspect of the theory.  On the one hand, I am pretty sure I&#39;ve seen this done.  Specifically, the book What Do You Say After You Say Hello? was changed to provide less information about &quot;script transmission.&quot;  Script transmission is a method used for mythology, government mind control, etc.  This was done in August 2010 by the Chinese Government to prevent a specific individual from breaking free from the programming.</p>

<p>Prior to August 2010, the epilog of WDYSAYSH went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, now that you know about Games, and Script Transmission, and Autonomy, what <em>do</em> you say after you say &quot;Hello?&quot;
Well, the answer is that an autonomous person says whatever they feel like at the time.
For example:</p>

<p>Man 1: I travelled to Africa once.
Man 2: Oh, how was that?
Man 1: I saw a man eating Lion.
Man 2: Oh, how horrible!
Man 1: He had ordered it medium rare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no copy of the book I have found since that date which has that epilog, including the copy I owned in which I read that epilog.</p>

<p>The most interesting content oriented change was in the early pages, and I could find where it was, but the changed part used to say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children as they grow up are often rewarded for playing with numbers.  Therefore, the Script Transmission can communicate with the Inner Child by using numbers.  There will be examples to follow for the reader who understands.
[...]
At first, the therapist appears to be a wizard of sorts.  ....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last line is Script Transmission to an inner child.  Parsed with homophones and in the original text there was a line break between &quot;the therapist&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, the rapist appears.
Two, be a wizard of swords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, that portion of the book is entirely rewritten and does not explain how to craft nursery rhymes and other hypnotic verses.  The entire book used to be a how-to of hypnotic media programming techniques, but it got changed to be &quot;harmless&quot; to the powers-that-be or the public.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t understand how this was possible.  I don&#39;t understand how a change could be made to my past, I would live in a world where the book never said that, but yet I remember what the book used to say.</p>

<p>I feel like I understand a lot of things, but I do not understand how this phenomenon works, except that I&#39;ve seen why it happens and who does it in one case, and that it seems to involve retrocommunication and an actual agent on the receiving end, thus retrocausality.  Yet it leaves memory traces...</p>

<p>Exactly what I was about to ask.</p>

<p>It just occurred to me that a few scientists here and there are challenging the assumption that memories are stored in the brain, or in any structure at all that we would currently recognize as material.</p>

<p>Maybe objects of ordinary (&quot;baryonic?&quot;) matter are affected, and/or only in the spacetime accessible to our bodily senses. Whatever and wherever memories are, they&#39;re beyond the reach of this time tampering.</p>

<p>(That&#39;s assuming that the phenomenon is real, which I realize would be enormously difficult if not impossible to empirically prove, almost by definition.)</p>

<p>Well, cause always precedes effect in time.</p>

<p>Suppose you notice that the sidewalk is wet at 9 AM. You wonder what caused that. The next day you find out that it had rained around 8 AM. You find the report of an 8 AM rainstorm sufficient to explain the 9 AM wet sidewalk.</p>

<p>Now suppose instead that the weather report said the rainstorm hadn&#39;t happened until 10 AM. Ordinarily, a rainstorm at 10 can&#39;t cause a wet sidewalk at 9. Roughly speaking, that&#39;s causality.</p>

<p>Retro (backwards) causality is when an event at one point in time can cause an effect that occurs in the past. It seems strictly nonsensical, right? Because it creates situations where (for example) some statement must be true AND not true at the same time. It creates loops that cancel themselves.</p>

<p>For example, suppose terrorists blow up your girlfriend&#39;s house, killing her. No problem. You go buy a Time Phone. They&#39;re incredibly expensive, so you have to rob a bank. Now you&#39;re a wanted criminal! As the police are closing in on you, you call your girlfriend up in the past and warn her to get out of the house. She does, and she&#39;s saved! But now, the event that caused you to rob the bank and get the phone never happened. There&#39;s no need to rob that bank and probably go to jail, because your girlfriend is already saved. So you don&#39;t do all that, and you don&#39;t save her. But you must have!</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>For a long time, scientists considered it impossible to send information back in time because it can lead to that sort of nonsense. But now there are legit scientific theories that have backward causation in them. You can also find investigators in the paranormal or psi fields who claim to have demonstrated that the past can be changed by will or intention alone.</p>

<p>So I dunno! Seems impossible, but maybe it&#39;s not?</p>

<p>Does that make more sense?</p>

I remember it:  &quot;Loooook&quot;  I write it that way to emphasize both the pronunciation of Luke, and the poetic homonymity that I remember of Luke/Look.

<p>To elaborate: I was 8 when I saw Empire in 1980 in the original film release.</p>

<p>I would not trust the &quot;unremastered&quot; VHS to really be not remastered.  I would assume this is not Mandela effect, but just Lucas changing shit without telling people.  He has shown a history of removing his Joseph Campbell influences, and reducing the mind control in his works.  I would imagine he could have wanted to change this line.</p>

<p>I believe the Mandela effect is very real, I am just not convinced this change in Lucas material is an instance of it.  I am confident the line said &quot;Luke&quot; in 1980.</p>

<p>I believe the Mandela effect is very real, I am just not convinced this change in Lucas material is an instance of it.  I am confident the line said &quot;Luke&quot; in 1980.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t understand how this was possible. I don&#39;t understand how a change could be made to my past, I would live in a world where the book never said that, but yet I remember what the book used to say.</p>

<p>I feel like I understand a lot of things, but I do not understand how this phenomenon works, except that I&#39;ve seen why it happens and who does it in one case, and that it seems to involve retrocommunication and an actual agent on the receiving end, thus retrocausality. Yet it leaves memory traces...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly what I was about to ask.</p>

<p>It just occurred to me that a few scientists here and there are challenging the assumption that memories are stored in the brain, or in any structure at all that we would currently recognize as material.</p>

<p>Maybe objects of ordinary (&quot;baryonic?&quot;) matter are affected, and/or only in the spacetime accessible to our bodily senses. Whatever and wherever memories are, they&#39;re beyond the reach of this time tampering.</p>

<p>(That&#39;s assuming that the phenomenon is real, which I realize would be enormously difficult if not impossible to empirically prove, almost by definition.)</p>
