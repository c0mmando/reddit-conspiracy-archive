       Look at the shuttles and rockets that supposedly went to the moon. Look at the material they are made up of. It looks like foil and something you make in your basement. Please tell me how this thing with less computing power of your cell phone go to the moon.

       USSR staying silent doesn't automatically make  it true. If Russia called Americas bluff, America would do the same with Russia. This applies to all governments who stay mum just to avoid problems for them in the future. Propaganda is rampant on all sides of the border.

       No, that doesn't automatically make it true. It being true is what makes it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, given the political climate of the day, you'll need to do better than the vague "but... propaganda" as a good reason for the USSR to stay silent.

       I will answer ONE of your inane questions without you answering mine. If you want more answers, you get to give a plausible answer to the USSR question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short answer is "quickly" with the short answer to the follow-up being "about 32 mrem, or 0.016 rads".

       What are you one of these official debunkers? Linking popular mechanics? Mind's well just copy + paste the the entire shill manual while you're at it and mention some Snopes and History channel. While you're at it maybe National Geographic can get in on this too, if we're going in that direction. We didn't go to the moon.

       I gave you three sources and that's only because I saw no reason to keep going after reading the science in the 3rd. You have the "for dummies" version in the popsci, you have the "working the math out for yourself" in the nasa, and you have the "holy shit that's a lot of science" in the third.

       What would you see as an acceptable source? Do you believe that every single scientific publication, and by extension literally millions of scientists and engineers over the past 60 years from all over the world, all decided to separately try and keep so many secrets for something they had nothing to do with? For what purpose exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think millennials (for example) go to university to study astrophysics, astrobiology, rocketry, aeronautics etc get told at some point during there degree that, hey guys please don't look  into this too much because it's a conspiracy and therefore nobody can know! All these millennial redditors have decided to keep this secret as well, for what exactly? What would all of those people
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       have to gain?

       I don't know but I can think of an analogy. 9/11 was an inside job and a fraud. I don't imagine that based on this fraud Metallurgists, Architects, and engineers changed their theories on the melting point of steel and fire-code. I don't think they dramatically altered the textbooks even though by definition, such an event should be actually groundbreaking in these areas. A steel highrise structure has never before collapsed from a fire in all of history. This event should merit a complete overhaul in the design in building structure. But it doesn't, and it won't, because it is conveniently ignored that a steel building collapsed from fires. So; when you ask if physics students are told not to look into the details because they might notice a conspiracy, I think the answer is that most people who did realized there is a conspiracy, and the rest are clueless or were suspicious but then read some shitty Popular Mechanics article that had enough pro-government spin to bring them to heel.

       So it wasn't the first steel high-rise to fall from fire alone? Show me another, please. I'll save you the time though; the only 3 steel highrises to have fallen in all of human history from fires all happened on 9/11. Go look it up.

       I did. A lot. I used to believe in all of that in my teens. Then I realised the sources I trusted were so much worse than mainstream sources, because not only do they also have an agenda, but they have zero credentials or specified knowledge to back up their outrageous claims.

       Nah they are pulling bullshit, there are no "holes".
      </p>
      <p>
       Space missions typically try to go over the van allen belts as radiation can damage electronics, the van allen belts aren't sphere but have gaps around the poles. so by changing the inclination of the orbit it's possible to pass over the top of the van allen belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The apollo missions avoided the inner belts but had to pass though the outerbelts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dose received by the apollo astronauts on a full return trip was less than the standards set for workers per annum in the USA.

       You didn't answer the question, because quite clearly, the Soviets were not able to track Apollo 11. They would have known the whole NASA story was a charade, but they had no hard evidence to prove it was fake, only the absence of evidence that it was genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you well know, the Soviets had the technology to send unmanned craft to orbit the moon, and to land on the moon (and take rock samples) and come back to Earth, but they knew sending humans to the moon and bringing them back alive was not possible because of the extreme levels of radiation within the Van Allen Belts, and on the lunar surface itself. So did the Americans, and that's why they faked it.

       How mature. You can save yourself the effort because we both know the answer - the Russians didn't send men to the moon for the same reason the Americans didn't. They simply didn't have the technology to send a craft with a sufficiently robust design to protect human occupants - the fuel/weight ratio was too great to get into orbit. And they still don't have the technology.

       Now if you grew up in America, went to public school in America, I understand and empathize with your lack of knowledge. I did the same. You know what they didn't teach us? Well, a lot of things. One of them was that there even WAS a Soviet moon program, let alone what it accomplished and when and why it stopped.

       The Soviets still went ahead with their Lunokhod missions to the moon, collected rock samples, left laser retro-reflectors and came back to Earth. But they didn't send a man because the Americans already did that? This is the logic of a 5 year old.

       If you read the link there was a tad bit more to it, failure with the rickets being the biggest problem. They did continue the research and testing into the 70s.

       But what I don't get is how you guys can accept both NASA and the USSR having sucessfully landed un-manned missions on the moon, yet one radiation belt stops them from landing humans there. Radiation doesn't kill you quickly in most cases. There was a Japanese man that was in Nagasaki and Hiroshima when the bombs were dropped, that died in the 2000s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, the Van Allen Belt is bad for you, now imagine you can shield against X% percentage, would you take the risk on flying through it to be one of the first people to land on the moon? If I got ok odds on surviving back and forth, I would.

       And you didn't awnser my question... do you accept submarines existing?

       Ok, sorry, X amount of radiation belts (not sure on the number since I'm too lasy to look it up for some stupid argument about the faking of man landing on the moon (which happens to be accepted by the overwhelming majority of humans)), which can still be shielded against to some amount.

       Well, lets say that they do exist. Ok? Now, there are many types of subs, most using diesel engines for power, but some that use nuclear energy. How are those people, packed into a a metal can with a nuclear generator and the radiation coming from it,  alive and kicking today? Shielding. Yup. I went all five year old on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if we are able to build shileds against radiation in a submerged vessel, why jn the world shouldn't we be able to build shields on space shuttles? Well, we did. And we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is rather silly how greatly some people protest against man landing on the moon. We have the tech. We had the tech. Greater minds then you and me worked on doing it, and did it. Couragous men trusted their lives to others in the hope of going where noone had been. And here you are, calling thousands of them liers for some unknown reason (Like, why would they fake it? Never been given an awnser there. Just been called a hoax and that's that..).
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly am sorry that you are driven to go against the stream when it comes to this. Like, do you accept that the planet we stand on is spherical in shape? Do you accept the Earth rotating around the sun? Do you accept submarines? Airplanes? Satellites?... Do you accept that there are smarter people than you out there? People doing their best to advance our species in the fields of science and math, medicine, computing and others...
      </p>
      <p>
       Never before have we had so much information in our hands as we do with the internet and computers. And you use it to try and shit over the people that spent years to bring mankind on the fucking moon.

       This is amusing me greatly. Just how much thrust do you think would be required to fire a nuclear class submarine into deep space?
      </p>
      <p>
       The shuttle is a flimsy aluminium can that has never left low earth orbit, and has therefore not got anywhere close to the Van Allen Belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the point - the sheer weight of a craft with sufficient lead cladding to protect humans from solar radiation, would be too heavy for us to get into deep space, with current technology. It was an insurmountable theoretical problem for Wernher von Braun, and it still is today.

       Well, we have managed to get some "flimsy aluminium cans" into the air... just look at jets. So if we can do jets, why not shuttles?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you seem to be missing the point of people willingly risking their own life to accomplish this. Look , for example, at the Chernobyl disaster, where 3 guys took on more radiation then any man had ever done before... they didn't die within seconds or minutes or hours. One went on for days, long enouh for his skin to start falling off. They knew the risks, they knew there was no happily ever after if they did what they did.... but to save others, they gave their lives. The people that go into space know well that they might never take off, they might never leave the atmosphere, they might never return, but they are willing to risk their own lives in the hopes of furthering our hnderstanding of what is beyond our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's good that my tjoughts on the matter amuse you so greatly. If your lifes work is to try and "debunk" the "propoganda and hoaxes" of NASA, all the power to you. I on the other hand will amuse myself with dreams of what might just come off our explorations into the unknown, hoping for the safety of those that go where I will never be and smkle over the faqt that my nieces will grow up into a world made better by people pushing the bounderies of science for the betterment of the human race. But you, and your kind, will never take away from the human race that yes, we did. Yes, we can. And yes, we will once again.

       I've already told you - even though the Soviets would have been virtually certain NASA was faking their moonlandings - because they didn't detect any evidence of it - they couldn't prove a negative. They were smart enough to realise that casting doubts on the moonlandings without evidence, would have looked like sour grapes.

       not to promote our podcast... but we did an episode covering the moon landing... there is a lot of weird stuff that doesn't make sense.. in 2 different missions several different pictures have the exact same background.. you can over lay them and they match up exactly. The cross hairs on the photos is shady.. how they "accidentally" recorded over the original footage of the broadcast.. lots of weird things.. But... if you listen to our show.. one of my co-host gives some damn good defense on why it wasn't a hoax. out of the 4 of us... 1 said we never went it was a hoax, 2 said we did go, and I am on the fence.. to many weird things for me to land on either side...

       To play devils advocate - only a small number of people would actually need to know as they could have positioned themselves between the earth and the moon, close to the moons orbit and the control room would be none the wiser ( or the Russians). As for the equipment - I assume you're talking about the mirror that you can bounce lasers off? Well the Russians have also placed one on the moon but they did theirs on an unmanned mission  (Google 'lunar retroflectors')

       Mirrors, man. We put mirrors on the moon.

       We aim lazers at those mirrors and thus calculate exactly how far away the moon is at the time of measurement and other useful data that, for example, proves once and for all that mirrors are able to reflect light as well as reflections.

       Actually you don't even need the mirrors.  The laser will bounce off anything.  BONUS: try this at home by shining a laser at a wall, carpet, or a cat.  You will see a laser dot, which means the light reflected back to your eye.  CRAZY RIGHT?

       There's a theory that NASA and the US government conspires to just put it into orbit for exactly the same amount of time it takes to travel to the moon and back and then bring it back down again right on cue. I mean who would ever know?

       He meant the rover, there should be a crater-like indent near the massive lander; but it appears smooth as the rest of the moon. Are you suggesting that a car-sized metal object falling at a high speed would leave no crater? Even in 1/6th gravity, it makes no sense, because we didn't go to the moon. Go was the ISS bullshit on youtube, people tear those videos at the seams because they are covered in bullshit.

       But that's not what happened. The module wasn't hurtling towards the surface of the moon, it was touching down quite gently- all of 3 mph by its final burn. And in close of photos of the landing surface, marks are visible showing the pressure from the landing thrusters.

       We Absolutely without a shadow of a doubt did not go. None of the scientific/engineering information about space is in the public domain. The secrecy involved with space agencies should tell you the answer. Moreover, if we went once, we would have done it again and perfected the art, but nah.

       Seriously... Read
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       about the subject you are trying to debunk before you say anything...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes it is. There's a whole heck of a bunch of information about space in the public domain. If you have enough money (and intelligence, that's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       important), you can get there yourself. That's what Space X is. A privately owned organization that learned how to get there with the info scientists figured out already.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, space agencies are now private organizations, so yeah, they're aloud to be as secret as they want. As far as the previous era of space exploration with NASA goes, you have them to thank for things like glow-in-the-dark paint, memory foam, Tang, and
       <em>
        everything else they ever invented
       </em>
       since releasing everything they ever invented for public use was part of the stipulations for their operations.

       We went back. A few times.
