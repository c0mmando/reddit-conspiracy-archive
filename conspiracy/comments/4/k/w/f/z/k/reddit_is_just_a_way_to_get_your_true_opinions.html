       I guess that I should limit my comments to accurate descriptions, valid critiques and suggestions of design improvements, so that when The Man comes to get me they can explain to everyone that their motivation for harassing me was to stop me from trying to improve the improvable.   I'll take my chances ;)

       How did they get where they were and what did they use to get there. NASA had stray.paperclips ... Who were they and how did they get there. What were their beliefs. Hint Mae Brussel covered paperclip. She was good.

       Yet the clueless idiots who use this site tend to view themselves as superior beings enlightened by science, technology, and progressive ideals. They think they're the ones who will save the world. The truth is that the government and corporations LOVE them! They're the best type of slaves because they don't ask questions (because they don't know they're slaves). If and when they ever DO asks questions, it's about the script or storyline of the elite's media puppet show. The idiots argue about stuff they saw on TV. They fall for it every time. For superior beings, they sure are dumb.

       Yes it's a trap, a honey trap because those of us who post here know damn well that bad shit is happening and the "representatives" are abject failures, failing at their basic historic mandates, that kleptocracy, and a vulture economy, on the brink of a world without law, except for those that threaten the oligarchs who have ruined everything, they, you and me will be brought to account by vipers.

       I'm not playing him he's in me. Playing God is what our government does. I think in a nutshell they do everything in their power to hide enlightenment including killing off cultures. They also have made an entire belief system called science that is an entire smear campaign of what's really going on here on earth.

       I can't answer that with a definite answer but I think it's either we are evolving ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or this is like a fun game we play with ourselves where we continuously go through stages where we get dumber and dumber until we are where we're currently at. Once we get to the end of this crazy train everyone will get enlightened and we will all praise the almighty one. That's the sparking of the golden age.

       Praise the almighty one, wonder who that is. Getting dumber and dumber ? Seems the opposite unless we revert after enlightenment. Hopefully not, there's a lot to do.

       Exactly, reverting is all we will need to do, reverting to 26000 years ago. We already built up technology but what will happen once everyone knows the truth? That's when the magic really begins.

       I honestly think we can probably revert everything we've done in less than a year. It's not that God exists, it's that God is within us and we can create our own reality with our willpower.

       Depends what you want, I think the golden age will be filled with tons of plants and trees, technology, no pollution, no plastic and everything we want to do, no lies only truth and love. That is the optimal but I believe we go through these phases to learn.

       It's because prophecy must be fulfilled. The polar shift will happen and we will be raised to a higher consciousness at the same time. Who knows when it's coming but it's definitely coming. All religions speak of this prophecy.

       Project paperclip...project Mk....fill in the blank. There are many. Look at who we know they brought and what they did. u/MaeBrusselHustler found me some stuf on operation chaos . found website that leads to someone else' site that tells the same story. We are all looking at what they do,not how. The real darkside. If there are any doubts there are thousands of kids  disappearing. Look into the Vril society. They live...we call them the Vulcans. And the whole shit show runs on coercion...I ethe sucking of our souls. This is all sigil magic. And it is the evil sort. Please. do give this all a Thoth. Or three. I need to be wrong here, if not we got some learning to do....quick. r/gnosis these people are talking about how to use our Creator given rights....methinks the demiurge might be a clue. If I tell you you will not believe.

       I am asking for people to prove me wrong. Not point and laugh, but looks t where I pointed readup on some of the things does there. Use your googlefoo. We are and have been circlejerking....we know the international power structure. mostly. we know they are rotten. we know at least prescott financed some of the corporate structure. In.the nazi germany the produced some awesome scientists. now we have a possible way to have at them at their own game. I can't tell you what to do. You have to go look or you won't believe. The hidden hand. The psychopath Vulcans. This all stuff that has been in this sub. I am just holding up a mirror. and a different way of looking at it. And it sure does explain an awful lot of missing and abused kids....I don't think Oppenheimer was one, he had a conscience. Look for the sick in the structure.
