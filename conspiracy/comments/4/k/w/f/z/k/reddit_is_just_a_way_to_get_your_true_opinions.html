They think they&#39;re the ones who will save the world. The truth is that the government and corporations LOVE them!

If and when they ever DO asks questions, it&#39;s about the script or storyline of the elite&#39;s media puppet show. The idiots argue about stuff they saw on TV. They fall for it every time.

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t answer that with a definite answer but I think it&#39;s either we are evolving ourselves. </p>

<p>Or this is like a fun game we play with ourselves where we continuously go through stages where we get dumber and dumber until we are where we&#39;re currently at. Once we get to the end of this crazy train everyone will get enlightened and we will all praise the almighty one. That&#39;s the sparking of the golden age.</p>
