       Perhaps one of the biggest and long running conspiracies we have in America is the one that rich white men have used to keep us under control: Telling poor gullible whites that their problems stem from blacks, muslims, latinos, and women, and that they too can be rich and powerful too, because they are white, and white is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whites have been fed this lie since the very beginning and for some reason have refused to look at history, because they continue to keep believing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       White men today that buy into this nonsense are generally speaking going to be Republicans, use the term SJW, have uncomfortable and irrational anger towards blacks, latinos, muslims and women, and feel the country is constantly being "taken" from them. And of course...They are usually poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sounds like you...Then yes, you have been targeted, over and over again to buy into the bullshit that you are better and different because you are white and that you too can one day become rich and powerful and one of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been feeding you this bullshit in so many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Romney tried it too. And everyone before them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that poor white southerners are the only group that historically, without fail, votes against their own economic interest and will fight for rich white interests despite  never being rich?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now, many of you are reading this and getting angry and pulling together stats and coming up with cliche responses to defend your belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would find it all so amusing if it were not so pitiful and sad. It reminds me of a quote from The Matrix.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.
        <strong>
         You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is most likely you. You are here because you are questioning the world around you. Now I want you to REALLY question it. Question why you are questioning it. Why do you really feel this way? What other lies are being perpetrated to keep us all apart?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it.

      <p>
       “You got more than the blacks, don’t complain.

      <p>
       You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they 
explain.

       Yes they are screwing us all, but the point I am trying to make is that  everyone seems to realize it except for a certain segment of the population, and they are made up nearly entirely by white males (white females too), most of which are in the South. This group believes the bullshit the elite tell them more than anyone else. Instead of blaming the rich white elite, they blame jews, they blame blacks, mexicans, muslims, women. Anyone but the rich white elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great change could happen if only this segment recognized what is going on.

       Southern white female here. This is so ridiculously true &amp; I see it pretty much everywhere. So many people I know suffer from the "American Dream," and it's disgusting and sad. Middle-class &amp; poor white southerners often believe they're wealthy because of what they've been able to finance. It appears to escape them that they don't actually own anything. They will shout anyone down for stating the truth because it infuriates them. They see the banks &amp; the billionaires as their allies - something to aspire to. The cognitive dissonance in this culture is often staggering to behold.   :(

       Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.

       Yes, this! Thank you, I'd forgotten this quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subject has been on my mind so much lately because everyone I know is yapping about the election. They all speak as if they're coming from the mindset of the "temporarily embarrassed millionaire," poo-pooing the lazy, less-fortunate over fancy china plates of fried chicken &amp; monogrammed glasses of iced tea. Meanwhile, I'm white-knuckling my urge to flip a fucking table. You'd think I'd be used to it all by now, but I am continually shocked at the raw strength of denial around me.

       Seriously dude? Having a conversation where the "s" word comes up, does not denote the endorsement of socialism. It's pure, propaganda-fueled assholery what you just did there, and it inhibits genuine discourse on this sub.

       There are a lot in the North, too. Maybe even more. Sounds crazy, but I've seen Jersey beat Mississippi easily. And I'll be honest, the worst racist shit I've heard out in public in the South has been from Northerners feeling "comfortable" to say horrible things because they're in the South...

       As someone who has lived in the South and now lives in the North, there's a reason for phrases like "Southern Justice" and "Good-Ole-Boy" that don't have an equivalent in the North.
      </p>
      <p>
       There certainly was and is racism in the North.  The extent and history of lynchings in the South isn't easily or intelligently forgotten, however.

       Just want to say "thanks" for saying this...and "fuck the Trumpets"...before the StormFront brigades show up here. Also, we might as well include the "Billary" brigades too. After all, she's still a (Republican) Goldwater wolf disguised as a Democrat sheep. Just take a look at

       Bullshit.  White people in this country see blacks out rioting in the streets, attacking people, and then claim racism when one of them gets shot.  We are told on one hand that we take advantage of "white privilege ", then we read a stupid post like this one claiming the exact opposite.  We're not buying the bullshit. What were going to do is elect Trump this November and take our fucking country back from you losers.  Then the next time a black moron with stinky breath interrupts my family dinner during a blacklivesmatter protest, I'm going to beat the shit out of him.

       This has echoes of a dystopian society. In the future our phones will be monitored all the time and hoards of unemployed people will be enlisted to listen  to everything we say whether using the phone or not. Everyone is free to say what they like but the Ministry Of Peaceful Communication, MoPCOM, will occasionally applying corrective measures to keep all communication peaceful. When a conversation shows signs of becoming confrontational an operative will invoke Rule 10 via the phone's speaker. Any person who has broken rule 10 more than nine times, is removed.

       The belief, by all races, that white is better, is universal. Go to Jamaica, and look at the complexions of those who run the island. Go to Brazil and look at the complexion of the ruling class. Go to India and compare the complexions of the Untouchables with the Brahman caste. Those with lighter skin color have always been viewed as more beautiful and superior -- by blacks, by Asians, by Hispanics, by Hindus, by everybody.
