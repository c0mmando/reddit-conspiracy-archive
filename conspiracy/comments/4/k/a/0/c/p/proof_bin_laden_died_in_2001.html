<p>2000 to September 2001: Reports Emerge of bin Laden Dying From Kidney Disease</p>

<hr/>

<p>In March 2000 the Chicago Tribune reports that an Afghan witness and &quot;Western intelligence official&quot; say bin Laden is suffering from severe kidney and liver failure.

<hr/>

<p>In July 2001, the South Asia Analysis Group reports: &quot;Bin Laden, who suffers from renal deficiency, has been periodically undergoing dialysis in a Peshawar military hospital with the knowledge and approval of the Inter-Services Intelligence, (ISI) if not of Gen.Pervez Musharraf himself.&quot; Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper266.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper266.html</a></p>

<p>September to November 2001: bin Laden is Trapped in Afghanistan, Unable to Receive Kidney Treatments</p>

<hr/>

<p>In September 2001, PBS&#39; Frontline interviews the former general counsel for the CIA, mentioning reports from 1998 that the DEA found out Osama bin Laden was undergoing kidney dialysis with a doctor in Peshwar. They mention further that the DEA wanted to poison bin Laden through his dialysis machine, but the CIA allegedy rejected this due to the ban on assassinations.</p>

This story is also picked up by several French newspapers. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism</a> In his first interview since 9/11, in November 2001 bin Laden talks to a Pakistani newspaper and claims that his &quot;kidneys are all right&quot; and denies visiting a hospital in Dubai the previous year (note that he may have visited one in Pakistan). In the same interview he also asserts, clearly lying, that he has &quot;nuclear weapons.&quot; Link: <a href="http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2">http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>December 2001: bin Laden is Dead, Buried in Afghanistan In December of 2001, the New York Times reports on &quot;high-level murmurings that bin Laden is dead.&quot; Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html</a> That same day,citing a Taliban source, Fox News reports that bin Laden has died due to an &quot;untreated lung complication&quot; from kidney disease. About 30 &quot;close associates&quot; reportedly attended bin Laden&#39;s funeral in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. A source concludes that the U.S. government and other forces are in a &quot;mad search operation&quot; but will never be able to locate the now-dead bin Laden, buried in an unmarked location. Link: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/12/26/report-bin-laden-already-dead/">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/12/26/report-bin-laden-already-dead/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Late December 2001 to March 2002: bin Laden&#39;s &quot;Death Video&quot; is Released In late December of 2001, after reports of bin Laden&#39;s funeral, a new video appears of a gaunt, sickly Osama bin Laden. The London Telegraph reports, verbatim: &quot;The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa&#39;eda leader was already dead.&quot; One aid further concludes that the video was created earlier in the event bin Laden is dead, who by December of 2001 was so heavily surrounded he would have been unable to escape to obtain kidney dialysis.

<hr/>

<p>At this time CBS news also runs a story on bin Laden receiving kidney disease treatments in Pakistan the week before 9/11. Link:Osama bin Laden Near Death in 2002 (from Dan Rather CBS); US Government bin Laden LIE In January of 2002, The Guardian reports that the president of Pakistan speculates that bin Laden is now dead of untreated kidney disease based on video and photographs of a gaunt-looking bin Laden. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In January of 2002, based on his analysis of video and photographs of bin Laden from December 2001, CNN&#39;s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that bin Laden seems to be having renal failure. He notes kidney dialysis is expensive, and suggests bin Laden would need help in obtaining medical treatment. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In March 2002, the BBC reports on an interview with bin Laden&#39;s wife, who speaks of bin Laden in the past tense, notes his failing kidney and frequent use of pills and other medicines. She says she has not seen her husband since September 2001, but holds out hope that he is still alive: &quot;I feel deep inside me that he is still alive.&quot; She also notes that bin Laden&#39;s wish was to die in Afghanistan and nowhere else: &quot;He never spoke to me about his intention to leave Afghanistan and always wished to die there. He told me once that if he ever left Afghanistan, it would be to meet his Creator.&quot; She also says that bin Laden &quot;always suffered from kidney and stomach pains and that he &quot;told me once that he was going to Pakistan for treatment.&quot; Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In March and April of 2002, U.S. officials downplay the threat of bin Laden, with Rumsfeld even saying the bin Laden threat has been &quot;neutralized.&quot; Even Bush, called out for rarely mentioning bin Laden in 2002, admits: &quot;We haven&#39;t heard from him [bin Laden] in a long time... I don&#39;t know where he is. I really just don&#39;t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.&quot; Link: Bush: Truly not concerned about bin Laden (short version) In May 2002, ABC News reports on a new spliced-together tape from unknown time periods in which bin Laden appears &quot;about the same&quot; (that is, sickly-looking) as in the tape from December 2011. ABC News also says they have &quot;learned intelligence reports indicate bin Laden had received a kidney transplant in Pakistan,&quot; but do not know when.

<hr/>

<p>July 2002: FBI Chief Says bin Laden is Most Likely Dead; Nothing from bin Laden Since December 2001 In July 2002, the BBC reveals a bombshell: the FBI&#39;s counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson says bin Laden is &#39;&quot;probably dead.&quot; Conveniently, bin Laden&#39;s followers&#39; claim that bin Laden will &quot;not make more video statements until his group launches another attack on the United States.&quot; Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In July 2002, CNN reports that bin Laden&#39;s close bodyguards were captured in February of 2002, but not bin Laden. The article also quotes mentions some high-level officials: &quot;Some high-level U.S. officials are already convinced by such evidence that bin Laden, who has not been seen or heard from in months, is dead.&quot; Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/">http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In July 2002, Time Magazine reports that &quot;intelligence officials are not certain whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead&quot; but that &quot;they have found a tantalizing document that suggests he was living at least as recently as the last days of December [of 2001].&quot; Link: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html</a> In July 2002, The New York Times runs another article on how Osama bin Laden is likely dead. The author notes how unusual it would be for bin Laden, known for his constant desire for media attention, would be silent for over half a year.

<hr/>

<p>October 2002: Intelligence Officials Confirm bin Laden is Dead; bin Laden&#39;s Will is Released Also in October 2002 the D.C.-based news service The World Tribune, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reports that the United States and Israel have concluded that bin Laden died in Afghanistan in December 2001. They note that additional bin Laden messages are &quot;probably fabrications,&quot; and that bin Laden&#39;s heir has been chosen. Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>The president of Afghanistan also concludes that bin Laden is probably dead: &quot;The more we don&#39;t hear of him, and the more time passes, there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere.&quot; Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/</a> In October 2002 CNN reports that U.S. intelligence officials have obtained Osama bin Laden&#39;s will, which is dated December 14, 2001 (approximately the same date as has been reported bin Laden&#39;s funeral in Tora Bora by Fox News and other outlets). CNN also reports that there has been no evidence of bin Laden since December of 2001. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>2002 Onwards: Efforts to Target bin Laden are Closed Down; bin Laden = &quot;Elvis&quot; In 2004, the LA Times quotes Donald Rumsfeld (who mixes up Hussein with bin Laden) as admitting: &quot;We&#39;ve not seen him [bin Laden] on a video since 2001.&quot; Link: <a href="http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/binladen/death/rumsfeld-says-no-clues-to-bin-laden-since-2001.txt">http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/binladen/death/rumsfeld-says-no-clues-to-bin-laden-since-2001.txt</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2006 the New York Times reports the CIA had officially closed down the unit focused on capturing bin Laden the previous year. Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?ex=1309665600&amp;en=3779ed9b98bb9d22&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?ex=1309665600&amp;en=3779ed9b98bb9d22&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2006, U.S. and Pakistani officials say they have not received any information about bin Laden in years: &quot;no tips from informants, no snippets from electronic intercepts, no points on any satellite image.&quot; The article rehashes the December 2001 video of bin Laden as the most recent evidence (other than a second-hand claim from 2003) of bin Laden&#39;s existence. Some commandos are now giving Osama bin Laden the codename &quot;Elvis.&quot; Link: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The available reports overwhelmingly supports the view that bin Laden died of kidney failure in December of 2001. We have mainstream media reports from a variety of sources, and zero credible evidence since then, as admitted by top level offiicals. Even if you believe the official story, the evidence very strongly suggests some entity (either the CIA, Saudi Royal Family, the Pakistani government, or all the above) helped bin Laden survive long enough via medical treatments to be killed at a later point in time. This very well could be the &quot;one big lie&quot; Seymour Hersh has mentioned in The Guardian recently.﻿</p>

<p>An image apparently showing a dead Osama bin Laden broadcast on Pakistani television and picked up by British newspaper websites is a fake.</p>

<p>The bloodied image of a man with matted hair and a blank, half-opened eye has been circulating on the internet for the past two years. It was used on the front pages of the Mail, Times, Telegraph, Sun and Mirror websites, though swiftly removed after the fake was exposed on Twitter...<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I just googled &quot;bin Laden dead photo&quot; and its literally the first result on Images. But when his &quot;death&quot; broke on the news I remember seeing it leaked a few days later and it seemed to be all over the place. At the time, it felt to me like it was the Obama administration&#39;s way of saying &quot;Look what <em>we</em> did! <em>Oops</em> we accidentally leaked a picture proving he&#39;s dead! Damn, guess there&#39;s no way you can doubt us now, right?&quot; Except I very quickly found out (don&#39;t remember from where) that it was a fake. Just like his birth certificate was a fabrication from another kid&#39;s. I can link a video of that one if you&#39;d like but that&#39;s totally off topic. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t remember where I first heard about all this bin Laden picture conspiracy shit first but when it was on the news, this photo was hovering around on the internet as supposed proof. A quick googling of the phrase above pulls up a few news article results that all seem to dance around the topic but <a href="https://www.mrconservative.com/2014/03/36190-breaking-the-real-reason-osama-bin-ladens-death-photos-werent-released/">this</a> is the only one I found that directly references the photo. I&#39;m starting to wonder if the photo was supposed to be a hoax now, though. Because several articles from 2012 and 2013 reference the bin Laden death photos as being &quot;unreleased.&quot; So maybe there was never really anything to this after all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have heard this repeated a thousand times, and I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s misguided - it would be true of someone born today, but not of somebody born in 1961. </p>

<p>This is because US legislation determining nationality has changed over time, and, as it happens, the law in force when Barack Obama was born in 1961 makes it quite clear that Obama&#39;s mother (Stanley Ann Dunham) was ineligible to pass on her US nationality <strong>if her child was born outside the United States (eg Kenya)</strong>. </p>

<p>The relevant legislation is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1952">1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 301(a)(7).</a></strong> Please note that subsequent, amended versions of this Act are not relevant to Obama.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know about this, because whilst we can discuss it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sr7yn/many_people_assume_that_obamas_birthplace_doesnt/">here</a>, it is never discussed in the mainstream media. </p>

<p>There was a lot of pressure on the administration at the time to release photos. They refused, and never leaked one.</p>

Obama was born in Hawaii, his mother was a noted anthropologist that moved him to Malayasia when she was studying.  Satoro is his step father&#39;s name, his half sister shares it with him.

<p>If they didn&#39;t want anyone getting their hands on this then they could have just got rid of them back at base or over countryside where a clean up would be far easier than in the compound they had just raided that was surrounded by witnesses and incoming Pakistani security forces.

    <div class="md"><p>She carried out genocidal killings against the Muhajir community in the city of Karatschi. She embezzled money out of the country when people in that Thahar area (which she represented) were dying due to shortage of water. She also represented an area that is still stuck in 2000BC. Slavery is rampant, and actual slavery. With private jails and daughters raped if they don&#39;t tow the line. The top brass fucks their daughters anyways. These people grow up worshipping their owners. It&#39;s a disgusting, vile culture.</p>

<p>How do I know this? The slave-owners are rich as fuck, they send their sons (not daughters though) to the best colleges in America. I had them as friends. They are the most fucked up people. They brag about their slaves, how they embezzle government money, fuck Benazir herself gave his dad government contracts that were up to 5x over overinvoiced.</p>

<p>They do the work, take the &quot;over invoiced part&quot; to London or Dubai where they split it 50/50 with her.</p>

<p>These are just off the top of my head.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, another thing. How they uses slaves. So they&#39;d commit any crime. And then a random slave would go confess and go to jail for their master.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so beyond fucked up, and they are proud of it. It&#39;s their culture. This is a place where the robbers were on TV complaining (I think a year ago) that the police is a nuisance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a parallel world where right and wrong are switched.</p>

<p>But yeah, she has a vagina, so maybe you worship that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small world, I worship it too. Sorry, just had to get that lame joke out of the way.</p>

<p>The fact is that all politicians are corrupt (esp. poor third world countries), so it kinda cancels out. I&#39;d have no problems praising her if she had actually done some excellent stuff (despite being corrupt) for her country. She didn&#39;t do much. On top of that, actual literal slavery + killing of people for their race is something that is unacceptable. Monetary corruption I can live with.</p>

<p>Do you know that Pakistan still has a feudal system and most politicians are feudal? India ended it right after their independence. Pakistan&#39;s still stuck in that time.</p>

<p>Also, incidentally, they have a program in that region that basically gives out free money to &quot;buy&quot; support. Guess what it&#39;s called? (check the link)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bisp.gov.pk/">http://www.bisp.gov.pk/</a></p>

<p>And sadly, since she has a vagina, Hillary just praised her slave-owning son yesterday I think. Forgetting the fact that every son comes from a vagina, so that doesn&#39;t make him any more special that any other son.</p>

<p>I suspect that many of us will either be dead or too old to care when these facts are leaked from official sources or the government outright admits it.  It will be reported like the thousands of other huge revelations and then buried by the latest celebrity gossip &amp; deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once the institution of fear-managed government is deeply ingrained and people have given up their &quot;old world liberties&quot; (which will be deemed archaic at best, barbaric at worst; notions of self-determination, independence and &quot;allowed to fail&quot;) then it will be safe (and perhaps even, horrifyingly, celebrated) to openly admit how government and liberty were co-opted. &quot;The values of that world were bad, anyway. We&#39;re so much more enlightened and evolved now.&quot;</p>

<p>Here we come with self driving cars. Legislation for forced vaccinations. Government abduction is legal. The state is our parents even when we are parents. We live in a constant state of &quot;justified&quot; fear and suspicion and think our corrupt politics are the saving grace of this post-prosperity system. Masculinity is &quot;toxic&quot; and along with it competence and capability to not only govern our own, but our very selves.</p>

<p>Common core in our government-sponsored indoctrination centers we call school are all about black history and gynocentricism, teaching our youth that thinking for yourself and discriminating against things which may be socially unhealthy is bad, and that untenable decay is good and self responsibility is radical. Critical thought vilified.</p>

<p>Classic values which lifted civilizations are the greatest enemy. There&#39;s a new system being constructed which focuses totally on hierarchical victimhood, with whites the lowest on the totem. The biggest problem with this system is not that it is sticking and growing like a juggernaut of trash based on momentum. The biggest problem with this system is that it needs never to be based on any element of truth or reality.</p>

<p>It is a completely synthetic &quot;reality,&quot; with a new aspect fabricated at will to push a new facet of control or domination. I&#39;ve been called crazy for claiming we live in a &quot;simulation.&quot; People think it&#39;s crazy because they don&#39;t think. They think I mean that we&#39;re plugged into a literal matrix with cords in our necks and our world is nothing but a digital approximation of life. While that&#39;s an apt allegory, it&#39;s not what I mean. The power of nuance is such that it is not grasped by most.</p>

Or care to even find out why 9/11 was a lie to the American people. It&#39;s been almost 40 years since JFK was killed and we&#39;re not even digging down to the bottom of it, it&#39;s forgotten. Yet in that time, when my parents were the same age as I currently am now, it was a big mystery/cover up. It was a major event that changed history. And now? They could care less. It&#39;s been so long they don&#39;t even care to ask questions. It happened, and that was it. Just like 9/11 happened yet we&#39;ll never get the answers in our lifetime. It was all designed to work this way. </p>

What is compiled above is largely mainstream articles, that as we know are mostly controlled and vetted by government and corporate interests before broadcast or publication. However, it seems that at the time bin Laden was on a dialysis machine and was suffering major organ failure, the media at the time presented the news unaware that he would be used as a scapegoat for years to come.

<p>Let&#39;s use the O.J. knife story: first curiosity was knowing that the fictional O.J. TV show had just experienced it&#39;s largest ratings drop and then when you read the article you learn that the knife had been turned in weeks before the &quot;breaking news&quot; was reported.  Furthermore, to believe the story one has to believe that LAPD had not thoroughly searched O.J.&#39;s property in 1995 and choose to forget that when O.J.&#39;s house was torn down there were folks on the scene monitoring the destruction for potential evidence.  So within an hour of reading the reports I would have bet my life on the fact that the knife had nothing to do with O.J. Simpson.  </p>

<p>Hopefully that better explains how one&#39;s beliefs do not and should not factor into the process of identifying utter bullshit presented as fact.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is compiled very well, excellent research.  </p>

<p>in the 2011 raid that the official explanation claims killed OBL, there was at least one independent source  that claimed to be a sort of eye witness to a raid being conducted in pakistan at the location government officials claimed OBL was hiding.  it was, of all things, some random dude on twitter.  he remarked on the helicopters in the middle of the night.  </p>

<p>another odd occurrence surrounding  OBL&#39;s death is the timing in regards to the obama administration.  in the same week as the raid, the obama adminstration also released his birth certificate and if i remember correctly, did something to the tea party (i believe, a little fuzzy) to kind of show them up.  all 3 in the same week.  not sure if this is just a coincidence or if something else is at play here.</p>

<p>id like to ask if you had done any research into the possibility that OBL received a kidney transplant.  that would have been the only thing to ensured that he remained alive, but any evidence you could  find of this would probably be hearsay at best.  not saying your research is wrong here, just playing the devils advocate.</p>

<p>finally, id like to ask your opinion as to why wait until 2011?  if he had been dead for years, why suddenly come out and say they killed him?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will research further on the kidney transplant. I believe the timing had a lot to do with setting in stone Obama&#39;s second term. He was allegedly killed close to an election. Not sure if there are any other correlations to the timing but like I said his death largely being the responsibility of the Obama Administration significantly increased his approval ratings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bin laden thing is pretty simple. After 2001 there was virtually no new audio/video of the guy at all. Every time the media released a piece on Bin Laden it was always old video rehashed. Ie the evidence he was alive after 2001, was almost non existent. At the same time you&#39;ve got multiple independent people reporting on the fact he was on dialysis and suffering from kidney disease, also that later on he had already died. What perfect way to keep a perpetual war going, chasing an invisible phantom. Obviously this is not absolute proof, only a body would be absolute proof. But unfortunately it doesn&#39;t exist because it was conveniently disposed of, presumably so no one could authenticate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you also have multiple independent people reporting that Bin Laden is alive. This is really par for the course for a person you don&#39;t recieve much info about and is in hiding. You had constant reports of Bin Laden&#39;s death, just as you had about even random celebrities that go out of public light for a while. People want to know and they&#39;ll grab anything they can. </p>

<p>Really I think the simple fact that to my knowledge Al Quaeda and Sadams family repeatedly rejected notions that he was dead before 2011, but haven&#39;t after the supposed hit sort of holds more water than random ramblings by a bunch of newspapers. </p>

<p>I also think one of the biggest problems I have with this theory is that the US pretty much gave away that they have a stealth variant of the MH-60 Black Hawk, as the one that crashed during the raid and was destroyed showed signs of being obviously quite different to standard Black Hawks. Also working into the whole problem of how the helicopters even got to the compound without detection by Pakistani forces. If the raid was just a &quot;false flag&quot; and Bin Laden wasn&#39;t killed, it was very stupid to basically reveal to the world that you have apparently extremely stealth capable helicopters.</p>

<p>I mean this mind sound trivial, but the MH-60 Stealth is obviously some sort of a Black Project like the F-117, and as such it really wouldn&#39;t be risked unless absolutely necessary. The crash left debris that anyone could pick up, plus resulting in photos of the wreckage, meaning that foreign nations could get a hold of it and analyze the absorbant paint, materials and just the design of the tail rotor asembly, which was left pretty intact. The F-117 for example wasn&#39;t revealed for 5 years and only really started being used for more regular work almost a decade after it&#39;s introduction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my two cents but the hunt for bin Laden was a big motivation for a lot of the blind patriotism in America. Plus, if he was in that bad of shape, it could see people finding it more difficult to believe he orchestrated 9/11 and thus would make people think even moreso that it was an inside job... I dunno. Just brainstorming.</p>

<p>How stupid would the govt have looked if they announced this amazing raid and then AQ provide actual proof that Bin Laden had been dead for years?  It would have been an incredible propaganda coup for them and could have brought down the Obama administration.</p>

We now know Saudi was behind the whole 9/11 attacks. Since the CIA was there too, we can speculate that they knew about it all. After the attack, he probably died BC of being the most wanted man in the world. Benazir Bhutto also confirmed this. He became America&#39;s martyr for war so Saudi and America could get regional control...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just Israel. It&#39;s a whole network of different people that all had something to gain. Israel got more funding, Saudi got weapons, oil tycoons got free resources, military contractors got huge contracts... just blaming Jews and Israel is dumb. Most their people are clueless citizens like us, it&#39;s actual people that exist that are to blame. Individuals and societies of small groups. I don&#39;t want to be blamed for Iraq. I didn&#39;t join the military, I sold my car to buy less oil, I protested the invasion.... stop lumping against the whole and educate yourself on the individuals and attack them. Otherwise, these evil individuals can hide in the Jewish community and claim you&#39;re attacking them unfairly.... I tell the same thing to israelis that blame Arabs, Palestinians, and Hamas all in one. Attackers are individuals and do not represent the whole... it&#39;s unfair to persecute a whole group based on the actions of a few people... it perpetuates war and hate against innocent people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i try to see it above that, even if jewish people were involved, there are other rich and powerful people in the world too who would have likely been involved too, like you said saudi oil tycoons, weapons manufacturers from various european countries and scores of other huge tycoons around the world. Maybe there were some jewish people involved too. It&#39;s not this country&#39;s or that country&#39;s, this race&#39;s or that race&#39;s, this religion&#39;s or that religion&#39;s people, it&#39;s the group of very very super rich people from various religions/countries/races/companies that maybe playing these global games of war and money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because they are behind the whole attack doesn&#39;t mean others aren&#39;t behind the entire thing too. People always play small roles, but certain people played large rolls. It&#39;s not all Saudis and it&#39;s not all Jews nor is it all israelis. It&#39;s a select few people that identify with these larger groups that conspired and committed this crime. Don&#39;t jump to some pfffft scoffy response. We can&#39;t demonize the people like you and I in other paces searching for truth, while a select few that live in their region did it. I did not want this, i sold my car and have rode a bicycle since to reduce my oil purchases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Demonize like me? You made that silly claim that the Saudis were initiator of an attack against the USA on US soil. </p>

<p>What the Saudis most likely were part of is helping with/running the necessary terror management to create the social environment so the USA could justify their military agenda in Iraq/Afghanistan/Pakistan/....</p>

<p>They might even be fooled/bullied/given promises to provide the services/patsies and unwittingly fell into the trap the USA set for the future(28 pages of nonsense) if needed.</p>

<p>But the assumption that they would have organized and executed 11/9 on US soil is so mind boggling ridiculous in itself.</p>

<p>That large complex military operation required several branches of the US governments to keep in line, the western intelligence/political and media realm to co-operate. That means it was executed with the support or even supervision of NATO which is ultimately an instrument of the USA again.</p>

<p>The only status the Saudis have for the elites which control the USA is a means to an end. If they end their usefulness all the treasure they collected with the USD/Oil deal will be &quot;retrieved&quot; by all means necessary.</p>
