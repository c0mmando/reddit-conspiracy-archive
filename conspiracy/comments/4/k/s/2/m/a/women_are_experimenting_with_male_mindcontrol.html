      <p>
       And to salvage this thread, how about some actual content?
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Patriarchy” (i.e. pre-feminist society) never portrayed men as doofuses and morons constantly in need of female supervision, something which is the norm now. It never even portrayed women in any negative light, and yet post “patriarchy” men are told by nasty old feminists like Hannah Rosin that they’re failing because they are essentially inferior and that women have proven themselves superior now that they have been “freed from shackles of gender norms.” Never was there under patriarchy any widespread popular acceptance of misogyny, but post-patriarchy society is so utterly misandric that it’s hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       When gender norms are removed, women gain everything in terms of personal choice, but men lose their role in society. Feminists try to appeal to the battered victim in men today who have been effectively castrated by feminism and misandry, by saying, “Hey, how cool! Now you no longer have to work! You can be a househusband!” And yet all the evidence shows that women continue to desire men who are higher up on the economic scale, and that most marriages involving a bread winning wife end with the wife tossing away the husband and going it alone or marrying up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing relies on men not seeing their own interests. Yes, standards of masculinity are often oppressive, but throwing out gender norms means that boys don’t attain their full potential by being challenged and encouraged. They’re instead encouraged to act passive, that women will like them just as much this way, and then these boys watch as women take advantage of all of their new options and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       date the type of guy these boys were told not to become.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~:~
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t women feel ashamed when they use the “rape culture” argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       To say that rape culture exists and influences every aspect of what a woman thinks differs in no way from saying that women are too stupid to think for themselves and that their every opinion is shaped and molded by men. Fantasize about being dominated? Apparently that’s rape culture, so they only feel this way because they’re so mentally weak and vulnerable that men were able to brainwash them into feeling this way without even needing to exert any conscious effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does that say about women? If someone could walk up to you, look at your wallet, and then you would just immediately pull it out and give him all of your currency, then it doesn’t mean that he’s a thief. It just means that you’re retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many women
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       admit that their opinions are shaped molded by men, mostly the ones they perceive as harmful, and that’s what they call patriarchy. But they somehow argue that they should still be trusted with voting rights…
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve brought this exact point up to women who subscribe to the extreme side of this nonsense. That this attitude pretty much says, “I’m incapable of thinking for myself and have no personal responsibilities for my actions. Everything that I do and think is that is bad is because of patriarchy, while all of the good is my own empowerment.”
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s their counterargument? Rarely they’ll actually address it with something akin to “Nuh uh!” and nothing else to support their point other than claiming that my way of thinking is patriarchy. Usually they’ll mostly ignore it and either resort to or continue personal attacks, twist my words to say that I claimed women are stupid, or just blatantly accuse me of saying something I never said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when the argument is in writing, I’ve had a few accuse me of saying something that was never said, and all of their female friends back them, even though there is visible proof that they’re lying. I don’t even bother presenting documentation to back my point anymore, because it’s a wasted effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern feminist argument has turned into the black argument. “The patriarchy (white man) is keeping me down! Everything is sexist (racist)! The patriarchy (white man) is the reason for all of my troubles, including the mean things I say and do to others of my own gender (race)! The patriarchy (white man) turns us against each other!”
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s the exact same argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~:~
      </p>
      <p>
       Their point is that “men don’t get to decide the things for which a woman is praised; only women decide that.” This is basically saying that women get to cover up all their failures and force people to focus on only the good things about them. You don’t get to point out their flaws, ever, Because they’ve chosen to ignore them, you are obligated to pretend they don’t exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Girl twerks and is as dumb as a brick? You don’t get to point out that she’s a dumb slut, because she decides what she is. Girl is ugly as sin but is a rocket scientist? You don’t get to praise her intellect but suggest that she work out. And God help you if you suggest what a woman
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be praised for, because you can never look down on them for their shortcomings.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s what modern feminism is about. Women are flawless, men are not allowed to question this. Women control the discussion, men are only to hold views and express opinions about women that women have allowed them to hold. We live in a matriarchy. Women are in a class that cannot be criticized, questioned, or attacked in any way, and anything a woman does, no matter how trivial or mundane, is praised as an accomplishment of the gods.

       <strong>
        5th century BC:
       </strong>
       Roman civilization is a a strong patriarchy, fathers are liable for the actions of their wife and children, and have absolute authority over the family (including the power of life and death)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1st century BC:
       </strong>
       Roman civilization blossoms into the most powerful and advanced civilization in the world. Material wealth is astounding, citizens (i.e.: non slaves) do not need to work. They have running water, baths and import spices from thousands of miles away. The Romans enjoy the arts and philosophy; they know and appreciate republicanism, commerce, science, human rights, animal rights, children rights and women become emancipated. No-fault divorce is enacted, and quickly becomes popular by the end of the century.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1-2 century AD:
       </strong>
       The family unit is destroyed. Men refuse to marry and the government tries to revive marriage with a “bachelor tax,” to no avail. Children are growing up without fathers. Roman women show little interest in raising their own children and frequently use nannies. The wealth and power of women grows very fast, while men become increasingly demotivated and engage in prostitution and vice. Prostitution and homosexuality become widespread.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3-4 century AD:
       </strong>
       A moral and demographic collapse takes place. Roman population declines due to below replacement level birth rates. Vice and massive corruption are rampant, while the new-born “catholic” religion is gaining power (it becomes the religion of the Empire in 380 AD). There is extreme economic, political, and military instability–there are 25 successive emperors in half a century (many end up assassinated), the Empire is ungovernable and on the brink of civil war.

        Here’s the process:
       </li>
       <li>
        Force women into degrees they don’t want using affirmative action.
       </li>
       <li>
        Force companies to hire the additional women, who have poor scores due to the mismatch effect and their comparative lack of motivation.
       </li>
       <li>
        Force healthcare companies to pay for the psychiatric diseases of these women as they go through life constantly being patronized and coddled.
       </li>
       <li>
        Force companies not to offshore to India to escape the ridiculous cycle of defeated idealism.
       </li>
       <li>
        Nudge women away from childbirth and into the workforce to pay for the declining economy as a result of the previous steps.
       </li>
       <li>
        Encourage immigration and push for illegal immigrants to be given citizenship in order to make up the deficit of births.
       </li>
       <li>
        Force different cultural groups not to fight in order to keep illegal immigrants in the country.
       </li>
       <li>
        Force population to give up guns in order to cut down intercultural violence due to close proximity.
       </li>
       <li>
        Declare that, as women have greater mental illness levels, lower pay, lower graduation rates, lower levels of trust in the workforce, and declining happiness, more government control is needed to equalize the situation.
       </li>
       <li>
        Declare that institutionalized racism is driving apart cultural groups and that more government funding and greater diversity are needed to stop racial violence.

       As a woman who gets daily
       <em>
        UNWANTED
       </em>
       verbal, emotional and physical sexual advances, I formally say to you all, fuck you very much. If I am hot and wear shorts and a tank top, I'm asking for it. If I want to wear an unpadded bra because it's fucking hot, I'm asking for it. If I speak to a man, I'm asking for it. If I choose not to speak to a man, I'm a frigid bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop thinking with your dick, and relate to women on a personal level, instead of physical attraction, and I'm sure you'll find a woman of integrity who is desperately seeking a man of character.

       I ridicule and humiliate them when they ask me if I use a vibrator in public conversations. When they sneak thier hands onto my arms, neck or hair. When they offer a hug to smash thier genitals against me. Ask some women in your life what they endure so as "not to be rude or difficult"...

       It seems you have some pent-up aggression and would like to control men as to never make a mistake, not have external genitalia, and erase the idea of sex from their minds. Of course, you would make it appear that men are in the wrong for expressing their feelings.

       Poor boys, getting their panties in a knot again
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the same when the Pill was introduced
      </p>
      <p>
       Gone was what mouth-breathers believed was their POWAH.  The powah to spit out DNA, zip up, walk away whistling, knowing they'd destroyed another woman's life.  See how far she gets now, with a kid in tow.  See what sort of life she'll have now as an unwed mother.  Fucked her good.  Ah, life's great as a man (as a loser who'd do nothing other than put small people on the planet before running away)
      </p>
      <p>
       Along came the Pill.  Woman had control over their lives.  And men were outraged. Men raged and frothed.  They couldn't 'fix' that uppity wife who'd had enough of his drinking, whoring, gambling and stained underwear.  They couldn't make her pregnant any more.  That woman had finally gained control over her reproductive life.  Men had lost their thousands of years long ace-card.  And men were bitter
      </p>
      <p>
       I predicted it and it happened.  Once men couldn't destroy women's lives, they stopped pretending to remotely enjoy women and opted for their secret vice ----- other men.  Suddenly thousands of men decided they were gay after all.  The equivalent of taking their bat and flouncing off the field
      </p>
      <p>
       Misogyny is of the Debil.  And misogyny is still whining and pouting, decades after the Pill liberated women from slobs whose ONLY 'achievement' was to put on the planet children they had no intention of adequately parenting.  Misogyny reaches hysteria pitch when courts demand that absentee 'fathers' financially support those children
      </p>
      <p>
       Shape up guys.  You ran the roost for way too long.  It all caught up with you
      </p>
      <p>
       You enjoyed dishing it out.  But you can't take it.  You only want to play when the deck's tilted in your favour.  Too bad
      </p>
      <p>
       and by the way, the OP is hysterically funny.  'Usernamesneedmorecha' on the other hand sounds as if someone's gone way off the deep end and humour lacking, e.g., 'The Patriarchy
       <em>
        never portrayed women in any negative light
       </em>
       ???   Too much.  'Usernamesneedmorecha' needs at least a basic education with emphasis on history, obviously

       Your analysis reads like bigotry.  The blame men for everything ideology doesn't pass the smell test.  The reality is that both men and women have suffered from the social designs they've allowed to exist.  The people who have historically benefited are quite small in number, and they're of both genders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women are currently 4-5 times more likely to pass their genes on.  In times past it was double and triple that figure.  If you consider reproduction to be one of main motivational drivers for humans (eg. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs), males have been quite unrewarded.  The genetic record does not lie. Source:
       <a href="https://psmag.com/8-000-years-ago-17-women-reproduced-for-every-one-man-6d41445ae73d#.2pydij1tu">
        https://psmag.com/8-000-years-ago-17-women-reproduced-for-every-one-man-6d41445ae73d#.2pydij1tu
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's a reason why men were historically disposable and, generally speaking, had lower quality of life than women.  Even today, according to the UN, the quality of life of women exceeds that of men in every single country, with the only exceptions being active war zones.  That includes closed and patriarchal societies too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can keep on blaming males for all this stuff.  Blame men for having kids, even though it takes 9 months to gestate (plenty of time to terminate), and effective, non-damaging abortive techniques have been around in most cultures for a long time.  But of course it's the man's fault pregnancy happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for men deciding they were gay, you'll note that gay culture essentially exploded in the 70s, and this happened AFTER no fault divorce, and general reproductive rights.   But blame that on men not enjoying the company of women, instead of say, structural social reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, you're a fucking gem.
