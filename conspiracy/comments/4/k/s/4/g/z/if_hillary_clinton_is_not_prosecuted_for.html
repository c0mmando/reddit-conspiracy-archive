       This shit about having their cake and eating it too.  That's what burns me up.  We have laws for a reason.  Her lawbreaking put america at big risk and I can prove she knew what she was doing.

       Yep. Speeding is a crime because it endangers public safety right?

       Ever been to jail for speeding? Or do you pay a stealth tax and you're off the hook?

       one way i can see them doing exactly this is keeping her trial secret and then burying the ruling under national security classification.

       The law serves power.  Kings remain Kings, and peasants peasants.  Just because the King can do as he pleases, doesn't mean you don't have to do as you're told.  Law is an illusion if you have either too much or too little power.  The King can kill people in broad daylight, the peasant gets shot for crossing the street.

       We can get to hillary when bush and those in power with him get investigated for the Iraq war and 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       What a fucked up country this is where people are whining about emails on a server and investigating for longer than anything else 4 americans dying in hostile territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But, but, she had her emails on a server she shouldn't have! This must be beat on for years! No one cares about wars, trillions of dollars spent, 9/11, or the thousands killed/maimed/injured/etc from Iraq. Pffft, the real story is some emails!"

      <p>
       We are so fucked on priorities it isn't even funny.

       Probably falls under prosecutorial discretion, so no.

      <p>
       Imagine a speeding ticket. Just because a cop decides not to give it to one person doesn't mean everyone is off the hook for speeding. It's like a lite version of criminal court. No prosecution =/= no law.

       Police are allowed to speed because it's their job.  Hilllary is not allowed to speed because it's not.  Similarly, she has to follow rules of state secrets.  Just like the secret service and anyone else in the military or government.

       But I get what you mean that the law is a joke.  It would only be fair if the courts were run by a macintosh computer instead because it would treat everyone the same.

       Nooo, I'm not talking about police speeding. I'm talking about police pulling someone over for speeding, but deciding not to give them a ticket. It's common in all levels of law. Not saying it's okay - just saying it happens.

       I think there would have to be a legal ruling for it to set precedent. Go to trial and find her guilty/not guilty for whatever she would be charged with. From there the Snowdens who commit similar crimes could be charged/not charged with their crime if it were the same type situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Hilary were charged with leaking secrets and found not guilty, in theory if Snowden were charged under the same crime he could use her precedent as an argument unless there's something different he did that would not be considered the same circumstances she was under.

       No, that's not how precedent works.  You can't have a precedent without a court decision being made.  A decision from the Justice Dept. not to press charges will obviously prevent the case from being heard before a court, and will thus prevent any precedent from being established.  Prosecutors at all levels have very broad discretion who to charge and with what crime.  So in this case, a decision not to charge wouldn't place and new restrictions or obligations on when prosecutors can charge.

       It doesn't.  A legal precedent requires charges to be laid and for her to be found not guilty, or acquitted.  Not charging doesn't change the law.  In fact, the very act of quietly agreeing to recompense without charges is a way companies avoid creating laws that may affect them.  This is obviously not the best strategy in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is still not clear if she will be charge, much less if she actually committed a crime (though many here think she did.).  In fact we should as good American's assume her innocence.  lol.  Okay that went too far.

       Then why hasn't he done so already?  When Ford pardoned Nixon, Nixon hadn't even made it to a trial yet; the pardon was for any actions he MIGHT have committed and was a pretty blanket coverage.  If Obama was planning on the same, why not already have it done then?  It's a lame-duck Presidency, not like he has to worry about reelection.

       I think he is waiting on the FBI to make the next move.  If the FBI indicts her, I think he will issue the pardon to keep it out of the courts and keep her on the pre-established path to be his replacement.  I imagine there is also a lot of pressure on the FBI from the executive branch to NOT indict her.

       Must have missed where she was accused of hacking anything. I thought the issue was that she used a private email server for official purposes and had secret documents on it. Also wasn't the president set when the top used private email servers to conduct government business.

       She didn't hack.  I doubt she knows how to do much technical stuff.  But what she did do was demanded they remove passwords and security features on her blackberry so she could speak 'off the record', and battled the secret service over it.  She also had her own private email service specifically so she could conduct communication 'off the record' or privately or specifically, so that the us government would not be privy to her conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, if you read up on Hillary, you find she knows exactly what she's doing.  There is no 'coyness' or 'childish demands' or even 'feigning technical inadequacies'.  This is about her trying to hide shit.  This is about her trying to break the law or do 'questionable things' behind the back of the watchful eye of sauron (CIA/NSA)
      </p>
      <p>
       WHen she and Bill were in the white house, she would frequently have them sweep for bugs, much more than any other former first lady.  She was very privacy oriented, and she dismissed the secret service guarding their door and demanded they remain down the hall in another quarters, so she and Bill could have sometimes very embarrassingly loud catfights with each other.  She didn't want them overhearing anything, like their plans for world destruction for example, or dibs on the next 8 yr old.
      </p>
      <p>
       She demanded high security protocols and was absolutely paranoid, according to many insiders who worked directly with her, as well as her security detail both as first lady and as senator and secretary of state.  She is very difficult to work with and demands perfection and many have said, "hillary clinton does not make mistakes".  Ok, so she's paranoid miss perfect who demands perfect privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point here is that she broke the law, we know it, and she did it with the willful intention of obstructing justice and obstructing the government's operation, and she put state secrets at risk--no one knows if those secrets were accessed, but certainly her blackberry and her server would be a very high target for hackers so I would say the possibility of someone exfiltrating state secrets from her unsecured devices is 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was almost as if she removed the security specifically so that those state secrets
       <em>
        could be removed
       </em>
       from her device.  After all, we have a corroborated characterization of Clinton and factual activities that demonstrate that she knew very well the importance of security protocols, so to remove them is a clue that she intentionally wanted them removed and so the question then is why?  It's not for convenience--she did many inconvenient things in the name of security in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the fact she's unpunished for this means that this particular rule of law is unenforceable, and if it's unenforceable for her now (without any special privilege) then it's unenforceable for any citizen of the US.
