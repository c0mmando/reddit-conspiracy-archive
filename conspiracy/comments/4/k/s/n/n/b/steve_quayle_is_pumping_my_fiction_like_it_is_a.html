        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-05-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Gonteekwa.html">Gonteekwa</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is Christian Nephilim specialist Steve Quayle talking about my website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTn4DhW_L4g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1448">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTn4DhW_L4g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1448</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m writing a horror novel featuring a werewolf named THE GONTEEKWA. I chose to bury the origins of the spirit of the werewolf in christian mythology rather than in full-moons and silver bullets. In fact, I chose the post-flood era where Moses takes out the last giant walking the face of the earth named Og. Here it is: </p>

<p><a href="http://thelostbookofkingog.com/">http://thelostbookofkingog.com/</a></p>

<p>Understand that I am no longer a Christian, but I was, and I studied the bible hard. I am using my past studies to fuel my horror story which is a little more cerebral than jump-scares and torture porn. I&#39;m going gothic. The profanity is minimal. Perhaps that is how I snagged this man? The truth of the matter is that I wasn&#39;t even looking for him. I wasn&#39;t looking for anyone. I am just trying to get my sorry ass PUBLISHED.</p>

<p>In late March, I activated the Lost Book of King Og website. That was when the fun began. Since mid-April Nephilim and Rephaim conspiracy theorists have been all over it.</p>

<p>Next thing I know, Steve Quayle is on Tom Horn&#39;s TRUNEWS podcast saying that the vatican has found King Og&#39;s Lost Book. Here is the episode:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trunews.com/trunews-041916-tom-horn-steve-quayle-biblical-giants/">http://www.trunews.com/trunews-041916-tom-horn-steve-quayle-biblical-giants/</a></p>

<p>Last week, Steve Quayle was in the Jim Bakker show (disgraced televangelist - Wikipedia him, its comedy) talking about THE LOST BOOK OF KING OG again. Shopping it like it was fact. The link that I enclosed at the top of this post (or wherever the live link went) is right at the point where he starts selling THE LOST BOOK OF KING OG as truth.</p>

<p>I have all of the links to help you comprehend this in one blog post, if you don&#39;t quite get the hustle:</p>

<p><a href="http://peterdemmon.blogspot.com/2016/05/steve-quayle-and-lost-book-of-king-og.html">http://peterdemmon.blogspot.com/2016/05/steve-quayle-and-lost-book-of-king-og.html</a></p>

<p>The stuff is hilarious and horrifying. All Steve Quayle needed to do was track me down and hit me up. Instead, he just shops it as fact.</p>

<p>I will admit that the website that I put together looks good. I also admit that I keep the whole thing at a cryptic level, because that is how the story is being written. The Vatican plays a sizable part in the novel. But seriously, a true researcher asks questions and RESEARCHES.</p>

<p>June 11/2016 Edit</p>

<p>Here is a link to the vid on Jimmy Bakker&#39;s site. I sent them an email telling them that there was heresy in the video. They sent me an email back thanking me for my donation (?). <a href="https://jimbakkershow.com/video/days-noah-almost-upon-us-day-3/">https://jimbakkershow.com/video/days-noah-almost-upon-us-day-3/</a></p>

<p>The story has been picked up by right wing christian media observers: <a href="https://trackingmeroz.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/steve-quayle-is-pumping-my-fiction-like-its-a-fact-claims-author-peter-demmon/comment-page-1/">https://trackingmeroz.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/steve-quayle-is-pumping-my-fiction-like-its-a-fact-claims-author-peter-demmon/comment-page-1/</a></p>

<p>I have avid hoax-debunker Jason Colavito on the case: <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/steve-quayle-accepts-a-hoax-as-real-while-j-hutton-pulitzer-remains-trapped-in-the-1960s">http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/steve-quayle-accepts-a-hoax-as-real-while-j-hutton-pulitzer-remains-trapped-in-the-1960s</a></p>

<p>Jason Colavito was the first to notice that Steve Quayle was shopping THE LOST BOOK OF KING OG as fact in this article here: <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/nephilim-theorists-embrace-hoax-text-as-proof-vatican-is-suppressing-lost-books-written-by-giants">http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/nephilim-theorists-embrace-hoax-text-as-proof-vatican-is-suppressing-lost-books-written-by-giants</a></p>

<p>There are also several &quot;indifferent sites&quot; that shop the finding of the LOST BOOK OF KING OG, but do not outwardly say it is fact or fiction. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><a href="https://wearetherealhebrews.com/2016/04/06/writings-by-ancient-rephaim-found-the-lost-book-of-king-og/">https://wearetherealhebrews.com/2016/04/06/writings-by-ancient-rephaim-found-the-lost-book-of-king-og/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://jcourt.net/the-lost-book-of-king-og-the-giant-found/">http://jcourt.net/the-lost-book-of-king-og-the-giant-found/</a></p>

<p>At the end of the day, this is the page that captured my interest the most. The comments are classic. They are a mix between balanced believers, non-believers and absolute nutjobs: <a href="https://remnantofgiants.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/lost-book-of-king-og/">https://remnantofgiants.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/lost-book-of-king-og/</a></p>

<p>This entire page all has to do with the generation of this piece of fiction right here:</p>

<p><a href="http://gonteekwa.com/">http://gonteekwa.com/</a></p>

<p>The Gonteekwa story itself is a whole other ball of wax. I was born under the shadow of a werewolf. The blog entry here clears it all up: <a href="http://peterdemmon.blogspot.com/2016/01/wwwgonteekwacom.html">http://peterdemmon.blogspot.com/2016/01/wwwgonteekwacom.html</a></p>

<p>King Og is in the bible, Deut 3:11, and they refer to him being a giant, so what am I missing here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amusement is the reaction. Not butthurt. If I was a Christian and learned that this guy was pumping fiction as Christian fact, I would be butthurt. I&#39;m trying to shine the spotlight on a false prophet here. It really sounds like that bugs you though. If you are a Christian who has been deceived by this man, you really should be offended. It seems that you are coming from a different direction, and I don&#39;t really comprehend it.</p>
