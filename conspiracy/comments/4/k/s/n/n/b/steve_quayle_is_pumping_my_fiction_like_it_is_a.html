       Here is Christian Nephilim specialist Steve Quayle talking about my website:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTn4DhW_L4g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1448">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTn4DhW_L4g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1448
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm writing a horror novel featuring a werewolf named THE GONTEEKWA. I chose to bury the origins of the spirit of the werewolf in christian mythology rather than in full-moons and silver bullets. In fact, I chose the post-flood era where Moses takes out the last giant walking the face of the earth named Og. Here it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://thelostbookofkingog.com/">
        http://thelostbookofkingog.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand that I am no longer a Christian, but I was, and I studied the bible hard. I am using my past studies to fuel my horror story which is a little more cerebral than jump-scares and torture porn. I'm going gothic. The profanity is minimal. Perhaps that is how I snagged this man? The truth of the matter is that I wasn't even looking for him. I wasn't looking for anyone. I am just trying to get my sorry ass PUBLISHED.
      </p>
      <p>
       In late March, I activated the Lost Book of King Og website. That was when the fun began. Since mid-April Nephilim and Rephaim conspiracy theorists have been all over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing I know, Steve Quayle is on Tom Horn's TRUNEWS podcast saying that the vatican has found King Og's Lost Book. Here is the episode:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.trunews.com/trunews-041916-tom-horn-steve-quayle-biblical-giants/">
        http://www.trunews.com/trunews-041916-tom-horn-steve-quayle-biblical-giants/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Last week, Steve Quayle was in the Jim Bakker show (disgraced televangelist - Wikipedia him, its comedy) talking about THE LOST BOOK OF KING OG again. Shopping it like it was fact. The link that I enclosed at the top of this post (or wherever the live link went) is right at the point where he starts selling THE LOST BOOK OF KING OG as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have all of the links to help you comprehend this in one blog post, if you don't quite get the hustle:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://peterdemmon.blogspot.com/2016/05/steve-quayle-and-lost-book-of-king-og.html">
        http://peterdemmon.blogspot.com/2016/05/steve-quayle-and-lost-book-of-king-og.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff is hilarious and horrifying. All Steve Quayle needed to do was track me down and hit me up. Instead, he just shops it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit that the website that I put together looks good. I also admit that I keep the whole thing at a cryptic level, because that is how the story is being written. The Vatican plays a sizable part in the novel. But seriously, a true researcher asks questions and RESEARCHES.
      </p>

       June 11/2016 Edit
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link to the vid on Jimmy Bakker's site. I sent them an email telling them that there was heresy in the video. They sent me an email back thanking me for my donation (?).
       <a href="https://jimbakkershow.com/video/days-noah-almost-upon-us-day-3/">
        https://jimbakkershow.com/video/days-noah-almost-upon-us-day-3/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The story has been picked up by right wing christian media observers:
       <a href="https://trackingmeroz.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/steve-quayle-is-pumping-my-fiction-like-its-a-fact-claims-author-peter-demmon/comment-page-1/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I have avid hoax-debunker Jason Colavito on the case:
       <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/steve-quayle-accepts-a-hoax-as-real-while-j-hutton-pulitzer-remains-trapped-in-the-1960s">
        http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/steve-quayle-accepts-a-hoax-as-real-while-j-hutton-pulitzer-remains-trapped-in-the-1960s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Jason Colavito was the first to notice that Steve Quayle was shopping THE LOST BOOK OF KING OG as fact in this article here:
       <a href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/nephilim-theorists-embrace-hoax-text-as-proof-vatican-is-suppressing-lost-books-written-by-giants">
        http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/nephilim-theorists-embrace-hoax-text-as-proof-vatican-is-suppressing-lost-books-written-by-giants
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also several "indifferent sites" that shop the finding of the LOST BOOK OF KING OG, but do not outwardly say it is fact or fiction. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <p>

       At the end of the day, this is the page that captured my interest the most. The comments are classic. They are a mix between balanced believers, non-believers and absolute nutjobs:

       This entire page all has to do with the generation of this piece of fiction right here:

       The Gonteekwa story itself is a whole other ball of wax. I was born under the shadow of a werewolf. The blog entry here clears it all up:

       so he's written 6 books on the subject and you haven't written any...so you're copying him?

       King Og is in the bible, Deut 3:11, and they refer to him being a giant, so what am I missing here?

       I think I understand your criticism. If you are coming from the point that Steve Quayle shops his stuff as fiction. He doesn't. That's the difference. He shops his stuff as fact.

       Amusement is the reaction. Not butthurt. If I was a Christian and learned that this guy was pumping fiction as Christian fact, I would be butthurt. I'm trying to shine the spotlight on a false prophet here. It really sounds like that bugs you though. If you are a Christian who has been deceived by this man, you really should be offended. It seems that you are coming from a different direction, and I don't really comprehend it.
