      <p>
       Posts are constantly getting recycled and reposted, but what about comments? Ever notice how when you enter a popular thread and scroll through it a lot of the comments are just copy/paste responses? Here's an example of what I'm talking about:

       As you scroll through the thread take a look at the usernames. You see a bunch of suspicious usernames pop up over and over again, all upvoted in the 100s. Such as these:

       Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the top comments are copied from a previous reddit thread. This is happening throughout reddit on almost all of the default/largest subreddits. Is reddit archiving popular threads/comments and reposting them at a later date to manipulate its own numbers? I think so.

       Reddit repost bots are accounts that automatically repost submissions that are over 1 year old. This is to circumvent the "other discussions" tab, which only captures reposts from the past year. I archived one of these bots getting caught for future discussion.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/4fhr73/overview_for_jesusenergydrink_7_year_old_account/d2g6nfo">
        You can view that here.
       </a>
       They typically come with a complimentary "comment repost bot" that posts one of the top comments, getting a little more bang for the buck. They are caught in the act all of the time, so this is nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/friends-and-influence-for-sale-online/?_r=0">
        here is an article that goes into some detail about bot farms (not specific to Reddit).

       If interested, a

      </p>

       The assumption is that the accounts build up karma and then are sold on a website such as "RedditSecrets," and finally to a PR/advertising firm. It appears that most people believe an account is "legit" if it has a certain amount of karma and a sufficient age. (I can't link to the websites that sell accounts and upvotes because they are auto-removed, but you can find that in the library.)

       Thanks for the links.  I've done a shit tonne of research on this topic and have concluded that as much as 90% of comments on mainstream articles / subs / sites are shills.  We are drowning in propaganda.

       Shills use 'dispatch services' which basically scour the web looking for production mentions.  One such service is (remove underscores and weird characters).

       They obviously use their own service (which scans reddit) and would shill this very thread.

       I have taken to fighting fire with fire. This is being posted via a simple program I wrote to control multiple accounts. I propose general boycott as the only non-violent tactic we the people can take to both hit the oligarchy the only place they care (the bottom line) AND simultaniously improve our lives (by spending what would have gone to the oligarchy on personal imfrastructure: gardens,etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts were that by appearing as more than 1 person calling for this, I might be able to get the ball rolling. I have been ding this for about 1 year and I honetly do feel like I have made a positive impact introducing the concept of general boycott.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it feels shitty to 'fake' it, but I am not lieing and again... fire with fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another tactic: beat the same drum over and over again. I talk about general boycott 90%+ of the time. I think too many people get caught up in whatever conversation might be happening, when in reality the monetary control is the root cause of almost all the world's strife.

       I was going to comment even before I saw this comment.  But after seeing that, I became even more excited.  I hear your passion and respect your commitment to spreading what you believe to be helpful.  But have you heard of blockchain/cryptocurrency?  If negative or dismissive imagery is conjured up, that's a sign of the propaganda!  A) no central entity controls it b) your wealth cannot be inflated away, c) it cannot be censored.  It's a peer-to-peer system absent of rulers.  Change the rules completely, change money itself!

       I have been thinking the exact same thing. I accept that there is an argument that people are just reposting popular responses for dat karma, but it doesn't feel quite as random as real people would be. It just feels like bots, if that makes sense.

       I think it might be just one guy, read the top comment to link above. Someone caught this manipulating, possibly using bots, but I think the conspiracy side of this is that Reddit doesn't care if it goes on.

       This is how reddit became popular in the first place, by faking stories and traffic. It shouldn't be surprising that they would resort to that tried and true tactic.
