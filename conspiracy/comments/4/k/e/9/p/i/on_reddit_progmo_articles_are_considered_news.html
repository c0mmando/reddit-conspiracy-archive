       There is an entire subreddit devoted to organizing GMO astroturf and vote brigades, it has existed for years.  There are individuals who post comments using sockpuppet accounts to give the illusion of consensus around the issue.  If you haven't already seen it, here is a

       It really bothers me that they can organize and brigade right out there in the open and the admins don't care. But then again, I honestly like them organizing in the open, too. At least they have
       <em>
        a little
       </em>
       transparency, even if it's not true transparency and many Redditors who don't spend a lot of time here are deceived. I find it really interesting, too, because I don't think other "stealth marketers" for different industries active on Reddit do this - which makes me wonder why
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       do it, if they're anticipating some crackdown on the activity at some point in the future and can point to this and say, "Obviously we were obvious, we weren't technically astroturfing."

       This subreddit has preemptively banned many pro 
GMO commentors based on one of many witch hunts people like you have had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one guy runs over 200 propaganda platforms, and his limit on them on Voat, plus yet more on other websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does not allow pro GMO commentary, and he's trolled and witch hunted people like me by making dedicated submissions about us.
      </p>
      <p>
       He very clearly has paid Reddit to advertise his anti GMO creations. His latest is an anti CRISPR subreddit. CRISPR is a technology that not only has the potential to create fantastic ag products, it has the promise to cure people of terrible diseases, yet privileged people campaign against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do a search on Reddit for anti GMO vs pro GMO submissions, the vast vast majority are anti Monsanto/anti GMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the history of this subreddit, it's highly unlikely my comment will remain, most pro GMO commentors are censored in r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect to see more and more deletions of the anti Monsanto/GMO stuff that's been debunked so many times and for so long, people are sick of it.

       who is more likely to be lying via a concentred effort about GMO's?
- big agriculture that spends millions on lobbying each year and tries to kill any law that would simply label the product as such.
- or a massive conspiracy of 1000's of anti-gmo protestors marching with signs and trying to get people to learn more about them.

       90% of the Anti-GMO crowd is just sick of being poisoned with round-up on nearly all their wheat/corn which is basically soaked in it. the same shit half the fucking planet has designated a full blown carcinogen. you know it has to be pretty fucking bad when CHINA!, fucking China, has banned any of these products from being allowed in to their country.

       Pesticides and GMO are different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growing plants with pesticides is mostly because we don't do more GMO. For instance we could take genes from a plant that is resistant to pests naturally and splice that into a commercial crop so we could remove the need to use pesticides.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with GMO is there is a lot of unknown. They have the potential to be used for good such as adding more nutrition and pest resistance. It all depends on how GMO is used that makes the difference, but pesticides and GMO crops are very different things. Pro GMO people tend to agree that presticides are bad and that is a good reason to invest into more GMO to make crops healthier for people.

       no that is 100% bullshit, the majority of GMO crops are engineered to resist round up, because it kills almost everything it touches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corn and wheat being the two worst offenders for this. the GMO pesticide resistance isn't the core problem, its that we are adapting this food so we can soak it in a fucking carcinogen pesticide and not die, just because its the cheaper option. AND then lying about it for decades knowing full well its causing the problems.
      </p>

       people don't have as much of a concern when it comes to frost proofing oranges with fish genes, but the whole monsanto/round-up thing is based on a completely different problem they have created just to save/make more money.

       Those issues are the corporations fault, not the technologies fault. GMO is still a very new field and we have the potential to do a lot of good with it. I won't dismiss the technology just because it has been misused by some people, I will dismiss those corporations.

       but that is the thing any one who is against using round-up and their resistant gmo seeds is being portrayed as anti-science and such which is complete non-sense. most people who are lumped in to being anti-GMO or are pro labeling are not ignorant of the science at all, but these groups focus all their energy on portraying them that way.

       that in my view shows that this has nothing to do with benevolent science and everything to do with corporate greed and control

       The issue is that people are anti GMO and not anti-monsanto and anti-bad GMO use. Being anti GMO can seem anti science as you squash a lot of potential good because of corporate mis-use.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Golden rice is a variety of rice (Oryza sativa) produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of rice.[1] It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A,[2] a deficiency which is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5 each year.

       That is why I find it hard to be anti-GMO. I am very much anti-corporate mis use of the technology but I can't rule out GMO as having a potential good. Add in that climate change will be an issue in the future and we are going to need crops that can handle the rapid changes.

       hmm golden rice... isn't that the one that show negligble benefits and did not actually address the problem in any meaningful way?
      </p>
      <p>
       was it not found to simply be a poor attempt at creating a cheap solution to food extremely poor in nutrition already?
      </p>
      <p>
       i have yet to see a single independent study that shows benefits to golden rice consumption in addressing the vitamin A deficiency. in most cases using half the money that has been wasted on it, would have had a much higher impact in providing proper nutritious food to those people. not to mention would have none of the risks associated with the patented GMO crops infecting neighboring non GMO crops in their vicinity.

       It's there in the wikipedia entry.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2009, results of a clinical trial of golden rice with adult volunteers from the US were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The trial concluded that "beta carotene derived from golden rice is effectively converted to vitamin A in humans".[28] A summary for the American Society for Nutrition suggested that "Golden Rice could probably supply 50% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A from a very modest amount — perhaps a cup — of rice, if consumed daily. This amount is well within the consumption habits of most young children and their mothers".[29]
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well known that beta carotene is found and consumed in many nutritious foods eaten around the world, including fruits and vegetables. Beta carotene in food is a safe source of vitamin A.[30]
       </p>
       <p>
        The Food Allergy Resource and Research Program of the University of Nebraska undertook research in 2006 that showed the proteins from the new genes in golden rice showed no allergenic properties.[31]
       </p>
       <p>
        In August 2012, Tufts University and others published research on golden rice in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showing that the beta carotene produced by golden rice is as effective as beta carotene in oil at providing vitamin A to children.[32] The study stated that "recruitment processes and protocol were approved".[32][33] In 2015 the journal retracted the study, claiming that the researchers had acted unethically when providing Chinese children golden rice without their parents' consent.[34]

       so the study you want to cite, was actually shit canned for its unethical practices regarding human experimentation and a lack of informed consent?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the IRB concluded that there were a number of problems in the way Tang conducted the study. For instance, she provided "insufficient evidence" that the study "was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Review Board in China in accordance with prevailing standards." It also found that some of the consent forms had not been obtained before the trial started, and there was "some evidence that the dates on some consent forms were changed and that other consent forms may have been inappropriately signed."

       There's something weird with golden rice on Reddit and the ag-marketers, you didn't see it mentioned very often, but now it seems to be a major talking point with the response "If you don't like it, you hate poor people, you elitist racist." When it's actually quite the opposite given the articles and sources you're posting here along with this

       exactly, these guys try to treat all this new GMO stuff like its established well known science, at best its rushed, extremely short term studies that only look at specific symptoms and results, use absurdly small sample sizes etc, etc etc, YET.

       but right now we are letting these GMO crops out in to the wild where they are cross pollinating and infecting the non-gmo crops out there.

       nice attempt to spin the demand of proof, show a study that has not been discredited and retracted that shows that it actually does provide any meaningful amount of vitamin A compared to equal costing of non-gmo food sources.

       anti-GMO, as Nogrim explains pretty well below. But the science-light, trolly and abusive way too many pro-GMO marketers argue here (and in other comments sections around the web) cause consumers to want to throw the babies out with your bathwater. (As an example, there's a commenter in this thread calling people who question the success of golden rice "racists" instead of effectively arguing his viewpoint and here - the person talking to you is being downvoted into submission - instead of you having a balanced discussion).

      <p>
       Whether you're wrong or right (on Golden rice, I believe you're wrong, but it's irrelevant to this thread) - It's bad outreach and thoroughly dysfunctional advocacy.

       That jappens with non GMO as much as GMO food. It says nothing about one being worse than the other. In fact if we engineered the RNA we could stop it from turning off the expression to block the bad cholesterol. Without GMO we have no options to stop foods from altering the genes.

Which is why I don't see glaring issues with GMO as a technology, just some of the companies that do GMOs are bad such as making pesticide resistant crops and using pesticides that cause cancer.

       I am not saying GMOs are universally good or bad, just that they have the potential for good so don't dismiss the entire technology due to some bad actors.

       The golden rice stands out to me as dangerous, though, especially given our very limited understanding of RNA transfer.

       And Roundup - I find a lot of GMO advocates are really pesticide/herbicide-supporters in disguise. (I mean - the biggest culprit there is wheat, which isn't even GMO, yet GMO advocates tend to get everything mixed up when discussing Roundup and its components - or deflect and only discuss glyphosate.) It's really wrecking our micro- and macro-biomes (see also our waterways, the Great Coral Reef, etc.) and it kills me that so many are persecuted for trying to research this stuff. We can't get off the planet yet, how is selling more kilos of Roundup more important than our next 100 years survival?

       Worse than roundup. Go into any bee colony collapse thread and they never mention the pesticide neonicotinoids. That shit is literally putting our food ecosystem at risk by killing off bees. People in those threads will talk about anything but the pesticide and blame it for CCD.

       Not all sweet potatoes grow a lot of vitamin A. They don't last as long as rice does and most people do not eat sweet potatoes as a staple of their diet every day like they do with rice. They are looking to GMO sweet potatoes to be able to grow the kind with a lot of vitamin A all over to help place like Africe.

       Syngenta does I believe.  Once again you're full of shit, the countries where they are doing Golden rice trials such as indonesia are some of the largest sweet potato producers.  Most sweet potatoes will easily allow people to meet daily requirements of vitamin A.  And they DO NOT need a GM variety to produce vitamin A.  Proper hybridization and cultivation easily produces sweet potatoes with massive amounts of vitamin A.  GM food is almost exclusively being used as a way of patenting food and controlling agriculture.  I don't doubt that GM technology can have many great uses, but the seed controllers now are parasitic, crony capitalist scum.

       Two of the top three are heavily censored anti GMO propaganda subreddits, and they're basically paid advertisements. The third one has finally moved from the top to the third position, and says: "Gross, Never Eat GMO".

       r/Monsanto, is one of the over 100 anti ag tech propaganda websites on Reddit that are heavily censored. Pro GMO  or pro Monsanto commentary isn't allowed, they're circlejerks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone in here is allowed to comment in pro GMO subreddits, they don't censor or ban for mere dissent. Only those harassing pro GMO commentors(and there are many of them), have ever been banned within the pro GMO or subreddits where actual farmers hang out, as opposed to the thousands of armchair farmers on Reddit who think they know better than farmers what's good for them.

       The commenters from the GMOMyths subreddit pop in with copypasta and rude, nasty comments to users here. I'm not pro-banning, but the derailment and the absence of authentic discussion when we get brigaded by you guys and gals is ridiculous and very "anti-science." It also really doesn't help your mission. I'll be honest - as someone who's not anti-GMO but is anti-specific GMOs and pesticide/herbicides and wants more federal $$ in research, testing, and quality control, I really don't understand how the pro-big-ag "advocates" on reddit actually help the cause - the attacks and low discourse really turns people off and makes them more suspicious of GMO tech than they would otherwise be (it also muddies the water and doesn't help consumers understand the tech - which I assume is one of the tactics Big Ag purposely engages in so that they can smear those who want more, better research).

       Many pro GMO commentors have had to have administration ban Redditors making sockpuppet accounts to harass and troll the pro GMO commentors. I myself got a message to get AIDS and die a couple of days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several pro GMO scientists have received death and bomb threats, and have been harassed though FOIA requests and cherry pickings and misrepresentations of their Emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trials of products are routinely threatened or even vandalized and destroyed, and I'm not commenting about crop products that will be sold to farmers, I'm commenting about products that are part of non profit projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally at least two subreddits created for the sole purpose of harassing and trashing a well respected science communicator and a journalist. They're hate subreddits, and defense of the their two targets isn't allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a liar, but feel free to show a copy and paste of other Redditors leaving you "rude nasty" comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most pro GMO Redditors have been nice considering how many hundreds of times lies are posted and upvoted, like  the oft repeated rumor about terminator seeds, which have never been sold. Look how many times people try to spread that lie here in this subreddit:
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=terminator+seeds+site%3A+reddit.com%2Fr%2Fconspiracy%2F&amp;amp;rlz=1CAACAG_enUS567US571&amp;amp;oq=terminator+seeds+site%3A+reddit.com%2Fr%2Fconspiracy%2F&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.9609j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We get it, you're frustrated because fewer and fewer people are buying into the nonsense. Expect that to get worse as the lies are debunked and claims of harm don't come to fruition years after it was claimed they existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consensus is right there with climate change and vaccines, and that's not going to change.

       You know, I actually had to report one of those guys to the admins for stalking me around Reddit - have never had to do that with ANYONE before on here, and I've been in plenty of arguments on bunches of subjects.

       Notice the accounts had to be banned by administration. Notice my account isn't banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also notice many of the pro GMO commentors are long time Redditors that comment about all sorts of subjects. Several are educators with degrees, several are actual farmers. Compare to you and others that routinely harass, witch hunt, mischaracterize, make false accusations, and lie about pro GMO commentors.
      </p>
      <p>
       No degrees, no science background, no experience farming, just ideologues.

       I'm an 11+ year Redditor and have only had to make new accounts to escape attempts to doxx and harass me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under all of my past accounts and this one, I've never much ventured into this subreddit, I don't waste my time doing that, and I won't anymore.

       I stand by my claim: You guys need to fix your outreach, you're shooting yourselves in the feet. And if you can't read your responses in this thread and understand how toxicly and poorly you're repping what you claim to want to rep, I just don't know.

       Actually kind of wondering if it's the same user I was referring to above, with a different account name. The abusiveness and some of the phrasing in his comment history matches two especially nasty users that have been stalky and verbally abusive to people in GMO threads, and it would make sense that he wants me to "prove it" with the stalking knowing that both accounts in question have been deleted from Reddit.

       They want to shut down authentic conversation about our food supply by any means necessary, as far as I can tell. That particular user, if you look at his comment history, insults and threatens people instead of engaging in actual conversation. I suspect he's on a new account because others have been banned for harassment.

       farmers KNOW glyphos &amp; others are very dangerous, they just cant embrace anti-GMO/anti-herbicides because of their bottom line. they cant fight it, so they dont. if everyone was on a level playing field, things would be different, but it isnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit/addon: this is why trade tariffs/taxes need to be higher on imports. if these shit chemicals were banned, and the problems better researched(ie not by big pesticide/chemical companies) they would find a cheaper, safer solution. the sad part is they wont, cos lobbyists.

       Nobody is fighting glyphosate, it's one of the most heavily researched substances. People like yourself certainly try to spread the rumors, it was the same with anti vax, it's not going to work for the same reason, the science has been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be willing to bet there's 0 mention in your history that herbicides are already and have been already heavily used on non GMO crops. You're just parroting glyphosate fears on the heels of anti ag tech activist nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       We always have to tell you folks herbicides that don't kill your lawn grass have been a thing for decades, herbicide tolerance was already a thing before GMO non selective herbicide tolerance products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crops have long been dried out before harvest with herbicides for uniformity in the harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all OK with alternatives to glyphosate too, which may be on the way, but for now, it's actually way way down the list as far as substances used everyday with the potential to cause harm. Hell, alcohol is more dangerous, including as a potential carcinogen.

       You seriously provide an article that cites studies that were found to be making fraudulent claims? Really sounds like you're wanting gmos to not be safe. Stop being a fraud.

       Oh my bad. Anyway one of the key articles that paper sources was retracted. In summary, he claimed to have found rats developed tumours after two years of eating gmo foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem? That species of rat has an 80% chance of developing tumours after one and a bit years.

        If you follow the mainstream media, you’ll probably only know the Seralini 2012 rat feeding study as “that GMO cancer study that got retracted.” You probably won’t know that the paper has since been republished and Seralini himself has won two court victories defending his work.

       Try reviewing what I had shared.
GMOs can be beneficial, however, there is still much to learn on them and whatnot since they are still new and we don't have big and independent multigenrration studies done by multiple independent teams in the long run. Mainstream health sciences and peer review is a joke.

       20 years isn't long enough.
There are also many studies showing inconclusive and even harm from certain GMO products and whatnot. I doubt Monsanto et al would be the Humanist way to imlement GMOs. There is much potential for GMOs, but they should be studies rigorously. Companies such as Monsanto are owned and operated by certain anti Humanist global elites. Many Monsanto crops require more and more Roundup, which contains the carcinogen, glyphosate.

       And not just glyphosate - marketers like to steer the conversation towards glyphosate so that the dangers of other chemicals in Roundup aren't discussed:

       (Glyphosate's bad, though, and degrades very slowly in low-light conditions like sea and river water - killing valuable plantlife. Not to mention what it does to our gut bacteria - but it's one thing if our stupidity and hubris kills ourselves - it's another to kill the planet.)

       Alternet isn't a reliable source, esp not for science. Try finding some real evidence to support you claims. You have nil so far. Forgot you were the low IQ fuck that fell for 'Monsanto feeds its own employees organic only'. AHAHAHA like how fucking gullible can you be.

       Claiming the entire scientific community is corrupt with out evidence and therefore not recognizing thousands of studies is ignorant.

       Absense of evidence is not evidence of absense. GMO have not been studied long term... Why not lable them like everything else, or are they scared of GMOs being labled... Glyphosate, the main ingrediant in Monsatans Roundup is a carcinogen... Monsanto and other pesticide andor herbicide manufacturors also have other products that are toxic...

       Reddit is corporate owned and run to make a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       GMO's are corporate products made and sold in order to make a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's doubtful that reddit's corporate masters would give equal treatment to both points of view.

       I don't think anyone in here trying to talk about this subject without being attacked and trolled is paid. I can't speak for anyone else, but I'm absolutely not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wonder about the tactics, though - why are so many pro-GMO so rude, abusive, and unable to have a civil and nuanced conversation? It's creepy. I would hope to god they're not being paid, either - because how could a company or non-profit stand behind such shitty outreach? It's actually pushing people away - these people have GOT to be doing it for free, there's no other explanation.

       if they are so safe label the fucking things so i know whether or not im eating them. the fact that you and teh other GMO shills refuse to even let the idea of labeling them enter legislators thoughts gives me a very very clear indication they are NOT as safe as you bots say they are, if they were safe then there is no reason you wouldn't be willing to label them.

       No matter what one thinks of GMOs, you've got to be amused by the fact that your post here is about the fact that you can't have a single fully-featured and even discussion about GMOs and pesticides/herbicides on Reddit without being reported/removed or downvoted and overrun with big ag marketers who want to shut you up if you're not cheerleading...

       Without independent studies I don't believe that they are safe and will try to err on the side of caution.

      <p>
       Even if gmos are safe, the additional pesticides they spray on them are likely carcinogenic and autism causing.

       The Seralini studies have been attacked rather strongly.The majority of science says they are safe and actually you use far fewer chemicals with GMO s .There are lots of independent studies....and the total lack of a disease spike in either farmers or farm animals.

       Seralini is winning in court right now for slander. The majority of advertised science is likely biased propaganda. There haven't been any real safety studies for these things.

       There is a separate set of problems of a patented and controlled food supply, on top of that add the continued push for keeping consumers unaware of how their food is made.

       `See,I just can't buy the whole"scientists are all bought off" theory...too many people to keep too many secrets.I believe the main problem with Seralini'\s study was he used tumor prone rats to prove GMOs caused cancerous tumors.I see a new labeling law going into effect and no attempts do deny people info on what is in their food,unless you are referring to so called GMO label laws...which ,to me,since GMOs are safe is just catering to a non scientific fear....why not label foods for their feng shui or the balance of humors?

       The headlines look rosier than the report, which is much more even-handed about their benefits and drawbacks. They link to a great appendix that points you into the report for specific items you might be interested in.

       Stop using Roundup, it's killing our waterways and our gut microbiota. Stop buying products that rely on it, like conventional wheat and oats, GMO corn/soy/cotton (where possible, this can be impossible) and non-organic produce if you have the means.

       It's quite obvious you're not a super scientist, but thanks for engaging in an Internet discourse in an inauthentic and lowbrow way that makes people further distrust the reputable scientists and researchers out there? Or no thanks, that is.

       How did you find this thread?
      </p>

       I'm especially curious as you're posting comments about how GMOs are great, but that's not the topic of this thread at all. The topic is explicitly talking about how discussion about GMOs is suppressed and derailed (and in fact, your comments here actually do derail the discussion, which is kind of ironic, but that's beside the point).

       the insulin isn't genetically modified, the yeast that produces it is. you're not consuming the yeast your consuming the by product of the modified organism, that the organism was modified to produce.

       The insulin is a GMO product just as corn is a GMO product...so when you use insulin you are not using a genetically modified product?And it is E.Coli not yeast.

       right,one is a product of GMO science and the other is a product of GMO science .Your contention is no remnant of "GMO" is in the insulin.That is simply not true.It is part and parcel a GMO products with all the characteristics of any other GMO product.You are splitting hairs in an attempt to discredit my assertion.

       thats like saying cars and planes are the same because they are products of electricity or combustion engines.
      </p>
      <p>
       one is a by product of a GMO organism, the other IS a genetically modified organism. you don't eat the yeast that made the insulin.
      </p>
      <p>
       using a gmo bacteria to create a chemical, and making an organism we have modified so we can spray it with tons of pesticide and not die are two incredibly different things.  one being safe does not mean the other is at all, and assertions that it does are simply an attempt to misinform and confuse people

       So you contend,that humulin insulin or other gmo produced products have no characteristics or genetic material that is "gmo"? P.S. the whole point of using GMO is the savings in other crop treatments.

       i have not argued anything is wrong with GMO sourced insulin, you are the one who keeps trying to fall back to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       these are two completely different applications for similar technology. stop arguing they are the same fucking thing, you are not adding anything new you're just trying to keep moving goal posts and spinning your talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's painfully obvious you are being paid to try to derail any sort of meaningful debate over the actual safety of these individual projects with your repetitive and non-sensical talking points and deflections.
      </p>
      <p>
       sockpuppets and paid accounts like this are the reason i do not trust GMO's or the Big agri businesses that are pushing them. if they were safe and everything was good for us, they wouldn't need to pay dishonest scum like this to come and try to spin the facts and stifle real debate over the safety and ethics of what they are doing.

       Let Nature run its course. Instead of spending trillions of guns, maybe we should invest that in agriculture.

       Also, nobody knows how GMO's will effect the ecosystem nor its creation in resistant genes in the future. We cannot fight nature

       Claiming the entire scientific community is corrupt with out evidence and therefore not recognizing thousands of studies is ignorant.
