      <p>
       Last year in 2015 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia after a bried stay in a psychiatric ward for hearing voices in my head. The voices would come on and off since late 2012 after I had left college. Over time the voices became progressively louder and louder until a breaking point in 2015 when I could not handle it anymore and I went to the hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       After being prescribed Zyprexa, I had gained almost 105 pounds a common side effect to the drug. The voices seemed to be going away with months of drug usage but would flare up from time to time. For my concern of my health, I stopped taking the antipsychotic in fear that as a side effect I would probably get diabetes, ruin my liver or something else completely worse due to the drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       After about almost a year of discontinuing the drug, the voices would come on and off but not as bad as in the lead up to 2015. If I had to guess, I would say 80-95% of the days leading up to 2016 I heard no voices and had no problems whatsoever. This is long after the last dosage of the antipsychotic and in my mind cannot be attributed to the antipsychotic as it's effects do not last that long after discontinuation of dosage.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the days in this last year in which I did hear voices. I was usually falling asleep or having a hypnagogic hallucination which occurs to me from time to time. Totally unlike what was happening before, which varied from constant screaming of my name, derogatory phrases like "you're stupid" and that's about it. (2012-2015)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tonight I have had one of my worst voice attacks in a long time. I have been hearing a constant barrage of voices yelling my name and it has only occured within the past two hours. The entire day and night up until this point was symptom free.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nature of these attacks has lead me to believe that what I am experiencing is not genuine schizophrenia. I do not have grandeur illusions of myself or any of the other major symptoms. I only hear the voices from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really ticked me off to the idea of mind control or manipulation is that certain phrases can be discerned especially if I meditate or talk back to the voices. If I internalize my own voice I regain some control but usually the voices come back stronger. I was meditating to calm down and relieve anxiety from these attacks when I had heard one of the voices ask me "Are you high? "
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately my suspicions were aroused to these voices being synthetic and man made in nature because although I partake in occasional marijuana usage, I have not consumed cannabis in over three months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this voice, which was previously screaming and yelling my name, asking me in the clearest most discernable language if I was high? Usually the voices sound muddy but sometimes they come through crystal clear, most often when they are screaming my name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for this massive post, but I needed to provide a lengthy background and defense as to why I believe that this phenomenon is not schizophrenia. To recap, it is important to note that almost a year of discontinuing antipsychotic medication the voice phenomenon did not occur on a regular basis. Even while on the  antipsychotic Zyprexa which takes about two weeks to work, the voices while greatly diminished, still persisted. Why then, if this drug is tailor made for this diagnosis leaving me more susceptible to the voices than compared to an entire year of no antipsychotic?
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently hear whistling as if someone is trying to distract me when I am focusing on the voices. The whistle , when it is used in my mind attack, represents to me a frustration on the other party's end. They know that I am focusing on this phenomenon so they try to annoy me with a quick burst of a whistle, the kind a man makes with his lips and not a man-made device.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all I can really think of right now because it's been a very long time since I have had such a vicious attack mentally. If I am schizophrenic, they would say it was because of this phenomenon and the fact that I believe that someone is using a weapon against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am exactly trying to figure out is what is the best evidence that could support my theory? Are there other people our there like me who are experiencing the same things? I have read the extensive patent pages  for mind control technologies but as a layperson the science for the most part is beyond my reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some technologies which are intuitive to understand like the microwave arrays and voice to skull, but I believe that in these extensive lists of patents on Google there are more complex devices which this community may know more about and understand better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done rambling on for now, I hope all of this sounds cohesive and doesn't come off as begging or laziness. I just need people who understand more about the technologies,  the past history of mind control and the government programs which have existed to propagate mind control weaponization.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the conclusive documents? What is the best evidence?

I would like to introduce you to u/curiosity36  . also will offer up my personal theory on who gets targeted....dissidents,objectors, truth speakers and anyone that volunteered for programs they might have to pay out on, and their children.

       Hey. I think it's good that he sought mental health help. That should be the first step. I think a lot of people calling themselves Targeted Individuals could be cured this way. The fact that the drugs affected the voices at all makes me wonder if there isn't another med, or some combination of meds, that would take care of them entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       For solid supporting evidence of mind control programs and psychotronic weaponry I suggest my website, that's what I put it together for:

       Thanks. I agree. They say when you hear hoofbeats don't think of zebras. If meds give some relief, that may be the best avenue to pursue. If you get body control, too, along with electronic possession, or if the voices aren't affected by drugs, then, yes, maybe there is another reason.

       He always says thanks for the shout out.  Plus, I feel as though the more information he can gather the better.  You know, since he's pretty organized and already has a thing going with information.  Also, if someone is being gangstalked or electronic attacked it can give insight to their situation.

       Thank you for sharing.  There is nothing in your statement that comes off as delusions of grandeur and you don't make self-contradictory statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this comment I describe an encounter I had on the street with a woman who claimed to be a victim of a mind control program:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4ia0lr/targeted_individuals_real_victims_of_mind_control/d2wz9ht">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Does your location matter at all?  If you are being targeted by a method that has some limit to its range it would make sense if you did not experience the phenomena if you moved outside the range.  Do you take weekend trips, or even trips outside your country?  Does anything change when you do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you had a dental visit where you received full anesthetic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you suspect any particular individual or organization to be responsible for what you are experiencing?  What makes you think that?

       I do not take weekend trips nor have I left the country in 7 years. I never had full anaesthesia for any surgery or dental procedure. To be honest I don't know who or what agency could be doing this. If I had to shoot in the dark and guess I would think it's the military or one of the intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that they are targeting me for political statements I have made in my past and for the advocation of drug usage.

       Just a quick update, I know I just posted this but since I began typing this the voices have dropped off considerably. I am still hearing them but it is getting fsinter and fainter. I had spent maybe about 10-15 minutes typing the post out on my phone.

       The frequency and lapses in between these mental attacks further leads me to believe that it is not genuinely schizophrenia. As far as I know, the voices have to be persistent for long periods of time in a medical diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to me from 2012-2015 was a gradual build up of occasional outbursts which began faint and grew louder and louder. Before 2015 I would not say that this was a daily thing but for months before I went to the hospital I was being bombarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some other important information that I left out is that when I was working at my job, I never heard any voices what so ever. I am still in college and I never heard voices there in only rare occasions. The vast majority of my attacks tend to be at home when I am doing school work, playing video games or something else. (This was in 2015)
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2016 I never hear the voices outside of home. Not at school and not at work. It only occurs at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if I'm making this unnecessarily long. The voices have calmed down substantially and I finally have a lot more peace of mind right now.

       Another update, 1 day out. Voices have dissipated almost entirely. I have noticed that upon leaving my room to do other tasks the voices stop completely and my mind is silent/ I hear my own thoughts. The voices I am hearing are very faint whispers randomly throughout the day, nothing like the yelling and screaming I was hearing before.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to even discern these voices from the background noise in my room which is a very loud fan. I'm not really an audio expert so I'll try to describe this as best as I can, but the fan mimics the lower gutteral tones of the voices so its hard to distinguish sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am feeling a lot better which is good because I have other work to do at home which would be debilitating if I was hearing that screaming like I did the other night. Like I said, that level of attack has been very rare over the past year so I felt like I needed to report it.

       Yes, there are others like you. And I always have the one impossible question to answer. What would you do to make "them" target you? If you can't think of anything for yourself, then what about those immediate to you? Something you did in the past? If your going to figure out if your actually being targeted or not the first step would be to know your enemy...

       I am going to admit that in 2011-2012, I considered my self  part of the occupy movement and posted alot of political statements on my Facebook account. I had liked pages like "The Anonymous Art of Revolution" because I had felt a connection with the causes Anonymous supported. That page was probably ran by some Indian guy, but I felt that what he posted frequently reflected my views on the corrupt society we live in. To be honest I just wanted to have posts like that on my page to share my edgy political beliefs. I was subscribed to pages like I believe in class warfare and other political pages like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that put me on some government watchlist but I think it might have. I openly promoted illegal drug use but supported it with scientific facts. Cannabis and LSD are drugs that kill no one as drugs but only through people's actions. Alcohol and tobacco kills hundreds of thousands a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all I can really remember posting on that page. Im sure there's alot more stuff but that's the general gist of it

       I just want to say I genuinely am sorry for what your experiencing. It does add up though. Reddit is about as far as I'll go social media wise because FB, IG, Twitter are great tools for agencies to keep tabs. Basically any anti-establishment comment or post, could potentially get you on a "list", on any site but I'm sure the big names are more heavily monitored just because of their potential for exposure. To be quite honest I couldn't see that alone as reason enough to resort to mind control or even voice to skull. Do you have means of traveling? I suggest you leave your immediate area not within your normal pattern to try and figure out what kind of technology could possibly be affecting you. Also try leaving your cell phone in a metal box or similar for a day. Do you have a newer car? Try not using it for a day. You can only be affected where the technology to affect you is present. It's just process of elimination.

       Look man, don't bother with the evidence. People will believe what they want to believe, and most people DON'T believe in this stuff and even if you slapped them across the face with the info they won't believe, unless it happens to them. This stuff is even deeper down the rabbit whole than 9/11 truth so you're going to find even fewer people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal behind this program is obviously to fuck up your life enough so that nobody will believe what you have to say, which they kind of did if you gained 100 pounds, which is why I suspect the voices stopped because they succeeded. Get off the pills, escape overseas to a non NATO aligned country would be my advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the "are you high" voice is very telling, especially as you say you were meditating. This would suggest your brain is being "monitored" somehow, and that possibly the meditation was changing your state of mind somehow the operator monitoring you believed you were using drugs...
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr I believe what you have to say. I don't think you're nuts.

       Check out voice to skull technology, or ELF weapons. Also known as voice of god technology. The most reliable source in my opinion is Corey Goode, but there are many other reliable sources talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easily accessible and overly used technology by the various intelligent agencies. Allows the projection of Ines voice, or messages directly into someone head from a far distance. Long term exposure can result in genuine schizophrenia being developed.

       My brother has been dealing with the exact same symptoms and had carried on the same beliefs as you for 6 years. He has been experiencing voices and high states of anxiety and was labeled schizophrenic while given meds. His belief was that "he was planted with nanobots in his brain and there are people after him to control his brain. That they are implanting thoughts and feelings in his head." Please listen to me when i say this, in the past few weeks he has had a HUGE breakthrough and is finally overcoming the thoughts because he has chosen to accept the fact that his belief was a delusion and these thoughts are just thoughts. He had a very traumatic experience and in order to deal with the stress he created an alternate reality. (A person struggling with a delusion is not aware of it, but continues to believe without clear proof, thats the way delusions work.) It is empowering to accept the fact that these are just thoughts and in letting go of the delusion you can work towards disciplining your mind and gaining control again, it will get easier with time as you get more accustomed to overcoming them. This label of schizophrenia is just a term made by humans to define a high state of emotion and imbalance and in order to better understand them but many of these people overcome it and even eventually wean off their meds when ready. Anyone with enough distress in their life, can have a psychotic break and experience similar symptoms. You can overcome this! Talk therapy with someone who is well informed on what you are going through, a positive support system of people who are empathetic, and consistancy with your health are all key factors in moving forward (stay away from recreational drugs, eat healthy and maintain good sleep habits)! You can work through this, please empower yourself and ignore the thoughts that are dragging you down! You are safer than you feel!

       How do you explain all of the mind control technologies bankrolled by the government? In reality these situations could cut either way. It might be schizophrenia or it might be government control. The U.S. government has actively spied on millions of citizens, experimented on unconsenting and unwilling people and that's only from the public disclosed information we have received through FOIA and declassification.

       Why did the army acknowledge this technology exist and have the audacity to post it on their website? This isn't the best evidence I've found so far but it's good evidence nontheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have called conspiracy theorists insane for stating that the government was monitoring them but with the Snowden revelations in 2013 the thinly veiled house of cards came crumbling down. Now we know for a fact that unfathomable amounts of data has been tracked by the government at the highest levels.

       although the HAARP facility in Alaska is 'down' now there are almost certainly smaller versions out there, and this book goes into some detail about how projecting thoughts/voices can/has been done.

       You, and most of the people on this sub probably don't want to hear this, but go see your psychiatrist.  For "mind control" to be possible, your favorite boogeyman three letter agency would have to be DECADES ahead of academic neuroscience and telecommunications, and be capable of locking onto your moving skull over long ranges with neuron level (sub-micron) precision.  I would love to have that sort of tech to play with, but it just simply isn't plausible right now.  I think for many people, accepting hallucinations as a product of an abnormal brain is far more damaging to the ego than attributing them to some sort of of villain.

       Black budgets and compartmentalization are bad fucking news my friend... academic research is always stunted by funding issues. Black budgets are not. "National Security" need more money.

       A long range MRI is not inconceivable. EM is long range and naturally it consists of both electric and magnetic fields... everything you need for an MRI. Setup a bunch of cell towers (dual purpose tech?), a couple satellites, and you're good.

       I have seen a psychiatrist already but I'm not ready to take more antipsychotic drugs. They have already ruined my body and I am in fear of more serious side effects if I switch to new drugs. This isn't a major problem day to day in my life but rarely throughout the year it gets as bad as it did last night

       I just want to say I genuinely am sorry for what your experiencing. It does add up though. Reddit is about as far as I'll go social media wise because FB, IG, Twitter are great tools for agencies to keep tabs. Basically any anti-establishment comment or post, could potentially get you on a "list", on any site but I'm sure the big names are more heavily monitored just because of their potential for exposure. To be quite honest I couldn't see that alone as reason enough to resort to mind control or even voice to skull. Do you have means of traveling? I suggest you leave your immediate area not within your normal pattern to try and figure out what kind of technology could possibly be affecting you. Also try leaving your cell phone in a metal box or similar for a day. Do you have a newer car? Try not using it for a day. You can only be affected where the technology to affect you is present. It's just process of elimination.
