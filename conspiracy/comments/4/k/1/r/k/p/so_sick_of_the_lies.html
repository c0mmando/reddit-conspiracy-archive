    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve finally given up on NA. LOADS of great info (wouldn&#39;t be successfull propaganda otherwise), but JCD has 0 idea what he is talking about economically. IMHO economically/boycotting is the only way we the people can even send a message to TPTB. They don&#39;t care about protests, they care about bottom lines.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago JCD said &quot;boycott was not true market activity&quot;. What? How are the consumers deciding not to spend their money on a product/service/corp they disagree with not TRUE MARKET ACTIVITY?</p>

<p>JCD also said that &quot;American&#39;s continue to save money, even in the low interest rate environment b/c that is what they are propagandized into doing&quot;. What? The USA is propagandized with BUY BUY BUY SPEND SPEND SPEND, not save...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on Adam&#39;s million CIA/MIC/etc connections that he somehow manages to spin as positive.</p>

<p>The rule is, don&#39;t fight <em>against</em> the things you don&#39;t want. That only holds them in your mind and gives them reality/power inside your self. Instead, fight <em>for</em> the things you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No offense but if you are a &quot;Christian&quot; it&#39;s in name only because based on your response, you know next to nothing about the bible - ANY bible and its teaching on Christianity. If you did you&#39;d know that a TRUE Christian has no need to fight as they are no part of the word. (2Tim 2:24, John 17:14) You would also know that vengeance belongs to God who will very soon reestablish His kingdom over the entire earth and destroy the wicked and its broken and corrupt governments and re-create a paradise. (Dan 2:44, Matt 6:9,10, 19:28, Romans 12:19, 2Thess 1:6-8, Rev 11:18, 16:13,14) So the plan is that we have no need to do anything other than be have faith, take in knowledge and be obedient to God. (John 17:3, Matt 7:21-27) But you already knew all of this right?</p>

Here&#39;s your pm&#39;s to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Solution from Aninoop sent an hour ago</p>

<p>You are delusional. What makes you think God is going to swoop in and save the day when there are billions of people starving and having unspeakable violence inflicted upon them? Those people surely pray and hope every day of their lives but look how well they are doing. Praying and hoping an invisible being in the sky is going to fix everything is exactly what the scumbags in power want you to do. Religion is a perfect form of control and sedation. It is up to the people and the people alone to fix this mess.

<p>re: Solution from Aninoop sent 8 hours ago</p>

<p>No but seriously, do you realize how ridiculous you sound when you tell people on the internet you have a plan to take on the system yet you have to be a Christian that owns a very specific Bible and believe it&#39;s the word of God? I&#39;m a Christian and all, but your requirements to be worthy to hear the plan are just insane. Nobody will listen to you if you go about your plan that way.

<p>I don&#39;t get it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gold has a set of properties that make it <strong>uniquely</strong> suitable to be used as money (both as currency and store of value). </p>

<p>It is pretty much indestructible - it doesn&#39;t corrode or spoil. Gold coins from sunken Roman ships come out completely unaffected after two thousand years in salt water. </p>

<p>It&#39;s highly malleable, so ideal for jewellery and coins.</p>

<p>Its yellow colour is very unusual and makes it immediately identifiable, but its most important feature is its density. Until platinum was discovered in the modern era, nothing known in nature was anywhere near as dense as gold. This meant you could use scales to establish if the &quot;gold coin&quot; being offered to you in exchange for goods or services was actually gold or not. If the coin was too light, you knew it couldn&#39;t be gold. No other metal had this intrinsic means of verification.</p>

<p>Today, a fake gold bar/coin could be made with a combination of platinum and tungsten coverd with a layer of gold and it would fool the scales, but for thousands of years that wouldn&#39;t have possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems to be the consensus amongst previous generations. Now I am pretty sure we have some in our phones and computers so it must have useful properties other than ....shiny....before banksters...there were jewelers....they were good too. Over on history porn you can see some going back to vikingdays. And it looks like new. Who knows....maybe colloidal gold should be a thing.......if silver turns ya blue, maybe that would give us a  whole new tone...I have no idea. I do know people value it. And when ever I find broken pieces...or jewelry people don&#39;t know what they are selling, for five bucks...or less at my local flea. I buy. My gold test kit has paid for itself in spades. Have accumulated about a quarter ounce of broken chains and pieces that are crushed ugly and unwanted....looks like net profit to me. And I remember when it was at under 400 an oz. I wish I had stacked it then.</p>

I am awake as they come but at the same time, wondering what to do next. I&#39;m constantly questioning every news story I see; looking for the ulterior motive.  I keep so much to myself now because everyone who I&#39;m close with other than a few people just accept the news as is and don&#39;t question anything.

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I have come to believe that this will all end the same way it always has throughout history.  That is, with a lot of bloodshed and violence.  We will reach that point when the situation becomes insufferable for the general populace and enough people have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>What will set off this chain of events?  Nobody can say for sure.  It may be a gradual escalation or there may be one big game-changing event.  </p>

<p>It would be nice to think that peaceful change through people holding hands and singing &quot;kumbayah&quot; is possible, but true, lasting, meaningful change from something like that is unlikely.  The main reason being that the government is more than willing to escalate violence in all situations to get its way.  It is willing to have a literal fight to the death for the preservation of its power, so even though the average person does not want that, those in power will force their hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thanks for the comments and upvotes peeps! I knew this sub could alleviate my sadness somewhat.</p>

<p>I DO focus on the change I wish for. My actual job in the world for those powerful pieces of paper, or in my case plastic (Aus) is repairing the Earth and as in every country on this plane, I earn only enough to survive on. There has never been, to my understanding, any real energy or focus on the future or any other life forms we share this reality with. Short term &quot;what&#39;s in it for me&quot; mentality.</p>

<p>I study my environment most keenly and seek understanding of what I can and cannot eat or use to assist my health or sustanance, and have done for a looong time. I willingly and freely share this understanding with anyone receptive! </p>

<p>Gandhi IS a human I have much admiration for and he had a massive impact on humanity in general. His guidelines are my guidelines. No harm, passive resistance and believing that the good will rise to the challenge. The constant war mongering fucken gets to me sometimes!</p>

<p>Sadly I have given up on our species and cannot see or even imagine us taking control from the few. We deserve what we get as a whole. </p>

<p>One thing in my opinion, would force change on humanity. An EMP that stopped everything electronic and pushed us back to resiliance and real community. A community where knowledge is the currency, where co-operation is key to growth and abundance and each of us play a role best suited to our level of understanding.</p>

<p>Thanks for yr voices r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understand this man: for all the problems you read and hear about in the world, look outside your window. Is it the apocalypse out there? Are you scrounging for food and shelter? Are cannibals trying to eat your family? No, you&#39;re on the internet (as am I, as are all of us), probably doing pretty good, relative to the rest of the planet.</p>

<p>So, these massive problems, that are really too big for me or you or anyone not born into a certain class with beaucoup resources to solve...if you can&#39;t do anything about them, is there really a point to getting worked up about them? It&#39;s important to know they&#39;re happening, sure—but largely, they&#39;re happening outside the scope of our little personal lives....is it a good use of your time and resources to spend your days fretting and getting worked-up about it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered this at length and decided the answer is no. All you can do is try to be the best person you can be within your own life: be good to other people, build strong relationships with your family and community if they&#39;re not strong already, &#39;do unto others as you would have them do to you&#39; or w/e....try to live your own life in the way you&#39;d like to see everyone else live theirs. It&#39;s easy to look outward and blame other people for these problems—it&#39;s probably more self-righteously fulfilling to get on a soapbox and rail against all the &#39;sociopaths&#39; and &#39;criminals&#39; that &#39;run the world&#39; —it&#39;s much harder to turn the lens on yourself and ask, &#39;how am I lacking? What do I participate in that hurts the world that I could change? What could I do better?&#39;. In the end, that line of self-interrogation will be much more fruitful for making you happy than educating yourself on how fucked the world is....if you can have a better relationship with your neighbor, that will do more to make YOUR life better than if you know all about how Boko Haram gives little girls clitadectomies, or Vulture Capitalists exploit 3d world countries routinely, or all our politicians are on a power-binge and don&#39;t care about the ppl. Your own world is the most important one there is: do like your boy Ghandi did, try to influence the environment around you with your actions.</p>

<p>We&#39;re human beings: the rub of our nature is that we&#39;re capable of amazing, compassionate, empathetic acts, and we&#39;re also capable of being cruel, violent, petty, jealous, murderous, etc. The only thing YOU can actually change is where you fall on that spectrum.</p>

<p>I used to feel like you did, until I realized worrying about these bigger things was just a distraction from examining/worrying about my own life. Knowledge is power: but compassion and presence and self-understanding are the nuclear bombs that will make you a &#39;sovereignty unto yourself&#39;.</p>

<p>Many blessings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ecclesiastes 1:18 &quot;For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.&quot; (KJV)</p>

<p>Certain things are out of your hands. Your focus must be on the things you can change in your life and worry about your own sphere of influence. The book of Ecclesiastes is attributed to king Solomon who was wise enough to be revered by people of many faiths (ie: Satanist, Christians, Catholics, Jews, Occultist, etc.). This is the man that said there is nothing new under the sun. All of these things whether they be the alien/ufo phenomenon, the corrupt bankers controlling so much in the world, pedophile rings, space travel, or whatever new modern day event have all been done before. Believe it or not God, The Son, and The Holy Spirit are in control of this world. Read the the 4 canonical gospels of the Bible and see how Jesus lived his life for even Solomon knew of the Spirit of Christ centuries before He walked on the earth. </p>

<p>I only say this because I had no religious background whatsoever and wasn&#39;t even a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; by any measure until about 2 years ago. Since then I am currently beating my depression, addiction, and have never felt better than I do today all because God spoke to me just for me to get to know Him. I&#39;ve said too much but just remember you have a Father in Heaven whos love for you transcends time and space with a power so great that it could not be described in words.</p>
