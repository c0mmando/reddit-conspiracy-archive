       <li>
        <p>
         NIST was working with LLNL to test and characterize these sol-gel nano-
thermites, at least as early as 1999 (Tillitson et al 1999).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Forman Williams, the
         <strong>
          lead engineer on NIST’s advisory committee,
         </strong>
         and the most prominent
         <strong>
          engineering expert for Popular Mechanics,
         </strong>
         is an expert on the 
deflagration of energetic materials and the “ignition of porous energetic 
materials”(Margolis and Williams 1996, Telengator et al 1998, Margolis and 
Williams 1999).
         <strong>
          Nano-thermites are porous energetic materials.
         </strong>
         Additionally, 
Williams’ research partner, Stephen Margolis, has presented at conferences where 
nano-energetics are the focus (Gordon 1999).  Some of Williams’ other colleagues at the University of California San Diego, like David J. Benson, are also experts on nano-thermite materials (Choi et al 2005, Jordan et al 2007).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Science Applications International (SAIC) is the DOD and Homeland Security 
contractor that supplied the largest contingent of non-governmental investigators 
to the NIST WTC investigation.
         <strong>
          SAIC has extensive links to nano-thermites, 
developing and judging nano-thermite research proposals for the military and 
other military contractors, and developing and formulating nano-thermites 
directly
         </strong>
         (Army 2008, DOD 2007).  SAIC’s subsidiary Applied Ordnance Technology has done research on the ignition of nanothermites with lasers (Howard et al 2005).   In an interesting coincidence,
         <strong>
          SAIC was the firm that investigated the 1993 WTC bombing
         </strong>
         , boasting that
         <em>
          “After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, our blast analyses produced tangible results that helped identify those responsible (SAIC 2004).”
         </em>
         And the coincidences with this company don’t stop there, as
         <strong>
          SAIC was responsible for evaluating the WTC for terrorism risks in 1986
         </strong>
         as well (CRHC2008).  SAIC is also linked to the late 1990s security upgrades at the WTC, the Rudy Giuliani administration, and the anthrax incidents after 9/11, through former employees Jerome Hauer and Steven Hatfill.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Arden Bement, the metallurgist and expert on fuels and materials who was 
nominated as director of NIST by President George W. Bush in October 2001, 
was former deputy secretary of defense, former director of DARPA’s office of 
materials science, and former executive at TRW.
         <br/>
         Of course,
         <strong>
          DOD and DARPA are both leaders in the production and use of nano-thermites
         </strong>
         (Amptiac 2002, DOD 2005).
         <br/>
         And military and aerospace contractor TRW has had a long collaboration with NASA laboratories in the
         <strong>
          development of energetic materials that are components of advanced propellants, like nano-gelled explosive materials
         </strong>
         (NASA 2001).
         <br/>
         TRW Aeronautics also made fireproof composites and high performance elastomer formulations, and worked with NASA to make energetic aerogels. 
Additionally, Bement was a professor at Purdue and MIT.
         <strong>
          Purdue has a thriving 
program for nano-thermites
         </strong>
         * (Son 2008).  And interestingly, at MIT’s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology, we find
         <strong>
          Martin Z. Bazant, son of notable
          <em>
           “conspiracy debunker”
          </em>
          Zdenek P. Bazant
         </strong>
         (MIT 2008), who does research on granular flows, and the electrochemical interactions of silicon.
         <br/>
         Zdenek P. Bazant is interested in nanocomposites as well (Northwestern 2008), and how they relate to naval warfare (ONR 2008).  MIT was represented at nano-energetics conferences as early as 1998 (Gordon 1998). Bement was also a director at both Battelle and the Lord Corporation.  Battelle
         <strong>
          (where the anthrax was made)
         </strong>
         is an organization of
         <em>
          “experts in fundamental technologies from the five National Laboratories we manage or co-manage for the US DOE.”
         </em>

         Hratch Semerjian, long-time director of NIST’s chemical division, was promoted 
to acting director of NIST in November 2004, and took over the WTC investigation until the completion of the report on the towers.
         <strong>
          Semerjian is closely linked to former NIST employee Michael Zachariah, perhaps the world’s most prominent expert on nano-thermites
         </strong>
         (Zachariah 2008).  In fact, Semerjian and Zachariah co-authored ten papers that focus on nano-particles made of silica,
ceramics and refractory particles.  Zachariah was a major player in the Defense 
University Research Initiative on Nanotechnology (DURINT), a groundbreaking 
research effort for nano-thermites.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          NIST has a long-standing partnership with NASA for the development of new 
nano-thermites and other nano-technological materials.
         </strong>
         In fact, Michael 
Zachariah coordinates this partnership (CNMM 2008).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 2003, two years before the NIST WTC report was issued, the University of 
Maryland College Park (UMCP) and
         <strong>
          NIST signed a memorandum of understanding to develop nano-technologies like nano-thermites
         </strong>
         (NIST 2003).
         <br/>
         Together, NIST and UMCP have done much work on nano-thermites (NM22008).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NIST has their own Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST 2008).
         <br/>
         Additionally,
         <strong>
          NIST’s Reactive Flows Group did research on nanostructured 
materials and high temperature reactions in the mid-nineties
         </strong>
         (NRFG 1996).

        <p>
         Richard Gann,
         <strong>
          who did the final editing of the NIST WTC report,
         </strong>
         managed a 
project called
         <em>
          “Next-Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program”
         </em>
         , both 
before and after 9/11.  Andrzej Miziolek, another of the world’s leading experts 
on nano-thermites (Amptiac 2002), is the author of
         <em>
          “Defense Applications of 
Nanomaterials”
         </em>
         , and
         <strong>
          also worked on Richard Gann’s fire suppression project
         </strong>
         (Gann 2002).
         <br/>
         Gann’s project was sponsored by DOD’s Strategic Environmental 
Research and Development Program (SERDP), an organization that sponsored a 
number of LLNL’s nano-thermite projects (Simpson 2002, Gash et al 2003).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As part of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer, NIST 
partners with the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head (NSWC-IH) on 
Chemical Science and Technology (FLCTT 2008).
         <strong>
          NSWC-IH is probably the 
most prominent US center for nano-thermite technology
         </strong>
         (NSWC 2008).
         <br/>
         In 1999, Jan Puszynski, a scientist working for the DURINT program, helped NSWC-IH design a pilot plant to produce nano-size aluminum powder.  It was reported that
         <em>
          “At that time, this was [the] only reliable source of aluminum nanopowders in the United States”
         </em>
         (SDSMT 2001), however, private companies like Argonide and Technanogy were also known to have such capabilities.

       Also the WTC complex had just been through a construction project to refurbish or reinforcement of anti terror project.  It has been awhile but I remembered reading that either before or after 9/11 as it was a huge issue against coincidence theorist that flooded the narrative.
