        The Ministry of Defence turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public. A government report provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain's biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979

        During the 1950s and '60s, the U.S. Army dusted chosen American cities from coast to coast with a fine powder of a fluorescent, potentially toxic chemical. And now one scientist says, at least in the case of St. Louis, that powder may have contained radioactive material.

        The Oakville blobs. In 1997, it rained gelatinous goo over Oakville Washington causing sickness for that population.

       For anyone who questions the use of the use of chemtrails and geoengineering, I encourage you to watch this video of the Global Chemtrail Summit Live with Press For Truth. It is an 8 hour video, and features various activists and professionals on the subject. It debunks any questions with empirical, scientifically tested, factual information. My favorite speaker starts around 1:24:00.

       Not a great video when the very first point is easily debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my small country, most commercial jets you see are from the same national air carrier. One clear day I had a family member taking a flight north which would take him over my region. I watched the jet on an app then saw it overhead, leaving a contrail as far as the eye can see which lasted for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 'expert' in this video suggests such a thing is laughable behaviour for a contrail. Well... Unless our national airline, of which I have both pilot and engineer friends working there, is spraying chemicals from a jet which also has passengers onboard...he is wrong and delusional in his old age.

       That is exactly what you all suggest when posting pictures of contrails covering the sky and calling them chemtrails.

       If not commercial, air traffic controllers would notice these swarms of military aircraft flying grids across the sky.

       It's evident you didn't read anything posted to this thread. I dont understand your overall point of contention. This issue is not whether or not these systems exist, but what they are being used for. Are you aware more than 40 countries are involved in weather modification today on a regular basis? These are facts. Weather modification has even been extended to the public. You and I purchase and schedule "clear weather" event from many various geoengineering and weather modification companies who extend their services to the public.

       And if you care to do your own research, here is a list of weather modification companies you can purchase services from:
      </p>
      <p>
       North American Weather Consultants;
       <br/>
       Weather Modification, Inc;
       <br/>
       Western Weather Consultants;
       <br/>
       Meteo Systems;
       <br/>
       Atmospherics, Inc;
       <br/>
       International Weather Modification;
       <br/>
       WET International;
       <br/>
       Ice Crystal Engineering (flare provider)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also important to note that not all cloud seeding is done by private companies; much is done by local governments (e.g., SW Texas Rain Enhancement) or utilities (e.g., Snowy Hydro, SMUD) that conduct their own modification events.

       Yes everyone is aware weather modification is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps tell your buddies to stop posting videos of contrails and saying its aircraft spraying chemicals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the link you just posted it shows that cloud seeding is done via bright flares, and is done by turboprop aircraft.

        Just like road flares, which also contain toxic metals, cloud seeding flares have to burn in wet, high-wind conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Besides silver nitrate and potassium iodide (an inorganic salt chemical) cloud seeding flares contain incendiary chemicals and metals that are toxic to living things, including aluminum, strontium and magnesium.

      <p>
       So whatever they're 'spraying' obviously can't be too harmfull.

       Of course these things happened, that isn't what we refute you fucking moron.

       We disagree with the ridiculous theory that all the contrails in the sky are actually Chemtrails, and there is a worldwide conspiracy involving all major airlines who are involved. Even ignoring how ridiculous that is, if you have the slightest clue about aircraft weight and balance you would see such a program would not be possible.

      <p>
       The claim is not that all contrails are chemtrails.  In fact, the claim is actually that chemtrails are noticeably different than contrails.

       The claim is not that it is worldwide, or that it involves every major airline.

       Wrong again.  You can effectively geonengineer with a very small number of aircraft.  If I recall correctly David Keith (one of the leaders in the field) claims you could do it with 6 aircraft.

       Stop trying to make geoengineering sound like some crazy tinfoil conspiracy theory.  It is a serious proposal, and one which has already been demonstrably deployed.  There are numerous geonengineering studies that have been done by NASA (such as SPICE).  You really think the Koch brothers aren't interested in geoengineering technology?  It is the one and only thing that can keep their oil empire from collapsing.
