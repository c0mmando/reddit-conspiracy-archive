<p>The answer is that isis is run by judeo-christians, catholicswho want to rewrite history by destroying culture.   Or people who want to destroy islamic culture or destroy all religions generally.  Any other explanation does not hold water.  It&#39;s similar to how the early christians pillaged and destroyed the gnostic library of alexandria in egypt: several times mind you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an attack on culture when you destroy the work of the culture.  So the MSM would have us believe islamic extremists are destoying islamic culture.  OK!</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not going to miss Ba&#39;al, but I think it&#39;s shameful to blow up historical sites and to try to rewrite history.  All you do it make the  conspiracy subreddit eternally relevant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to know what the elite&#39;s &quot;ideal&quot; narrative of history is, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that the ancient Mesopotamian civilizations are intended to be erased from the record (perhaps to support some alternative idea about the origin of western civilization?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I find especially saddening is the eradication of the Cathars. Roman Catholic crusaders burnt and tortured women and children to death. Isn&#39;t it said that murder is a great sin? The Cathars were pure, did not murder or hurt others, were independent, spent their time ruminating and following Jesus&#39;s path. They believed that lucifer was the God of the physical world and so it was important to rid of all materialism and look within. A very pure philosophy they followed of love, humility and patience and they all were murdered by the crusaders. There is an objective truth to Christianity but the Roman Catholics are far from that truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cathars were gnostics.  Christians have persecuted gnostics forever.  I think there is something valid to it, but to christians it&#39;s a heresy (alchemy -&gt; apotheosis -&gt; &#39;to become god&#39;, etc).  Christians burned the first libraries so they were in the wrong.  </p>

<p>My immediate impression of the ruin of these temples and a middle eastern library was a response to alexandria, but then I thought on it and even that didn&#39;t make sense.  I think other posters are onto something, that it&#39;s the gnostics (freemasons and elite cabal) trying to cover up their junk because of the internet, we&#39;re appropriating their gnosis whether they like it or not.  There&#39;s nothing really fundamentally wrong with this ideology, but when it is used to create elitism, child rape, ongoing war, isis mind control and psychological warfare, negative globalism (caste based technocratic globalism), then it&#39;s rubbish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;early Christians&quot; or the CATHOLIC CHURCH! Do not undermine the Christian faith by using a corrupted institution to define it. </p>

<p>But my theory is that ISIS, which is run by occultist (not Judaeo-Christians by any definition), are destroying historical evidence of their own faith to keep certain truths hidden. The first thing the united states military did when they took Baghdad was loot the museum (fact check me please)! It is all the same thing, they are destroying evidence of the ancient world so that no one can go and come up with their own conclusions of who those ancient people were. </p>

<p>There is a lot of occult power left in Persia and the CIA/Mossad running ISIS want to make sure they monopolize it and keep it out of the hand of scholarly interests so we learn as little about ancient worship as possible. The more they destroy the more knowledge is in the hands of people like Crowley, Helena Blavatsky, and Manly P Hall who have a agenda behind their research. </p>

<p>The new age movement is just another version of the occultist faiths. The more that the masses buy into spiritualism through self and the accepting of spiritual entities taking over their bodies the closer we move towards the end. They are not destroying their history purposely.... This is the controlled media telling you that they&#39;re destroying ancient sites. They could be destroying even more than you know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah except there&#39;s a reason people on here who are supposedly &quot;awake&quot; have little to no reference with what I&#39;m talking about. All they care about is talking about a pagan/occult secret societies instead of understanding what&#39;s going on in them. </p>

<p>It is a religion based on Luciferian worship of the fallen angels which has been disguised by antiquity as &quot;separate&quot; faith&#39;s with similar rituals and beliefs. This is a illogical fallacy that everyone is programmed to believe in order for a one world government/religion to be put into place within the next 20 years by my estimate. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so amazing so many people believe in these Israeli Zionist bankers who secretly worship the devil  but yet don&#39;t think about the full reality of what that means. If there is devil worship by these people who want to control the whole world maybe you should look into what Jesus and God have to say about the whole thing because the Bible touches on all this. If Freemasons believe in a character like Nimrod, who&#39;s rise and fall is discussed in the Bible, then maybe there is some truth in that book that people just aren&#39;t reading. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is there&#39;s a reason my comment is at the bottom of the page with zero up votes or whatever the hell they&#39;re called. Through all my research there is only one conclusion that makes sense but it is the one I rarely see people get to and that is : the God of the Bible is very real as is His Son Jesus and They have all the answers one needs when going through the rabbit hole of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard many things that, as of right now, confuse me. Was Jesus a real person that lived, died, rose and ascended? Was he a creation of Rome itself? Was he an initiate in a cult? Was he a mix of past pagan deities? Was he an allegory for the Sun? Is he a symbol for the Piscean Age? And God....was God the evil one, the selfish one focused on complete power? </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is a worthwhile search. I don&#39;t discount the messages to be found in the Bible. I do think that there are more clues out there from the past than solely the Bible though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point #1.  The Catholics are trying to do better these days.  Their last heretic killing was in the 1800&#39;s.  <a href="http://www.heretication.info/_heretics.html">http://www.heretication.info/_heretics.html</a>    </p>

<p>Point #2.  Muslim radical practitioners believe any graven image is idolatry, and they don&#39;t care if anyone is forcing them, personally, to worship a graven image.  They just want to be in control of what everybody around them does - that&#39;s the whole problem with mixing law and religion, including sharia law.  Muslims are destroying everybody&#39;s culture, not just the Arab artifacts.  The Taliban blew up the Bamiyan Buddhas.<br/>
Isis is most definitely not run by Catholics.  How dare you try to shift blame for the most low-life, atrocious, ignorant, misogynist group to rear its head in recent history?  It&#39;s hard right Muslim extremists, gathering psychopaths from all nations that are doing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ba&#39;al = El = Saturn.  Follow the phonemes - in this case the el sound.</p>

<p>Saturn seems to have had a great influence in many major religions and cultures.  It&#39;s the &quot;god of the bible&quot;, basically.  Its teachings have been consistent but widely misinterpreted and coopted/coerced into power narratives.  It consistently teaches these things: duality (and the math &amp; language stuff that falls from this); the decorator (aka fibonacci, phi, building pattern of life, the trinity); a general critique of hierarchy as a systems design principle, and the requirement for Care in systems design.  There are other common mythologies, archetypes, parables, etc. that come out of the Saturnian school such as Horus/Zeus/Jesus (notice the ooos phoneme).</p>

<p>Anyway, given this one actor, Saturn, has played such a huge role in the development of humanity for the last few thousand years, and its fingerprints are well over the planet, control of its artifacts facilitates narrative control.</p>
