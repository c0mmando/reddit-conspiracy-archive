At least NASA has CGI as pathetic proof, these guys are just guessing some flat dome nonsense. This is my problem with flat earthers.</p>

<p>I believe the NASA discontent and exposee was hitting high places, so they needed to feed that discord through a group that would be discredited. The upside is it is drawing attention to weak evidence for Heliocentrism and its relative theories. Not good for whomever thought they could save NASA with Flat Earth nonsense.</p>

<p>but why was the cameraman off the ship first?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am passing no judgement on the validity of the moon landing.  I am only commenting to say that I thought Neil <em>was</em> actually the first person off the ship, and the footage we see of him is from a camera that is attached to the exterior of the ship.  I may be wrong about this, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How come Neil Armstrong instantly had some profound quote ready?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were on the very first trip to the moon, you wouldn&#39;t be thinking about something awesome to say knowing that your actions were being televised to the entire world?  Not like it was a short, sudden trip.  He had plenty of time to think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the final question, why don&#39;t we have moon tourism yet? We landed on the moon nearly 60 fuckin&#39; years ago. How the fuck do we not have that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It costs an absurd amount of money to put things into space.  The more weight, the more fuel, the more expensive.  Trips to the ISS cost a ton of money, and that doesn&#39;t require nearly as much travel as going to the moon.  Then y&#39;know, you have to come back.  We don&#39;t have a moon tourism industry just like we don&#39;t have a space tourism industry.  It is cost prohibitive.</p>

<p>Again, just to reiterate, I am making no comment on the validity of the moon landing.  Not trying to crap all over you, either.  I believe there are better aspects of the landing to criticize, but the points you bring up require no grand conspiracy.</p>

<p>I would argue that is demonstrably not the case. Firstly, I have seen no evidence of Reddit admins censoring this subreddit, and the mods here would inform users straight away if that were to happen. </p>

<p>Secondly, whilst the mods here do remove some spam and troll posts, as well as abusive and rule-breaking comments, everything the mods do can be monitored because we make our modlogs public. It&#39;s linked in the sidebar, but here it is anyway: </p>

<p><a href="https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy">https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>In addition, /r/ uncensorship lists all posts removed by mods from this sub.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=url%3A%2Fr%2Fconspiracy&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all">https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=url%3A%2Fr%2Fconspiracy&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any other sub as large as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> allows users this much scrutiny of mod actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could argue that for thousands of sites on the web, though. They all want to sell you something or collect your data, usually both. This sub has an interesting user profile and that might give rise to some added scrutiny from time to time, who knows?</p>

<p>Anyway, the Reddit admins have put &quot;the honeypot&quot; out of reach of most users, by making this subreddit non default. This means no posts from this subreddit make it to default front page. I suspect the number of subscribers would be much higher if they did (although it would bring in mainly dross who don&#39;t add value, so it would be a mixed blessing).</p>

<p>Is this the case? My understanding is that these are two separate things, and that very popular posts from non-default subs can still make it to the front page.</p>
