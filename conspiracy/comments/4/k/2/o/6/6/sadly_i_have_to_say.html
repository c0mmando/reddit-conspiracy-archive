       This sub is the first place I check for news stories. How fucked up is that? I am a normal functioning member of society with a mortgage and the first place I go to see what is happening in the world is a conspiracy sub Reddit? I do realize there is a lot of bullshit on here, but it is way easier to spot than on a msm source.

       I wouldn't come here as the primary source because the front and new pages do not change quickly enough. For conservative/conspiracy news and updates, drudge, zero hedge, and GLP update with "what happened today" faster than this shit sub. That said, there's plenty of shit on those three sites too, GLP taking the cake for "crazy people."
      </p>

       I still come here because I get things that aren't posted elsewhere, but consumption has to come from not only independent news sources but also mainstream news.

       Yeah, Its just kind of too big to really get involved and actually network with people I think personally. I mean sure, people figure out things and then a few thousand people get to see it, but its all so filtered and cycled through all this bullshit. Like if everyone acted if we were just everyday fucking people instead of this seemingly select group who think they know something everyone or most of people who live life don't know, or care to even discuss, then its just some fuckin cirkle jerk. Idk.

       It's what we should expect.  In America, we have freedom of the press and freedom of speech.  Media owners can say whatever they want to, and particularly now that the msm is concentrated into the hands of a very small group of people, it's no wonder that all we get from them is what they want us to believe.

       Don't know what happened, but found this funny. Talking head on National News: "there is going to be a lot of conficting details released in the next few days, but we won't know what happened 'til we get teh black box..... We're pretty sure it was a bomb that ISIS planted." (Not a direct quote)

       Easier to spot the bullshit is right on. I wish there were more news sources that were entirely bullshit-free, but conspiracy bullshit is at least entertaining or enlightening. I always think of conspiracy theorizing as a critical thinking exercise. You have to allow ideas to enter into your mind every once and a while, it's unhealthy not to.

       Right on. I like to think about shit like the moon landing being faked. I don't know if it was or not, but why was the cameraman off the ship first? How come Neil Armstrong instantly had some profound quote ready? And the final question, why don't we have moon tourism yet? We landed on the moon nearly 60 fuckin' years ago. How the fuck do we not have that? In the grand scheme of things though, like you said, it's just fun to play with ideas.

       Yes, this is the reason for the flat earth theory. NASA is up to some bullshit, but they want anyone associated with calling NASA liars to be flat earthers.

       I definitely think flat earth is psychological game too, how the fucking do you go from calling out NASA bullshit lies to predicting a flat domed earth in the same breath with Zero evidence. At least NASA has CGI as pathetic proof, these guys are just guessing some flat dome nonsense. This is my problem with flat earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the NASA discontent and exposee was hitting high places, so they needed to feed that discord through a group that would be discredited. The upside is it is drawing attention to weak evidence for Heliocentrism and its relative theories. Not good for whomever thought they could save NASA with Flat Earth nonsense.

       I am passing no judgement on the validity of the moon landing.  I am only commenting to say that I thought Neil
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       actually the first person off the ship, and the footage we see of him is from a camera that is attached to the exterior of the ship.  I may be wrong about this, though.

       If you were on the very first trip to the moon, you wouldn't be thinking about something awesome to say knowing that your actions were being televised to the entire world?  Not like it was a short, sudden trip.  He had plenty of time to think about it.

      <p>
       It costs an absurd amount of money to put things into space.  The more weight, the more fuel, the more expensive.  Trips to the ISS cost a ton of money, and that doesn't require nearly as much travel as going to the moon.  Then y'know, you have to come back.  We don't have a moon tourism industry just like we don't have a space tourism industry.  It is cost prohibitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, just to reiterate, I am making no comment on the validity of the moon landing.  Not trying to crap all over you, either.  I believe there are better aspects of the landing to criticize, but the points you bring up require no grand conspiracy.

       I would argue that is demonstrably not the case. Firstly, I have seen no evidence of Reddit admins censoring this subreddit, and the mods here would inform users straight away if that were to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, whilst the mods here do remove some spam and troll posts, as well as abusive and rule-breaking comments, everything the mods do can be monitored because we make our modlogs public. It's linked in the sidebar, but here it is anyway:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy">
        https://modlog.github.io/#/r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, /r/ uncensorship lists all posts removed by mods from this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/search?q=url%3A%2Fr%2Fconspiracy&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;t=all">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any other sub as large as
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       allows users this much scrutiny of mod actions.

       You could argue that for thousands of sites on the web, though. They all want to sell you something or collect your data, usually both. This sub has an interesting user profile and that might give rise to some added scrutiny from time to time, who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the Reddit admins have put "the honeypot" out of reach of most users, by making this subreddit non default. This means no posts from this subreddit make it to default front page. I suspect the number of subscribers would be much higher if they did (although it would bring in mainly dross who don't add value, so it would be a mixed blessing).

       Is this the case? My understanding is that these are two separate things, and that very popular posts from non-default subs can still make it to the front page.

       Right on. I like to think about shit like the moon landing being faked. I don't know if it was or not, but why was the cameraman off the ship first? How come Neil Armstrong instantly had some profound quote ready? And the final question, why don't we have moon tourism yet? We landed on the moon nearly 60 fuckin' years ago. How the fuck do we not have that? In the grand scheme of things though, like you said, it's just fun to play with ideas.
