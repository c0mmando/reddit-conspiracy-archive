    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he does seem to make a lot of money.  And I never seen him support or donate to other networks.  And many other good networks failed cause of lack of funds.  He seems to want a monopoly on this business and he is very close with the govt, especially FOX news.  He seems to play the neoconservative angle on the conspiracy side.  He almost never interviews liberals, 98% of his guests are conservatives.  I used to listen to him, but now I get really sick or frustrated listening to him.  It&#39;s a good horror show, but majority of his predictions never come true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That he has a certain agenda with a local Texas cultural twang is obvious. On top of that he became his own product too which you or I might not particular like but he reaches certain people where his act might be attractive.</p>

<p>From a german perspective his behavior pattern is obviously strange but I&#39;m not his target audience and so I at least try to separate between packaging and actual message.</p>

<p>IMHO the real problem I have with him over the last few years is the low(er) quality of the product itself.</p>

<p>I think when he decided to increase his presence with several programs running without the actual resources he needed to fill it with a lot fluff&amp;noise which comes with a certain agenda(NRA, capitalism vs. communism, the usual tropes).</p>

<p>He&#39;s like a &quot;news&quot; station with a lack of sources/production who has to wait for the next larger thing to get fuel.</p>

<p>IMHO the only time the show is worth watching when there&#39;s an &quot;event&quot; or when he gets a &quot;good&quot; guest without all the loudness. </p>

<p>I enjoyed the discussion with Billy Corgan some time ago for instance even if he didn&#39;t say anything earth breaking. A real talk without much framing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to defend Jones (because I, too, think he&#39;s a shill). But making an attempt to be perfectly objective, someone could state: The very fact that he hustles and tries to constantly hawk products implies that he&#39;s NOT a shill. Why? Shills get funding. </p>

<p>The fact that he pimps more products than a QVC salesman implies that he&#39;s forced to raise funds himself . . . and seems to argue against secret reservoirs of Deep State cash.</p>

<p>Actual players putting forth a mole would be wary of him losing credibility by doing vulgar hawking. It makes him lose credibility points--and they&#39;d want him to have all the credibility he can muster. So the ideal shill would be someone <em>without</em> a money motive, someone with an almost selfless and religious zeal for the movement. Jones doesn&#39;t come across as Gandhi, he comes across as Sinclair Lewis&#39; corrupt preacher Elmer Gantry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is very focused on making money and selling shit. He&#39;s also very close to the military and is heavily influenced by ex-military types. He also seems to buy into the false divisions created around social issues. And he&#39;s prone to knee jerk reactions and running his mouth before doing research. </p>

<p>Overall he&#39;s just an unreliable source of information and probably does more harm than good, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s controlled by any third party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His show is more of entertainment and not much education.  But that&#39;s the majority of the media though.  It puts people in a fear based mind control and basically neutralizes any opposition.  The crazy theories of his will make your head spin and next thing you know, is that you need an exorcist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liked Millton &quot;Bill&quot; Cooper a lot more than Alex Jones.  Alex Jones is more of an entertainer than anything not to say he hasn&#39;t done anything good like give us an inside look into the Bohemian Grove which really catapulted his fame although since Bohemian Grove he hasn&#39;t really done anything as a journalist his show is almost unwatchable with all the adverts a litte more tolerable with the adverts removed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1CtXVx2Q-tpb9pr24SQbwA?nohtml5=False">This guy puts out his shows with the commercials cut out</a> in case you&#39;re interested.  I&#39;d take a lot of what Alex says with a grain of salt especially when it comes to the fear mongering part which is his biggest crime.  He also seems to have latched onto Christianity a lot more recently and tries to use that to demonize people he doesn&#39;t like by calling them demons/devils etc which I think is very dangerous oh and he cries on air and I fucking hate that shit its nothing but Glen Beck woo woo garbage.  Here&#39;s what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7jJMYJbAKc">Bill Cooper</a> had to say about Alex Jones.

    <div class="md"><p>He wakes people up yes. An alarm clock is only useful for 1 minute once a day. Any more than that and you&#39;ll get a headache.</p>

<p>You are spot on in as much that he never questions Zionism.
He also claims that Arabs run Hollywood.</p>

<p>Right...</p>

<p>Thing is most people he wakes up only wake up to a slumber. They do sweet fa. Nothing. Nada. Zilch.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be. You sap peoples energy and give them that I&#39;m not alone feeling. Then put them on snooze mode.
And repeat. Daily. Ad infinitum. Whilst earning $19.95 a pop for tangy tangerine or whatever he peddles nowadays. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider Jones could already be an intelligence asset without his knowing. All they need to do is tap his wire to see who he&#39;s talking to, working with, getting stories from etc. He can keep tabs on the whole conspiracy community by staying on top of all the 0-day stories and issues and guest speakers. Then, big brother can watch and prod the community from afar with fake news, false flags, limited hangouts, coverups, destroyed evidence, new laws etc.</p>
