       Hey guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook is one of the few stories that didn't catch my attention from reading things afterwards, it actually seemed very fishy to me from the moment it happened.  I've watched a bunch of the videos but I just can't make any sense of the "Whys" or at least what the going theories are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the children ever exist or were they made up like some suggest?  This seems like it is easy to debunk as I would think school age children have numerous ties to a community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were the parents in on it?  I have seen the theories that the parents were aware and the deaths were a hoax.  If it is believed the children actually died, are the parents victims of government intervention then?  Seems odd to me as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, what is the exact motivation?  I understand the feeling that the left wants the catalyst to push extreme gun control, but if this was a conspiracy, I would think an operation of this magnitude would have to go far beyond political ideology.  Is there profit to be had somewhere along?  This might be the part that confuses me the most.

       The fact that there was no footage of a mass exodus of 500+ kids is a red flag. Also, the aerial footage of the swat team converging on the school is actually drill footage from another school just down the road, happening earlier that day. And lastly, FEMA/HSEEP were conducting exercises in the area on the same day raises an eyebrow. Of course there's plenty more facts out there, but these I listed are important

       CNN ran that Rose St Lima drill footage very early as the story was breaking.

      <p>
       how the hell can drones and/or helicopters be there on the scene quicker than fifteen minutes into the event.

       not unless the whole thing is a drill/exercise being sold as a news event.

       CNN did the same on 9/11, they were filming and broadcasting the burning WTC1 from their rooftop literally less than three minutes after the first 'plane' impact.

       Legitimately curious, why is FEMA the bad guy in so many of these conspiracy theories? The only times I hear about them are disasters like Katrina (and even you guys can't blame them for that), and conspiracy theories, so what's the deal?

       Blame them for what? Katrina? No, that was Bush's deregulations resulting in a channel cut through the mouth of the Mississippi River to allow traffic to reach the gulf faster (and to allow a surge from a cat5 to be funneled directly at New Orleans) x weather modification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blame them for the gross mishandling of the situation and putting displaced people in formaldehyde boxes to live in? Absolutely.

       All the big agencies get involved in these things. And this is far from a conspiracy theory anymore... This thing has been blown wide open as a farce. As far as Katrina... There's evidence that that was man-assisted on the weather mod end. This world is one big staged shit pile

       All they would have to do was seed some clouds off of the southern cape in Africa. It appeared to be a sweet spot for starting a Hurricane that year. There were so many named storms that year that they ran out of letters and had to start over again with greek letters. Its pretty evident that they figured something out and went with it crazy that year. I truly believe New Orleans was a target and they were set on throwing out as many bowling balls as they could until one struck the pins. Then a second one right after (Rita) to pick up the spare. Luckily, it guttered out into Galveston.

       600+ children.  You NEVER see even 100 students.  Ever.  For parents, you would expect to see anywhere from 600 to 1200 pqrents.  Again, you'd be pressed to find 100 patents in any of the photographs or videos of the day.  Live video was being recorded from the supposed lock down to well after.

       The official police report contains hundreds of photographs and videos of the school's interior and exterior. It doesn't show any sign that a massacre has taken place there. However, it does show that the school has been in disarray, possibly flooded, and used as a storage facility. Look up the work of Wolfgang Halbig, who did a great job on this particular issue, and is now in the process of a legal action against Sandy Hook / Newtown / Connecticut.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only evidence of children being evacuated are the two iconic photos with a dozen kids (of hundreds, supposedly), being rearranged in between the two photographs. Official full length police dash cam videos do not show this particular group, or any other, despite the fact that the police cars have been parked in a way that would have clear view of the evacuation path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adam Lanza has supposedly killed two dozen people while injuring no one else. Triage tarps have been set up, but remained empty. The school driveway has been quickly blocked by numerous vehicles, with no ambulances coming in or out. The medical examiner's behaviour at the press conference (look up "Wayne Carver press conference" on YouTube) is bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "parents" are in on it, for the money. They have collected millions of dollars in donation money by use of donation websites that, in some cases, have been up and running on the day of, or even before the day of the shooting. A lot of them have moved to the area very recently, accompanied by shady real estate transactions, then moved out in a similar fashion. Very shortly after the event they have been laughing it up with Anderson Cooper, with no sign of grief. Then furiously promoting the anti-gun agenda, which they do to this day. Obama flew some of the parents on Air Force One to promote this agenda. I put parents in quotes because there is no evidence showing that any children have died, or they are indeed the parents of the children that have reportedly died. Look up "Robbie Parker laughing" to see a "grieving" father getting into character the day after the shooting. Look up "David Wheeler sloppy sniper" for evidence of at least one professional actor playing the role of a grieving father and a SWAT team member at Sandy Hook. In the following months there have been lottery winners announced in Connecticut for people bearing the same uncommon last names as some of the families. There's lots more.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Live" coverage had lots of conflicting footage, including footage from a drill at a different school down the road, people literally walking in circles (look up "Sandy Hook walking in circles"). Inordinate amount of black vehicles on the school parking lot, with every single car on the parking lot parked facing in the same direction. Gene Rosen citing the same script almost word for word in dozens of interviews taken later that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as execution of the event, everything points to it being a drill, reported as a live event. As far as motivation, the only thing we see coming out as a result of Sandy Hook is gun control propaganda, and it's coming hard.

       From an EMS stand point on protocol during a Mass Casualty Event, hospital helicopters would be evac'ing out people nonstop.  In any event like this, even if they're unresponsive, holding their guts in or whatever - they're air-lifted immediately to the hospital.  If this was a real event, there would be non-stop shuttling of critical cases.

        As far as execution of the event, everything points to it being a drill, reported as a live event.

      <p>
       Yes, a hyper-real drill in which the fictional victims/perp are given names and a backstory and, in the case of the 20 (made-up) child victims, real world actors are allocated to play the role of fake parents. The extremely unconvincing performances by these fake parents has woken up many people who would otherwise have believed the entire story.

       Like OP said, your links provide a fragmented and contradictory narrative. Some propose the theory that the Sandy Hook school never existed. Some state that it was faked. Some determine that the children were tricked, while others claim that there were no children, only actors.

      <p>
       The shooting at Sandy Hook happened as reported. Evidence that it didn't happen is minimal, fragmented, and contradictory.

       Of all the things that defintly happened, the Sandy hook shooting was one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make theories that the government was behind the shooting or did it or whatever, but saying it didn't happen or that the children were fake or the school never existed just make people who think that look very dumb.

       I think people can challenge that  fact since no one has seen any pictures of any dead bodies. Never. Not one. Not the victims and not the killer. I'm not saying I definitely know it was fake. But fuck In a normal court of law this murder case would be dismissed due to the lack of a fucking dead bodies.

       I've met people who live in sandy hook who knew some of the people that died. Do you have any idea how massive a coverup it would have to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the "it never happened" conspiracy to be true, people I knew for decades would have to have been paid off, and for years before it also! They have kids that used to go to Sandy hook elementary school for god's sake! How could it not exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further more, if the government wanted to fake a shooting to get guns outlawed, why not actually do it? it would be cheaper to just do the shooting, not brainwash people into believing a school and children existed only to fake a shooting years later.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you believe 9/11 truthers, why wouldn't the government do it? If they did 9/11 they obviously have no problem with killing people!
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the things to have a conspiracy theory about, why one that is easily proven wrong?

       You obviously have already made up your mind - and I'm not exactly sure why you care enough to reply to a 100+ day old post - but hey, to each their own. I recommend checking out the well researched articles and video/pic evidence. If you're not convinced then that there is probable cause to doubt the official narrative - well oh well.

       aerial video from drone/helicopter shows searching Newtown police searching and chasing possible perps in the woods, they run past open shed door at the side of the 'school'. (the shed near the generator container)
      </p>
      <p>
       later theres afternoon footage of CT SWAT state troopers forcing open the same shed door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newtown cops were there first on the scene, the only way theres footage of CT state troopers opening that shed is if that footage was filmed a day or whatever earlier.

       The aerial footage was what first grabbed my attention.  I watched live when they took down the camo guy in the woods, then he was never mentioned again.  Thought it was very odd, since that could have been a perfectly reasonable explanation to me (hunter), but found it very suspicious they never spoke of him again

       That's the fascinating part for me.  I find conspiracies very interesting but try to look at them as objectively as possible.  I am happy to hear all the theories, and just as happy to see logical, factual debunking.  In this case there are so many issues that I have yet to see debunked.

       It was an attempted Port Arthur or Dunblane manufactured terror to justify the unconstitutional disarming of law abidig citizens.  As Holder said, Americans need to be brainwashed about guns.  Every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       To see who was involved, look to who the loudest advocators of forcefully disarming citizens.

       Thanks for the info, I've read lightly on Dunblane, never Port Arthur.  Obviously when I got suspicious about Sandy Hook I immediately thought false flag, but it seems like an extraordinary amount of effort just for some political agenda with no obvious profit.  Still confuses me a bit.

       Is there any MKULTRA type conspiracies floating around on this?  I know the general consensus seems to be the Adam Lanza of the media didn't really exist but I am curious about that aspect.

       All the big agencies get involved in these things. And this is far from a conspiracy theory anymore... This thing has been blown wide open as a farce. As far as Katrina... There's evidence that that was man-assisted on the weather mod end. This world is one big staged shit pile

       Blame them for what? Katrina? No, that was Bush's deregulations resulting in a channel cut through the mouth of the Mississippi River to allow traffic to reach the gulf faster (and to allow a surge from a cat5 to be funneled directly at New Orleans) x weather modification.

       Blame them for the gross mishandling of the situation and putting displaced people in formaldehyde boxes to live in? Absolutely.
