This ignited some panic in the establishment, as truth was being leaked to the public about police brutality. In order to counteract this, the FBI infiltrated BLM and propagated extremist and absurd views in order to incite more racism. the FBI actually did this with the Black Panther Party:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case with BLM or not. </p>

<p>But anytime there is a genuine grassroots movement that means well it gets destroyed from the inside and then slandered by the media as its agent provocateurs cause havoc.  It is a tried and true tactic and will be as long as so many people are swayed by the media.  As long as we remain divided by fake social or party lines and demean the other side by name calling like some did with the tea party and occupy movement then we lose.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of people who like to claim the moral high ground. But nobody should be able to claim the moral high ground if they are dismissing thousands of people without understanding their cause and using derogatory words to describe them without understanding them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM are political shock troops designed to silence opposing movements and capture media attention away from thier rising narrative. BLM will prevent whites from awakening by pressuring/oppressing them violently, individually, at the college level, so they don&#39;t get ideas layer on in life and resist. They are a synthetic movement and a rent a mob. And a private intelligence cutout. Right now they are being used as SA style thugs to disrupt the rallies of a right wing outsider, a nationalist that doesn&#39;t agree with a new world order, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>They are the work of and paid for by George Soros. A new world order Zionist slave state insider.</p>

<p>But your theory that it&#39;s a hijacking of a legitimate movement is a good idea. Maybe your right. We know the police at every level, especially fbi, do this. But Webster Tarpley, in his 9-11, synthetic terrorism he says that this tactic can actually be done terrorist groups whose members are not even known! Eventually the original members run off, arrested killed, give up, etc and are demoralized when a complicit media gives attention to Gov. fakes mimicking thier attacks, then hijacking the movement and steering it in a useful direction. This can be done by something as simple as using a faked or copycat attack, yet controlling and manipulating one simple variable - time. The timing of attack itself gives it political power, by generating predictable emoton and action from the people. By provoking fear, a fearful mass will lean to strength, to the right, seeking a protector. If i wanted to turn this country to the right, I could dont by myself. I could fake convert to Islam and launch a terrorist ISIS style attack just before the election. This would ensure a Trump presidency. This tactic only failed once. In Spain. That was a fluke. It worked Everytime before and since. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a similar technique to push to the left, but I don&#39;t know what it is. Maybe mass crowd production and manipulation, riots and rally&#39;s?</p>

<p>The derailing of a a real movement happened for sure with the Tea Party and the left/right mix of the Occult Wall Street movement. Occupy scared them because it was what they fear so much in the US ruling class - for left and right to stop beiliving in that division and going after the rich and guilty together. No longer split and played off each other. That&#39;s why their response was quick and insistent- that it didn&#39;t make sense and had no real purpose or point. That was literaly the media narrative- we don&#39;t understand therefore you aren&#39;t real. Eventually under media manipulation and without the major support needed it petered out. </p>

<p>I think Hamas started out fake and went real, in the other direction. It&#39;s been done to the entire far right. Anything to the right of mainstream republicanism. No one ever mentions it, as it&#39;s considered an acceptable techniuque to use on the far right, whom &quot;we&quot; all know, is &quot;wrong&quot; anyway, and deemed mereley criminals. These are &quot;police work&quot; oppressions and people buy that just fine. But the actions against the left in the 60s-70&#39;s get all the good press on the topic. The KKK is pretty much exclusively an FBI concoction, wholly. And the rest of the far right groups are shared by the FBI, and various Jewish organizations. </p>

<p>ISIS seems to be one too.  hijacked or outright created (time will tell) to be the 2016 Nazis to depopulate the middle east and reverse the shocking and amazing success of Al Qaeda (another suspicious organization) in Iraq. Who would have thought the ragtag group of terrorists would evolve into a state and virtually take over Iraq, with the capability to run it, and achieve thier extreme jihadi lifestyle at the nation level? To the degree that the US had to derail it by creating or at least supporting the likes of ISIS? Must have been desperate. And now we have a greater monster, leading us to provide counterbalance support to...Al Qaeda!!! We simply asked them to change their name! They are now receiving our weapons and support under the name, Al Nusra Front! Crazy world   we live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are great cops out there..sadly most of the good ones are in the minority. Ray Lewis is a prime example. But the culture of go along to get along has allowed for an underlying structural problem. One bad apple can corrupt the whole barrel... And when it is built in that you get punished for speaking truth, then the outcome can&#39;t be good. That is what we are dealing with. The feeling of impotence, and the ability to wield power without consequence. It is very sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM movement was shit to begin with. Seeing as most violent arrests or altercations are with white people. Also the stats say that Mexicans are lumped with white too. </p>

<p>It was the media that hyped this police brutality angle. Look at most of the fatalities in police shooting a suspect its white people. Yet when you watch the news its always black that is shown as innocent. Mike brown got world wide coverage. </p>

<p>Yet when that swat team threw a flash bang into a baby crib and really fucked a kid up (was white) nothing was really shown. Also it was the wrong house. </p>

<p>The media used pics that were years old and at first nothing was said about the store incident. You just saw a pic of a 15yo black kid. </p>

<p>The FBI doesn&#39;t have to do anything because media will shape public ideas so much easier. Police thruout the USA need a leash. That&#39;s evident. But its against people that the war is on. Citizens of the areas in which they patrol. </p>

<p>BLM is just another group to segregate us more. Black people by a large majority have no idea how the government works. They know what they can get from it. </p>

<p>Hell many don&#39;t know you can by seedling plants or seeds with food stamps. I mean how much more benifitial is that then processed foods. That is what I did when I was on them. Also many local butchers take food stamps. </p>

<p>Think about how much further and healthier you can get from things like this. All of the into is there but they go to Walmart like 99.9% of everyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, sometimes the answer is right there in front of us. The white establishment doesn&#39;t want an organization that fights for the civil rights of blacks. It never has. </p>

<p>Black Lives Matter is the Organizational idea of Tupac. Even citing his aunt as one of the main reasons it was formed. Anyone or any group that has tried doing the above has been destroyed. BLM just came at the right time (Obama) just like the Civil Rights Movement came at the perfect time (JFK) but you know, they killed him.</p>

<p>They knew they couldn&#39;t just do the same to Obama, the country would have been in flames. Thus that gave BLM a lot of time to mature.</p>

<p>You gotta wake up man. We are polarized because you hold on to this idea. Red Jews did the slave trade, Red Jews controlled the south. You are upholding the ideas and destruction of the Red Zionist, not white people. Abraham Lincoln even went to war with the south because Britain controlled it.</p>

<p>Interesting. And only 1%, or less, of whites own most the wealth in this country. I am sure that has no impact on the other 99% of people and their wealth.</p>

<p>Not true, Blacks warring with whites &amp; Technology ended slavery</p>

<p>400 years of rape, genocide, torture, mutilation, hanging, good ole boy hunts, extermination of multiple tribes, slavery and underhanded systematic racism in today’s world is not the cause.</p>

<p>Nope, it isn’t. You really don’t want to get into an argument with me on this. Unless, of course, you <strong>enjoy</strong> being even more wrong than you already are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to say, it doesn&#39;t sound like you could win the case in court. There would just be too much evidence against you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many liberals talk of the “debt” which Europeans owe for all sorts of past alleged “wrongs” committed during the Age of Expansion. Leaving the subjective arguments about colonialism aside, as well as whatever wrongs may or may not have been committed five hundred years ago, there is still no justification for the ethnic cleansing or genocide of European people today.</p>

<p>Slavery in the US is a case in point: relentless propaganda claims that white Americans owe a terrible burden of debt to blacks in North America, both morally and financially, for the scourge of slavery up to the time of the American Civil War. The reality is, however, that the first person to legally own a slave in America was the black Angolan Anthony Johnson, who became a tobacco farm owner. By July 1651, Johnson had five black slaves working for him and became the first legally recognized slave owner in America when a Virginia court ruled in his favor in a freedom suit of one of his servants, John Casor. Johnson won the suit and retained Casor as his servant for life, the first true slave in Virginia. In addition, the slave traders who brought blacks to the America’s during the Atlantic Slave Trade did not gather up blacks in Africa by themselves. On the contrary, Africans were the ones to capture their fellows as slaves and then merely sold them on. We’ll leave the matter of who owned the slave markets on both sides of the ocean aside for now. If the “logic” of blaming whites for slavery was consistently applied, then blacks, historically speaking, bear as much–if not more–of the guilt than whites. If that was not enough, the reality is that only a tiny handful of whites in America ever even owned slaves.</p>

<p>According to the 1860 US Census, only 393,967 white households held slaves, or around 8 percent of all American households. All of these facts make it clear that to demand reparations from–or inflict “white guilt” upon–the majority of the modern-day white American population is laughable and would, under normal circumstances, be dismissed as a joke. The Arab slave trade in Africa, by way of comparison, lasted far longer and involved millions more Africans than the transAtlantic slave trade–but somehow there seems to be no similar demand for “reparations” against modern Arab nations or their people.</p>

<p>In any event, the argument of “colonial exploitation,” even if it were valid, as a reason for the current dispossession of European homelands by non-Europeans is fallacious in itself. At some stage of history, almost all nations and all peoples have conquered or exploited other people. African tribes have done it to one another, Semites conquered each other, Chinese, Japanese, American Indians–all people, somewhere, and at some time, have blood on their hands. History is replete with examples of national rights being abused–but the purpose of learning history is not to exact revenge for past wrongs, but to prevent them from happening again.</p>

<p>Finally, if there ever was any such European “colonial debt,” it has already been repaid a million times over simply in terms of how the living standards of the entire world have been improved through European technological gifts and modern foreign aid. If anything, the “debt” is firmly the other way around. It is the rest of the world which owes the European world a mountain of incalculable debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Africa didn&#39;t have the wheel. The fucking wheel. no one there thought of it yet. Think about that.</p>

<p>Or romantic love. Or pacifying and harnessing the power of animals. Capable of architecture In only the form of  mud huts-the same level as that of a beaver, who also makes them. No second story conceived of yet. Music? rythym only.  No means of transportation beyond walking, no. Transport or goods placing items on head. No concept of fractions nor proportions. Only oral history.</p>

<p>Dude, do you want me to go on? It would be painful. Just admit Africans are not capable of what others are. When we realize this, maybe we can really help them. If we just face facts without guilt on our side or shame on thiers, we can install a benevolent system to run things and still find a way to let them have thier own expression of life, without oppression from us, in realms other than politics. Perhaps they can manage business,or maybe that has to be guided too, I don&#39;t know. They should not be oppressed by their own simplicity either, which we should politely not look down on. Africa can have drums and hunts and thier own rythym of life, but it can also have hospitals and electricity, if we help. We have the power to help and not hurt, and we should feel we have the right to step in to do it, as long as the cost is not so great it causes harm at home, Europe. We could have chose closing the chapter on them, to say nicely the thing you think I&#39;m saying, or ignoring them to some more misery they didn&#39;t have to suffer, a million endless, individual tragedies, like easily defeated disease and starvation.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m saying we need to invade Africa, then implement a  global permanent apartheid state between us.</p>

<p>Or we will eventually destroy them, or mix with them and be destroyed, our society brought down somewhere between our levels. </p>

<p>Three choices. Get rid of them. They rid of us (mixing), or we make a nice world for them and maintain both of ours. Which is kicking the can down the road, since it  still allows the possibility for both the first two options, at a later date. But it&#39;s the nicest plan. So it&#39;s more politically realistic. What else will the world do about Africa? Just keep watching and shrugging our shoulders?</p>

<p>Not everyone owned a slave with their own hands, not every Frenchman assassinated Algerian leaders, but every citizen in those countries benefited from the plunder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wasn’t plunder. Wasn’t being used. Wasn’t going to be used. Wasn’t stolen in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nations which suffered colonialism were robbed of their chance to prosper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fucking lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the colonial nations which exist today sit on ill-gotten gains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess we should have blacks and muslims give us reparations, then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think we (as a nation) can really make it up to descendants of slaves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So shut the fuck up about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>every American and European should remember daily the destruction and barbarity of their proud nations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah; we should remember what happened TO us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, what kind of argument is “We don&#39;t have to own up to our nation&#39;s legacy because everyone else is doing it?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A whataboutism that no one said which you are inventing out of nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when was anything fair?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for disproving the need for reparations.</p>

<p>You are very seriously misusing the word &quot;prove&quot;.   If my statement truly and conclusively &quot;proved&quot; your point, I&#39;d be globally famous for finally settling the issue with perfect, indisputable logic. Maybe you meant to say I contradicted myself?   I didn&#39;t and I&#39;ll explain soon,  but I&#39;m too tired now.  You&#39;ll get a proper rebuttal tomorrow morning. </p>

<p>this is 100% accurate, its in a nutshell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So George Soros hires them for what?</p>

<p>If its a legitimate movement, why is the same billionaire that uses rent a mobs and thugs employing them?</p>

<p>To put it as plain as day - Soros spends his billions financing thuggish political grouos to attack his political/business enemies, under cover of their politics, like they have done for Soros through all the &quot;color&quot; revolutions in the middle east, and in a few European countries. BLM do it for him at Trump rallies and college campuses. How do you not see the connection and pattern? Does Soros just love blacks and has a hard on for the plight if an American black guy? Or is there..some other motive? All those paid movements in the color revolutions were part of a CIA playbook on manipulating elections and instigating coups, that looked like a real popular movement, by riding the coat tails of small groups of activists focused on a local injustice. But, this time, you think its the same, only real? This time they promise, they mean it?  Not likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, it was just a result of the useful idiots trying to insert intersectionality and complexifying a movement beyond it&#39;s original message. It happened with Occupy Wall Street, where it slowly became apparent that some people wouldn&#39;t just let you protest big banks, you also had to participate in the progressive stack, unneeded identity politics that left the silent majority silent, and the crazies with more media attention. Eventually, Occupy was no more.</p>

<p>FBI infiltrates everything that threatens the white status quo. ie the profit machine for the 1% plus its minions ie the govt worker class.</p>

<p>remember the FBI collaborated with and protected anti OWS companies/groups, they took no action over planned assassinations of OWS leaders.</p>

<p>Lies, rather. And the establishment is behind BLM, so they wouldn’t be afraid of them.</p>

<p>They made the mistake of importing black slaves. Then they freed them. Then they mixed with them. Then Egypt declined, stabilizing into the Egypt we have today. </p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Look at the facial features in thier  busts. Lots of them. Mark the dates, then put them in order. By the time the thick lips and wide flat noses reached the the ruling class, it was almost over.</p>

<p>Btw, for a real outrage, read even here on reddit what happens to white women, especially blondes for some reason, of any age, including girls, who are foololish enough to vacation, or have parents take them on vacation to Egypt. Basically sexually assaulted constantly. What happened to reporter Lara Logan was not a rare event. Egypt is a shithole.</p>
