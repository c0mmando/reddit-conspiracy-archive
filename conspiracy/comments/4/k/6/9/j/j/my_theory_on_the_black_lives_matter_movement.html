       In my opinion, BLM started out as a legitimate movement with justified concerns regarding police brutality against black Americans. This ignited some panic in the establishment, as truth was being leaked to the public about police brutality. In order to counteract this, the FBI infiltrated BLM and propagated extremist and absurd views in order to incite more racism. the FBI actually did this with the Black Panther Party:

       The FBI has done this with every movement... they had people join black panther's and kill people to ruin them as a hate group. The anti-war movement had the FBI agents grow their hair out and do shitty things to discredit it...

       Came here to post this.  Same exact playbook: use agent provocateurs to discredit the movement and justify the use of violence to shut down protests.  Even though it's public knowledge, this tactic still works like a charm.

       I don't know if that's the case with BLM or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anytime there is a genuine grassroots movement that means well it gets destroyed from the inside and then slandered by the media as its agent provocateurs cause havoc.  It is a tried and true tactic and will be as long as so many people are swayed by the media.  As long as we remain divided by fake social or party lines and demean the other side by name calling like some did with the tea party and occupy movement then we lose.

       There are a lot of people who like to claim the moral high ground. But nobody should be able to claim the moral high ground if they are dismissing thousands of people without understanding their cause and using derogatory words to describe them without understanding them.

       You said this well.....it soems that the people are waking up to it though. And when we chose to engage with other people in a nicer more civilized manner, it creates a better thought process.....remember the revolution with love.......awesome till they got all kocked up.....and the vitriol began. Best we can do is be kind to the screamers, and then disengage until the tone changes.

       BLM are political shock troops designed to silence opposing movements and capture media attention away from thier rising narrative. BLM will prevent whites from awakening by pressuring/oppressing them violently, individually, at the college level, so they don't get ideas layer on in life and resist. They are a synthetic movement and a rent a mob. And a private intelligence cutout. Right now they are being used as SA style thugs to disrupt the rallies of a right wing outsider, a nationalist that doesn't agree with a new world order, Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the work of and paid for by George Soros. A new world order Zionist slave state insider.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your theory that it's a hijacking of a legitimate movement is a good idea. Maybe your right. We know the police at every level, especially fbi, do this. But Webster Tarpley, in his 9-11, synthetic terrorism he says that this tactic can actually be done terrorist groups whose members are not even known! Eventually the original members run off, arrested killed, give up, etc and are demoralized when a complicit media gives attention to Gov. fakes mimicking thier attacks, then hijacking the movement and steering it in a useful direction. This can be done by something as simple as using a faked or copycat attack, yet controlling and manipulating one simple variable - time. The timing of attack itself gives it political power, by generating predictable emoton and action from the people. By provoking fear, a fearful mass will lean to strength, to the right, seeking a protector. If i wanted to turn this country to the right, I could dont by myself. I could fake convert to Islam and launch a terrorist ISIS style attack just before the election. This would ensure a Trump presidency. This tactic only failed once. In Spain. That was a fluke. It worked Everytime before and since. I'm sure there's a similar technique to push to the left, but I don't know what it is. Maybe mass crowd production and manipulation, riots and rally's?
      </p>
      <p>
       The derailing of a a real movement happened for sure with the Tea Party and the left/right mix of the Occult Wall Street movement. Occupy scared them because it was what they fear so much in the US ruling class - for left and right to stop beiliving in that division and going after the rich and guilty together. No longer split and played off each other. That's why their response was quick and insistent- that it didn't make sense and had no real purpose or point. That was literaly the media narrative- we don't understand therefore you aren't real. Eventually under media manipulation and without the major support needed it petered out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Hamas started out fake and went real, in the other direction. It's been done to the entire far right. Anything to the right of mainstream republicanism. No one ever mentions it, as it's considered an acceptable techniuque to use on the far right, whom "we" all know, is "wrong" anyway, and deemed mereley criminals. These are "police work" oppressions and people buy that just fine. But the actions against the left in the 60s-70's get all the good press on the topic. The KKK is pretty much exclusively an FBI concoction, wholly. And the rest of the far right groups are shared by the FBI, and various Jewish organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS seems to be one too.  hijacked or outright created (time will tell) to be the 2016 Nazis to depopulate the middle east and reverse the shocking and amazing success of Al Qaeda (another suspicious organization) in Iraq. Who would have thought the ragtag group of terrorists would evolve into a state and virtually take over Iraq, with the capability to run it, and achieve thier extreme jihadi lifestyle at the nation level? To the degree that the US had to derail it by creating or at least supporting the likes of ISIS? Must have been desperate. And now we have a greater monster, leading us to provide counterbalance support to...Al Qaeda!!! We simply asked them to change their name! They are now receiving our weapons and support under the name, Al Nusra Front! Crazy world   we live in.

       They used the same tactics on the wall street protesters. If you make them look crazy the message gets lost....game over. Their only problem is those things don't go away so you have to do it to the next dummy who raises his head up in protest. Rinse repeat.

       I agree with your post. Primarily because BLM was a huge target of divide and conquer. You don't see BLM protesting out in the streets anymore. They are still active, but not as publicly, which was the whole intent of the divide and conquer strategy

       BLM's whole purpose is to continually push race as a wedge issue to keep everyone distracted from real issues. Much like the Millennial for Prosperity super PAC being a group of affluent geriatrics, BLM is funded by rich white guys playing everyone.

       Fair enough, but at the end of the day these people destroyed cities such as Baltimore. Surely they didn't need to be that drastic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not some racist and I apologise if I come across like one. But I believe in accountability, and the explanation for the sad state of the black community today is a direct cause of liberal welfare policies and the breakdown of the black family IMO.

       Citizens killing other citizens is one thing.

       BLM was addressing the government doing the killing (cops/justice system).

       I am going to say that watching this unfold...and seeing the hate they hot from everywhere, that this was a logically engineered reaction. wrong in every way. But engineered. There was so much bile coming to them on the first day of Protests that I can understand it happening though. And maybe if they didn't have some good points to begin with the KKK wouldn't have had to so aggressively cover-up the misdeeds of those own. So  not right. But very much the result of years of maltreatment by a now outed Klan infested police force.

       There are great cops out there..sadly most of the good ones are in the minority. Ray Lewis is a prime example. But the culture of go along to get along has allowed for an underlying structural problem. One bad apple can corrupt the whole barrel... And when it is built in that you get punished for speaking truth, then the outcome can't be good. That is what we are dealing with. The feeling of impotence, and the ability to wield power without consequence. It is very sad.

       Not this time. BLM's popularity was apparently manufactured by Facebook. It was not an organic movement. There has been no panic in the establishment over this movement.  It is controlled opposition from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see panic in the establishment,  look for how they treat people who want to arm minorities. That causes problems because armed people are free people.

       BLM movement was shit to begin with. Seeing as most violent arrests or altercations are with white people. Also the stats say that Mexicans are lumped with white too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the media that hyped this police brutality angle. Look at most of the fatalities in police shooting a suspect its white people. Yet when you watch the news its always black that is shown as innocent. Mike brown got world wide coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet when that swat team threw a flash bang into a baby crib and really fucked a kid up (was white) nothing was really shown. Also it was the wrong house.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media used pics that were years old and at first nothing was said about the store incident. You just saw a pic of a 15yo black kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI doesn't have to do anything because media will shape public ideas so much easier. Police thruout the USA need a leash. That's evident. But its against people that the war is on. Citizens of the areas in which they patrol.
      </p>
      <p>
       BLM is just another group to segregate us more. Black people by a large majority have no idea how the government works. They know what they can get from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell many don't know you can by seedling plants or seeds with food stamps. I mean how much more benifitial is that then processed foods. That is what I did when I was on them. Also many local butchers take food stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about how much further and healthier you can get from things like this. All of the into is there but they go to Walmart like 99.9% of everyone else.

       No, sometimes the answer is right there in front of us. The white establishment doesn't want an organization that fights for the civil rights of blacks. It never has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black Lives Matter is the Organizational idea of Tupac. Even citing his aunt as one of the main reasons it was formed. Anyone or any group that has tried doing the above has been destroyed. BLM just came at the right time (Obama) just like the Civil Rights Movement came at the perfect time (JFK) but you know, they killed him.
      </p>
      <p>
       They knew they couldn't just do the same to Obama, the country would have been in flames. Thus that gave BLM a lot of time to mature.

       Black lives matter are controlled opposition, they are funded by George soros.
They are here to be a distraction.
Instead of questioning the oligarchy or capitalism they will wheel out their pet Negroes to demand more black people on tv or some inane shit like that.

       You gotta wake up man. We are polarized because you hold on to this idea. Red Jews did the slave trade, Red Jews controlled the south. You are upholding the ideas and destruction of the Red Zionist, not white people. Abraham Lincoln even went to war with the south because Britain controlled it.

       Let's raise the level at which we interact. If we do not rise above and start overlooking our diffences tho overlords win. See, the people of color were blessed with a head start in this one. The power structure was and is clear. Us white folks still in part have a delusion of becoming part of the power structure. Those are the ones we see out there spouting hate. The need to learn from the black community how slavery really worked...on families...on communities...on the soul....cause only then will they get the message that slavery is really still a thing. You and I already know this. ;-)

       Exactly but the hardest part is doing it without allowing the controllers to implement their plan for a global race war which in prophecy, is inevitable it seems.

       It's hard to help people let go of that type of pride, I assume this is why they blamed it all on the white man instead of the controller of the white man.

       I believe we need to maybe use our inner light and let in shine. Noone thinks we can. This will be how we win. We raise our standards. We let our inner light out shine thier floodlights. Set higher standards and raise all. It is indeed an internal spiritual battle, when you are sure in your light it shines on everything around it. Spread it. Namaste. This is on us. let's do it.

       Interesting. And only 1%, or less, of whites own most the wealth in this country. I am sure that has no impact on the other 99% of people and their wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while only 6% may have owned them, what percent of whites owned the businesses, were police, politicians, etc? Do you think that had zero impact on the lives of blacks?

       Even if only 1.4 - 6% owned slaves, they all benefited from it....northerner and southerners alike.  Whether the individual tolerated, supported or abhorred it doesn't make a difference when they are still taking part in the sin.

       There was no benefit to a person not directly involved in precisely one localised industry. Cotton. The other 90% of America was on thier own.

       That's why when a black guy acts like "we built this country" I laugh.  How do I benefit from racism back then if I was a white person, when so was 90% of the people around me? And the ten percent regional to the south?

      <p>
       Many liberals talk of the “debt” which Europeans owe for all sorts of past alleged “wrongs” committed during the Age of Expansion. Leaving the subjective arguments about colonialism aside, as well as whatever wrongs may or may not have been committed five hundred years ago, there is still no justification for the ethnic cleansing or genocide of European people today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slavery in the US is a case in point: relentless propaganda claims that white Americans owe a terrible burden of debt to blacks in North America, both morally and financially, for the scourge of slavery up to the time of the American Civil War. The reality is, however, that the first person to legally own a slave in America was the black Angolan Anthony Johnson, who became a tobacco farm owner. By July 1651, Johnson had five black slaves working for him and became the first legally recognized slave owner in America when a Virginia court ruled in his favor in a freedom suit of one of his servants, John Casor. Johnson won the suit and retained Casor as his servant for life, the first true slave in Virginia. In addition, the slave traders who brought blacks to the America’s during the Atlantic Slave Trade did not gather up blacks in Africa by themselves. On the contrary, Africans were the ones to capture their fellows as slaves and then merely sold them on. We’ll leave the matter of who owned the slave markets on both sides of the ocean aside for now. If the “logic” of blaming whites for slavery was consistently applied, then blacks, historically speaking, bear as much–if not more–of the guilt than whites. If that was not enough, the reality is that only a tiny handful of whites in America ever even owned slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the 1860 US Census, only 393,967 white households held slaves, or around 8 percent of all American households. All of these facts make it clear that to demand reparations from–or inflict “white guilt” upon–the majority of the modern-day white American population is laughable and would, under normal circumstances, be dismissed as a joke. The Arab slave trade in Africa, by way of comparison, lasted far longer and involved millions more Africans than the transAtlantic slave trade–but somehow there seems to be no similar demand for “reparations” against modern Arab nations or their people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, the argument of “colonial exploitation,” even if it were valid, as a reason for the current dispossession of European homelands by non-Europeans is fallacious in itself. At some stage of history, almost all nations and all peoples have conquered or exploited other people. African tribes have done it to one another, Semites conquered each other, Chinese, Japanese, American Indians–all people, somewhere, and at some time, have blood on their hands. History is replete with examples of national rights being abused–but the purpose of learning history is not to exact revenge for past wrongs, but to prevent them from happening again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if there ever was any such European “colonial debt,” it has already been repaid a million times over simply in terms of how the living standards of the entire world have been improved through European technological gifts and modern foreign aid. If anything, the “debt” is firmly the other way around. It is the rest of the world which owes the European world a mountain of incalculable debt.

       Logically, the point you have made is a fallacy. It employs the idea that because a black man was the first to get it on paper it's okay. The same idea that was used to modernize slavery into a institution rather than it's primitive form 200 years earlier. What I mean is that by saying this, it implies the belief that you don't think white people owned slaves before a black man 200 years after America had been conquered by whites. A fallacy.

       If it wasn't for horrible whitey, you probably would have died as an infant. If you somehow managed to survive past that, you would have probably been molested by a tribal elder for a pack of cigarettes in a mud hut somewhere.  Then probably catch disease and die like the others. But I don't hate you,  just like i don't hate dogs for purring or dogs for barking.  It's your nature to play the "race card", because, face it. ...That's all you got.

       Africa didn't have the wheel. The fucking wheel. no one there thought of it yet. Think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or romantic love. Or pacifying and harnessing the power of animals. Capable of architecture In only the form of  mud huts-the same level as that of a beaver, who also makes them. No second story conceived of yet. Music? rythym only.  No means of transportation beyond walking, no. Transport or goods placing items on head. No concept of fractions nor proportions. Only oral history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude, do you want me to go on? It would be painful. Just admit Africans are not capable of what others are. When we realize this, maybe we can really help them. If we just face facts without guilt on our side or shame on thiers, we can install a benevolent system to run things and still find a way to let them have thier own expression of life, without oppression from us, in realms other than politics. Perhaps they can manage business,or maybe that has to be guided too, I don't know. They should not be oppressed by their own simplicity either, which we should politely not look down on. Africa can have drums and hunts and thier own rythym of life, but it can also have hospitals and electricity, if we help. We have the power to help and not hurt, and we should feel we have the right to step in to do it, as long as the cost is not so great it causes harm at home, Europe. We could have chose closing the chapter on them, to say nicely the thing you think I'm saying, or ignoring them to some more misery they didn't have to suffer, a million endless, individual tragedies, like easily defeated disease and starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm saying we need to invade Africa, then implement a  global permanent apartheid state between us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we will eventually destroy them, or mix with them and be destroyed, our society brought down somewhere between our levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three choices. Get rid of them. They rid of us (mixing), or we make a nice world for them and maintain both of ours. Which is kicking the can down the road, since it  still allows the possibility for both the first two options, at a later date. But it's the nicest plan. So it's more politically realistic. What else will the world do about Africa? Just keep watching and shrugging our shoulders?

       The ancient Egyptians were white.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made the mistake of importing black slaves. Then they freed them. Then they mixed with them. Then Egypt declined, stabilizing into the Egypt we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sound familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the facial features in thier  busts. Lots of them. Mark the dates, then put them in order. By the time the thick lips and wide flat noses reached the the ruling class, it was almost over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, for a real outrage, read even here on reddit what happens to white women, especially blondes for some reason, of any age, including girls, who are foololish enough to vacation, or have parents take them on vacation to Egypt. Basically sexually assaulted constantly. What happened to reporter Lara Logan was not a rare event. Egypt is a shithole.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That's right, the ancient Egyptians weren't black. They weren't white either, mind you, but to presume that a culture has to be one or the other is to accept a racial dichotomy that white colonialists themselves invented for the purpose of sorting the world into "civilized" (white) and "savage" (colored) peoples. Most cultures in the world don't really fit neatly

      <p>
       I don't think we (as a nation) can really make it up to descendants of slaves, but every American and European should reflect daily on the barbarity and destruction caused by their proud nations.  Maybe if we all tried a litttttttle harder to undo a terrible legacy, the world might somehow be a better place.  As it is, we are content with cheap labor, foreign resources and exported pollution.

       You are very seriously misusing the word "prove".   If my statement truly and conclusively "proved" your point, I'd be globally famous for finally settling the issue with perfect, indisputable logic. Maybe you meant to say I contradicted myself?   I didn't and I'll explain soon,  but I'm too tired now.  You'll get a proper rebuttal tomorrow morning.

       Reported for trolling and supporting genocide. Seems pretty fucking simple to understand. I make a claim and provide evidence, you either agree or make a counterclaim with your own evidence. You’ve done neither. You lose. There’s nothing else to be said.

       So George Soros hires them for what?
      </p>
      <p>
       If its a legitimate movement, why is the same billionaire that uses rent a mobs and thugs employing them?
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it as plain as day - Soros spends his billions financing thuggish political grouos to attack his political/business enemies, under cover of their politics, like they have done for Soros through all the "color" revolutions in the middle east, and in a few European countries. BLM do it for him at Trump rallies and college campuses. How do you not see the connection and pattern? Does Soros just love blacks and has a hard on for the plight if an American black guy? Or is there..some other motive? All those paid movements in the color revolutions were part of a CIA playbook on manipulating elections and instigating coups, that looked like a real popular movement, by riding the coat tails of small groups of activists focused on a local injustice. But, this time, you think its the same, only real? This time they promise, they mean it?  Not likely.

       Nope, it was just a result of the useful idiots trying to insert intersectionality and complexifying a movement beyond it's original message. It happened with Occupy Wall Street, where it slowly became apparent that some people wouldn't just let you protest big banks, you also had to participate in the progressive stack, unneeded identity politics that left the silent majority silent, and the crazies with more media attention. Eventually, Occupy was no more.

       All lives matter. Black. White. Blue. Red. Yellow. All if them. I sincerely doubt the idea that the FBI sees BLM as any type of threat worth infiltrating. Nobody cares. I'm not trying to shit on your idea, just expose you to an opinion of some dude.

       FBI infiltrates everything that threatens the white status quo. ie the profit machine for the 1% plus its minions ie the govt worker class.
      </p>
      <p>
       remember the FBI collaborated with and protected anti OWS companies/groups, they took no action over planned assassinations of OWS leaders.

        In my opinion, BLM started out as a legitimate movement with justified concerns regarding police brutality against black Americans.

       Statistics don’t justify such a movement.

       Lies, rather. And the establishment is behind BLM, so they wouldn’t be afraid of them.

       Brought on in large part in all poorer communities by terrible horrible good for nothing laws that are largely being changed. The drug war is a class war...and the ones that supported it got filthy rich pushing it....while the cocaine importingagency was hard at work. Not about color. About selective lawenforcement.

       The ancient Egyptians were white.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made the mistake of importing black slaves. Then they freed them. Then they mixed with them. Then Egypt declined, stabilizing into the Egypt we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sound familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the facial features in thier  busts. Lots of them. Mark the dates, then put them in order. By the time the thick lips and wide flat noses reached the the ruling class, it was almost over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, for a real outrage, read even here on reddit what happens to white women, especially blondes for some reason, of any age, including girls, who are foololish enough to vacation, or have parents take them on vacation to Egypt. Basically sexually assaulted constantly. What happened to reporter Lara Logan was not a rare event. Egypt is a shithole.
