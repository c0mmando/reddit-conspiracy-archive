There were also several military helicopters circling overhead that had people rappelling down.  When residents called 911 the dispatchers had no idea what was happening. The official story on the morning news was a &quot;military exercise&quot; at the site of the former St Francis Hospital. Since when are exercises done in the middle of a residential neighborhood? Any coincidence 300,000 people will be at the 100th Indianapolis 500 race this weekend?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On 9/11, the Air Force, the FAA, NORAD, the Pentagon, and other entities were involved with numerous terror simulations that morning, at least one simulation directly dealt with NORAD tracking hijacked commercial airliners that were crashed into the WTC towers, the Pentagon and White House. And then every member of the Bush Administration and high-ranking military and intelligence brass all had the balls to say and repeat that &quot;nobody could have ever imagined this kind of attack, terrorists using airplanes as missiles.&quot; Well, you guys did. And so did the chief architect of the World Trade Center and so did Larry Silverstein, the guy who bought WTC buildings 1, 2 and 7 and insured them against terrorist attacks just several months before 9/11.</p>

<p>They never could have imagined terrorists bombing the train station in Madrid... except that there were emergency anti-terror drills in Madrid that day specifying bombs in the station. London? Also had anti-terror drills of terrorists attacking public transport systems on the day of the London Bombing. The LAX shooting? DHS and FEMA anti-terror drills. Sandy Hook? Anti-terror drills. They even had the perfect number of Christmas trees. Aurora, Colorado? Anti-terror drills. Oklahoma City? Oslo? Virginia Tech? Taft Union? Terror drills gone live.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a series of unfortunate coincidences. It is a planned, coordinated assault on humanity, perpetrated by the governments tasked with keeping us safe. Like it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these are tests to gauge how a population will react.  The use of fear as a test strip is nothing new.  They figure if 20% of the people violently refuse, then they&#39;ll need more troops in that area, or, a different type of suppression method. This is their way of dipping a toe in the water to see how hot or deep it goes. These are calculated &quot;drills&quot;, to see how hard a population pushes back. When the shit hits the fan, they have an idea of the percentage of resistance. That way, when they do fuck you up the ass, they know how much lube to use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe it is still focused on foreign influence as much as it was in the 60&#39; and 70&#39;s, or that what ops are being carried out are much more focused on the domestic anti-war movement. I feel the latter is more probable considering the U.S. pretty much knows who its foreign enemies are and with the globalization and interconnectedness of the world, any foreign support is already known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the purpose of CHAOS was mostly to sow discord and confusion in the US and specifically to infiltrate and neutralize the young anti-war movement.  The official line is that the CIA was worried about &quot;foreign influence&quot; but what they were really worried about was the civilian population saying enough is enough and telling them to fuck off and get our people out of Vietnam.</p>

<p>To answer your question though, I think it&#39;s both and more.  You can&#39;t underestimate the power and reach of the CIA and the rest of the western intelligence agencies.  They have their dirty tentacles everywhere, in all fields, and they&#39;re probably running dozens of ops on us all as we speak right here and now.  But I like to link it to Operation CHAOS because it&#39;s easier to put into context so that people understand because that&#39;s basically what the CIA is doing with all of its ops: spreading chaos and confusion and trying to prevent the people from realizing their/our own power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have only quickly read about it on my break, but it strikes a few bells. So, it wasn&#39;t just about monitoring and intel, it was a program to incite rebellion of sorts. That makes much more sense. &quot;Foreign influence&quot; was the face, that figures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am.  &quot;We will know our disinformation program is complete when everything the US public believes if false.&quot;</p>

<p>I know the quote is uncorroborated/unproven, but I would say that I&#39;ve read enough about the CIA and William Casey to not doubt he said it.  That is the agenda, at least one of the main ones.  Edward Bernays realized a century ago that scared, confused people buy things.  Happy, content people have no need for all the materialistic bullshit.  And then add to this the fact that scared, confused people find it difficult to take meaningful action.  They&#39;re given so many different perspectives, theories, ideas, conflicts, influences, agendas, ideologies, mindsets, etc. that they don&#39;t know down from up.  And how can you take action in the real world when you aren&#39;t even sure what&#39;s happening in the real world?  This is the main reason why the CIA has infiltrated the mainstream media and Hollywood/TV.  Control what a person is exposed to and you can control what that person thinks about and, in turn, control what they&#39;re able (and unable) to actually do.</p>

<p>If you want to read about the CIA in detail, there are three books which I couldn&#39;t recommend high enough that I think all people should read: <em>Legacy of Ashes</em>, a big fat tome that looks like a Bible about the history of the CIA.  <em>Killing Hope</em>, which is about the US being a &quot;beacon of democracy&quot; around the world (AKA it shows CIA covert involvement all over the planet over the decades).  And the last one is called <em>Inside the Company</em>, which is a memoir written by a former high-ranking CIA agent whose conscience got the better of him and who exposes the inner workings and how everything in the intel agencies is linked.</p>

<p>Then you will see why the children&#39;s invocation was important.  In Masonic lore, you can kill anyone you want, as long as the right conditions are met and the killing is done in a certain way. </p>

<p>One thing is that the Mason must warn the person, by telling them they will be killed. Then the person is &quot;fair game&quot;. </p>

<p>The chant may have been the official, formal announcement of the planes hitting the buildings. </p>

<p>When you read that book you will them understand that the occultist are always seeking to take man and transform him. They are usurping god and his plans and imposing thier own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, there was a sudden rush of helicopters, black with red blinking lights...they were louder than the news helicopters i&#39;m use too and way faster...they were swirling around, flying really low and close to the houses, circling the old hospital...my windows were rattling from the vibrations. i ran to look outside, the police had set up a road blockage at 13th and albany, in front of the hospital.... men  started climbing down ropes on top of hospital., there were explosions that sounded kinda like 4th of july mortar shell but with a lower boom. strobe lights were going off inside the abandoned hospital so it looked extra creepy.  some neighbors came outside, started looking up at the sky....the old guy across the street had his rifle. i ran inside in a panic, didn&#39;t know what the heck was going on...hopped on facebook, saw all the comments and then someone posted a screenshot from the mayor&#39;s personal facebook stating it was a &quot;secret military training mission&quot;. a lot of people are pissed we weren&#39;t notified beforehand, and that it wasn&#39;t offically posted on the city&#39;s page, only those friends with the mayor on FB were privy to the info.  later the local news sites posted that it was a train ing exercise that had been planned for months in advance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they didn&#39;t effectively warn residents about being invaded like that is what really bugs me. They clearly had plenty of time to do so, but must have made the conscious decision not to, maybe for &quot;super secret military reasons&quot;, or maybe just to prevent troublemakers from showing up to make trouble. Either way, I really question the methods used to come to the conclusion that the consequences of informing the residents outweighed those of <em>not</em> informing them. Your account of these events is exactly what I expected to hear. Your neighbors felt the need to bring out their guns after hearing what certainly sounded like a real invasion. That kind of experience can only be called terrorizing, and isn&#39;t the kind of thing a country that is so apparently concerned with mental health (especially combined with gun ownership) should be doing. I first thought of all the elderly combat veterans with aging, weakened hearts and other vitals who are a mere blood pressure spike away from death. That fact alone would be the first and only consequence I would need to make the decision to inform residents. I would be curious to see what the daily death records looked like for that day along with times and possibly even location to see if there was any correlation.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be pissed not to be notified too.  What would they have done if your neighbor shot somebody?  It would be really unfair to put a regular human into such a situation unprepared, and then hold them accountable criminally speaking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/node/3339">https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/node/3339</a> &lt;-- a paper titled: Can nuclear explosions cause earthquakes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On January 19, 1968, a thermonuclear test, codenamed Faultless, took place in the Central Nevada Supplemental Test Area. The codename turned out to be a poor choice of words because a fresh fault rupture some 1200 meters long was produced. Seismographic records showed that the seismic waves produced by the fault movement were much less energetic than those produced directly by the nuclear explosion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The possibility of large Nevada Test Site nuclear explosions triggering damaging earthquakes in California was publicly raised in 1969. As a test of this possibility, rate of earthquake occurrence in northern California (magnitude 3.5 and larger) and the known times of the six largest thermonuclear tests (1965-1969) were plotted and it was obvious that no peaks in the seismicity occur at the times of the explosions. This is in agreement with theoretical calculations that transient strain from underground thermonuclear explosions is not sufficiently large to trigger fault rupture at distances beyond a few tens of kilometers from the shot point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I don&#39;t disagree with you on life on other planets :) I wouldn&#39;t believe Chavez anyways , but if weather modification is a thing , &quot;natural&quot; disasters don&#39;t seem so far fetched to me.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a California resident too and, to be honest, it is very unlikely that the <em>government</em> is going to purposely set off the San Andreas Fault to collect... insurance money? Bush and his administration did it with the WTC but that&#39;s a building, not a geographical landmark half the size of a state.</p>

<p><em>On the other hand</em> I do think weather modification is within the power of the US government. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/haarp-secret-weapon-used-for-weather-modification-electromagnetic-warfare/20407">HAARP</a> is the name of such government entity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what would you think of a catastrophe to validate our future president whomever that may be . Do you think it&#39;d be plausible to use an internal issue as the earthquake would be and have a &quot;knight in shining armor&quot; come in with aid to boost ratings since none of the candidates are popular (I know this strays from my &quot;insurance collection&quot; comment lol)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get your reasoning, that all seems like something that a powerful entity would do, I just think its a bit of a stretch to assume our government has the power to jumpstart an Earthquake. But honestly, who knows... Nikola Tesla once created an &quot;earthquake machine&quot; that shook the building he was in. When he went to shut it off, it wouldn&#39;t stop, so he smashed it with a hammer. When he died on US soil and the FBI seized all of his files, I&#39;m sure they found blueprints for it. 70 years later, I wouldn&#39;t be very surprised if they had developed a more powerful version of it.</p>

<p>So, on second though, I guess it may not seem so far fetched...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a huge difference between &quot;mysterious earthquake technology&quot; and a nuke. </p>

<p>With a nuke and a drill, the threat is quantifiable. The technology is limited to certain groups. There are a million certain considerations, from location to expense, and all can be evaluated. And logically we can extrapolate motive. And such forth. </p>

<p>If we can&#39;t find evidence or even make an educated guess as to why anyone would pay the billions it would cost for an attack like that, then it&#39;s the height of absurdity to play Chicken Little about earthquake weapons and stir simpler folk into a frenzy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drills like these are more about a show of force to the citizenry than they are about training. The personnel involved have already been well trained. Sure, it helps to do a real life exercise. But more importantly the general public is shown the power of their military - should they ever consider rising against it. It&#39;s much like the military parades in Russia or North Korea. It is also similar to governments&#39; torturing people. That is NEVER about garnering actionable intelligence. It is ALWAYS about showing the people what their government is capable of, so do not even think about a possible uprising. It has been this way throughout the ages. It is no coincidence torture was brought back into the mainstream by W et al at a time when dissidence is at an all time high. And then there&#39;s the high tech surveillance systems. Again, not to thwart terrorism, but to identify pockets of dissent. They want to know from where the pitchforks are coming.</p>

<p>it&#39;s more a matter of &quot;how many of them will fight americans&quot;</p>

<p>it&#39;s honestly hard enough to keep the military willing to fight and prevent them from becoming totally demoralized while fighting foreign brown people who don&#39;t speak english, imagine the suicide rate increase when they&#39;re being sicked on people in their own country.</p>

<p>Over 2 million in Chinese army alone not including reserves. Even 50,000 Troops would be enough to disarm and disorganised and unready population. Media blackout + nighttime raids on the most populous centres would be done fairly quickly imo. It&#39;s the lack of organisation and communications networks (That aren&#39;t completely monitored) that would be the problem. </p>

<p>This whole sentence is a string of buzzwords put together in roughly the right way to form a semicoherent thought.  I didn&#39;t bother including proletariat  and such because I thought it&#39;d be too on the nose for tongue-in-cheek.

<p>To &#39;correct&#39; someone by qualifying &quot;not the US, it&#39;s the US Government&quot; is not splitting hairs, it&#39;s pedantic. Let&#39;s be honest here. </p>

<p>Also, a skeptic isn&#39;t a skeptic simply because they split hairs or question authority. Except on reddit, of course. A parrot can ask questions, skepticism implies a certain level of learning. </p>

<p>And for the <em>opinion</em> portion, possibilities are fun to discuss around the proper framework. if we&#39;re just popping off any crazy thing, then my spitball is Trump bailing out to secure a Clinton nomination.  </p>

<p>If we&#39;re talking about things within the context of realism, then a Russian/Chinese directive to secure US civilians on US soil is absolutely not such a thing and should be derided for the absurdity it is. It belongs in the category of Trump seceding / conceding to Clinton. Which is why I commented in the first place. </p>

<p>Since Trump has the election pretty much locked up, there is no reason for him to sign it over. He gains far more as POTUS himself than as Friend of POTUS.  Not only is it obviously and objectively against his own interest, but it would go against every bit of character he has ever shown for him to step down now.</p>

<p>Seems like reasonable protocol if it&#39;s used with reasonable justification.</p>

<p>The problem is that you seem to be implying that this protocol is inherently dysfunctional/counterproductive/malicious. I&#39;m not saying it can be, I&#39;m just saying that if I were a country that had my populations interest at hand, then if they all go berserk then I&#39;d want help disarming them however I can get it.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;d be asking myself is, have these people ever really worked for us? Deep down I don&#39;t know if I could answer that, at least not right now these days and at least not positively. The matter of whether or not we would &#39;let&#39; our leaders get away with this or that, today is a moot point. They&#39;ve already gotten away with all they need to. We are not an obstacle to them, not anymore. I would love to hear your perspective on this though.</p>

<p>Edit: to those who think the army would do &quot;live fire&quot; here - they don&#39;t even do that on base besides in one or two set aside and regulated buildings that are consistently tested for wall durability. They would be using blanks or rubber bullets. I would put a hefty sum that they were practicing multi-level room clearning, hostage extraction, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military has these type of drills all the time and they often perform them in residential neighborhoods because that more closely resembles the realities of modern combat.</p>

<p>I recall the marines doing exercises in some abandoned housing projects, back in 2006-2007.  This went on for two to three weeks to prep new pilots for urban combat.  Cobra attack helos doing strafing runs (no live fire), Blackhawks dropping armed squads and F-15s flying orbits.  This was every damn night for about three hours in a very busy residential neighborhood.  Of course, we were given warning of what was going on, due to the length of time.  </p>

<p>In fact, they just had more helo exercises last month, in another part of town.  This was only a couple of evenings, though, and no warning was given.  </p>

<p>Of course, something strange could be afoot but given my experience with several of these events, and the lack of any significant event following them, I&#39;d be inclined to believe the official story this time.  I will keep this in mind, though, shoudl anything happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was gonna post something similar about how training like this is a pretty common occurrence. I used to be in the air force as a fire fighter and we did numerous off base exercises with various agencies, not only because we might not have the vehicleas, equipment, or anything like that but we might not even have the necessary building setup to accommodate such training. The other big thing to remember is training like this can be required to maintain certain certs as well.</p>

<p>I remember one time we were conducting an off base exercise with the county haz mat team that myself and two others were also on. We rolled out with pretty much all our haz mat gear and arrived at the location to find a massive staging area with an even larger area cordoned off as the cold, warm, and hot zones. Thing is the off base agencies are in charge of telling the communities about this and this time they didn&#39;t really alert anyone. So part of the way through suddenly news teams are showing up, crowds are gathering, and no one really knows what we&#39;re doing and why. Some started thinking there had been an attack or they were in danger when that couldn&#39;t have been further the truth.</p>

<p>Heck some of my vehicle licensing had to be done off base because we didn&#39;t have what we needed to properly test someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise an interesting point that I hadn&#39;t considered before.  u/Meyerd is likely correct and I suspect any noise complaints would fall on deaf ears, since any agency that could act on a complaint would be the same one that authorized the training, in the first place. Though I will say that, at least in my case, the aircraft observed municipal quite times and cleared out before 10PM.</p>

<p>Also, in my case and the one in Indy, with the use of abandoned properties that were likely built with federal funds, the military might not even need municipal approval.  The whole operation could fall under something relative to eminent domain.</p>

<p>This is all speculation pulled directly out of my ass, mind you.  I&#39;m no constitutional scholar.</p>

<p>Remarks like these are just comment litter.</p>

<p>In qualitatively modded subreddits, your comment would be deleted because it includes a useless assertion that&#39;s shamefully immature and counterproductive. Let&#39;s just see how qualitatively substantial this subreddit is, depending on whether or not your comment stays.</p>

<p>A real mark of intelligence would be to express the sentiment that BlackStarPrince&#39;s comment was naive, without resorting to expressing it in the form of &quot;you&#39;re fucking useless! see!&quot; There are plenty of ways to express that in a mature and consequently productive manner--however, such ways require the intelligence to be able to do so.</p>

<p>I mean, let&#39;s just compare and contrast your comment with BlackHawksHockey&#39;s response.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So you are surprised someone fucked up and didn&#39;t communicate properly?   This is the military.   Not surprised at all.   Shit happens dude.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes even less sense to use an old hospital that&#39;s in a populated areas.</p>

<p>As opposed to all the empty hospitals in the country?   Where do you expect them to do training?   </p>

<p>The military doesn&#39;t train to fight against countries.   They train to fight terrorists, which utilize buildings like hospitals, as strongholds.   </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be surprised when you see people practicing insertions.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never seem anything like this in my life.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean shit.   I bet you&#39;ve never seen a city destroyed by war, yet I have.   Does that mean my experience doesn&#39;t exist because you haven&#39;t seen it?  That is nonsense.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would think that they had an actual target that they hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s called training.  Do you expect them to blow it up?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To pit that many civilians at risk with the half dozen helicopters and the explosions. It&#39;s just to much risk for way to little reward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On every single military base, around the US, you will see planes/helo&#39;s constantly flying around the population, or some sort of training going on.    Sometimes I can even hear military personnel firing their weapons at the range.   Does this mean I should be scared?  </p>

<p>Near an Army base?   You&#39;ll hear arty fire ALL THE FUCKING TIME.  </p>

<p>Near an Air Force base?   You&#39;re gonna hear jets/planes non fucking stop.   </p>

<p>Near a Naval base?  No clue.   I don&#39;t know shit about the Navy.  </p>

<p>Near a Marine base?   No fucking clue.  Probably a lot of grunting and yelling.</p>

<p>More importantly, I think it is important for people to remember that the military has too train.  You train how you fight.   </p>

<p>Get over it and put your big boy pants on, because we live in a new world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent a good chunk of time in 10th group at Ft. Carson. I have deployed quite a few times to with OIF/OEF. So yes I&#39;ve seen my fair share and of fucked up shit. I grew up in military towns, I spent a big chunk of my life in the military, and I currently live in a big military town. I have never seen anything like this. I know for a fact that if the military wants to conduct training they will build what they need. They are not going to take any risks in an area where civilians are present especially with a low flying helicopter. A crash in a area like that would be catastrophic. Yes I see Black Hawks and other helicopters flying around multiple times a day but not low flying where they would be in support of a operation. Nor would they do it in the middle of the night with our property warning people. Also 911 dispatchers do contact the police when they get a call. If the police knew then it would have quickly gotten to the dispatchers who in turn would have started telling people what was going on. </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right.  But you know what?  People fuck up.   I&#39;ll give you a personal example.  </p>

<p>I worked with altitude chambers, and I was required to perform a yearly test.  This test involved calling 911, and having the fire department and flight medicine respond to my building, which also happened to be located off base.  </p>

<p>I coordinated with everyone, and had talked to everyone that morning.  Everything was set.   When I called 911, I even used the term &quot;This is a training event, blah blah blah, this is a training event.&quot;  </p>

<p>Lo and behold, the fire marshal forgot to tell his underlings and the fire department responded to what they thought was a real emergency.   Do you realize how huge of a fuck up that was?   Yet it still happened.  </p>

<p>When you have the human element involved, there will be mistakes.   It&#39;s not a matter of if, but when.   That&#39;s why I&#39;m not surprised there was a communication failure.   It happens ALL the fucking time.  </p>

<p>Edit--IIRC, the overall purpose of the training event was to test Flight Medicine response time, but the fire department wanted to use it for part of their training as well.   They would drag hoses in, and put giant fans at doorways blowing air out.   It was a really neat scene to watch.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find the architect of the building and see if he/she happened to designs more than one hospital with relatively the same floor plans and where.</p>

<p>I know Black Ops programs build full life size <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Acid_Gambit">compounds</a> resembling their targets so the guys can muscle memory the whole building. Not including the life size <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=military+builds+fake+town">towns</a>.</p>

<p>The hospital as far as I know was abandoned and would make sense being used for training but this is the military we are talking about not the local SWAT team. If the military can afford a $2,000 toilet seat and a $500 hammer having the option to bring in contractors to build a mock hospital for more than a single use seems to me like the road they would really take.</p>

<p>My 2 cents..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an armored military vehicle driving through my city towards the high way with an undercover driving behind it. Thing is, this wasn&#39;t a normal undercover. I know what the undercovers look like in my city and this one looked really different. It looked like a brand new escalade but a newer model, really nice looking and then it started veering side to side behind the armoured vehicle to see if any cars were in front then they hit their lights and sped off to the highway ignoring all civilian traffic. It was very strange...strange because these types of vehicles were in a part of the hood where they don&#39;t belong. Government vehicles in the hood? Doesn&#39;t seem right.</p>

M.U.T.C.stands for Muscatatuck urban training center.
I have been on this installation and it gives me the hibbie jibbies somethin&#39; fierce.
It&#39;s a guarded military and police training center replete with fake buildings to train in, lots of dead and rusting cars, overturned Train car, school building, hospital.
Also comes with a small jail sized prison with inmates is on the base. Super secretive and buried behind woods.</p>

<p>Oh and whilst heading north today at 2-3 pm I noticed  two formations of heliocopters, four each heading east from a western origin. Not that fishy really, Camp Atterbury was in that direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A wave of 911 calls came into into Marion County police dispatch starting after midnight as the military training got underway, a dispatch supervisor said. Police confirmed that the military was conducting a training operation at the site.</p>

<p>Beech Grove Police Capt. Robert Mercuri said officials went door-to-door to warn neighbors about the training, but some residents did not get the message.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re sorry people were startled,&quot; Mercuri said. &quot;We hope they understand that the city of Beech Grove was trying to help the people who protect us everyday.&quot;</p>

Were there announcements? I&#39;m only going off what was originally written here and haven&#39;t browsed all 250+ comments. Just seems really fishy to not notify the public so that they stay out of the area as well as not call 911. </p>

<p>for them to be doing a training exercise at night there without seriously properly giving notice to all the residents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you are surprised someone fucked up and didn&#39;t communicate properly?   This is the military.   Not surprised at all.   Shit happens dude.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes even less sense to use an old hospital that&#39;s in a populated areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As opposed to all the empty hospitals in the country?   Where do you expect them to do training?   </p>

<p>The military doesn&#39;t train to fight against countries.   They train to fight terrorists, which utilize buildings like hospitals, as strongholds.   </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be surprised when you see people practicing insertions.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never seem anything like this in my life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean shit.   I bet you&#39;ve never seen a city destroyed by war, yet I have.   Does that mean my experience doesn&#39;t exist because you haven&#39;t seen it?  That is nonsense.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would think that they had an actual target that they hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s called training.  Do you expect them to blow it up?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To pit that many civilians at risk with the half dozen helicopters and the explosions. It&#39;s just to much risk for way to little reward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On every single military base, around the US, you will see planes/helo&#39;s constantly flying around the population, or some sort of training going on.    Sometimes I can even hear military personnel firing their weapons at the range.   Does this mean I should be scared?  </p>

<p>Near an Army base?   You&#39;ll hear arty fire ALL THE FUCKING TIME.  </p>

<p>Near an Air Force base?   You&#39;re gonna hear jets/planes non fucking stop.   </p>

<p>Near a Naval base?  No clue.   I don&#39;t know shit about the Navy.  </p>

<p>Near a Marine base?   No fucking clue.  Probably a lot of grunting and yelling.</p>

<p>More importantly, I think it is important for people to remember that the military has too train.  You train how you fight.   </p>

<p>Get over it and put your big boy pants on, because we live in a new world. </p>

<p>Then you will see why the children&#39;s invocation was important.  In Masonic lore, you can kill anyone you want, as long as the right conditions are met and the killing is done in a certain way. </p>

<p>One thing is that the Mason must warn the person, by telling them they will be killed. Then the person is &quot;fair game&quot;. </p>

<p>The chant may have been the official, formal announcement of the planes hitting the buildings. </p>

<p>When you read that book you will them understand that the occultist are always seeking to take man and transform him. They are usurping god and his plans and imposing thier own.</p>
