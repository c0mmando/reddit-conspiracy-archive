    <div class="md"><p>Sounds about right.</p>

<p>But instead of years, I&#39;d refer to it as generations. There&#39;s no way to be sure their current level of high tech would take 50 years for us to get.</p>

<p>Strategically I think they try and stay about 10 generations ahead. That way in a small scale they can outdo nearly anything, and at the same time strategize for what&#39;s to come while acting like they don&#39;t see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense. The strategy is simple. The US will not lose a war, we will not be invaded. The only way this country gets destroyed is from the inside. While DARPA and the military are redefining technology, the real battle for hearts and minds is going on in the school rooms and in the media. </p>

<p>Programming starts from square one!</p>

<p>I am extremely strategic and logistic minded.</p>

<p>I watched the BS throughout my years in school. I now have no interest in being killed in false premises or randomly disappeared, so I mainly keep my mouth shut about what I see.</p>

<p>Which I guess is part of their goal with all deep thinkers...</p>

<p>Got 2 kids. If it were not for them, I&#39;d be MUCH more proactive. But instead I am only locally active and looking to get me and mine off the grid ASAP. The next step is forming myself with a local militia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get a little open minded here. War? Of course we won&#39;t lose, it&#39;s rigged. The whole point is to not stop. Invaded? In terms of another country? Yea we can hold our own. In terms of something beyond earth? You seriously think we have the tech to match anything out there? Again just keeping an open mind, if we base our technology on speculation of reverse engineering we are ahead in terms of what humanity has seen publicly yea. Not anything beyond our planet. Hell even military weapons we see as &quot;brand new&quot; on the market are already 20+ years old once civilians try to buy them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That answer has way too much depth of possibility for me to be able to easily reference in a few short paragraphs.</p>

<p>Basically I&#39;d be playing the world domination game, like they all do. My only question, is how much would my choices be the same ad what is happening, vs my attitude of trying to help the common good.</p>

<p>I fear what we bitch about, is the result someone somewhere doing their best amongst a limited amount of choices.</p>

<p>The only question is what are their values?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something strange happened before, during and after ww2 and tech world changed forever (mostly in computing/electronics and also medicine/genetics... could it be that the meld of machine and organic was the plan all along for some reason ?!) its like it skipped time it would take to get to that level of tech, if we look at history of tech before ww2. </p>

<p>So how advanced secret tech is, at worst 40-50 years more advanced of what is &quot;known&quot; today (movies, tv shows, games and such might actually hint of what is), at best godlike tech that it seems like magic. I got this feeling that for some reason they (mostly people in power that think they are gods and are simply power hungry or just plain evil with their own agendas) are not allowed to use this tech that is &quot;given&quot; to them to its full potential... only study it, learn from it and reverse engineer it and that there is some secret ancient conflict still active today and humans are in the middle of it, caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>

<p>Personally i would not be surprised if info &quot;got leaked&quot; that Mars is being colonized and then some or that they can visit other Star systems without even leaving earths orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just imagine what kind of technology and weapons you would see if there was a war where a world superpower became desperate enough to bust out the classified stuff. I would say that hasn&#39;t really happened since ww2 and if you take a look at that you have ww1 to compare weapons with. Just between those two wars the advancements in weapons was pretty good. They really had propeller planes pretty well shaped into better weapons in between that time, machine guns also improved. In the 13 years between the two wars You went from fighter planes that were made out of wood and canvas which could go 106 mph with a range of about 290 miles. To planes which could go 437 mph with effective range of 1988 miles with 6.50 caliber machine guns that were made of metal. Better machine guns, radar, the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>The tommy gun, the first robot built, insulin, frozen food, liquid fueled rockets, the jet engine, electron microscope, magnetic recording, nylon, road reflectors, LSD, the first successful helicopter are some examples of things between the two wars that came out. That was 71 years ago. 71 years of world super powers who during that time have been 71 years into the nuclear atomic age of technology. Yes there have been wars since then but were they on the doorstep of any of the major world super powers and enough of a threat for them to show those classified advancements they had been working on? </p>

<p>The only thing we have really seen in that 71 years has been what? mostly refinements to things we already knew about? The rail gun technology with the navy more recently has been interesting, harnessing electromagnetic power to launch projectiles. </p>

<p>71 years is a long time to come up with all kinds of amazing things. Especially with the advancement of technology that everyone knows about, just think of all the things that advanced supercomputers make possible when applied to world super powers coming up with new classified technological advancement. </p>

<p>Honestly, I hope we never find out how advanced current classified technology is because for us to do so some world super powers would have to be in a war that caused them to be desperate enough to break out those weapons. The most destructive weapon I hope ever gets used were the two bombs that were dropped on Japan all those years ago. I don&#39;t know that the world, or mankind would be able to live through that next world war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4h95sr/weird_science_and_fucking_magic_just_how_managed/">thinking about this too</a>.  Peter Westwick&#39;s 2000 paper about Secret Science demonstrates that an entire secret scientific system was built to keep the national labs from becoming dysfunctional near the onset of the national securty state (1947 on).  I think there&#39;s a big story here, but it&#39;s pretty buried in details.   </p>

<p>Point:  In the 40s-50s, many sober and respected scientists and the like were making statements like &quot;we will be going beyond the stars soon&quot;.  Were they all terribly wrong, or did something stop them?</p>

<p>Point:  The Manhattan Project was largely intuited and developed from the open science of the pre-war era.  If you found something like the unified theory which einstein was mocked for believing in, can you ever imagine that it wouldn&#39;t become classified instantly?  You wouldn&#39;t want that to get into the hands of your enemy, and then you&#39;d need to keep it secret from EVERYONE outside your club.</p>

<p>Point:  Nature cannot be masked.  Anyone with sufficient effort can (at least in principle) reproduce the results of another researcher.  If there is deeper science to be understood, you can only keep it out of the hands of your enemies by misleading them (and your own public).</p>

<p>Point:  No current technology uses any understanding &#39;deeper&#39; than that in the post-war era.  We have made technical progress and developed some sub-fields (semiconductor theory and the like), but applied physics has remained stagnant (no quark-o-scopes), working within the same general framework.    </p>

<p>Is it only a coincidence that Murray Gell Mann came from RAND?</p>

<p>I could go on, but yeah.  There&#39;s a real discussion to be had here and it gets heavy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that they have that much at their disposal that we don&#39;t know about. The evolution of robotics is happening right in front of our face... the stuff from Lockheed and its ilk are displayed, in better and better form, at weapons shows all around the planet... every year. In public, we are already capable of building autonomous flying death machines. In five to fifteen years, it will be completely possible for a government to create a drone army with sufficient strength to effectively take over the world.</p>

<p>If they had that technology, they would use it. They don&#39;t have anything that we don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve got electromagnetic propulsion... so what... we do, too, if we choose to go down that road... or unlimited energy? There are so many ways to meet the world&#39;s energy needs, it will be hard to choose. Maybe they have a little box that can power a city... but we&#39;ve got Nickel Hydrogen Fusion and Focus Fusion and whatever else.</p>

<p>If they had the ability to close the fist around our necks, they would have done it already. This idea, that they have some menacing technology, serves their agenda... because it gives credence to the flawed notion that they are keeping technology from us for our own protection.</p>

<p>I do not give an inch on that. They are suppressing energy and propulsion technologies, and they probably have a few prototypes, but they don&#39;t have enough to menace a nation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure you can make military use out of electromagnetic levitation other than recon, because I&#39;m not sure that anything can cross the electromagnetic shell created by the rotating field. Or, anything going through it might have it&#39;s circuitry fried.</p>

<p>As Tesla demonstrated, you can do amazing and horrific things with electromagnetic fields... but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ve even caught up to Tesla, in terms of their understanding.</p>

<p>I believe that the kind of abstract thought that Tesla leveraged is killed by top-down structure of organization. I, therefore, believe that the new Tesla&#39;s won&#39;t be the type of person that the elites will expect. They will expect that it requires discipline and hard study... and it does... but the driver for that discipline and study must be internal, or you just turn into a beaker bud with a lab coat.</p>

Interplanetary and maybe even interstellar travel.
&quot;Free&quot; energy.
Definitely weather control, this is even openly acknowledged.
Mind control is another certainty, the only question is ease of use. I&#39;d say there have been massive leaps in this since the 70s.
We most likely have bases (at least) on Mars and maybe other moons and planets.
Doomsday weapons that make nukes look tame. SCALAR weapons that can simply disconnect humans from consciousness en-mass in the blink of an eye.
Tunnel boring machines that can &quot;swim&quot; through rock.
I would also say THEY most likely have subterranean high speed transport systems and massive underground bases that could be called cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe it would have to be xrays, or microwaves, or combinations of all of them. Maybe microchips that instead override the brain&#39;s natural electrical impulses. If you find a way to influence the actions of the body by &#39;signal jamming&#39; (so-to-speak) of the action translation areas of the brain I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>We just haven&#39;t actually (or publicly maybe) done it yet. The proof of concept is very old, too. You can stimulate certain areas of the brain to create predictable bodily responses. Given the right technology and the right scientific minds, it should be completely possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The brain can be stimulated to produce physical responses, yes, but those are all electric.  In order to wirelessly cause those responses, there&#39;d have to be some sort of electronics in the body already to permit a current to be induced.</p>

<p>Regarding microwaves (or any other sort of radio waves for that matter), what I&#39;m wondering is how the waves might be modulated to produce whatever effect is desired.  We have things like the gamma knife, but they work simply by destroying tissue.  I can&#39;t see any possibility of them producing an effect in an otherwise normal person, unless that effect relies on precisely destroying tissue in a surgical environment like the gamma knife.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah microchips at the right spot are most likely the way to go, as they could be individually powered, or they could even use the electrical impulses of the human brain but then change them.</p>

<p>Wave modulation is a funny thing, and in the case of that kind of &#39;jammer&#39; type influence over a brain it would have to be mounted on the person&#39;s head, that way it could send many signals to jam many &#39;transmitters&#39; in the brain simultaneously. interesting thoughts</p>

Air current modification by dropping metal particles in the atmosphere and effectively microwaving it from the ground to create walls of high pressure or a vortex.</p>

<p>Mind Control - I still don&#39;t think they can reliably Manchurian candidate someone. I think they can induce short term memory loss, via drugs like scopolomine, but I don&#39;t think it is reliable enough to use on an actual operation. It&#39;s better to scopolomine someone like Robert K&#39;s &#39;assassin&#39; and just kill Robert while moving the patsy into place. 
You can put voices in someone&#39;s head. You can certainly influence behavior with this, like driving someone crazy.
You can alter brain state with EM waves and induce emotional responses, like fear and joy, but it&#39;s not specific yet... I don&#39;t think... so no traditional &quot;mind control&quot;... yet.</p>

<p>Alternative medicine is winning. Thanks, Internet.
Cancer is a fungus. Raymond Rife cured that long ago. I believe that EM can be used to destroy just about any microbe... semi-specifically. They probably know that, and use that.
They&#39;ve probably cloned humans, but no eternal life serum. </p>

<p>I think they can do electromagnetic levitation, a la flying saucers.</p>

<p>But in some areas, the prices are so ungodly high for manufacturing, there are certain areas where the public stuff is probably just as good as the private stuff.</p>

<p>Such as... I&#39;ve never seen any evidence of a working quantum computer, or anything more advanced than silicone wafer technologies... so your cpu is the same one that is flying a saucer.</p>

<p>And I hear they don&#39;t have any good video games =P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Camera&#39;s mounted on a platform as large as a fruit fly. Probably smaller ones that can be dropped directly into your eye, without pain. What better way to monitor what someone is doing than by stealing their eyes. We know they were having trouble with hawk sized devices like this almost 20 years ago. They were probably wasp sized in 2000.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic control of the atmosphere. From weather on demand, to 2 km holograms of 2pac, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve been there for a decade or two.</p>

<p>Geospatial electrodynamic programming (I can make up names) Why install malware on a suspect&#39;s PC when you can just modify RAM from orbit. This may be far fetched... but I KNOW they can do this from 10m reliably.</p>

<p>The Mean Green Beam. Something straight out of Tesla&#39;s mind is small enough to be vehicle mounted. I may or may not have seen this in action, and the result of its payload. Hypothetically... how would you start a fire in the center of a wooden beam, that is sandwiched by concrete? Have you ever seen a FD jackhammer a floor in order to extract smoldering wood? I digress...</p>

<p>We know that they have a database on us, have a fake database of personas they use for propaganda and info-sec purposes. They are surely predicting the actions of &quot;interesting parties&quot; and making pre-emptive strikes against anonymous groups. But that isn&#39;t surprising...</p>

<p>We have &quot;slap on&quot; flesh for the battle-ready medic. We have numerous delivery mechanisms for medicine, in the field. </p>

<p>Super soldier programs never stop.</p>

<p>Drones that can sustain themselves on sunlight alone, allowing for exceeding long missions. These same drones could be used for any number of electromagnetic or cyberwarfare scenarios, from capturing every protestor&#39;s phone, to blacking out a city at will.</p>

<p>EDIT: Almost forgot. They probably have a 4096 qubit quantum computer at the Los Alamos labs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The history books will call it the &quot;Great Death&quot; but...</p>

<p>Mass production of the drones, first. I would want billions of them orbiting the planet. Not armed with weapons, but with the purpose of closing our RF radiation to the universe. I&#39;d want to isolate our RF &quot;noise&quot; to our own atmosphere, and I could probably do that with enough RF drones. From space, our planet would &quot;go dark&quot; electromagnetically (ignoring Allen&#39;s Van.)</p>

<p>I&#39;d have to pull a Justinian and find some excellent people to tackle some world problems. Food, power, weather, shelter... all needs to be addressed, but I&#39;m going to be busy...</p>

<p>...building spacecraft for the newest branch of the military. The goal is to conquer our own solar system by any means necessary. Not knowing what kind of strange agreements we may have, or what hidden things are already out there, this could be disastrous.</p>

<p>Then it all just plays out like an EVE online game where we actually have an alliance we abide by.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m successful, our species, &quot;the bacteria infested t-shirt wearers&quot; would become a space faring empire, just ripe for plucking by some larger player in the universe.</p>

<p>And there&#39;d probably be quite a few choice <del>accidents</del> tests for some specific people...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no doubt in my mind that they are capable of free-energy. And with the gov&#39;t&#39; actively shooting down UFOs with EMP weapons since Roswell, who knows what kind of tech they have been able to reverse engineer. </p>

<p>It is kept secret mostly because keeping us dependent on fossil fuels is very profitable for them.  It&#39;s ridiculous to think that we are still using the  internal combustion engine because no invention has been made for over 100 years.  Anyone who invents a new device gets it confiscated and the patents are classified, and this has happened hundreds if not thousands of times, starting with the confiscation of all Tesla&#39;s notes.  </p>

<p>This is also why disclosure will never happen because once the people know that advanced species exist, they will start questioning why we are still using the old technology, and eventually demand that we adopt new technology.</p>

<p>It truly pains me to think how far advanced the human race might be and how much better our lives would be if not for the power elite keeping humanity stuck in time for their own gain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what sector of technology you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m willing to bet serious money that hardcore conspiracy buffs <em><em>vast</em></em> overestimate what classified technology exists/is capable of and who controls it.</p>

<p>As far as aerospace goes, I think it&#39;s one area where neither side has it right (computing tech perhaps as well). I do think that the cutting edge of classified technology is beyond what the wonks and enthusiasts estimate it, but still short of what conspiracy buffs claim it is (if you like to do things like repeat 2nd/3rd hand accounts of Bill Rich claiming &quot;we Star Wars now&quot; - you fit in this category. No. Just no.).</p>

<p>You see things like <a href="http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/never-seen-photos-of-boeings-1960s-stealth-jet-concept-1732308296">the Quiet Bird</a> which is a design so far ahead of its time it really has no business fucking existing when it did and how quickly we move from Tacit/Have Blue to F-117 to B-2s to F-22/YF-23 and I have to question what the fuck is going on.</p>

<p>My guess is that bleeding edge aerospace tech is probably 20-30 years ahead of what has been publicly disseminated. Now, while that sounds impressive (and it is), keep in mind that we&#39;re approaching diminishing returns. I&#39;m not saying we have FTL-capable space-planes and we&#39;re having dogfights around Jupiter&#39;s moons with those damned xenos. But we probably do have stealth hypersonic-capable (shit, throw VTOL in there for fun too) space aircraft that are like a B-2/X-15/F-22 combined into one.</p>

<p>Going forward with computing, I have no doubt the NSA is <em>very</em> interested in quantum computing and is working to develop some very advanced and fun toys to <del>watch you fap with</del> secure freedom and democracy.</p>
