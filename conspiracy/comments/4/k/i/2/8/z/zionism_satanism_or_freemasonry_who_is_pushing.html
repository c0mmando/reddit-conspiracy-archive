       Could it be all 3? Some folks, me included, have the idea that all these religious societies are subsets of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). It is a fraudulent setup to control the world by 1 controlling the money, and 2 installing minions everywhere, into positions of power. They were trying to take on Russia, but V. Putin is wise to them, put them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this 3 choice menu is misleading. Another analysis is there is a "network of corporate control" which includes wealthy bankers, royal families, multi-national corporation and media executives, military brass, and public officials (government) all serving a hidden master control group based in Rome. Jargon is "RKM", meaning Rothschild Khazarian Mafia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strong clues that an Irish-American businessman and a Marine Corps general have achieved the nearly impossible, and have initiated the FALL (restoration of the de jure u.s. of A). POTUS of the de facto government, USA Inc., was made to resign immediately prior to the Apr. 30 Correspondent's Dinner, and has left the Whitehouse. VP Biden has gone to Israel... don't believe cover story, the real reason is, he needed to get out, because he is a minion (Israel is an arm of the Jesuits.), and many persons will be on trial for treason. In a military court, the penalty is to face a firing squad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third in line for POTUS is Speaker of the House. Therefore, Paul Ryan is now secretly president, with Chairman of Joint Chiefs Gen. Dunford vice pres. My guess, the new temporary pres. will be the GOP nominee for the Nov. elections, because an incumbent has a big advantage. Many incumbents of other offices set to be candidates will be on trial for treason (everyone in Congress knew the scam), and only rookie candidates will remain on ballots.

       I'm absolutely sure that interest in and propagation of money supply is not limited to any particular families or nationalities or industries or religious organizations. Money is an international phenomenon and the supply too fluid and covert (Panama Papers are the tip of the iceberg) these days to accurately determine who has the most, although certain groups (USA, China, Japan, EU, Catholics, Protestants, Jews [Rothschilds], Muslims [OPEC]) obviously dominate.

       They are all interrelated. It can be all. The jesuits are the top of the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming the people that always get carried away with "it's the Jews" (yet provide no evidence) are either misinformed, purposely spreading disinformation to cover up the jesuit power and/or some sort of white supremacy angle

       Get ready for downvotes and blantant atheism, but I'd say the only defender of ALL humans is the Vatican. I believe the Luciferians are using freemasonry as a tool to manipulate the masses, but Zionism isn't about a bloodline, it's about were lucifer fell to earth. Call me brainwashed, but the changes in the Catholic Church are a response. This is a holy war for souls, not money, resources, etc. The battle is near. Find the God of your understanding and hold firm. If you think religion is utter bullshit, you're the brainwashed one.
      </p>
      <p>
       What race? The human race. Who's God? OUR God. Drop selfish desires, bond with your family, friends and neighbors and don't fear the reaper. I'm barely on this sub anymore because of FEAR.  My daily fears are not being present for the people I see and hear. The internet is an isolation tool. Yes, social media is great. But when the power cuts out, it's my neighbors that grab a grill and a cooler that really matter...

       Which History books? Lol, ask yourself why the RCC is demonized so hard, especially with what many here know about pedophilia being used as a smear campaign? Is the percentage of pedophiles in the RCC higher than in Protestant churches?  Nope. At least the RCC reforms itself with public statements, which is somewhat like a corporate press release.  Go back and read PJPII papal statements on human dignity.  Read what the US Bishops released in the 70s about poverty. Go seek Truth, not youtube videos.

       History is littered of examples of fairy evil examples of actions from the church. Witch hunts. Trying to, and often killing people like martin Luther who was a problem to the establishment. 700 years of inquisitors torturous ways.

       I was not talking about child sex abuse that's a problem in the world and in organised religion. But 2000 odd years oh dodgy actions by the RCC that lent weight to the theories the jesuits are running the earth today; in charge of the Zionist, santantic ad the rest

       It has nothing to do with ratio.  It has to do with consequence when it's found.  The popes have protected their own, not 'kicked them out' or put them in jail actually, which is what they should have done.  In fact, since Jesuits are so good at these things, they should have put pedos into the iron maiden and slammed that shit several times.  Sorry if that's gross and terribly cruel.  Maybe I'd have made a great, and terrible Jesuit.

       Because scandal causes others to lose faith? Because sexual disorders shouldn't be physically abused out of the individual?  Jesus is coming to reveal the Truth, every asshole on the Internet is not Jesus, myself included.  Punishment in the RCC is separation from the Sacraments, which bring one closer to God.

       But what do I know? I just read and talk to people and search my own soul, rather than rely on YouTube or some author's bias.

       You're completely 100% wrong.  I'm sorry.  Pope Francis is/was a Jesuit before coronated as pope.  He was one position from Superior General.  He was the regional, latin american prefect (or whatever they are called).  Jesuits have taken over vatican and they are a military order that thinks it's OK to torture people for heresy, as they were the ones performing the cruelty during the inquisition; torturing to death scientists culture now records as intrepid heroes of human thought and reason.  In this way, they are anti-knowledge, anti-science, anti-truth and they are the ultimate authoritarian gatekeepers waging a war on consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freemasons were templars before they were masons.  Actually it goes templars to knights of malta to rosicrucians to modern masonry.  Stonemason guilds have been around since before Christ and one can say the craft guilds would be a good place for these people to meet up outside of their martial obligations ... which is how it's endured over several hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Catholics burned templars to death for worshipping baphomet.  Which they do.  Google jacques de molay.  A french king burned them on order of the pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward 800 yrs or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pope Francis is also a freemason.  Freemasons now endorse Catholicism and Catholicism has changed it's position (Francis's decision) to allow Catholics to become a member of freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangely, a document was FOUND after hiding for 8-900 yrs.  It's from Jacques de Molay, and it exonerates him from ALL Baphomet worship.  So  Great!  We were wrong and freemasons are all Good now.
      </p>
      <p>
       From one fake document,.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after centuries of battling freemasons, Catholics have changed positions overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile some countries banning them outright; similarly Jesuits have been kicked out of countries as well, for causing financial and poltical intrigues, plotting against the government, assassinating people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think Catholics are anything more than a political empire PLUS dogma (religious nonsense) then you are seriously deluding yourself and ignoring most of known history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sorry if this sounds callous or confrontational, but I'm not going to let you propagandize your false doctrines to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you said Jesus is great, that's fine and I believe that also.  But if you say, "give to the church because they feed the poor", then tell me about why the Vatican needs and army, missles, anthrax, assassins, lobbying, and those stupid fucking hats.

       I'm within a deeper ring with two of these three. I can tell you it's definitely Zionism. Satanists want everyone to be free and liberated as far as control goes. Freemasonry might have some deep roots in government but to each individual is his own decisions.

       But what do I know? I just read and talk to people and search my own soul, rather than rely on YouTube or some author's bias. The more I hang out in this sub, the more I see evidence of Satanic apathy spreading like wildfire. Question your own ego, dude. It may be keeping you from lasting happiness, here, in the midst of bullshit and manipulation.
