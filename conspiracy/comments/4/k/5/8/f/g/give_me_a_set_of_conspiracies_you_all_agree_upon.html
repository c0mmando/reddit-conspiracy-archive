       TBPTB: Jews are at the very top and below them a select few goyim who serve them(freemasons)

      <p>
       The end goal: A one world government where they monitor and control everything.

       I personally know that these people are absolutely ruthless pyschopaths that will kill and decieve to get their way, and they are master manipulators. If I had to predict the near future I truly do believe they are going to kill off a lot of people soon once technology(see self driving cars, Mcdonalds replacing workers with robots, etc) makes most people obsolete(useless feeders as they would call us)

       all power on earth is granted by the temporal and spiritual dominion of the representative of God on earth. The pope.

       The monarchy is the monarchy because the pope said god said so. so to then are all the contracts made between the monarchy and "independent" nations like the US and the entire commonwealth, in essence a contract with the pope.

       I can't . there is a contract/ binding written agreement for all things under the aun. Study contract law. Look into law of the sea and sovereignty. Not that I don't want to. I do. I can't give you ten years reading in cliff notes. I had to trudge. So do you. I am not able to hand you that. I would.ID only I could.

       I don't know what you're rambling on about but if ten years of reading led you to believe that the pope and jesuits are running the world you wasted a lot of time.

       This post is an attempt at further division. 
 I'll answer from my own perspective anyway so you'll have your division.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sociopaths run everything. That is because the sociopath or the psychopath is the only kind of person who is willing to do absolutely anything to control others by getting power over them. They fear their fellow man because they don't understand that most people do have what they themselves don't and cannot imagine. That being a conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our ru8ling class has  no conscience.
They make each and every decision based on a single consideration. That single consideration is, personal greed. The goal is the goal of all madmen throughout history, that is to rule the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think in terms of Survival of the fittest, Dog eat dog and The Law of the jungle, the rules that snakes and alligators live by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Civilization was made possible by he qualities of the human brain that surpassed the animalistic patterns of thought. Civilization was made possible by the human traits of compassion, empathy, conscience and remorse, the exact qualities that sociopaths lack.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we continue to be ruled by the law of survival of the fittest dog in the jungle we will revert to  being just barely advanced animals. The winner of that contest will be alone, hungry, and without the means of sustainable  survival. Greed doesn't work for its living.

       "Us people'" , at least this one, highly suspect that you are the one who is confused. You are not being genuine.

       I said division, not diversion. There's a difference. Divide and conquer is the reference. I'm showing the similarities among the various  people in power and what I wish was the consensus among us. The  shared psychological makeup of those in power determines their goals. That's what you asked about.

       Some will disagree based on their degree of investigation, some are not at the same stage of awareness, and others will never be.  Isn't it wonderful to a be witness to the inner thoughts of a free thinker in all the stages!  I personally have and will continue to evolve my "theories" based on new evidence and thought provoking articles that stimulate me to want to learn more about one subject or the other...

       I can't . there is a contract/ binding written agreement for all things under the aun. Study contract law. Look into law of the sea and sovereignty. Not that I don't want to. I do. I can't give you ten years reading in cliff notes. I had to trudge. So do you. I am not able to hand you that. I would.ID only I could.
