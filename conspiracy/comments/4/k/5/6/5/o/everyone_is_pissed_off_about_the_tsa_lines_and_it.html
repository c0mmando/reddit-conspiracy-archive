       The weirdest...maybe you guys can help me unravel this.
      </p>
      <p>
       ex-CIA director James Woolsey was on the morning news today making a statement about the disappeared EgyptAir flight possibly being an "inside job".
      </p>
      <p>
       His name stood out on TV because I've recently come to realize James Woolsey and Dick Cheney have an oil venture in the Golan Heights (middle east) called Genie Energy. Israel's Netanyahu is also protecting that land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I didn't know what he meant by "inside job" (an inside job by who?), so I did a Google search and found an article from 6 months ago where this same event seems to have occurred:

      <p>
       Look at the date on that. November 2015.

       The flights are different in these stories, but it's the same event.

       This is my second favorite sub, but I'll still admit people get called idiots for having opinions here, too. In the defaults, if you go against the MSM narrative, you'll probably get downvotes and called names. Here, for better or worse, if you go against certain alternative narratives, you also get called an idiot or sheep. There's more nuance here, but not as much as there could be, and we'd be naive to think there aren't people here actively trying to stifle or slide the discussion.

       Marduk's Advocate here: What is the aim of having intensive TSA procedure?  Is it simply to delay them on their flights?  Or do you believe that their inspection of luggage is the aim itself?  Because I see no reason in bombing a plane to prevent the bombing of planes, and I'm assuming you don't either.

       Rather than suggesting TSA bombed a plane to justify their own existence, I think OP is suggesting TSA / government is using the bombing to their own advantage. The media is complicit though for running the pro TSA stories.

       I don't think they deny the fact that the government could be involved.  They are saying there isn't a good enough reason for it to be a TSA thing. It just doesn't make sense. But once I think about it. There could be a politician working on a  bill to cut TSA funding and the higher ups caught wind of it and decided they needed to spark fear into Americans so they see the TSA as a necessity to our every day life. Which in turn keeps some government contractors pockets fat and he is putting that money back into the officials campaign fund. By blowing up a jet over seas it keeps people scared but doesn't question the TSA's ability to keep Americans safe, as where if it was an american plane heads would roll. You just never truly know do you?

       Nah, TSA is a government entity, their funds are voted on in Congress.  In fact, I believe their wages were recently cut by Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also fails on the front that public opinion will not sway how much money the TSA "makes".  It's not like a car manufacturer or department store where reduced patronage has a negative effect on their procedure or how much they make.  In fact, they kind of have a monopoly on border/flight security, so I think nobody really has a choice.  You didn't hear anybody say "ah shit, these lines are ridiculous, I'll have to start sneaking onto the tarmac and into the wheel wells of my flights...but what can you do?"

       One of the key aspects of "terrorism" is to keep us scared of other cultures. Obviously traveling breaks down major brainwashing barriers built up from years of propaganda. This is why when terrorism was invented the main purpose was to attack points of travel like trains and planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This helps keep people physically in their place of origin and removes all privacy from those who would dare to travel and see the world for them selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres no coincidence that almost all terrorism happens in transportation hubs. It is part of the mental brainwashing that we get in our daily propaganda doses. Keep people in their big cities and convince them it's a big scary world out there.

       It's also where there are huge amounts of people not really concentrating on their surroundings. If you were going to be a terrorist, the idea is to terrorise so you don't blow up some small store in the middle of nowhere do you because no one would care nor be "terrorised"

       Um, the bomb went off OUTSIDE the stadium and killed ONE person other than the bomber. He's talking about setting a bomb off INSIDE, in which you have massive casualties and possible structural failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hasn't happened though, and is not likely to anytime soon, because sports draws in billions of dollars and serves as a distraction while keeping people focused on their localities, instead of exploring other parts of the world, as u/ironlionclan eloquently phrased. So while it would seem like a logical place to conduct some terrorism, it's also under some of the most legitimate protection, and a false flag in a stadium is too damaging to the economy and would also have far too many witnesses.

       Plane goes down and it is wall to wall coverage on the controlled 3. It's a tried and true formula.

       93 people killed in a suicide bombing in Iraq? Pfff. Barely news. Plane goes down with 66 passengers in another country? Non-Stop coverage with terrorism tossed around like candy.

       The insinuation that they take no part in attempts at swaying public opinion is ridiculous enough for me to question your motives. Now I'm not really a Sanders supporter (how could I support any of these clowns?), but this clip posted the other day makes it quite clear that Hillary is
       <strong>
        the
       </strong>
       preferred candidate of the networks and their brass.

       You're reading too much into what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do suspect most people working at CNN, ABC, NBC, &amp; CBS are Hillary supporters and it comes through in what they report and how they report it. I think it's in their culture. Just like college students are overwhelmingly Bernie supporters, and racists and uneducated people support Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying that the networks aren't getting their marching orders from some shadowy organization that says: "people are getting too cranky about the lines at airports, thanks to the congressional budget cuts. Crash a plane into the Mediterranean sea and remind them why they need to be 'homeland securityed'."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just silly.

       Well, I didn't say anything about the airplane crash. I don't know much about it, other than the fact that we will probably never really know much about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the anchors probably have their own opinions, but those could very well be a product of their working environment and desire to move up by sharing the same views as their superiors. Undoubtedly, networks hold meetings with their anchors and don't often let them speak off the cuff.
It's not even to say the anchors are "in on it"...they may have just arrived at honest beliefs based off of subjectively-filtered news. But to say it's not driven in a certain direction by any network executives seems naive, mainly because there aren't a wide array of differing opinions across the channels.

       There's an enormous difference between channels. Watch 1/2 hour of each cnn, fox, then msnbc. One is Hillary, one is Trump, and one is Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even while CNN is likely in the tank for Hillary (from top to bottom) they cover Trump all the time. Some of the coverage is good for him and some is bad for him. Why? because people

       Curious, do you have any thoughts on the Korean Air plane crash at SFO in 2013? There's not a whole lot of material on it, but it looks possible that this was some sort of farce. It's a little hard to fathom, because it's difficult to come up with a reason to fake it. But by now, we're well aware fake events can be used to gauge information control and public response.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons I think this could have been some bizarre psy-op is that first off, there's NO damage to the runway or grass in its flight path, which is entirely inconsistent with the fireball seen in the video. The plane appears to be in different spots in various photos. Additionally, there are only before-and-after photos of the plane, with no images of the fire that would have burned the roof off. Also, it looks like the plane is missing windows in some of the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I always wonder about these things and not only whether or not it was actually some sort of terrorism, but if it even really happened at all.

       The Korean air crash at SFO didn't seem to correlate with an agenda in my mind. Though something was "off" about it. My thing was how can these modern planes with the hundreds of safety features that are made to prevent such things as too low of an approach happen?

       The MSM is, in my serious opinion,  a tool of indoctrination and brain washing. They create the reality for the general population that dove tails with the Zionist wars of the Middle East and the police state at home...and as the world watches, the American MSM is complicate in the current election fraud that will put Hillary the War Witch into the Oval Office.

       Still not sure why, but this just had to be a fake. Watch this video - when the plane crashes, is that not the nose of the plane dragging on the ground as it starts to come to rest? If that really happened, then why is the nose of the plane squeaky clean, and where are the skid marks leading up to it? Just, no sense at all.

       Logically yes, it's not a reflection of a TSA failure at all, but that's not how the public is going to perceive it. To most, the idea that terrorists on airplanes still exist, period, is enough to stifle any opposition to increased TSA searches and longer wait times. Very few people are going to think "hey, that bomber didn't slip through TSA security, so why is anything changing?" It's more like "damn, better let them do what they have to do, I don't want to die on the flight like those others!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not at all a benefit to the travel industry, or the economy in general, but none of that is held in high regard anyway when it comes to keeping terrorism afloat and restricting freedoms.

       I might not be smart enough to debate with everyone here, but I will try and I appreciate the civilized conversation so far. To me though, it just seems like more than just a huge coincidence.

       So you also think the TSA took down a not even full airliner in the Mediterranean Sea, flying from a European airport to justify their existence?  At the very least they would do it over Russia or another manufactured enemy of the usa.

       Ok so there was one Saudi on the flight. If it turns out to be a terror attack plotted by Saudi Arabia, I fear this is when the 28 pages will be released and the inevitable war we have been waiting to wage will be declared. We'll take Syria down then Iran. Shit could be about to hit the fan. Or not.

       TSA is bad at their job.  So why are we still taking planes when you know that a terrorist could have slipped through?

       Not just fear mongering, it's SOCIAL ENGINEERING. You see it every day it's in papers you read, the advertising all around you, it's in the laws, belief systems old and new, social fads, apps. The list is endless and half the time none of us notice, even some of the people on this sub I'm sure.

       Police killing the mentally ill is at epidemic proportions. Most specifically, autistic children lashing out and being killed by police becomes common place. Parents start to fear for their autistic children's safety, then this weeks heartwarming fluff piece of the one officer that helped an autistic kid instead of shooting him gets pushed by the police union and made viral by a social media PR team. Everything is convenient deception anymore.

       Um, the bomb went off OUTSIDE the stadium and killed ONE person other than the bomber. He's talking about setting a bomb off INSIDE, in which you have massive casualties and possible structural failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hasn't happened though, and is not likely to anytime soon, because sports draws in billions of dollars and serves as a distraction while keeping people focused on their localities, instead of exploring other parts of the world, as u/ironlionclan eloquently phrased. So while it would seem like a logical place to conduct some terrorism, it's also under some of the most legitimate protection, and a false flag in a stadium is too damaging to the economy and would also have far too many witnesses.

       There's an enormous difference between channels. Watch 1/2 hour of each cnn, fox, then msnbc. One is Hillary, one is Trump, and one is Bernie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even while CNN is likely in the tank for Hillary (from top to bottom) they cover Trump all the time. Some of the coverage is good for him and some is bad for him. Why? because people
