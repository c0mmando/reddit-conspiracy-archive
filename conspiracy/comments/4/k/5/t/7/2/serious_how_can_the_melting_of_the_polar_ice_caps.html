    <div class="md"><p>It depends on what ice you are talking about. If you are talking about ice over land that is sitting/stacked anything above the water line, and it melts and drains into the ocean, then yes, the ocean levels will rise. If the ice is already floating in water no matter if it is only partially submerged, then no, the ocean levels will stay the same.</p>

<p>Specifically, you are asking about the polar ice caps. Let&#39;s start with Antarctica; Antarctica is a landmass so everything on top of it if melted would raise the ocean level. Same thing with Greenland. All the ice on Greenland if melted and drained into the ocean would cause the water level to rise. A random iceberg floating in the ocean that melts will not raise or lower water levels. </p>

<p>Yes water does expand when frozen, but if the ice was never displacing water to begin with, even when that ice melts it will still be something you are adding to the ocean causing a net gain in water levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>the Antarctic ice isn&#39;t a sheet of ice floating in the ocean, it&#39;s a glacier sitting on land. (There&#39;s a continent under that ice.) If the ARCTIC polar cap melted, the sea level would only change due to the expansion of water due to warming.</em></p>

<p><em>There is a significant amount of ice covering Greenland, which would add another 7 meters (20 feet) to the oceans if it melted. Because Greenland is closer to the equator than Antarctica, the temperatures there are higher, so the ice is more likely to melt.</em></p>

<p><em>But there might be a less dramatic reason than polar ice melting for the higher ocean level -- the higher temperature of the water. Water is most dense at 4 degrees Celsius. Above and below this temperature, the density of water decreases (the same weight of water occupies a bigger space). So as the overall temperature of the water increases it naturally expands a little bit making the oceans rise.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are confusing different aspects of the climate change phenomena.
Melting Arctic ice does not raise sea level directly, it reduces albedo and results in substantially more solar energy being absorbed at high latitudes on the dark ocean surface. This really messes up global atmospheric energy distribution, the jet stream and thus northern hemisphere weather systems.

<blockquote>
<p>Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.</p>

<p>The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 <strong>Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.</strong></p>

<p><strong>AAAS</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change</strong> documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems. The scientific community has convened conferences, published reports, spoken out at forums, and proclaimed, through statements by virtually every national scientific academy and relevant major scientific organization—including the  American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)—that climate change puts the well-being of people of all nations at risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NOAA</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A large body of evidence supports the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming. This evidence has accumulated over several decades, and from hundreds of studies.</strong> The first line of evidence is our basic physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These estimates are often obtained from living things and their remains (like tree rings and corals) which provide a natural archive of climate variations. These indicators show that the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years. The third line of evidence is based on comparisons of actual climate with computer models of how we expect climate to behave under certain human influences. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content, a rise in global sea level, and general retreat of sea ice and snow cover. These and other aspects of modeled climate change are in agreement with observations.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">2</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/tau-lepton.html">tau-lepton</a> 2016-05-20</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Some of the papers cited have been published in prominent peer review journals, including 34 from Nature and 33 from Science.</p>

<p>However, our analysis also shows that many of the papers do not focus on human-induced climate change – and so have little relevance to the theme of the list.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some of the authors featured on the list surprised us, so we contacted a selection to see whether they supported this interpretation of their work – the responses confirmed their work is being misappropriated by inclusion in lists such as this.</p>

<p>Professor Peter deMenocal, of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, told the Carbon Brief when asked about the inclusion of his paper on the list:</p>

<p>“I’ve responded to similar queries over the years. No, this is not an accurate representation of my work and I’ve said so many times to them and in print.</p>

<p>“I’ve asked Dennis Avery of the Heartland Institute to take my name off [another similar] list four times and I’ve never had a response. There are 15 other Columbia colleagues on there as well … and all want their names removed.”</p>

<p>A paper on the list by Zeebe et al. published in the journal Nature Geoscience in 2009 studies the Palaeo-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which is a period of rapid temperature rise around 55 million years ago.</p>

<p>The authors found that feedbacks such as increases in other greenhouse gases were responsible for a substantial part of global warming, alongside the direct impact of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The lead author, Professor Richard Zeebe, University of Hawaii, said:</p>

<p>“Using our paper to support skepticism of anthropogenic global warming is misleading.”</p>

<p>These two papers contribute to the scientific consensus on climate change,  rather than undermining it. Earth’s climate has changed throughout geological time. Studies like the papers listed here have helped to explain why, broadening our understanding of the climate system.</p>

<p>It is precisely our knowledge of these processes that allows us to eliminate them as the cause of the current warming trend. Manmade emissions of greenhouse gases are now the dominant factor forcing today’s climate.</p>

<p>A paper by Meehl et al, also placed on the list, discussed how the 11-year solar cycle has an amplified effect on climate signals in the tropical Pacific. The author of the paper, Gerald Meehl, of the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), said:</p>

<p>“It’s odd that our 2009 paper is on a site about global warming.  Our paper addressed specifically the climate system response to the 11-year solar cycle. Thus it is about decadal timescale climate variability.</p>

<p>“It said nothing about long-term warming trends, and in fact, in the last sentence of the paper, we state, ‘This response also cannot be used to explain recent global warming because the 11-year solar cycle has not shown a measurable trend over the past 30 years.&#39;”</p>

<p>The inclusion of a paper studying the sun’s influence on climate is in itself very odd. It’s well established that solar irradiance has contributed little to warming since the 1960s, whilst the Earth’s temperature has risen. For example, a paper by Scafetta &amp; West (2006) says:</p>

<p>“Since 1975 global warming has occurred much faster than could be reasonably expected from the sun alone.”</p>

<p>The authors of the list at Popular Technology appear to believe that studying the effect of non-human effects on the climate provides evidence to undermine the theory of man-made climate change.</p>

<p>In fact, it is precisely such work which shows that the man-made changes to our planet are unprecedented.</p>
