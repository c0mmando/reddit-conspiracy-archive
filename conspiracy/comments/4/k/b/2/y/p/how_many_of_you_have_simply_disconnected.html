       I honestly did not even start to buy into any conspiracies until I completely stopped cable TV and most forms of popular media. I'm not saying I never ever watch TV or the occasional movie, but days of me sitting on the couch and zoning out are gone. I spend my free time reading, writing, researching, and exploring nature (anything active and photography).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just ran into a post on
       <a href="/r/mandelaeffect">
        /r/mandelaeffect
       </a>
       , and the user noted everybody seemed like they we under a spell. Then, there were many replies about how people had stopped watching cable tv/other forms of media long ago. I even found myself feeling programmed by Facebook and other social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has to be a connection here. How many of you stopped the programming and why? What other connections have you found?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much better would this world be if more people turned off the TV, perhaps the most classic form of brainwashing...

       I don't own a TV anymore nor do I have Wifi in my apartment.  I do have a smartphone and there is a library nearby if I needed to get online for something. I also have a Netflix (DVD) subscription for any movies I choose to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for feeling brainwashed, I notice the people around me all seem to "independently" come to the same decision about something at the same time.  It is very disturbing to see it from an outside perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, the very fabric of the culture seems to change on a regular basis lately. Maybe not being "plugged in" allows us to see the changes instead of being consumed by the tide.

       I think it's important to at least be aware or familiar with the garbage that is coming out of the TV, if you are going to try to transmute it into something worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though, once you've seen enough of it and realize it will always be the same garbage year after year after year, then yeah, of course, then you can switch it off completely.  But at that point at least you know what everyone else is being pumped full of so you can work your magic on it.  You gotta have a target for your concentration right?

       Yet you post on reddit and are being a targeted for advertising you don't control right now and you WILL consume it.
Get off your high horse.

       You would have to live completely off-grid to not be effected at all. My point was not that I'm completely impervious just that I willingly live my life in a way that the conditioning is not 24/7.

       Of course I still have some of the message sent to me.  On Reddit (and other websites), billboard signs, and just plain conversations with others.

       Popular media is absolutely a form of brainwashing, and you only really realize it once you've stepped away from or are out of it. Opinions and influences are everywhere, but through "entertainment" those infleunces bypass the rational brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stepping away fro TV is a good thing - advertisement and the shows themselves have specific agendas - and they're not in your best interest. Many popular movies carry political and social programming (whether purposeful or inadvertent). And one of the worst and maybe most obvious offender is the radio with stunningly obvious programming baked into pop song lyrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only good solution is to take control of your input stream. Ingest only the media that you want, and know the reasons why you want it. It's also good to be aware of the messages contained in whatever you are watching or listening to so that you know how your chosen media is affecting you. Because all media, good and bad, does have affects on our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Myself, I haven't watched TV in about 6 years and decided to stop listening to top 40 stations a year or two ago.

       I think there's a brainwashing element beyond the subject matter. I don't mean anything magic or secret, but the pace of media is far faster than real life, so it leaves you feeling bored and empty if you turn it off. You get accustomed to fast input and it can make reality feel intolerable for a while.   It's too bad telling people about the benefits of cord cutting makes you sound like vegans and crossfitters.

       I stopped being under the spell years ago. The scary part is, seeing everyone else under the spell.i have a close friend that is aware on some levels, but for the most part so drunk on the bullshit. From believing in voting, that the system " can change ", etc. When we hang out, I have to get drunk so I can just zone out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing it in public is kind of trippy. Watching the brainless take their selfies and being totally rude to you. This whole structure have turned everyone mad. ESPECIALLY because the things on tv are for the rich and wealthy, and the poor out number them. So alot of envy and hatred out in the real world.
The worst are college towns. Students are the most dumb,privileged, cutoff from reality, and on a high horse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is being institutionalized in some shape or form.

       Edit: I am currently under the spell of basket ball right now actually. I will shake that once the seasons over.

       I live in Uk,Our cable isnt as brainwashing as it is in the US however it is crontolled.For many years, I used to be a news junkie and I thaught I was well informed with things going on in the world.How wrong I was.It was only in the last 2-3 years that I have swithced off that I realise, the MSM is means of propaganda and programming. For news that  want to read, I come to reddit and other sources,not to say everthing on here is gospel, but it certaintly isnt forced on you like the MSM forces news narrative. Since I have been disconnected,its so funny and obvious to see the narrative manipulation by MSM when observed. 
Im lucky enough to have grown up at the same time Facebook was starting,so I know and understand the thing completely.I used to use it flat out until recently, when I have noticed it too tries to push the narrative,paris profile pics and the likes.FB has become like a tool that can sample general public mood at any given time,just like after the paris attacks!And because "everybody"jumped on the bandwagon and did it,you can see how it can be a tool to influence or control public opinion!!

       I unplugged over seven years ago, when I had finally had enough of the filth and lies that were assaulting me and my family 24/7.  About a month later, I started to see how I had been affected by the brainwashing.  I began to think again, rather than blindly believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge everyone here to read
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arguments-Elimination-Television-Jerry-Mander/dp/0688082742">
        "Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television"
       </a>
       , an amazing book, an absolute spell-breaker, written in the '70s by Jerry Mander.  He was an ad-man in California for fifteen years before coming to the realization that television can't be reformed.  (You can probably find the pdf, but you really should support the author and buy a copy.)

       Odd to me that y'all are talking about "unplugging" yet you're posting on an incredibly popular site either using a computer or phone...that's not being unplugged now is it? You're still addicted. 
We're all addicted, even when we think we're breaking free.

       fucked off my facebook last year, free-to-air tv probably 7 or so years ago, and ive never had cable/satellite tv.

       i only read my news/current events/propaganda in written form. it did wonders for my mental well-being and family life.
      </p>
      <p>
       most people who still run with FB, free TV etc do seem to be under a 'spell'. it really is quite telling when youre at a dinner party or other social event and youre talkng to people about random stuff, they all spout the same shit they hear or read in the MSM. it really is fun tangling with people like that, as they dont know shit from clay.

       15 years into the experiment. Not much to add besides what the other unplugged already said - there seems to be a huge correlation between those who consume TV regularly and those who think the state the world is in is "normal" and cannot even begin to imagine that a better world is possible.

       I dropped TWC for Netflix and Hulu...they are getting frighteningly creative with their online advertisements. With the paid-for-but-not-premium Hulu you get an ultimatum: 1) watch commercials during the show or 2) answer this survey. Grrrrr. Soon they'll have us playing minigames, and then enough talent will be put into those minigames that you get stuck in them and forget you are watching a show.

       I got off the fb programming a while back. Now I check it maybe once or twice a week very quickly to either post some article on Hilary's bullshit or check up on family in another country. My SO is still stuck on that crap scrolling thru all the ads and articles. It's annoying. Plus people that get stuck on those stupid "free" game that you have to pay to really advance. Scary thing is once you break away there world seems sad when you notice all the bad going on.

       Commericials are a big business. There's a reason they cost so much they work. Not to mention working where CNN/Fox is playing constantly in the background. You start believing it or it starts driving you insane.

       We actually talked about this today at work, most have already cut the cord, but sentiment leaned heavy to that the spell still exist in other formats one way or another, especially social media propaganda. One guy who doesn't have a TV and who just got a smartphone a couple months back said that the mojo was powerful on it, sucks you in real quick. TPTB have their bases covered, TV or no TV, these people can farm human beings at a control level of 90%+ and keep it there.

       Understandable, but ... in this thread, aren't we going a little too far in the extreme anti-TV, anti-media direction? I mean, for fuck's sake, I'm not going to become an ascetic Luddite reading old books or spending my entire day staring and nodding at the wall like a Jew, depriving myself of the conveniences and the sources of genuinely enjoyable entertainment that are to be had in the 21st century, just because television channels are loaded with commercials and because the mainstream news media presents a certain spin. (I don't even watch TV, anyway, but I do watch the TV programs of my choosing online.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It enrages me when conspiracy theorists try to climb on a high horse and guilt-trip others condescendingly by telling them, "Ha, yes, go watch the Super Bowl, you inferior peasant, you sheep! I'm better than you because I'm cynical and hate my own government and the society I'm a part of! I spend my time fighting The Man on the Internet! Entertaining yourself is stupid!" Alex Jones, as much as I agree with him on quite a few issues, is especially guilty of this.

       There's actually some value to limited escapism. Imagine the life of the ordinary person. What is Average Joe going to do when he gets home from his dead-end job at Starbucks? Watch
       <em>
        Game of Thrones
       </em>
       or read Elder Scrolls lore and be enchanted by pleasant fantasies, or obsess over the conflict in some hellhole 3,000 miles away or about any of the innumerable cases of horrid suffering that is unfolding around the planet at this very second? Which of the two paths leads to greater happiness? Which is more conducive to good mental health, and therefore more evolutionarily advantageous?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not telling you to be a conformist drone. I think that you become the most informed, well-rounded person that you can be when you take in a nice dose of the mixture of poison and candy that is being thrown at you from every angle and from every media outlet. I feel at ease knowing that CNN is State Department propaganda, that Russia Today is Russian Putinist state-funded propaganda, that MSNBC is primarily leftist-liberal propaganda, and that Fox News is primarily cuckservative propaganda. I've tasted, and can thus now recognize, many flavors of propaganda. The same goes for advertising. I'm not such a robot that I will hear an ad and then automatically go and buy the product that someone on my screen is shilling for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still derive pleasure from occasional escapism, but I'm not a programmed slave and, no, spending your free time raging on the Internet and churning out paragraphs in frustration to prove your superiority to other redditors you argue with doesn't necessarily make you (I'm using the plural "you" here) a more evolved being than me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling people here who are already prone to paranoia, "Stop watching TV. Just visit conspiracy forums, cut yourself off from every perspective that is grounded in consensus reality or that seems 'traditional' or 'mainstream,' and distrust everyone so you can feel enlightened by our echo chamber," seems like a toxic message. Just saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get familiar with bullshit so you can immunize yourself to it. And fucking live a little. When a paradigm of thought prevents you from enjoying life freely, or makes you feel like a retard for watching a fucking football game, there's something wrong with it.

       Nah, you didn't come across as having a holier-than-thou attitude. The post in the OP wasn't extreme. You were asking very genuine questions. I was just responding to the general tone of this thread and others I've come across, which tend to shift to the anti-technology extreme. I wanted to make other visitors to this thread question themselves before they go along with the group polarization that is developing here.

       I am not going to live in the stone age just because some politicans are corrupt.

       Sure I don't watch cable TV, I only have it for sports, for business, and I download shows I watch.

       But arguments like we need to get rid of the need of having a new iphone every year and these gadgets and consumership ... sure, but i am not giving up technology because of corrupt bastards.

       I don't think technology in and of itself is inherently evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is the capacity to do so much good with technology, yet in reality it really is used as a distraction.
