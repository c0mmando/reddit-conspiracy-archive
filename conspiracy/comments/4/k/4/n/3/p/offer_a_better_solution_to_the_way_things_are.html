       Respectfully disagree. We the people have the power (money). Every year USA consumers spend over 11 TRILLION dollars. This money buys the assholes a lot of influence, but ultimately it is up to we the people to foot the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people bitch and moan about wasting money on war? 1 trillion in Iraq over 15+ years? Who cares... when compared to about 175 TRILLION in consumer spending during that period.
      </p>
      <p>
       General Boycott is the tactic these assholes will respond to, and nothing else short of violence. I'd how we the people are smart enough to play the boycott card and have the assholes play the violence card. Nothing like some (more) moral high-ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think back to SOPA and GoDaddy. GoDaddy changed their lieing tune in about 48 hours once their bottom line was threatened. Same thing applies to any comany or the aggragate eCONomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem IMHO is what to do AFTER we smash the eCONomy. We the people should stop financing the shit-show via boycotts and focus those dollars/power into infrastructure. Gardens and the like. Stuff that will not be dependant on dollars to provide our future needs. Find something you keep spending on, and solve it once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to look at it: Our employers HAVE to pay us. We do not have to buy their shit.

      </p>
      <p>
       tl-dr; we need to stop playing in the eCONomy and start building the future.

       I think a tribal community system without the notion of personal possession is the only way we can live in perpetual peace.  We are too large and diverse a country to have things like the Federal Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we've gone too far in chasing progress for the sake of progress and forgot to consider that maybe we have not improved our lives over the "savagery" of the native peoples with all our civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a perfect utopia all planned out or anything, but I do think we need to return to simple living and local sustainability.  Each small community should provide themselves with as much of what they need as possible, if not
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       they need.  Trade should be only a pleasure that benefits both parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       No human should control another.  Decisions should be made through communication and participation in your community, and taking personal responsibility for your stake in the community is a value I think we should be instilling over "take a selfie and brag to your friends" or whatever.

       The other day someone posted a link to r/politics (i think, a 'big' sub) and the people there were talking about the USA involvement in 9/11... when the post started off poo-pooing the Saudis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took this as evidence that enough (not all) people are aware of what is going on, but they don't know what to do about it. Future protests I think should focus on alternatives at least as much as exposing truths.

       Wasn't the American Revolution fought with like 3% of the population? If we could get even 3% to boycott the corupto-corps, I'd imagine the other 97% would be brought along for a wild ride!

       The human species drops all the racism and separation propaganda it's constantly bombarded with and is, instead, taught to live and work together in such a manner that money is not even needed in order to exchange goods and services.

       There is a deep, covert, hidden power that pervades all of human society that prevents this from happening, however.

       to do the work for them that they were unwilling to…and I guess it just fell on us.

       And by “us”, I don’t mean “humans”.  We were around before the vehicle of the human body was created.  By “us” I mean the intelligent non-corporeal identities that

       the vehicle of the human body.

       It's not a belief.  It's an intelligent assessment based on the study of relevant information and data - a far different, more potent thing altogether.

       One need not understand the mechanics of ensoulment to understand that there is a dynamic of power manipulation on this planet and that there are groups overseeing and in charge of it.

       Understood.  Most things one doesn't understand do indeed sound like fantasy.  Turning a basic flashlight on would be considered veritable magic to a Sentinelese bushman who's never seen such a thing before in his life.

       You wouldn't know the content of the book, as you haven't read it - yet are passing judgement on it by trying to reference another source which you are also attempting to marginalize.

       lol.  Okay, son.  You're trying way too hard to make a non-point and try to save face for some reason.  You're doing nothing, and your attempting to protect your ego by trying to marginalize the information shows an extremely fragile personality that has

       little prospects of actually learning anything of any real import.

       make things better.

      <p>
       End all foreign alliances. Let the rest of the world pay for its own defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deport all illegals immediately. Shoot any who resist deportation. Build a wall on the southern border.
      </p>
      <p>
       End all welfare. Transition retirement to private corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Destroy the ACA. Destroy the pharmaceutical companies. Rebuild the AMA with simpler licensing.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this, all other things are simple.

       Your plan would deteriorate the world twice as fast. I can see none of you think long term.

       Too fucking bad. It’s what must be done. Don’t like it, don’t resist. Shouldn’t have come here illegally in the first place.
