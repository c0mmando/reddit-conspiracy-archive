We all see what&#39;s happening around us.We all see through their lies and can think for ourselves. We are the unplugged. Isn&#39;t it time we collectively...together...did something to make a change? To stop all that is wrong with our planet? </p>

<p>Great...It&#39;s one thing to be a keyboard cowboy to voice your opposition to our global enslavement, but we need to wake everyone else up including those who don&#39;t want to wake up...to what&#39;s going on in this world. We are being lied to. We need to organize and say enough is enough. Isn&#39;t it time we all stood up and shouted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_qgVn-Op7Q">&quot;I&#39;m as mad as hell, and I&#39;m not going to take this anymore!&quot;</a></p>

<p>If you are for change, real change, reply to this thread with ways we can stop this global corruption of our society. We deserve a better planet. Who&#39;s coming with me? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you of all people should know that it is not ok. The real question here is are either of us having a better life for having been raped? Must be somenanger there...or castrated white males wouldn&#39;t have been part.of this at all. Usually it is the ones with the biggest chip that carry the biggest wedge. I am truly sorry you had to live through that. Attacking anyone other than your abuser is somehow highly ineffective. In my case, looks to me like the .gov folks may have had something to do with it. I would very much like to find a solution to and please do pay attention: to the systematic abuse of children by left handpath pikers. Look at that: problem named.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t raped. I was molested. I guess in that respect I was lucky.</p>

<p>As regards your castrated white male meme. It&#39;s not a meme. It&#39;s a global phenomena. And it&#39;s happening in Asia also. It&#39;s a spiritual castration and I think we all know it&#39;s perpetrated through the media. </p>

<p>My original point was, will the weaklings fight or submit.</p>

<p>I think a great many will submit. And if so then so be it.</p>

<p>We are at a stage where those who want to wake up have already. Those who need more convincing risk becoming a waste of your own precious resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, we need a well connected and somewhat famous leader. We all have this perspective of world events in common which is good, but we have nowhere to take it from here. We also need people with enough energy to move from their keyboards and become activists on the street of Washington DC. AS with recent big protests in DC, the MSM ignored them and since it is the MSM that creates reality for the majority of the people, its as if they never happened.</p>

<p>As one person, we can all email and call our representatives on the issues and let them know we are quite aware of what is going on and ask them to vote in accordance with what is best for the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The solution is quite simply Slack.</p>

<p>We&#39;re under a hierarchy.  Hierarchies aka Hero Narratives are bad design.  They don&#39;t model reality efficiently as complexity increases.  They&#39;re brittle.  The Hero Nodes have obvious failure modes:  they can be wrong; they can be bought; they can be coerced; they have limited knowledge.  As the Hero Ledge becomes higher and higher, the Hero Slope becomes harder and harder to climb, the number of Heroes decreases and everyone else increases.  This creates a scale burden of responsibility.  In other words, as the Heroes become more insular/nepotic, their burden to be Heroic increases in both domain and scope of responsibility.  As I mentioned earlier, hierarchical design doesn&#39;t scale to complexity well (it scales combinatorically to be precise), and the Heroes are confronted with this challenge.  Their natural instinct to this challenge is to over-simplify - and we see this in policy all the time.   Anyway the natural progression of this dynamic is the system forces conformity as a way of handling its complexity + scale problem.   Conformity, however, doesn&#39;t solve the design problems the Heroes are mismanaging and thus, the systems become more and more susceptible to edge condition events that have far-reaching consequence.  In other words they become brittle, and generally unable to adapt.  This is basically what I see happening in the real world as well - in gov and industry.</p>

<p>To stop a Hero System (particularly a machine-like one with no single operator) one must increase the Hero Burden.   In other words, <em>encourage</em> the Heros, lol.  Let them build up their Hero Ledge.  Give them <em>more</em> power.  Shit like that.  As with all duality that is in balance both sides are equal.  The opposite of a Hero is a Victim (if you can avoid the Villain category, and that&#39;s where Slack comes in).  Embrace your Victimhood.   This buys you time (which is really the only thing, other than your own thoughts, that one has).  The Church of the Subgenius goes into this quite well. </p>

<p>Praise Bob</p>

<p>Also grow your own food and network with likeminded (put your shill glasses on first!).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t address defensive strategies.  Basically the control system is a machine.  It requires people to interact with it.  So limit your interactions with The Machine.  If you have to deal with The Machine, make sure the requirements asked of you are exactly, perfectly clear - and if they aren&#39;t keep asking for clarification!  Do this in a loop until your burden is very clear.  This tactic makes The Machine  do most of the cycles.   It&#39;s a jits type of philosophy.</p>

<p>If you have to avoid The Machine, this will increase your personal responsibility burden like feeding yourself, housing yourself, etc.  But you should be getting control of these things anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you of all people should know that it is not ok. The real question here is are either of us having a better life for having been raped? Must be somenanger there...or castrated white males wouldn&#39;t have been part.of this at all. Usually it is the ones with the biggest chip that carry the biggest wedge. I am truly sorry you had to live through that. Attacking anyone other than your abuser is somehow highly ineffective. In my case, looks to me like the .gov folks may have had something to do with it. I would very much like to find a solution to and please do pay attention: to the systematic abuse of children by left handpath pikers. Look at that: problem named.</p>
