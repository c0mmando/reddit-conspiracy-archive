        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This website, the <a href="http://www.marioninstitute.org/biological-medicine-network/resources/articles/castor-oil-essential-health">marioninstitute.org</a>, has published very dangerous disinformation, highlighted in bold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first medicinal prescription of castor oil may have been in pre-Christian times. <strong><em>The Egyptian physicians instructed to chew the seeds of the plant with beer to relieve constipation (2) while the Aztecs used the oil externally to treat skin lesions and hemorrhoids (3)</em></strong>. The Chinese used it to induce childbirth and expel the placenta (1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Castor beans (&quot;seeds of the plant&quot;) have <em>never, ever</em> been used medicinally, as they are highly poisonous.  Not toxic: deadly.  They contain ricin, 4-8 chewed, crushed or swallowed beans is enough to kill an adult (~1mg ricin), 1 bean can kill a child.  It kills people within 3-4 days.  If it doesn&#39;t arrest the breathing, it will destroy the liver and kidneys and destroy protein synthesis on a cellular level as one molecule of ricin can destroy 2000 cellular ribosomes.  Farmers grow it to control gophers and aphids and other &#39;sucker&#39; parasitic insects as a &#39;trap plant&#39;.  The oil is used in skincare because ricin is not oil soluble so the oil contains no ricin.  This is poison which Walter White from Breaking Bad refined in the kitchen.</p>

<p>This plant has <em>never</em> been used medicinally and therefore this website to publish this info is an attempt to kill people, specifically those with HIV.  I have been an informal herbalist for 20 yrs and I treat myself with herbs.  I&#39;ve read at least 30 books on herbalism, and they all list some poisonous plants never used in herbalism--this is one.  The other ones include henbane, monkshood (curare), tropane plants.  Those plants are sometimes used in witchcraft &#39;flying ointments&#39; for their &#39;magical properties&#39;.  Castor plant is not even among those if that tells you anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scientifically, castor oil has demonstrated immune stimulating properties. The oil may also have antiviral properties. The ricin, a substance in the bean, has been shown to kill the HIV virus in test-tube trials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no it hasn&#39;t.  This was written by someone who either doesn&#39;t know what they are talking about or has dumbed this down and conflated the oil with the ricin on purpose to try to confuse people into making a mistake in self-treatment.  This <a href="http://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/toxicagents/ricin.html">Cornell University infopage on Castor / Ricin</a> clarifies that yes research has been done with bone marrow transplants.  Specifically, that ricin has been demonstrated to destroy immunotoxins from the donor in order to prepare the bone marrow to transplant to a recipient--it has nothing, literally nothing to do with HIV or AIDS.  The only thing that could be construed from this is the fact that bone marrow transplants have been evaluated for treating AIDS, which has shown to be a mixed success.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s crap.  The whole marioninstitute blog is crap.</p>

<p>And of course, when people with HIV end up dying from castor beans, then this will be ammunition for the FDA and Pharma industry to join forces yet again to try to tighten control over natural health herbs, alternative health and the green grocery industry.</p>

<p>Another thing they mentioned is Edgar Cayce.  An occultist.  This is the <strong><em>calling card, folks</em></strong>.  This is how you know who put this blog out there and what they are up to.  They want to kill stupider people, especially those with AIDS.  The real problem with their AIDS is it doesn&#39;t work as well as they wanted.</p>

<p>You get to the heart of modern Western medicine and media with this statement: consider the mainstream information on sunlight, cancer treatments, heart disease (cholesterol, statins, etc.), pharmaceutical drugs vs. natural drugs, and on and on.... If something makes it to the mainstream as &quot;good for you,&quot; its media budget is directly proportional to how fast it will fuck you up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....my read on this is....Masons are a magic umbrella. Some, mostly non aware good guys there. But it is just a filter. Using some one else terminology here. Systems are self sorting...I.e. Psychopaths can relate to psychopaths. So within, when characters are known and exposed, weakness are exploited. When we look into Masonic symbolisms and sigils we can see that the two pillars are left and right. The symbols lead to Gnostic texts where if we look we see a left hand path and a right hand path. Self. Vs others. To make service to self by abusive practices and control of  others is quite simply evil. So yes. Left-hand path pikers....not Masons. Leftovernaziscumsatanists. You helped me get here. Please tell me I am wrong. I want to be batshit crazy on this. But, no...no evidence to the contrary. The TRIVIUM of Rome London DC.. Has its duality....this is straight sigil to Gnostic texts...</p>

<p>And what about the beer? What&#39;s in the beer? Could there be something in it that counteracts the deadly effects?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unbelievable. 
In addition to your wonderful post, I would like to add one that I discovered recently:</p>

<p>Do a google search for cinnamon cassia benefits.</p>

<p>The first result is a website (herbwisdom) that has the benefits of cinnamon ceylon (real cinnamon) listed, NOT cassia, but it is still labeled as cassia. The dosages for ceylon is three times per day, whereas cassia is only once per day due to the toxic content. This is dangerous! Someone in the comments even points this out, yet the article remains the same. This could make certain people very sick as cassia contains coumarin which is a hepatotoxin that has been banned in several manufacturing processes such as food additives, cigarettes, etc. due to coumarin having been compared to rat poison. In utero it causes neurological damage, which is why it&#39;s important that a person distinguishes the differences between the two. Don&#39;t take my word though, do the research. I did, and I&#39;m glad that I did!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plant of the Week
[A-Z]
Castor Bean, Mole Bean
Latin: Ricinus communis
Picture of Castor Bean (or Mole Bean) plant showing red and reddish-green leaves.</p>

<p>The bold look is back in garden design, so not surprisingly, castor beans have reappeared as backdrops for gardeners wanting to make a prominent statement in their plantings. Everything about castor bean is bold and a bit audacious, so gardeners with a bit of maverick in them seem to be drawn to this big plant.</p>

<p>Castor bean (Ricinus communis) is a member of the spurge family and is native to tropical Africa where it grows as a tree to 40 feet tall. When grown as an annual it is usually a more modest 10 feet tall. Its leaves are star shaped with five to nine lobes and can be as large as a garbage can lid. The selections grown as ornamentals usually have a maroon tinge to the foliage.</p>

<p>The flowers of castor bean are borne near the top of the plant in panicles. But lacking petals they are not especially noteworthy. As the seed mature, the three-celled, spiny capsules turn bright red on foot long panicles and make an interesting distraction to the bold foliage.</p>

<p>The castor bean seed looks like an engorged dog tick in size and shape. It is from the extracts of this seed that castor bean gains its real significance. The oil is used commercially for everything from lubrication to cosmetics and is one of the most important industrial crop oils.</p>

<p><strong>Like most children of my generation, my first encounter with castor oil was as a not-so-gentle laxative. The purgative powers of castor bean have long been known. The ancient Egyptians believed that food was the source of disease, so they drank beer laced with castor bean three times a month for a hearty flush of the digestive track.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As a teen-ager my encounter with castor bean expanded when I tried Castrol motor oil in hopes it would make my old Ford run like a race car. It didn’t help. The oil is used commercially in cosmetics, medicine and waterproofing treatments.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But castor bean seeds have one other characteristic that merits attention - they are poisonous. The poison is ricin, a proteinaceous molecule similar in structure and mode of action to the bacterial toxin found in anthrax. It’s said to be 1,000 times mote toxic than cobra venom.</strong></p>

<p>Castor bean is sometimes called mole plant from the practice of placing castor bean seeds in mole runs where the rodents will hopefully eat the seeds and perish. When you spot a castor bean growing in the middle of someone’s lawn, you can bet that the moles missed one.</p>

<p><strong>Because of poor absorption of the phtotoxin from seed, fatalities from accidentally ingested seeds are uncommon. In fact, I can find no direct reports of fatalities from the seeds unless some nefarious plot was at work. But prudence dictates that castor bean plants should not be planted if small children are around.</strong></p>

<p>Ricin has its own footnote in Cold War history. Georgi Markov (1929 - 1978), a dissident Bulgarian journalist who worked for the BBC and Radio Free Europe earned the animosity of Bulgarian State Security.</p>

<p>After his mysterious death in 1978, Scotland Yard investigated and found embedded in his leg a BB that had been cross-drilled with holes. The BB was fired from an umbrella rigged as a pellet rifle while Markov stood in line at a bus stop. The holes in the BB had been packed with ricin.</p>

<p>Three schemes were uncovered in the US between 1991 and 1997 in which ricin was intended to be used in murder. The most notorious of these involved a separatist organization in Minnesota that plotted to assassinate a local U.S. marshal by dosing the doorknob of his home with the poison.</p>

<p>Castor beans, despite their colorful history, are still good garden plants. They are best used at the back of the flower border where they form a fast growing, bold screen. Seeds should be planted where the plant is to stand in mid spring after the last chance of frost is past. They do best in full sun in any good garden soil. They are intolerant of wet locations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are at least three incorrect statements in that.  I&#39;m not going to spend the time dissecting it but I&#39;ll say this.  They don&#39;t work for moles and everyone knows that.  They are repelled by the scent of castor oil, so why would they eat the beans?  Everyone who has had moles and searched for solutions knows that this castor thing is a myth.  You might as well fight them with dynamite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you&#39;re right. However, not everyone knows that. I didn&#39;t know that. There are several foods that smell horrid but taste fine or vice versa. My previous questions was curious about the fact they said they ingested the seeds/beans with beer. Why beer? You seem to know everything about this particular subject, do you happen to know if there&#39;s something in beer that counteracts the effects of the plant?</p>
