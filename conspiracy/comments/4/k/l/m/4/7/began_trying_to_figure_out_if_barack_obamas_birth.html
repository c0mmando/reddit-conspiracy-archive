       Edit #2:
       <strong>
        A fellow redditor in this thread enlightened me with a video of great importance if one wants to not be in the box on the issue of Obama's potential fake birth certificate.
       </strong>
       It's about
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG2">
        JBIG2
       </a>
       compression (For what's relevant to this thread, see "Pattern matching and substitution",) and if the scanner or software used, applied this algorithm.  The video is long but here it is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0O6UXrOZJo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0O6UXrOZJo
       </a>
       Essentially, the algorithm looks to reduce the file size as much as possible; one technique being to find the same symbols (in this case, many characters, one of which is a checkbox which weren't originally perfectly pixel similar) and replace them we one that is, effectively increasing the compression ratio of the final pdf image.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There are still some very important questions I have.
       </strong>
       Why did the algorithm only pick up on two checkboxes, probably one of the most easily computationally identifiable 'Symbols'?  And then why is the center (void) of the identical checkboxes different?  Why only a handful of characters are duplicated?  This algorithm certainly doesn't answer all my questions (at least yet) but knowing more about JBIG2 is still helpful before I would ever take this theory any further.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I started with the PDF straight from the viper's den (whitehouse.gov) (File location:
       <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf#page=1">
        https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf#page=1
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me, I know this sounds downright bizarre, but let's suppose Obama's birth certificate is not a complete fake; I have really strong evidence that it has been altered in both of the sections having to do with twin status.   Hmm... what might this indicate?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I thought I was doing was checking for the whole certificate being fradulent.  I know there are analyses and reviews of supposed digital experts which claim without a doubt that it's fake, and some of the propositions hold up, but others do not.  Regardless, i'm not
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       convinced it's a complete fabrication, especially after I brought to light what I'm about to explain.  So let's just go with that for now:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my full explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       When we look at the "question 3: This birth" checkbox for twins and "question 4: if twins or triplets was child born ..." checkbox for 1st/2nd, we find both been copied from another place in the document (the former from question 7g, and the latter either from Q3 1st to 2nd checkbox or 2nd to 1st; it doesn't matter which, just that the checkboxes are identical; one of them most probably were crossed in the original.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the evidence in as best a form as I could produce for all of you:
      </p>
      <p>
       Q3: This birth:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/FXZ9aYQ">
        http://imgur.com/FXZ9aYQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Q4: If twin or triplet, was child born:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/wuACdGf">
        http://imgur.com/wuACdGf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about it. There is absolutely no reason those check boxes should overlay on one another pixel perfectly. The birth certificate was printed with the crappiest of printers in the 1950's. We should expect all of those checkboxes to not align perfectly and all of them dont except for the two I pointed out.  This is established with the following picture where of all of the checkboxes in the form, which I clipped and put in one place for comparison:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/QiaQOFU">
        All checkboxes compared
       </a>
       .  Notice that all of the checkboxes are substantially different as you'd expect them to be, except for the two ("four") highlighted in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, It doesnt automatically mean he must have a twin but its really solid evidence that those two checkboxes were doctored. Now I ask the readers here: Why would those two checkboxes be altered digitally? Other than that they have concealed his twin, I personally come up with nothing.
      </p>

       Edit #1:  If Obama dies or is assassinated before his term ends and then is "resurrected" and praised as the next Jesus Christ, we'll know this theory holds weight.  I urge all to not fall for this Magick trick if it happens (Just a prediction which most likely won't come true)

       Just added that for a fun prediction.  If he has a twin, this is, after all, an ace card they hold in their slimy hands.

       If this happens, than everything will be full circle. People have been saying this since he was first elected. I wouldn't put it past them though. This goes along with my "Force the Hand of God" theory that I feel like has been happening for awhile.

       Ok, I'll try my best. So using Christianity as the prism of understanding since the US was founded on Christian principles and US presidents publicly align with Christianity. Ok so the bible which has many stories, but amongst those stories is Revelations which outlines the "endtimes" that would affect people in the future. It's the only "provable" evidence to the bible in many ways as the rest of the bible needs to be accepted with a serving of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been saying the endtimes are coming, have been saying so for a long time. In many ways, it is almost as if mankind is using the Christian "endtimes" as a litmus test for the rest of the bible. For example, if predictions/conditions for the "endtimes" start happening: the Anti-Christ assassination/resurrection, natural disasters, continuous war in the middle east leading to Armageddon, etc. then the bible must have some truth in it and it may be easier for people to have faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we constantly "Force the Hand of God" with manmade conditions for the "endtimes" and the end never comes. Jesus never returns, the big collective orgasm never happens, then people will stop paying attention. You can only cry wolf so many times. If this happens, then bible is lies, most other religions are lies and we can get on with this one world government already because there is no authority besides man. If that's the case, than our amoral leaders can justify themselves because this realm is literally nothing but survival of the fittest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, there's a lot of ways to look at this. Perhaps preaching and acting upon the "endtimes" is just a disinfo campaign to God and his follows. With so much information out there, how can you sort between which is useful and which is misleading?

       do you know who the evagelicals really are?  they are some very powerful people in american politics.  anyway, they are actively trying to bring the end times.  and this is not a conspiracy theory, this is their openly stated goal.  and they have found the perfect dancing partner in the form of ISIS, because in their version of the end times, jesus comes back after a fight between the worlds true muslims (ISIS) and the non believers in a city in syiia called dabbiq, which isis controls now.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you have 2 powerful groups in the world, both war hungry and fighting each other to rub some hurry on the return of jesus.  isnt that kind of fucked up?!

       when you start quoting revelations, say goodbye to most of your audience.  its a book of the bible written in such a way that you can make literally anything about it.  a friend of mine just got the clap and took some antibiotics to cure it.  is he the beast with 2 heads that has a wound that is miraculously healed?

       Christianity and Islam are the exact same religion, except Islam believes the savior hasn't come yet, Christianity believes he's already been here and will come back.

       Every other aspect of the 2 religions is exactly the same. It's a dividing mechanism created by the elites. Christians fear Muslims right now, because they're violent and want to kill us because we don't believe in Mohammed, but in Bible it literally said kill those who don't convert. Just like Christians think Muslims want to do. Both are/will be born to a virgin. Both speak of a Holy Trinity.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you carefully study other religions those religious leaders too had virgin or miraculous births similar to jesus.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to islam when Mohammad's mother Amina was sleeping Allah sopke to her in a dream and told her that she will give birth to a prophet who will be a messenger to his people. A few days later she conceived Mohammad
       </p>
       <p>
        When Buddha's mother Queen Maya was sleeping she had a dream. In this dream she was walking in the garden and saw a white elephant coming towards her and kneeling before her. Then she felt a child moving in her tummy. When she woke up she was pregnant with siddartha who later became the buddha.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the Hindu vedic scriptures the baby lord krishna was placed in his mothers womb by the God Shiva.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can go on and on about every religion and sect and belief which originated in the past about how all their leaders had virgin or miraculous births. But i have given 3 examples above.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you read these accounts how can you say that jesus was the only person who had a miraculous or virgin birth, when according to mythology other religious leaders too had similar miraculous births?
       </p>

       I know this link proves nothing, but arguing with a Christian is impossible to win because their mind is already made up, so no link will ever suffice, But this gives you the jist. But I've dug really deep into religion and they're literally all the same thing. That's when I realized that religions are controlling mechanism to:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Keep people segregated (same with feminism, race, sexuality, ethnic group etc..)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Keep people submissive (this is all in God's plan, so I better not interfere)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tricks people into tithing, which is a free tax on the poor and gullible, just like the lottery, and charities.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I'm not against the idea of a god, because I'm open-minded to the possibility of anything, but the religions that are most "mainstream," are fake just like everything else in America. A big show, like WWE.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I will say is this, if God/Jesus Christ are loving, all-knowing, powerful and a miracle worker, why would God put all the information in front of me telling me that the elite created the religions to control us after being a devote Christian for 27 years? I grew up in the church, I can still recite scriptures, I know the Bible better than most Christians I know. If God is so pure and gracious and omnipotent and predestination exists through the eyes of God, how did he create evil? How could evil come from such a holy being? Makes no sense to me.

       It's funny you stumbled on this. The Soviets used twins as spies. In America, both sleeper agents were given a single identity -- so that they could be "one man, in two places". Communist Cuba followed Soviet methodology, and did the same thing. See Antonio and Patricio De La Guardia:

       What's interesting about Obama possibly being a twin is that the Russians were bragging back in the 1970s that they had a mole in America. "A young man who's half-African. He's going to be President in a few cycles," they bragged.
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be interesting if Obama was really two different people, part of the same infiltrator program that used other sets of twins.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: Depending upon how far you want to go down that rabbit hole, there's a fascinating take on Lee Harvey Oswald being two different people, as well. One woman [named Laura Kittrell] claims to have seen both men:

       Before asking "why" and then saying it didn't happen because you fail to come up with a "why" just evaluate the evidence presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is something I've learned after digging into conspiracy for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell the same thing to most that respond in the way you did and usually they come to see my logic as sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, there happen to be answers to the "why" but we don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       one to evaluate the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the why? Just let your imagination work on it for a little.  Why might it be beneficial to have two people able to play the role of a president?

       Good find on the two sets of identical boxes OP. I think that is highly suggestive that the birth certificate is fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far I've found these other instances of identical characters (down to the last pixel) which point to a cut and paste job like the boxes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The '7' in 7d and 7f are identical.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The period after 7d is the same as the one after 8.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The two 'd' characters in 'address' are identical in box 7f.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first 'I' in CERTIFICATE at top and the 'I' in LIVE at top are identical.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first 'T' in CERTIFICATE at top and the 'T' in BIRTH at top are identical.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The '1' digits in FILE NUMBER 151 are identical.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Multiple 't' and 'i' characters in the 6e heading "Name of Hospital or Institution..." are identical to one another. EDIT: actually these 't' and 'i' characters are repeated heavily throughout the whole document.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's more also... just got tired of writing. This thing has to be a photoshop I think.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       When I was searching for these, it helps to cross your eyes so that the two characters lock on top of each other, that way it is easier to verify that they are identical. Too lazy to make the gifs like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Looks like this was all a false alarm. The identical-pixel characters most likely arose from a JBIG2 compression algorithm that modifies the content of scanned documents in order to reduce filesize. Hat tip to

       Just confirmed all of these.  Honestly, this surely hurts the theory presented in my OP, as if it was only the twins then I'd be much more sure something was up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perps may just be messing with the analyzers of the authenticity (us).  Leave valuable clues and then tack on more identical characters; for the characters you pointed out don't necessarily need to be duplicated in this manner.  I just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, thanks for your help in finding more instances of this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S for anyone else who is looking to either confirm these or look for more, no need to cross eyes or do anything but clip a layer of character(s), make them slightly opaque (50-70 or so?) and then drag them around to find where all pixels align.  It's not hard at all.

       It's probably just laziness on the part of whoever forged it? There are duplicate characters everywhere in that document. Even a lot of the periods are duplicates of one another. I stopped updating my post I found so many. So yeah it's definitely not exclusive to the twins part. The entire thing appears to be a sloppily doctored document.

       Stop trying to defend something which is an odd aberration.  I already admitted that because this type of aberration is found in more than the check boxes, that it's a possibility the clues were confounded by other negligibly meaningful copy and pastes.  Or that it's a completely fake birth certificate.  We should be concerned
       <strong>
        either way
       </strong>
       .  And I said in my title "I have really strong evidence"  I didn't say he is a twin, I actually said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No, It doesnt automatically mean he must have a twin but its really solid evidence that
        <strong>
         those two checkboxes were doctored.
        </strong>
        Now I ask the readers here: Why would those two checkboxes be altered digitally? Other than that they have concealed his twin, I
        <strong>
         personally
        </strong>
        come up with nothing [of reasonable explanatory value].
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then I responded reasonable to the posts pointing out other similar identical characters.
       <strong>
        Are you even trying to read this thread
       </strong>
       or just want to start a shitstorm?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you admit maybe they were "running out of scanner light" (whatever that means in 2010+) and had to resort to copy and pasting?  What the fuck is that?  A "plausible deniability sheep comment" if I've ever seen one.  Who would possibly think it's a good idea to waste time and resources on this idiotic "fixing of blurry or illegible characters" like you apparently claim?  Instead of just scanning it again, or just posting an unaltered scanned version
       <strong>
        without digital fix-ups
       </strong>
       .   And finally I am sad to say, no, it's not "shitty resolution", you clearly have not examined the document closely.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sir, are a steaming load of idiocy if you are going to stick to the arguments presented in your post above.

       I am not sure of what you are claiming but the checked box for #7 does not match the checked box for single birth pixel for pixel, but the lower right corner seems to. Perhaps the left half was cleaned up?

       Yes I tried to match that X.  It is vaguely close to one of the X's thats severely blurred out.  And if it was a match, there is a reason that X is so visibly blurred/smeared (although other characters are also blurred.)

       Thanks a ton.  This is the closest to coming to understanding this non-aberration of characters.  I'm putting it at the top of my post since it's really important.  That being said, finding out what scanner was used or if whatever software used to export the image uses that algorithm or one similar would help.  Anyway, I now have a grasp of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBIG2">
        JBIG2
       </a>
       compression now.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But
       </strong>
       there are still some questions I have and I'll probably need to dig into the internals of the algorithm to find out the answers (Unless you are a data/image compression scientist.)  Why did the algorithm only pick up on two checkboxes, probably one of the most easily computationally identifiable 'Symbols'?  And then why is the center (void) of the identical checkboxes different?  Why only a handful of characters are duplicated?  This algorithm certainly doesn't answer all my questions (at least yet) but knowing more about JBIG2 is still helpful before I would ever take this theory any further.

       Well, it's fascinating, because the first thing I did after coming across this solid evidence and then postulating the theory that Obama was a twin, was some searching on the internet for "Obama" and "twins" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lo and behold, others have generated the theory that Obama is a twin and present different evidence than what I show above.  To be completely honest, before hand I'd have thought they were crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       No longer do I think they are crazy.  They are more than likely, correct.

       Some of the evidence includes
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The scar on his head
       </li>
       <li>
        Noticably differences between public appearances ("Body double")
       </li>
       <li>
        Ridiculous amount of time devoted to bullshit talk show appearances and social media indulgences.  Yes, we are now in the digital age, but the amount of time he wastes gaining and entertaining fans is off the charts.

       If there are two acting presidents, one is clearly the social media wizard, teleprompter reading, human presence, and the other, probably the one meeting with generals discussing things that "matter" ... er, like which country/location to autonomously bomb next, while shining his Nobel Peace Prize.

       IF I was a twin, and was rising to power, and most people didn't know, nor was it publicized. I would hide it, without question. For fear of my brother getting jacked up cause he looks like me.

       The video you linked is mostly fluff by the way and a waste of ten minutes.  I've read an actual list of points which point to total fakery along with examining the birth certificate very closely and doing my best to come to my own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Several layers" seems to be most of what is focused on in this particular video.  But I'm not dull enough to jump on that like Alex Jones and crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       This explanation makes perfect sense, at least to me, and believe me when I say I am willing to believe otherwise:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you scan a doc with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) turned on, Adobe Acrobat is capable of taking a scanned doc and breaking it out into layers automatically. That's what seems to have happened here. There are still one or two funky anomalies, like the text in box 17a getting split into two separate layers and the date in 20 getting its own, but OCR is an imperfect beast and stuff like that happens. The larger question seems to be settled on how the cert got broken out into layers: Adobe did it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What's your issue with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I hope you read my whole post, because regardless of whether or not the document is fake there is solid evidence of tom-foolery.  So let's just go play along with the document is real for the time being.
       <strong>
        In this case, I'm simply pointing out the blatant identical checkboxes which point to Obama being a twin
       </strong>
       . Why these two checkboxes...?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask me, the perps might be utilizing/harnessing/directing classic misdirection towards fake or not fake.

       Just confirmed all of these.  Honestly, this surely hurts the theory presented in my OP, as if it was only the twins then I'd be much more sure something was up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perps may just be messing with the analyzers of the authenticity (us).  Leave valuable clues and then tack on more identical characters; for the characters you pointed out don't necessarily need to be duplicated in this manner.  I just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, thanks for your help in finding more instances of this happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S for anyone else who is looking to either confirm these or look for more, no need to cross eyes or do anything but clip a layer of character(s), make them slightly opaque (50-70 or so?) and then drag them around to find where all pixels align.  It's not hard at all.

       I'm not from America so I wouldn't know but it looks like the certificate is a scan of a booklet? So I assumed there are more pages.
Maybe not publicized or I am mistaken.
