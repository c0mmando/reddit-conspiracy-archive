        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the last canto of the Bhagavata Purana there is a list of predictions and prophecies about the dark times for the present age of Kali Yuga. The following 15 predictions, written 5,000 years ago by sage Vedavyasa, are amazing because they appear so accurate. Despite the negative tone of these prophecies, there is still one bright spot for all of us, which is mentioned at the end.</p>

<p>Prediction 1:</p>

<p>Religion, truthfulness, cleanliness, tolerance, mercy, duration of life, physical strength and memory will all diminish day by day because of the powerful influence of the age of Kali.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.1</p>

<p>sri-suka uvaca
tatas canu-dinam dharmah
satyam saucam ksama daya
kalena balina rajan
nanksyaty ayur balam smrtih</p>

<p>Prediction 2:</p>

<p>In Kali Yuga, wealth alone will be considered the sign of a man’s good birth, proper behaviour and fine qualities. And law and justice will be applied only on the basis of one’s power.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.2</p>

<p>vittam eva kalau nṝṇāḿ
janmācāra-guṇodayaḥ
dharma-nyāya-vyavasthāyāḿ
kāraṇaḿ balam eva hi</p>

<p>Prediction 3:</p>

<p>Men and women will live together merely because of superficial attraction, and success in business will depend on deceit. Womanliness and manliness will be judged according to one’s expertise in sex, and a man will be known as a brahmana just by his wearing a thread.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.3</p>

<p>dāmpatye ‘bhirucir hetur
māyaiva vyāvahārike
strītve puḿstve ca hi ratir
vipratve sūtram eva hi</p>

<p>Prediction 4:</p>

<p>A person’s spiritual position will be ascertained merely according to external symbols, and on that same basis people will change from one spiritual order to the next. A person’s propriety will be seriously questioned if he dos not earn a good living. And one who is very clever at juggling words will be considered a learned scholar.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.4</p>

<p>lińgaḿ evāśrama-khyātāv
anyonyāpatti-kāraṇam
avṛttyā nyāya-daurbalyaḿ
pāṇḍitye cāpalaḿ vacaḥ</p>

<p>Prediction 5:</p>

<p>A person will be judged unholy if he does not have money, and hypocrisy will be accepted as virtue. Marriage will be arranged simply by verbal agreement, and a person will think he is fit to appear in public if he has merely taken a bath.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.5</p>

<p>anāḍhyataivāsādhutve
sādhutve dambha eva tu
svīkāra eva codvāhe
snānam eva prasādhanam</p>

<p>Prediction 6:</p>

<p>A sacred place will be taken to consist of no more than a reservoir of water located at a distance, and beauty will be thought to depend on one’s hairstyle. Filling the belly will become the goal of life, and one who is audacious will be accepted as truthful. He who can maintain a family will be regarded as an expert man, and the principles of religion will be observed only for the sake of reputation.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.6</p>

<p>dūre vāry-ayanaḿ tīrthaḿ

satyatve dhārṣṭyam eva hi
dākṣyaḿ kuṭumba-bharaṇaḿ
yaśo ‘rthe dharma-sevanam</p>

<p>Prediction 7:</p>

<p>As the earth thus becomes crowded with a corrupt population, whoever among any of ther social classes shows himself to be the strongest will gain political power.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.7</p>

<p>evaḿ prajābhir duṣṭābhir
ākīrṇe kṣiti-maṇḍale
brahma-viṭ-kṣatra-śūdrāṇāḿ
yo balī bhavitā nṛpaḥ</p>

<p>Prediction 8:</p>

<p>Harassed by famine and excessive taxes, people will resort to eating leaves, roots, flesh, wild honey, fruits, flowers and seeds. Struck by drought, they will become completely ruined.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.9</p>

<p>śāka-mūlāmiṣa-kṣaudra-
phala-puṣpāṣṭi-bhojanāḥ
anāvṛṣṭyā vinańkṣyanti
durbhikṣa-kara-pīḍitāḥ</p>

<p>Prediction 9:</p>

<p>The citizens will suffer greatly from cold, wind, heat, rain and snow. They will be further tormented by quarrels, hunger, thirst, disease and severe anxiety.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.10</p>

<p>śīta-vātātapa-prāvṛḍ-
himair anyonyataḥ prajāḥ
kṣut-tṛḍbhyāḿ vyādhibhiś caiva

<p>Prediction 10:</p>

<p>The maximum duration of life for human beings in Kali Yuga will become 50 years.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.11</p>

<p>triḿśad viḿśati varṣāṇi
paramāyuḥ kalau nṛṇām</p>

<p>Prediction 11:</p>

<p>Men will no longer protect their elderly parents.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.42</p>

<p>na rakshishyanti manujah
sthavirau pitarav api</p>

<p>Prediction 12:</p>

<p>In Kali-yuga men will develop hatred for each other even over a few coins. Giving up all friendly relations, they will be ready to lose their own lives and kill even their own relatives.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.41</p>

<p>kalau kakinike ‘py arthe
vigrihya tyakta-sauhridah
tyakshyanti ca priyan pranan
hanishyanti svakan api</p>

<p>Prediction 13:</p>

<p>Uncultured men will accept charity on behalf of the Lord and will earn their livelihood by making a show of austerity and wearing a mendicant’s dress. Those who know nothing about religion will mount a high seat and presume to speak on religious principles.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.38</p>

<p>sudrah pratigrahishyanti
tapo-veshopajivinah
dharmam vakshyanty adharma-jna
adhiruhyottamasanam</p>

<p>Prediction 14:</p>

<p>Servants will abandon a master who has lost his wealth, even if that master is a saintly person of exemplary character. Masters will abandon an incapacitated servant, even if that servant has been in the family for generations. Cows will be abandoned or killed when they stop giving milk.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.36</p>

<p>patim tyakshyanti nirdravyam
bhritya apy akhilottamam
bhrityam vipannam patayah
kaulam gas capayasvinih</p>

<p>Prediction 15:</p>

<p>Cities will be dominated by thieves, the Vedas will be contaminated by speculative interpretations of atheists, political leaders will virtually consume the citizens, and the so-called priests and intellectuals will be devotees of their bellies and genitals.</p>

<p>Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.32</p>

<p>dasyutkrishta janapada
vedah pashanda-dushitah
rajanas ca praja-bhakshah
sisnodara-para dvijah</p>

<p>Despite all of these dark prophecies, there is one good quality in this age of Kali yuga:</p>

<p>kaler dosha-nidhe rajann
asti hy eko maha gunah
kirtanad eva krishnasya
mukta-sangah param vrajet</p>

<p>“Although Kali-yuga is an ocean of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply by chanting the names of Krishna, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.” (Source: Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.51)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>#1: Vague as fuck.  You do realize that the definition of all those terms were completely different during that time than they are now or at least arbitrary based on the method of quantification, right? Except duration of life.  That&#39;s at an all time high.</p>

<p>#2: That&#39;s true more often than it is not true throughout history.  Unless this applies specifically to a few decades (which it doesn&#39;t) this is not better than &quot;volcanoes will erupt at some point&quot;.</p>

<p>#3: Men and women living together because of superficial attraction?  My god!  This is clearly relevant only to this point in time.  I mean, for most of history people have sought out plain or even ugly companions with no regard for physical appearance!  The part about the threads, well if I wear a suit, people call me sir.  There&#39;s nothing to reasonably interpret that as anyway.</p>

<p>#5: This is so irrelevant as to be irrefutable.  People will have arranged marriages without a contract?!?!  Wow, that must have been shocking to someone in a particular culture 5,000 years ago!  People who don&#39;t bathe won&#39;t be among the elite of the world?  Gasp!  That&#39;s not like a basic signifier of cleanliness and hygiene that pervades all of written history.</p>

<p>#6: This is completely irrelevant to anything.</p>

<p>#7: Overpopulation and the will to power (relevant to all societies before during and after agricultural centrality).  Nothing prophetic here.</p>

<p>#8: Famine.  A staple of every era of human history but least of all the current one.  Completely wrong.</p>

<p>#9: Weather and conflict.  Applicable to every society ever.  Here&#39;s mine:  &quot;Weather will sometimes be bad, some people will want more food and there will be conflicts between people&quot;.  When did that ever <em>not</em> apply to humanity?</p>

<p>#10: LOL!  Even people who believe that there&#39;s anything prophetic about this (or anything else that claims to be prophetic) must be like... &quot;Hmm, well I guess he got that one wrong&quot;.  Unless that&#39;s a prophecy still to come?</p>

<p>#11: Because that was totally a given before and not just a characterization of virtue often not followed and enforced by cultural norms that required that they do so in order to inherit their family farm land.</p>

<p>#12: OK... peoples have turned against each other before.  I don&#39;t see any relevance as prophecy.</p>

<p>#13 shifting social norms described vaguely enough that they can be arbitrarily applied to any social order.</p>

<p>#14: See above.</p>

<p>#15: See above and above.</p>

<p>Well that was a waste of time.  I see no specific predictions, much less any that show any knowledge of the future and many which are rooted entirely in a specific time and place rather than some transcendent understanding of things to come.</p>

<p>Can we keep this stuff where it belongs?  I&#39;m not sure where that is, maybe /vedic or /prophecies or /mysticism.  Just not here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh, OK, so these vague predictions have another 427,000 years to be arbitrarily applied to any given situation.  Why would I believe any of this over Norse mythology?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do a little <del>contemplation</del> selective, cherry picking application, you can more or less relate it to modern day culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what is wrong with all &quot;prophecies&quot;.  They require a predisposition to believing them which causes the &quot;interpreter&quot; to ignore where they are wrong and selectively apply them when there is only a passing similarity.  That and the things that bear more than even an arbitrary similarity are things that are always true of human existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole point is that everything will become more and more externally oriented and inauspicious as time progresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I took away from it, but I tend to look for facts in statements.  If you want to ignore the actual content in favor of a a subjective, generalized interpretation, go ahead.  It&#39;s just as much fantasy as are the prophecies of every other major religion or prominent &quot;prophet&quot;.  Regardless, it doesn&#39;t belong in this sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See the forest, not merely the trees...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the real world, not merely the meaningless appeals to baseless belief.  Why are we in the age of Kali?  Because someone writing at a time when basic physics didn&#39;t exist said so?  Despite the fact that countless other peoples in similar circumstances have their own totally contradictory predictions?  Why?  This is self delusion born of a predisposition to believe one myth over another (as well as provable, repeatable truth) and has nothing to do with rationality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to waste my time arguing with an empirical perspective. You will never understand reality if you rely on rationalism and reductionist  views. The foundation of reality, which is described in the Vedas and other holy texts, is beyond our material senses. If you place your authority in sensual and worldly experience, then good luck because everything you experience with your senses is transient and no more substantial than a dream.</p>

<p>Whether you believe it or not, the Vedas do not originate from human beings. They contain information that would be impossible for an ordinary human being to compile. They originate from a transcendental source to guide the human race towards the goal of life, self-realization. You will never understand the self through empiricism because the senses, by their nature, point exterior and away from the self. So whether you believe these prophesies or not is irrelevant. How you plan on transcending this hellish world is the real question. </p>

<p>Yeah, who needs to rely on rational thought when you have the questionably interpreted and largely irrelevant writings of someone dead 5,00 years?  Do you know how willfully ignorant that sounds?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The foundation of reality, which is described in the Vedas and other holy texts</p>

<p>Why?  Why did someone writing millennia ago have some kind of inexplicable link to the nature of being?  Do you know how often these prescriptions are wrong, grossly immoral by modern standards or so meaningless as to be irrelevant?</p>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s just so deep.  Forget that we live in a world defined by science.  Most of us would not be alive past 25 (or 2) without it, but go ahead.  Invest your belief in a series of obtuse and irrelevant writings from a time when people killed each other for wearing two kinds of cloth or speaking up to their parents or marrying without their parents permission or being raped and on and on and on.  That&#39;s a really solid basis on which to view the world.  Good luck with that.</p>

<p>Done</p>

<p>Enjoy your fantasy world.  I, on the other hand <em>know</em> that Harry Potter along with Bilbo Baggins will one day rid the world of the Galactic Empire and my beliefs have every bit as much basis in reality as yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.  Here is an abbreviated list of things that science can do which religion cannot:</p>

<p>!) Make predictions about phenomena based on repeatable demonstration of the principles on which those predictions are based.</p>

<p>2) Explain the natural world in a manner that agrees with other methods of explanation.</p>

<p>3) Advance the state of humanity from hunter-gatherer to a point where the medicines, tools and conveniences we take for granted would have been considered magical buy those who rely solely on religion for explanation.</p>

<p>4) Extend the human lifespan, not just pretend Methuselah lived to 969 because someone said so.</p>

<p>5) Grow an amount of crops on one acre that early agrarian religious societies couldn&#39;t in a square mile.</p>

<p>6) Learn to properly dispose of our feces because we understand microbiology.</p>

<p>7) Destroy huge portions of the earth with minimal effort.  What?  God did that too?  Says some guy dead 5,00 years?  Sorry but I&#39;ll take the human-based event that is undeniably documented and happened just over 70 years ago over an old parchment translated dozens of times and which is wholly vulnerable to mistranslation and biased fraud.</p>

<p>8) Allowed us to quantifiably understand our place in the world and the universe (at least to some extent).</p>

<p>And about a million other things.</p>

<p>What has religion done for the state of humanity aside from provoke wars, promote baseless superstition and bigotry and occasionally promote charity?</p>

<p>Science frees us from religion and while blind faith in science may one day take on the negative characteristics of religion, so far, over the last maybe 14,000 years is it been <em>at the very least</em> less bad than the alternatave of blind faith.  </p>

<p>You ever have a nasty cut get infected?  Or a serious ear infection?  Break a bone?  Get a serious illness?  Well religion didn&#39;t figure out how to heal any of those things for anyone, so a huge portion of humanity owes their lives to the scientific method.  You want to be dead because all the treatment you got was a faith healer trembling his hands over you or do you want be alive because of penicillin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet as those things are true,humans are still unhappy and are gearing up to destroy the world.No amount of material progress is going to solve the worlds problems because they are inner problems.Only spirituality and not religion or materialist faith can overcome the root causes of suffering.It should not be a us versus them thinking,it is a how and why question.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the most materially wealthy nations on earth (with the exception of The US which is in the late stages of imperial collapse) show the least violence based on nationalistic and ideological grounds.  It&#39;s not hard to see why since such freedom from the restrictions of superstition and toil allow more time for education and enlightenment (including increasing rejection of religion).</p>

<p>Well, call it spirituality all you want but it&#39;s <em>you</em> who are just promoting a slightly different form of religion; one equally without basis in human nature or historical fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow your using cultural supremacy of first world nations to validate your point?They are the ones causing the problems in the rest of the world.I don&#39;t see enlightenment,i see pathological materialism which is quickly destroying the world.The precedent is that we haven&#39;t killed each other off already,it&#39;s actually what keeps us humans from saying fuck it there is no meaning and becoming psychopaths who do what ever we want.Spirituality and religion are not the same thing although religion even with its stupefying effects can lead a person to higher form of being.The how is a question for science,the why is a question for spirituality.It is obvious that you are a hardcore materialist so i won&#39;t try and convince you that there is a different nature to existence.I&#39;m not trying to disrespect what your belief system is but i find it limiting to say the least.I don&#39;t believe that religion is good at this point in humanity but the idea that western progress is going to save us is just as ridiculous to me as a white bearded man in the clouds.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>cultural supremacy of first world nations to validate your point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m using the prevalence of education and exoanded free time through higher standards of living to validate my point.  This has nothing to do with cultural supremacy but I&#39;d bet dollars to doughnuts that if any nation on earth enjoyed the educational standards and standard of living of Scandinavia or Japan that they would have far fewer incidents of albinos being butchered for their body parts or women being stoned to death for the &quot;crime&quot; of being raped etc.  Realistically this has nothing to do with cultural &quot;supremacy&quot; (your term, not mine) and everything to do with the educations level and resultant non-vilence of a society.  Much of the Arab world is now justifiably considered among the most unegalitarian and misanthropic nations on earth but during the height of the Ottoman Empire they enjoyed a much higher standard of living that anywhere in Europe and likewise much more enlightened social policies.  Please don&#39;t twist my words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>religion even with its stupefying effects can lead a person to higher form of being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning what?  This is not a functionally meaningful statement.  Your definition of &quot;higher form of being&quot; will differ from that of others, or would if you gave one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The how is a question for science,the why is a question for spirituality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I guess you should be able to enlighten me as to why.  The fact is that it comes down to personal belief and that varies vastly from person to person.  The why is an internal matter and if you choose to subordinate it to the writings of others, go ahead.  I don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i won&#39;t try and convince you that there is a different nature to existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as well.  I&#39;m rarely convinced of provable things without evidence.  I am convinced of philosophical and moral positions based on sound logic and basic empathy.  None of this applies to the arbitrary application of ancient predictions, nor to the afterlife.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe that religion is good at this point in humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a very interesting statement and I largely agree.  I think there was a time when religion was on the whole good for humanity, but like you, I don&#39;t think it is now.  There was a time when it was an organizing principal with far less manipulation exerted by the leaders for personal gain.  I just think we&#39;ve come far enough as a species that we can drop the now counter-productive charade originally introduced when adherence to it was beneficial the survival of the group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the idea that western progress is going to save us is just as ridiculous to me as a white bearded man in the clouds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is in no way specifically &quot;Western&quot; progress.  The vast majority of technological advances that led to the renaissance in Europe originated in India, China or the Middle East.  All the technology that led to those originated in Africa or the fertile crescent.  It is just a fluke of history that European technology has predominated for the last 300-400 years (not long at all in the 8,000 year history or heavily hierarchical societies) and that is already changing.</p>

<p>Saying that technological advancement is as ridiculous as the Abrahamic god (or likewise Kali, or Shiva et. al.) is just not born out by facts or history.  Religion declines as technology advances and while neither is a definitive savior of humanity, technology has won out against the monumental biases of tradition based solely on the fact that unlike praying or reciting sutras, it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are describing the &quot;progress&quot; that science has brought us. But I beg you to define what true progress is. It seems that you are describing how science has made our life more comfortable and efficient. (I would argue that the world has gotten more uncomfortable, as technology has created more problems as it solves others.) But for arguments sake, let&#39;s say that science has brought us progress in the form of a more comfortable world.</p>

<p>But according to the Vedic perspective, real progress is defined according to a culture&#39;s progression in higher morals and detachment from worldly comforts. </p>

<p>Religion actually did provide a solution to all the sufferings you mentioned: tolerance. Transcending problems through knowledge of one&#39;s true position as pure awareness. Science may have provided a solution for these problems, but that is synonymous to saving the clothes of a drowning man. We must save our consciousness (the actual man in the metaphor), our ability to tolerate and see truth, not save the temporary body.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>well, if you define &quot;morals&quot; as throwing widows onto funeral pyres alive, executing gay people, those who get tattoos, those who kill cows, those who violate any number of ridiculously arbitrary prohibitions, then we are way ahead of theistic societies.  You know what&#39;s also great about modern societies based on rationalism?  If you want to live an ascetic lifestyle free from modern comforts, you&#39;re free to!  There are plenty examples of religious intolerance directed against those who wouldn&#39;t engage in the worldly expenditures of shrines, burial ceremonies and tithing for religious &quot;virtue&quot; among many other things.  If you want to eschew comfort in the name of a certain set of edicts, go ahead, just don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s anything more than one of a million ethoses most of which have nothing to do with science.  Also don&#39;t tell me that I&#39;m living my life wrong because I like internet access and the convenience of cars.  By the way, you totally eschew these modern comforts right?  You walk to work and I got this Reddit post from a courier on donkey-back right?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most historically incorrect sentences I have ever read.  I&#39;m not exaggerating.  Religion has caused or at least been the excuse for, the majority of wars for almost all of human history.  It has been the primary excuse for the subjugation of others as well.  I really am taken aback by the ignorance of history and the human condition required to make a statement like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transcending problems through knowledge of one&#39;s true position as pure awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Myself, I tend towards self-enlightenment through the metaphysical transformation of my chakras through deep self-awareness.  Meaningless.  I guess Dalit&#39;s have a great sense of well-being knowing that they are the whipping boys of Hindu culture.  That must be blissful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We must save our consciousness (the actual man in the metaphor), our ability to tolerate and see truth, not save the temporary body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All very well and good if you don&#39;t pay any attention to <em>evidence</em>.  As far as I can tell, when we die, we rot in the ground.  The only sense in which we live on is in what we built or changed and in how we influenced others.</p>

<p>OK, insofar as I am not, it is simply because your argument boils down to &quot;this is right because it is&quot;.  Insofar as I am, well I have responded to each of your &quot;points&quot; with real world analogues and the underlying logic totally lacking in your statements.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence that some 5,000 year old text has anything to do with subsequent events yet you accept it.

<p>Why would I?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s nothingness followed by the cobbling together of organic molecules based on the properties of DNA followed by birth followed by death followed by nothingness.  I don&#39;t see why an ancient text that changed nothing but people&#39;s opinions should inform my world view than a system developed over millennia which has vastly changed both the world around us and our lives as a whole.  More importantly, the latter system has two things the former lacks: repeatable proof of its tenets and functional results which, in the long run. converge into agreement among those with an understanding of it. Religion and spiritualism are static, unable to change based on evidence because they are not based on evidence.Dogma is based purely on opinion and belief.  You can believe The Bhagavad Gita bit that doesn&#39;t mean it has any evidence or provable results to support it.  Try believing the sun revolves around the earth or that gravity doesn&#39;t have a calculable value and you will quickly find a million reasons you are wrong.  All societies make use of these functional principals to utilize things like medicine, electricity and combustion and religion is routinely either mute or incorrect on such tangible topics.  Try powering the lights in a church or temple using scripture or spirituality,  It won&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, everyone who is religious does indeed have a fundamental disagreement within it&#39;s scope; for example, a Christian will have many disagreements with a Jew over the divinity of Jesus. When I say science is like a religion what I mean is as a scientist you have to in the end believe in induction as a valid form of knowledge, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/</a> </p>

<p>Science is really practical, but there is nothing to say that these laws derived from nature can all change tomorrow. Science should not be the end all be all. Perhaps, there are better ways to learn about the universe we have not &quot;discovered&quot; yet. A Scientist works from the set of beliefs that the scientific method works, and from this POV he is able to do great things such as produce computers and medicines, but I will not be dogmatic in something that only has practical value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting recommendation for truly learned spiritualists from the same text:</p>

<p>&quot;Although a saintly person may not expose himself to the vision of human society, by his behavior his purpose is disclosed. To human society he should present himself like a restless child, and although he is the greatest thoughtful orator, he should present himself like a dumb man.&quot;</p>

<p>The purport is he does this so he doesn&#39;t waste time with insincere souls and cheaters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find myself frequently commenting on stabs at modern academics, and that line is indeed spot-on with what you said.</p>

<p>All too often, we meet someone who foregoes the simple explanation and instead digs deep into his/her vocabulary in what is an <em>obvious</em> effort to impress. And if you show any confusion or ask for clarity, there is some contempt in the reply. Over the past 6-12 months, I&#39;ve embraced the phrase &quot;brevity is the soul of wit&quot; in regards to my e-mails, meetings, etc. and have been more keen on putting myself in another&#39;s shoes before explaining something.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that good speaking ability often has an incredibly disproportionate effect on your business career than your actual production, and while it&#39;s something I&#39;ve used to my advantage, I&#39;m aware it&#39;s a very primal trait to hear someone speak clearly and confidently and use it as a measure of intelligence and leadership.</p>

<p>Bullshit.  They are pretty specific.  </p>

<p>Take this one for instance:    The maximum duration of life for human beings in Kali Yuga will become 50 years.   </p>

<p>Also, this one:   In Kali Yuga, wealth alone will be considered the sign of a man’s good birth, proper behaviour and fine qualities. And law and justice will be applied only on the basis of one’s power.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t leave much room for interpretation - wealth alone, justice will be applied only on the basis of one&#39;s power.  Pretty succintly sums up the current state of society in present day America.  </p>

<p>Ya&#39; got me.  That one is pretty specific <em>and totally wrong</em>.  Life expectancy is higher than it has ever been in human history.  If you want to wait a few millennia and see if major changes bring that about, fine.  This &quot;prophecy&quot; gives itself over 400,000 years to pick the time and place it will be &quot;right&quot;.</p>

<p>Nope, nor does it leave much room for deviation <em>from all of human history</em>.  If I predict that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow is that somehow exceptional?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After Kali Yuga, the cycle of the four yugas repeats, starting with the most pure form of this world. This is known as Satya-yuga. As time goes by, the world gradually ages to Kali yuga. Then it is reborn. Then degrades. Then it is reborn. The universe has a lifespan of its own and is reborn repeatedly for the unlimited souls to repeatedly take birth in. Everything in this world is repeatedly dying and rebirthing at different rates. The universe is the top-tier of this process.</p>
