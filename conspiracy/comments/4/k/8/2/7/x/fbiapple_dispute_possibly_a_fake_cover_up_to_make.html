    <div class="md"><p>To an extent I agree. Here&#39;s my theory. As a major alphabet agency, compartmentalization is inevitable. The lower tier scrub teams aren&#39;t gonna know about the A-teams up top that exist. So the FBI had their shittiest and least capable team try to crack the phone to make headlines, and inevitably fail and outsource it. Naturally they are capable of cracking it if they really wanted to.</p>

<p>Also as a major hardware manufacturer based in the US, the probability is greater than 99% than they were approached by some agency and told to backdoor the hell out of it, and then slapped with a gag order.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about those gas station burner phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. Though, just for the sake of argument, why didn&#39;t they transfer the project to a more experienced team in the first place? Rather than making a huge fuss about it? Not saying that your statement is false (it&#39;s most likely right), I&#39;m saying that an organization doesn&#39;t mess around like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that an even higher up agency (CIA), told the FBI to stfu and don&#39;t actually try to crack it, for the exact reason you originally stated - to convince people the iPhone is safe. It&#39;s not like the government&#39;s gonna come out and say, &quot;Yeah we can crack pretty much every electronic device on the market because due to national security regulations, it&#39;s all backdoored.&quot;</p>

<p>“If they win, great for the FBI. They get a precedent going forward where they can demand a backdoor into essentially anything,” Cardozo told Yahoo News. “If they lose, maybe even better for the FBI, because they can go to Congress and say, ‘Look, the law didn’t allow us to do what we wanted to do in San Bernardino.’ Either outcome is great for the FBI.”  </p>

<p>Also great PR for Apple.  Little stunts like this distract you from the fact that they have been spying on you all along.  They also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463">run a sweatshop in China</a> and have a long history of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/apple-uk-corporate-tax_n_3528372.html">tax evasion</a>, among other heinous acts.  </p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Olson">Theodore Olson</a> whom Apple hired to lead their legal team.  His wiki speaks for itself: he defended Reagan during the iran-contra scandal, represented Bush v. Gore deciding the 2000 election, and be sure to read about his 3rd wife&#39;s unfortunate accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to know. It&#39;s always important to ask yourself what&#39;s really going on and disregard possibly false claims on social media and other media platforms. Another similar incident was when the U.S accidentally dropped nuclear bombs in Spain, where they focused so much on different issues and successfully hid the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could always access the phone with help from the NSA in my opinion.  Snowden warned us that workers in the NSA were accessing nude photos.  We are all under surveillance as long as we are connected to any major cellphone provider or the internet.  They could access it the whole time, they just would like you to think that checks and balances still exist.</p>
