       I think each of us goes through the day wondering; "well what if I had done this, or what if this had happened to me." We day dream. We speculate. We wish. We fear. We plan for the future. After having done psychedelics for the first time in 2013 I felt like I ripped through a wall in my psyche. The hidden "reasons" why I did things appeared more naturally to me. My conscience was clear, my vision was clear. Now, when I "let myself down," I have to tools to try again. I think we live in a endless expanse of thought; thoughts can become realities with enough energy behind them. It's all just energy anyway. Energy will always change because that is its fundamental purpose: to change (chaos, random chance, repeating patterns, synchronicity; these are forces we don't heed and we should).

       Deep. Very deep, but I think you're right on the money. Particle physics and the supernatural cannot be two different things. Einstein once said, "Not only is the Universe NOT the way it appears to be...it CANNOT be the way it appears to be." Very profound when you think about it.

       Psychedelics change your perspective. It's like looking at the town/city where you live. Most of the time it's all street level.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you take a little something and your perspective changes. Now you're at the top of a high-rise and you can see the whole thing all at once, from above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe things don't make more sense... but they do make sense in a completely new way. There's definitely a value in this and the people who have experienced it for themselves know this best.

       Yeah and I'm really conservative about it normally (me mentioning it on an anonymous comment section is about as far as I'll go). It's definitely something people should choose for themselves. Knowledge is power and power hurts. The truth can be painful, frightening, and overwhelming at times; but it's accompanied by what I call the "Beautiful Silence." The silent ringing. Death. Death is the great equalizer. It comes to all things; big and small, good and evil; the clock keeps turning and new life forms will arise. The silence is the arbiter of our alleviation from pain, our rediscovery of the childlike belevolence of the universe.

       This theory explores the fractal, holographic nature of the structure of space and thus, how the totality of all is within each piece - unifying physics and solving quantum gravity."

        Fractal

       : A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

       Proposes that the ancients figured out that the material universe is the result of energy waves that by interference create focus points which we at our scale call subatomic particles.

      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">
        Holographic Principle.
       </a>
       In a nutshell. Anything that stands at any one point in the universe has the entire contents of the universe within itself. Anywhere you stand, every bit of information about the universe is being received by you. This principle, when considering interference and fractals implies that you yourself, as you are made of said sub-atomic particles, are not only made by intersecting energy waves, but that you are also all the energy waves everywhere at once. This, some call the Law of One. The same energy waves that make you, also make me and the rest of all the starts and galaxies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware a lot of these principles are hotly debated and even classified by some as pseudo-science. I like to think there's something to it.

       We live in illusion. Psychedelics warp our illusion. Best thing they can do is help us understand we are in illusion and push us to find the truth (while sober). By no means will they give us a complete understanding of ultimate, transcendental reality, which is naturally transcendent to the confines of psychedelic experimentation.

       I would argue that the warping of the illusion is more important for the eager soul then your allowing. Yes, there are limits to the understanding we can be given in altered states of consciousness, but there are ALSO limits to what can be achieved during sobriety. Is it the chicken or the egg? Is it spirit or matter? Is it good or bad? It's neither. It simply "is"

       It is WHAT? That makes no sense! This is not recognized by any authentic spiritual tradition. They have terms to define what it "is" and it's not just "it"
      </p>
      <p>
       Altered state of consciousness or not, the limitation is due to one's nature of being "jiva" this means an infinitesimal soul, with limitations on the sensual, mental, and intellectual level. Whether you are on drugs or not, these limitations apply. Thus the requirement to invoke divine mercy in the form of transcendental knowledge from the infinite source of consciousness.

       All I was saying is that there is an invisible symmetry between what we call "spirit" and "matter". The two are lovers. They dance with each other and we are the result. Your getting too worked about religious texts, in my opinion; they don't matter all that much; many of them are insightful and completely true; but their knowledge will come and go; the people who adhere them will change and wither and eventually, die. Over and over again. I want to break out of the cycle, not worship it.

       The problem is, your description shows SOME truth, but it is vague. That's the whole point of religious texts. They help us sharpen our intelligence, which is plagued with limitation. You have some good ideas, but these ideas have been perfected, especially if you consider the Vedic literature.

       Look I've looked into eastern religions quite a lot (primarily Zen Buddhism, but Hindusim as well). They have a lot of insights but I really don't believe there is "one truth", theres some truth for everyone; some people will gain more than others because they sought it out. You have to get your hands (your mind and body) dirty.

       Relativism would imply that there is no truth. And if you are implying that the truth is "there is no truth" then that would logically refute that statement. Your truth of "there is no truth" is a logical conundrum.

       There's a couple of dungeon mazes in the legend of zelda series where you--link--find yourself in a room with a bunch of boxes.  When you push the boxes into different configurations, different doors open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that's what's happening with psychedelics and reality tunnels: that the psychedelic state puts you into that room where you can push boxes around, not only do you open up new reality tunnels, you're also moving the boxes of neuronal connections around in an bioelectrochemomechanical way by changing the voltage membrane potential of neuronal mitochnodrion and resurfacing neurotransmitter receptors, reconfiguring, reconsidering, recontextualizing the past/present/future in a different way than before.  If you pay attention to what's happening you can guide this alchemical process towards self-healing, by burning away the needless denigrations and refining the good aspects of the self in an objective way once ego is put aside.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like pushing the boxes around and going into the door that you want, rather than the one that is open by default.
