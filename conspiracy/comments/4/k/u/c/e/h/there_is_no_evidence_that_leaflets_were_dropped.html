        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is an oft referenced urban legend proposing that residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were warned in advance of the nuclear bomb, and urged to leave the city.  It is almost certainly untrue and appears to be being propagated currently as propaganda in conjunction with the president&#39;s historical visit to the site of the bombing.</p>

<p>This thread was posted yesterday in <a href="/r/TodayILearned">/r/TodayILearned</a>.  Despite several messages to mods, a clear controversy in the comments and poorly sourced post, it has remained without retraction or note in the title.  </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4knzt3/til_the_us_warned_japanese_citizens_at_least_5/">https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4knzt3/til_the_us_warned_japanese_citizens_at_least_5/</a></p>

<p>The reality of the tragedy is that leaflets were continuously dropped as a part of a psychological operation against the citizens of japan, intended to spur the population into urging surrender by the emporer and military.  Leaflets were often dropped &quot;warning&quot; citizens of fire bombing campaigns, and there are documented leaflets that were to be dropped on 30+ cities for 9 days warning of imminent A-bombs.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, the evidence shows that the leaflets which referenced the
nuclear bombs were not printed until the 9th and 10th of August (Hiroshima was bombed on August 6th, and Nagasaki on August 9th) and were intended for distribution among other cities.  While it&#39;s possible they were dropped on  Nagasaki, it&#39;s unlikely.  And even the captain of the Enola Gay (the aircraft used to the deliver the munition to hiroshima) claims that the residents were never warned as it could have impacted the mission. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting story and there is a lot of information available.  <a href="http://www.psywarrior.com/OWI60YrsLater2.html">This blog on the OWI Pacific Propaganda program</a> appears to be a great resource on the leaflet campaigns surrounding the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and is cited on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Bombing">the wiki article</a>) It&#39;s a shame that people are still repeating this debunked claim and not understanding that the leaflets were part of a propaganda program, not an actual system of warning for civilians.</p>

Why didn&#39;t they choose more effective targets if they had no fear of being stopped? Surely for harming Japan&#39;s industrial abilities there better choices, or if it was to kill people and force a surrender they could have chosen larger population centers.</p>

<p>According to Tibbets (pilot of the enola gay)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hiroshima was not warned because the secret atom bomb was to be delivered by bomber devoid of any defense weapons and the Allies could not jeopardize the success of the historic mission by advertising - especially since they rightfully felt the newest weapon would end the war and save thousands of Japanese and Allied lives.</p>

Los Alamos, May 10-11, 1945</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A. Dr. Stearns described the work he had done on target selection. He has surveyed possible targets possessing the following qualification: (1) they be important targets <strong>in a large urban area</strong> of more than three miles in diameter, (2) they be capable of being damaged effectively by a blast, and (3) they are unlikely to be attacked by next August. Dr. Stearns had a list of five targets which the Air Force would be willing to reserve for our use unless unforeseen circumstances arise. These targets are:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>snip for brevity</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) Hiroshima - This is an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and <strong>it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged.</strong> There are adjacent <strong>hills which are likely to produce a focussing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage.</strong> Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target. (Classified as an AA Target)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis mine in both snippets.)</p>

<p>And yet people like to fight over how nuclear bombardment saved more lives than it took in some absurd Devil&#39;s arithmetic vs. other people who adamantly claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not civilian targets.</p>

<p>The estimates for casualties of an allied invasion of Japan (both Japanese and allied) were astronomically higher than the number killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I wouldn&#39;t call bombing cities atrocities - by that logic any attacks on any city is an atrocity.<br/>
Mass destruction shouldn&#39;t be any more atrocious than normal destruction. Whether or not I bomb your city with a hundred bombs or just one doesn&#39;t change the fact that I bombed you.<br/>
And yes, radiation poisoning is bad and it was terrible, but I&#39;m fairly certain there was little knowledge as to the <em>severity</em> of radiation poisoning. They definitely didn&#39;t know there would be genetic mutations, how could they? Midori Naka, an actress who eventually succumbed to radiation poisoning was the first official person who died of radiation sickness. The two scientists who died because of radiation exposure is arguable evidence to suggest they knew the atomic bombs would cause sickness, they could have believed that the fissile material being used up also meant the radiation was removed.<br/>
I can honestly believe they didn&#39;t know. Truman was pretty hard-lined on the use of chemical weapons like poison, I feel he&#39;d have disliked the use of the bomb if he had known the extent of the damage.<br/>
Hindsight is twenty-twenty.<br/>
<strong>EDIT</strong> I just want you to know, I think the killing of people in general is terrible, and that any wholesale slaughter of people is terrible. I&#39;m not arguing the ethical issues of bringing a bigger gun to a war, just that the word atrocity is an <strong>extremely wicked or cruel act</strong> and to say using one big bomb versus a hundred little bombs doesn&#39;t cause an atrocity, and theoretically, if one of my hundred little bombs blows up a chemical plant and suddenly everyone who survived dies a terrible death doesn&#39;t make what I did an atrocity. </p>

they never could make a nuclear BOMB, although nuclear power exists. radioactivity exists. it&#39;s just that the bomb idea doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>politics and diplomacy doesn&#39;t actually serve as a buffer to avoid nuclear war, it&#39;s just propaganda and crowd control.

</blockquote>

<p>No, nuclear materials tend not to stick around long in large amounts unless it was intended to stay that way.  A nuclear bomb disperses material across a large radius and high up into the atmosphere.  Additionally, the materials used in these bombs--uranium and plutonium--have relatively low activity levels.  The key to how a nuclear bomb works is the shape and mass of the materials, and especially the chain reaction.  Huge amounts of energy are released in that chain reaction when it&#39;s triggered properly, but once that material is dispersed, it&#39;s far, far less dangerous.  The radiation that kills during a nuclear detonation is gamma radiation, and that&#39;s released during fission.  Think of it like an x-ray machine.  It doesn&#39;t linger.</p>
