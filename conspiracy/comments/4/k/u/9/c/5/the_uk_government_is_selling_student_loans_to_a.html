        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://gyazo.com/92699a2a30a808f168603514af61968e">https://gyazo.com/92699a2a30a808f168603514af61968e</a></p>

<p>I took out a student loan at the age of eighteen to study Civil Engineering at the University of Nottingham. Unfortunately, I was in the first cohort year of undergraduates who were charged the increased fees of £9,000 per year, from £3,000 – a huge hike in student fees. When I took out the student loan, we were told the loan was at a very low interest, and at the time was around 0.5%. </p>

<p>I was still in the Sixth Form at school, when I agreed to the student loan. I had no experience of loans, credit cards or mortgages. Like all the other thousands of students in the UK, we trusted the Government that the interest rate would remain low - at around 0-0.5%. </p>

<p>I graduated with a huge debt of around £41,000.
We have just learned of the underhand way, the Government has sold our loans to a private company which has caused the interest rate to skyrocket. At no point was I consulted about this, and of course I would never have agreed to this enormous increase in fees.</p>

<p>Now graduates, we feel we have been cheated by a government who encouraged many of us to undertake higher education, despite trebling the cost of attending university. 
The current interest rate is now around 3.9%. We were told our loans were around 0.5% interest. I am now lucky enough to own a property, and my mortgage is around 3% - less than my student loan.</p>

<p>From the attached image you will see some months the interest on my student loan is over £180.
The student loan repayment is currently 9% of anything over £21,000. The total interest on my debt between March 2015 and March 2016, is £1828. Below is a simple calculation to see how much I would need to earn, just to cover the interest in a year:</p>

<p>£1828. (total interest last year) 
£1828/0.09 =£20311 (In order to find out how much money above the threshold) </p>

<p>£21000 + £20311 = £41311 (total amount needed to be earned to cover interest)</p>

<p>Therefore, just to cover the interest, I would need to be earning over <em>£41,000</em> a year. 
Unless I earn that much, my student loan will increase due to the interest. </p>

<p>I would like to know how many new and recently qualified graduates are earning over £41,000? I am only 22 years old and out of university less than a year.</p>

<p>Do you know who owns your debt now? What is the company? How do you know it was sold?</p>

<p>This may give you more information - <a href="http://www.slc.co.uk/services/interest-rates.aspx">http://www.slc.co.uk/services/interest-rates.aspx</a></p>

<p>Also, why don&#39;t you log into <a href="http://www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/">www.studentloanrepayment.co.uk/</a> and actually see what the percentage is.</p>

<p>If you are paying via PAYE (your employer) they may have screwed something up as they tell the SLC your salary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My housemate told me urgently (we&#39;re students) that interest rates were being magically jacked up and now that I&#39;ve read what you&#39;ve said, I can see that it&#39;s pretty much based on this picture alone.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of getting some kind of lazy and greedy feel after I saw <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125268">this petition</a> from someone who clearly has better things to do than actually research what he&#39;s paying. And 350 other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. He first told me like it was some huge 3.5% interest is being added, so I checked the BBC wondering what was going on... Found nothing and he later told me that he was basing this off of this picture alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As usual for student loans, there&#39;s a lot of mis-information here and any corrections will never be seen as widely as the original. All you need to know is that the loans are such good value <em>for the individual</em> that even if you could afford to pay for Uni out-of-pocket, you&#39;re almost certainly better of sticking that cash in savings and taking the loan instead.</p>

<p>The crucial thing that everybody overlooks the significance of is that, by design, the <em>majority</em> of people will never pay it back before it is <em>written-off</em>. A direct consequence of this is that the total balance (£41k) is <em>completely irrelevant</em>, the relevant cost is simply the graduate tax rate (9%) and the repayment threshold (£21k).</p>

<p>There are genuine issues with the system and inflation measures, but &quot;huge debt&quot; is not one of them. For more information, the moneysavingexpert &quot;student-loans-tuition-fees-changes&quot; article is excellent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is terrible math.  In fact it makes no sense.  In order to only cover the interest you would need to make at least 1828/(1-tax rate).  You would then have to give it all to the bank.  They are almost certainly required to accept and apply the money toward the loan.  You should still complain about the rate increase but perhaps your highest priority should be complaining about the quality of your education with numbers.</p>
