        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the birth of my child approaches, it occurred to me that I don&#39;t want to put them in the social media spotlight. First of all, it creates a permanent digital record of my child and their growth - a record that is beyond my control or any confidentiality policy. That would be unfair to the child to create such a profile without their consent, while I have been blessed with the what you might call a classic upbringing, where memories are confined to the neural networks of myself and a few chosen others, or perhaps by word of mouth if an event was significant enough. It&#39;s liberating in a way to have those moments peak and fade away in your consciousness as nature seemingly intended. </p>

<p>Secondly, it introduces a new untested paradigm to mental and behavioural development. This is the first time in human history that we will have to teach our kids (assuming they are on social media) that any thought they conceive, any action they perform, any fleeting passion they profess their love for, will be forever preserved (potentially) and subject to review throughout their lives, creating possible personal and professional roadblocks for them in the future. It forces us to teach our kids to &quot;shut their mouths&quot;, not only for fear of the short term implications, but also that their behaviour now will echo through history in a way we&#39;ve never seen before. Is this the mental roadblock that, if instilled at a young enough age and perpetuated by future generations, leads to an Orwellian &quot;big brother&quot; society that people are afraid of speaking up within?</p>

<p>Alternatively, should we prevent our children from using social media by clawing and scratching with every ounce of our willpower to not only prevent them from using what &quot;all the other kids&quot; are using, but to make it feel &quot;normal&quot; to them to be alienated from what the majority of kids are engaging in? Do we cave in and sign them up for Facebook, rather than risk discord at home between father and son, mother and daughter (&quot;you won&#39;t let me be a normal kid Dad!&quot;)? </p>

<p>What does all of this imply for future generations&#39; development, the new family life, and societies as a whole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your idea and thinking.  I agree that Social Media is already a control and information gathering device which could be used to &#39;silence&#39; future generations through self censorship.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t forget that computers are dumb and will do exactly as you tell them.    Create fake profiles for the kids to use.  Use made up names.   Maybe even &#39;create&#39; friends for them online.   The best way to hide data is either a.  not generating it at all, or b. obfuscating it so that a clear picture cannot be drawn.</p>

<p>Using these ideas, the kid can still be normal and use social media, but (hopefully) maintain an armslength association with their profile online.</p>

<p>Also, teach your kids how to be safe and anonymous online.   Use VPNs, Tor, Proxies, give them acccess but teach them both how and why we use this tech.</p>

<p>Teach them to fool or otherwise manipulate the system to their advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a teacher, I wish more parents were so thoughtful.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many parents use technology to shut kids up. That&#39;s what it does.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not old by the way (27), but I&#39;d say I was able to see the contrast of life with and without smart phones.</p>

<p>Though the smart phone has done amazing things for my life, I also feel it has taken over aspects of my life. It&#39;s something I need to start thinking about myself.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anything is done genuinely anymore. How many people go on vacation just so they can post those photos and make friends jealous? How many people post selfies to prove how beautiful they are to the world? How many actions are taken to prove something to someone now?</p>

<p>As for children, I think the biggest effect is the child now feels &#39;bigger&#39; than they are. They feel they are at the center of the world now, when in reality we are all very small. Please don&#39;t misinterpret my words. I&#39;m not undermining anyone&#39;s value, but now everybody feels special, as if the world was made for them.</p>

<p>I have seen a shift in just 5 years. Unfortunately, I feel my students are now less empathetic due to over exposure. They can easily learn about any atrocity in the world, then distract themselves with a game for 4 hours.</p>

<p>When you do bring up some other the problems with the world (research projects), they aren&#39;t engaged. While they know about it, they just can&#39;t relate to it. It is very strange, and I could comment more on this.</p>

<p>I think technology has ups and downs, but I think people underestimate how it is truly impacting the world in some negative ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry i meant have an account.</p>

<p>Anyway:</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use Facebook, you will have seen the company’s “like” button springing up in more and more places around the internet, like a nasty case of chicken pox. If you click on it, you can like the page of a company, person or brand, all without leaving the website you’re on.</p>

<p>And then there’s Facebook share buttons (like the one at the top of this page) and Facebook comments, both of which hook in to the company’s servers to provide their own features. But it’s a two-way relationship: the price you pay for being able to interact with Facebook even without going to their website is that they can see the other websites you’re on, following you around the internet and using that information to better target ads and content to you back on the mothership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way you&#39;re going to stop kids from using social media or the internet. There will be a digital record of them no matter what you do. You can&#39;t control what other people post online about your kid.</p>

<p>What matters is that children are keenly aware of the risks, and that you teach teach them or have them taught about cyber security, networking, reading, writing and editing of various software languages.</p>

<p>I think rather than trying to prevent children from having a social media account you should have them set up accounts that are professional in appearance, and are for the purposes of making professional connections. Channel their desire to use the internet into lessons about using the internet properly.</p>

<p>Create the social media accounts early to control and create the electronic historical narrative that makes up their online profile. You don&#39;t want kids or anyone to shut their mouths, you want to teach them to speak out, but with carefully calculated subtle tact.</p>

<p>Explain to them that other kids, and adults are going to be largely ignorant of what you&#39;re teaching. Explain to them that other people are probably unaware of what dangers they are exposing themselves to with their irresponsible internet use.</p>

<p>Sadly childhood is dead. Four year old kids are bringing guns to school and killing other kids. We have to treat kids as adults, as best we can. &quot;Wait until you&#39;re older&quot; is no longer a viable solution for anything. The big serious discussions must be had as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t have any of my own kids, but I&#39;m responsible for hundreds of kids every day. I&#39;m in a position to see the various failures of parents, and the rare successes. Moreover realize that the school, the institution, society at large, will be likely be teaching them seemingly contradictory and utterly foolish ideas.</p>

<p>Raising children correctly is becoming increasingly more difficult.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>In some sense, I wonder if Snowden was a limited hangout to make us believe the NSA et al&#39;s capabilities are actually greater than they are in reality.  If your goal is social control, much cheaper to manufacture a limited hangout like Snowden and begin pressuring the public to self-discipline than to actually have relatively well-developed panoptic capabilities.  I really have no idea how the size of the data we generate scales in relation to storage capacity and the computing ability to separate signal from noise, but I really have a nagging suspicion the deep states capabilities in terms of wide-ranging dragnet arent really that good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are a real person posting here, great!</p>

<p>I suggest you allow them to use social media but teach them how to use it from a business stand point. Let them create a blog, talk about things they want to talk about on it. Maybe help them a bit, and teach them how to promote their blog using social media like twitter, facebook, and google+. Eventually, they might be able to get enough viewers to monetize it. You could also write an e-book or two with them and sell it through the blog.  It would be a great way to help them build social skills as well as learn about earning money in this new age.</p>

I cringe when i see pics of small children on reddit and elsewhere because the kids can&#39;t consent to those pictures being public and they potentially will exist forever (and with facial recognition they&#39;ll be cataloged and attached to the child as he/she moves through life).</p>

<p>Granted, parents have the right to make that decision <em>for</em> their kids i just wish more would think through the possible implications of leaving a long photographic record of their child all over the internet.</p>

<p>Even without the Orwellian thoughts, just seeing the effect of technology on teens (I used to teach high school), is horrid.

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer : I  dont  have  children</p>

<p>I can comment based on observation. I observed that those that create social media profiles for their newly born children tend to be for brownie points. That also includes photograph uploads. </p>

<p>The social media type had changed from ICQ, MSN, Messenger and MySpace. And even so until they hit their teens there is not many interesting things to do on social media in any case. </p>

<p>Teach them to ride a bike, skateboard and roller blade/roller skate or play a sport. With sport, depending on the environment, if the child does not entrench itself to say &#39;no&#39; it might get involved with substances at an early age and generally a toxic culture with the sport scene during the teen years. Its better, I think, to have one&#39;s kid say &quot;you wont let me be a normal kid dad&quot; than &quot;dad, you let me be someone without a personality&quot;.</p>

<p>I would also watch for the wife. Too many times in the situations that I have observed the wife either folds or feels that shes is obliged by a predisposition for the child be &quot;normal&quot; according to the trend. For example pre teen girls dressed as teens and over heading for a night out and the mother does not mind in the slightest. Sometimes I wonder whether those mothers are grooming their infantile daughters to utilise sensuality for using others and perhaps desensitisation. I used to know a girl who despite not being allowed to hang out with her friends past a certain time, no way past 8pm or close to it, and not to not leave the house without escort.  &quot;Nice girl&quot; right? &quot;Prim and proper&quot;, huh? Well.. despite that  social perception (ahem smoke screen). Her parents (see mother) did not have an objection to her watching pornography in her teens, she would go out past midnight as underage along with her female cousins that were more mature than her and who already were of age to be in the clubbing scene and finally she and her cousins went to a male strip joint at age 14. </p>

<p>So you might think &quot;oh wow, you mean she bangs, bro?&quot; LOL for an substantial price, maybe. Did I just refer to her being a gold digger? Why, yes! The mother spent years and years so that her daughter was not labeled as a slut and to teach her daughter to belittle other girls who had sex on the basis that they gave it up too easy ie not for a substantial price wink wink nudge nudge. She also was preconditioned to refute love between a man and a woman as not real. Real love for her was two people working, making a living and (financially) supporting each other. She unsuspectingly became a social whore, the slut she so despised. </p>

<p>Another example was this guy whose parents were very strict and also domineering. Even if he made a good decision his parents would take the credit for it mostly. They even beat him. Come high school he became involved with a different crowd and started binge drinking to the extent that he now takes medication for his digestive system, later resorted to drugs. He was compressed that to form his own choices he went after that his parents forbade him from doing. After all they took most if not all the credit for his good choices and in addition placed most if not all the blame on him. </p>

<p>Peer and social pressure is a cunt of a thing. The person wants to hang on to their friendships/relationships and wonders whether they are really his friends, family etc. With the advent of social media its probably more potent. Then again social media in of itself is not bad, it depends on the crowd and the people that are on the list that could make it really enjoyable and connective. Doing that in person is way better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even tho kids are like sponges... genes, consciousness and maybe even luck play a role of what that child could/will become but... </p>

<p>Parents and loved ones need to imprint and show them understanding, truth and love... make it the most basic thing they know, try to teach them to best of your ability good values like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Appreciation, Belief in Others, Caring, Commitment, Compassion, Cooperation, Courtesy, Dedication, Devotion, Effort, Forgiveness, Friendship, Gratitude, Honesty, Hope, Imagination, Integrity, Optimism, Patience, Respect, Right Choices, Sacrifice, Sharing, Tolerance...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know sometime it&#39;s simply necessary to say no for their own good but the more you do it and try to forbid or limit the &quot;bad things&quot; that they might be exposed to chances are they will do it anyway instead try to make them understand and explain the conveniences. Perhaps now more then ever children need to be thought to be mentally resilient and understand themselves and the world around them specially when it comes to the internet and beyond. Also that freedom is the most important thing and they need to fight for it and protect it for themselves or for others.</p>

<p><strong>All this will mean nothing if the child is a demon kid from depths of hell ! just kidding lol :P</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. Me and my partner have nothing to do with social media so the only way they can know I have a child is if they actually came to my house to see him. Not the type either to have my child vaccinated (sorry if this sounds like I&#39;m hijacking your topic). I just think that children don&#39;t need to see that &#39;world&#39; of social media as it taints your brain into thinking collectively and you start doing shit like &#39;the ice bucket challenge &#39; etc.. it&#39;s all conditioning, making you think you&#39;re apart of something big which allows leads you into a false sense of security that in turn makes you feel your voice is being heard but in reality nobody gives a fuck. Just an online diary which anybody can be granted access too. I would never allow myself to go back to where I was obsessed with that world nor would I allow my child to either. I broke free and I&#39;m not letting my child get wrapped up in meaningless fights over brands, bands, who they&#39;re friends with, what they like etc. It leads to mental instability. </p>
