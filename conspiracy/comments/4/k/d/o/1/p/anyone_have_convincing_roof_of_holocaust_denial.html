       <strong>
        Answer these questions.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Elie Wiesel and countless other Jews survive the Holocaust if it was the intention of the Third Reich to eliminate every Jew? Elie was a prisoner for several years; other Jews survived even longer. Most of these “survivors” were ordinary people who did not have any unique expertise that the Germans could have exploited. There was no logical reason for them to be kept alive if the goal was extermination. The very existence of more than a million survivors even today, some sixty years later, contradicts one of the basic components of the Holocaust; i.e. that the Germans had a policy to eliminate every Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is there no mention of the Holocaust in Churchill’s six volume History of the Second World War, the wartime memoirs of either De Gaulle or Eisenhower, or any of the other lesser luminaries who wrote about the Second World War? Keep in mind all these were written years after the war ended and thus after the Holocaust had been allegedly proven by the Nuremberg Trials. With regard to the Holocaust, the silence of these “cognoscenti” is deafening!
      </p>
      <p>
       What was an inmate infirmary (and a brothel) doing in Auschwitz if in fact it was a death camp?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the Germans round up Jews from their far-flung empire (thereby tying up large numbers of personnel and rolling stock, while fighting a world war on two fronts) to deliver people to “death camps” hundreds of miles away to simply execute them upon arrival? Wouldn’t a bullet on the spot have appealed to the legendary German sense of efficiency?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, after seventy years, have historians been unable to come up with a single German document that points to the Holocaust? Should we believe the likes of Raul Hilberg that in the place of written orders there was an “incredible meeting of the minds” by the literally tens of thousands of people who would have had to coordinate their actions in order to carry out an undertaking of this magnitude?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is is still insisted upon that six million Jews were killed when the official Jewish death toll at Auschwitz, the flagship of the Holocaust gulag, has been reduced from an immediate post-war figure of 4 million to a figure of less than 1 million? Why do many respond to this observation by saying, “What’s the difference whether it’s six million or one million?” The answer is that the difference is five million. Another difference is that saying so can get you three years in an Austrian jail… just ask David Irving!
      </p>
      <p>
       All of Germany’s wartime codes were compromised, including the one used to send daily reports from Auschwitz to Berlin. The transcripts of these messages make no mention of mass executions or even remotely suggest a genocidal program in progress. Furthermore, it has been insisted that the Germans used a kind of euphemistic code when discussing their extermination program of the Jews–e.g. “final solution”, special treatment, resettlement, etc. Why was it necessary for them to use such coded euphemisms when talking to one another unless they thought their codes had been cracked by the Allies? And then why would they still use cracked codes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The water table at Auschwitz lies a mere 18 inches below the surface, which makes claims of huge burning pits for the disposal of tens of thousands of victims untenable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially, claims were made that mass executions in homicidal gas chambers had taken place in camps located within the boundaries of the old Reich (e.g. Dachau, Bergen-Belsen). “Evidence” to that effect was every bit as compelling as what is offered for other camps–located in occupied Poland–yet without explanation in the early sixties we were told that this was not the case and that all the “death camps” were located in the East (i.e. Poland), outside (some would say conveniently) the probing eyes of western scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has been able to reconcile the eyewitness accounts that personnel entered the gas chambers after 20 minutes without any protective gear, and the fact that Zyklon B was a “time release” fumigant that would have had a lethal capability for at least another 24 hours. And that even after 24 hours the corpses would have themselves remained sufficiently contaminated by the hydrogen cyanide gas that they would have had the capacity to kill anyone who touched them who was not wearing protective gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we no longer hear claims that the Germans manufactured soap, lampshades, and riding britches from the bodies of dead Jews? Could it be that in the light of modem forensics and DNA knowledge these claims are totally untenable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we no longer hear claims that huge numbers of Jews were exterminated in massive steam chambers or electrocuted on special grids? “Evidence” of this was presented at Nuremberg–evidence that sent men to the gallows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elie Wiesel has been described as “the Apostle of Remembrance,” yet in his memoir, Night, which details his stay at Auschwitz, he makes no mention of the now infamous homicidal gas chambers. Isn’t this a bit like one of the Gospels making no mention of the Cross?
      </p>
      <p>
       Virtually every survivor who was examined at Auschwitz says that he or she was examined by the infamous Dr. Mengele.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to survivor testimony, hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed at Treblinka and then buried in mass graves in the surrounding area. Why is it that extensive sonar probing of these burial grounds reveals that this alleged final resting place for Holocaust victims has remained undisturbed since at least the last ice age?
      </p>
      <p>
       “Proof” of the Holocaust rests primarily on survivor testimony. There is little, if any, hard evidence. The best of this has been described by Jean Claude Pressac as merely “criminal traces.” Even Judge Grey who presided at the Irving-Lipstadt Trial commented that he was surprised the evidence pointing to the Holocaust was “extremely thin.” To paraphrase Arthur Butz, “a crime of this magnitude would have left a mountain of evidence.” Where is it? There was more hard evidence against O. J. Simpson at his trial and he was found innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has Holocaust revisionism been criminalized in at least eleven countries? What other historic truth needs the threat of prison or the destruction of one’s career to maintain itself? Should someone be sent to prison for expressing skepticism about the official Chinese claim that they suffered 35 million dead in World War II?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the court historians insist that “denying the Holocaust” is like denying slavery or saying the Earth is flat? The leading Revisionists are first rate scholars who hold advanced degrees from the world’s leading universities. Is there anyone comparable among those who say the world is flat or that slavery never existed? Notice again that it is not illegal to say the Earth is flat or that slavery never existed. The truth of these things does not seem to need legal protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Promoters of the Holocaust have expressed concerns about remembering the Holocaust once the last survivors die. Why haven’t Civil War historians expressed similar concerns since the last survivor of that conflict died in 1959?
      </p>
      <p>
       Survivors of the Holocaust have testified that smoke billowed from the crematoriums as they consumed the bodies of murdered victims–some eyewitnesses even claimed they could detect national origins by the color of the smoke. How can this be reconciled with the fact that properly operating crematoriums do not produce smoke of any color?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official version of the Holocaust, hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were rounded up in mid-1944 and sent to Auschwitz, where most were gassed immediately upon arrival and their bodies were disposed of by burning in huge open air pits using railroad ties and gasoline. Why is that there is no evidence of these huge funerary pyres in the high resolution surveillance photos taken by Allied aircraft overflying the camp on a daily basis during this time period? Furthermore, why have no remains been found, since open pit burning, even when gasoline is used, generates insufficient heat to totally consume a body?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the liberated camps were littered with corpses; is there a single autopsy report or any other forensic evidence that shows that even a single one of these deaths was a consequence of poison gas?
      </p>
      <p>
       The death toll for the Holocaust relies exclusively on population statistics provided by Jewish sources; has any independent demographic study been produced that shows that approximately six million Jews were “missing” at the end of the war?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the wartime inspection reports of camps made by the International Red Cross contain no references to mass executions? It strains credulity that such monumental crimes could be hidden. The only explanations are that either these crimes were not occurring or that the Red Cross was complicit in a cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has there been no effort to respond to the Leuchter Report?
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Holocaust was technologically possible because it happened.” Why is this intellectually bankrupt argument, which turns scholarship on its head, considered by the promoters of the Holocaust as historical truth, and considered a sufficient response to the mounting Revisionist evidence to the contrary?
      </p>
      <p>
       What other historical truths rely to the extent that the Holocaust does on so-called “eyewitness” testimony, and why have none of these witnesses ever been cross-examined?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official version of the Holocaust, the Jews remained ignorant of their fate until the very end–so skillful were their Nazi murderers in deceiving their victims. How can this ignorance be reconciled with the fact that the Jews have historically been, as a group, the most literate and highly informed people on the planet, with legendary access to the highest echelons of government?
      </p>

       Do you deny that jews and other people held in camps got experimented on by na2i scientist this is fairly concrete?
      </p>
      <p>
       lets imagine your right and there never was a holocaust, that would logically mean in light of all the great things hitler done for germany he isnt really evil, do you feel that way as you hold the belief he didnt order a huge genocide of jews.

      <p>
       Basically yes, since the evidence amounts to “every single one of us personally saw Dr. Mengele”, etc. There’s plenty of proof even in the Nuremberg Trial documents that show Nazis were actively keeping as many of the prisoners alive and healthy as possible. I sincerely doubt there was experimentation.

      <p>
       From Germany’s standpoint, that’d be mostly true. What he did after the Weimar Republic went bankrupt was (rightly) called an economic miracle by the rest of the world at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for “evil” and the connotations most put with it, I’m not a NatSoc personally and don’t like the ideology because it removes free agency from people. But it certainly worked. I doubt any other policy would have saved Germany in the timeframe given.

      <p>
       Even Jews believe he didn’t order said genocide. No documentation for such order to be planned or carried out has ever been presented by anyone. Netanyahu said just last year that Hitler didn’t want to kill jews, it was just “DA EBIL MUZLIMS” who convinced him to do it. Of course, that completely contradicts the narrative they’ve set up for the last 70 years, so it’s all coming down around them.

       have you ever expressed your view on the holocaust to people you have contact with and what was the reaction or do you not let people know that you personally hold this view as it could obviously be problematic?

       It’s a long road to get there. I’ve found you can’t
       <em>
        start
       </em>
       with the Holocaust. At least, that’s not how I came to it. Everything else came first–learning what has happened to our economic, governmental, and social policies over the last century or so. Modern evidence, particularly, started to build up against the overall narrative. If you look hard enough, you start to see patterns. Often, such things are called “coincidences”. They’re not.
      </p>
      <p>
       There just came a point where I was ready and willing to start looking into the happenings (supposed and real) of the holocaust and found that all it took was elementary school-level mathematics to drive a stake in the heart of the concept (the number claimed to be killed cannot possibly have been killed within the physical laws of the universe in which we reside in the amount of time we know the camps were running). From that initial point came learning about everything else (chimneys built by the soviets after the war; Treblinka being off-limits to those looking for the mass graves claimed to be there; teeth being found on the battlefields of Middle Ages battles but none anywhere near the claimed mass graves at any camp; the fact that the resources required to manage such a feat didn’t exist anywhere near the camps with no record of the resources being shipped there or culled from anywhere in German control; the testimonies of survivors from the camps explicitly saying that there was no genocide, there were no gas chambers, etc; oh, and how all the Jewish encyclopedias before and after the war show global populations that grow rather than shrink; and many more).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t imagine anyone can just jump into the Holocaust. Rather than know what happened to learn why everything is happening today, I think you have to teach them what is happening today, who is responsible, and why they were allowed to do such a thing. Raise the ire at current events (since that’s exclusively what most people care about, sadly), and then when they know what is happening now and who is responsible, hit them with what they did to gain this power. And then watch the anger rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately I don’t have close contact with many people these days. But I did a full 180 with my parents and best friend on the concept. The programmed (brainwashed) anger they’d had at anyone who questioned the narrative has been swung around entirely at those who push it.

       Since you already know the big deal underlying the changes made to Western society in the last 70 years, I’d suggest reading a book called
       <em>

       Remember, the countries in Eastern Europe the Nazis invaded treated them as liberators, and their own nationalistic systems were set up in their wake. What’s wrong with nationalism? And what is a nation but a genetic subset of a people?

       As strange as it used to sound, Stefan Molneaux seems to be slowly transitioning from a sycophantic liberal to a nearly redpilled person. He has some great videos on illegal/immigration recently (calling out their costs to society, Israel’s hypocrisy, etc.). What else... Oh, if you’ve Christians to break from a zionist heresy, there’s always Steven Anderson, who has feature length films on the illegality (secular and biblical) of Israel, the bastardization of modern Bible translations (to foment “Christian” zionism), and on the Holocaust itself.

       I think her saying she would love to be a paid shill is taken out of context and probably just a joke, if she was a paid shill for the jews or something ridiculous, she wouldnt be removed from YT the moment she starts getting a heap of followers.

       No, that's not a counter argument. That's an explanation. All throughout it's existence Nazi German did some awfully wasteful, poorly planned and poorly executed things. Saying "oh but why did they do this wasteful and poorly planned thing?!?" Isn't exactly a strong argument, because that very concept underpinned Nazi methodology.

       There's quite a bit of proof, once you leave the books and videos and Web sites that parrot the Jewish narrative. Naturally, all these sites that dispute the narrative are reviled and dismissed by the Jews, and their tame, trained Christian pets. Find the Holocaust sites that the Jews are attacking and laughing at, and you will find proof that the Holocaust is a modern myth created by the Jews for their own selfish purposes. But it will take you a while to shake off your conditioning. At least a few years, before you fully realize the lie that has been told to the world.

       I know what you mean about the points raised in the Hitler documentary seeming biased. The reason they seem biased is because you have been brainwashed through the schools and the media to automatically accept the very biased talking points of the liberals and Jews. The points in the video are not really biased, they are just a different point of view -- one you have almost never encountered before.

       I am not new to anti leftist views non politically correct views or such i have just never explored the holocaust denial or hitler's history beyond what i learned years ago from school, as i naturally equated it with racism and just a bunch of cra2y people.

       im a skeptic and as such i never seen evolution was valid until i explored it myself and came to that conclusion, years ago i was into NWO trype stuff specifically reptilian theories but came to the conclusion there's no basis for reptilian theories if you dont believe that ancient mythology are rooted in truth and that truth is shape shifting aliens.

       Same reasoning is used by YEC to show noahs flood being true..
