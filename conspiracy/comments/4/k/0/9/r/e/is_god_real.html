       I hate to hear that this is the worst time of your life... And to see that you're looking to remedy it by asking questions here. All we have to offer are more questions, my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, someone answering these questions for you isn't going to bring you any closer to KNOWING any truth. If you're feeling bad, get some exercise, drink some water, and watch your diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep looking for truth, but start with that which is KNOWable, not with those questions which all men have been asking themselves since the beginning. Go outside and know that the sun is warm and women are beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that taxation is theft.

       Whether or not God is real, it is the journey of spirituality that gives peace... it is not a destination. It's like playing D&amp;D... how do you win? You play.

       I have to somewhat disagree, to me it reveals there is a spiritual realm; but that it's nothing like why we imagine in our worldy religions, it's much more complicated. And fair. The wicked will be punished accordingly. Not eternally, who would do such a thing?

       The Father promised to punish the wicked for eternity so it will happen. The Angel of The Bottomless Pit will not mind doing the dirty work. Sadists exist in that realm too.

       Depends what you call God.  If you call God a human male of European morphology that controls and is responsible for everything ever, then no.  God is most definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       real.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, you know God to be that energy (whatever it might be) that is A) responsible for all that is, and B)
       <em>
        of necessity
       </em>
       is absolutely intelligent (among other things), then yeah.  God is very much real.

       I have to answer your question with a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people who control the world today believe in satan and our bent on evil, then if you oppose them you have no choice but to represent something that counter's their dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       If God is real and they face an ultimate judgment then good for them,  If God isn't real and they never face an ultimate judgment then good for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would life be any better for us if we knew God wasn't real and didn't try to establish a more righteous order?  What if we knew he wasn't real and we just let the wicked shape the world to their desire?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be much worse if the question was answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we knew God was real for a fact, yet the wicked still ruled, then wouldn't their wickedness seem that much more oppressive? Knowing that what they do isn't just against our own laws, but that it flies in the face of a universal law put in place by the very entity that created the universe!

       When you go through difficult periods of your life, your very being is tensed by the vibrations you are experiencing, it makes for a very high pitched tone, one that is difficult to endure and painful to experience, but it is simply a moment. A moment of time sequestered from contextual temporality is just like a single note played, as on a piano. The vibration continues on into the next moment, as a new note takes over, the tone continues until the vibration extinguishes itself eventually, and the music carries on. Those hard screaming moments where life is most difficult for you are part of the great crescendo of your life's symphony, and the music would not be half as beautiful without that crescendo. Ride it out, and know that you are blessed. Yes there is a creator of all of this, and you are a part of that creator as much as you are a part of this creation. Live your symphony safe in the knowledge that the very hairs on your head are all numbered, and the symphony you are living out is a part of an even greater symphony which requires every constituent, just as every song requires every note.

       People experience consequences from their state of awareness, everyone reaps what they sow in an individualized way. We reside in a just creation because it can't exist in any other way. When it comes to why some are born in worse conditions than others... I am clueless, and it feels wrong to say they deserve it because no one deserves to suffer.

       The spirtual world is real my friend. If we could see into the spiritual world we would be surrounded by the recently dead, the nature spirits or the spirits of the elemental world, our guardian angel and the entire 9 level heirarchy of spiritual beings and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our "reality spigot" is tuned to the physical earthly plane because we couldn't function if we could see into the spiritual world without making the necessary effort to build up our consciousness (through moral and ethical advancement plus meditation).
      </p>

       Everybody faces judgement after we die, not just the wicked, and we are made into the servants of the dark powers for our sins.

       Jesus has already returned once (on the etheric plane in the 30s when the world was focused on war) and will never return in the flesh again. The Mystery of Golgotha is a profound and crucial event in human history, never to be repeated, and the dark powers gain much by occulting it's importance.

       The universe is not indifferent. We are just living in a time that requires us to pull our selves out of the mud and there are many forces at play, physical forces and spiritual forces (but all physical forces have spiritual forces behind them!), that don't want us to succeed. Atheism, although a healthy response to religious bullshit, is one avenue that the dark powers love to use...but it covers up the truth of the spiritual world that exists behind everything physical.
      </p>

       This is the unvarnished truth.

       And the synagogue of satan only has the power that we human beings contribute to it. Remove support for it and it will fail. They only have a thin veneer of control. The goodness and love in this world is massive, but our brothers and sisters are wallowing in the mud of confusion and will eventually perish there if they don't standup and straighten their spine and walk through this world supported by their morals and ethics.

       I'd wager the answers your looking for are in yourself and by their very nature they only can be. It could be especially dangerous to your psyche to listen to others. Especially the advice of random folks on the internet of which I guess I am one. In that sense I am saying nothing. I recommend reading the tao.

       Yes and no. It depends on how you look at it. They're in control of the physical and most people's physical bodies will suffer, but the spiritual will be free; always. We're okay; just be ready to be tortured or killed; accept it. Something else is out there and if your worthy I'm sure better things await.

       The Christ consciousness has appeared many times on this planet, Buddha, Krishna, Vishnu, and Jesus were some examples.  The Powers that Be (higher dimensional beings who watch over the planet) decided to mix it up this time around and the second coming of Christ isn't going going to be 1 man, it's 144,000, 12 tribes of 12,000 each and each person is responsible for awakening and activating the DNA of about 8,000 people in an effort to save as many people as possible before the axis shift which will wipe out most of humanity in another flood of biblical proportions.  The ETs will save those worth saving and the animals in Noah's ark were DNA strands in petri dishes they preserved in order to repopulate the planet when the waters receded.

       GMo? (Grant Morrison). He's created comic book masterpieces based on supposed real life experiences not unlike those which you describe. I'd be down with this outcome, it's certainly more uplifting and entertaining than the probable reality we are left without our precious fictions.

       The good news: nobody is in control, although that doesn't mean some people aren't trying. A one world government is a precondition for total control of humanity, and this is why it must be stopped.

      <p>
       The bad news: Jesus was not a real person, but a myth, like Hercules, or Mithras or any other half man/half god entity that we see from ancient mythology.  if you look for historical proof of his existence (ie not including the Bible) there is no contemporaneous evidence of Jesus. He exists in the same way as Sherlock Holmes exists - in books, in films, in people's minds, but never in time and space as a real "person". So no, there can be no return.

       This is life really is it, there's nothing before or after. However, humans are in a post-evolutionary space because our species can alter its own destiny (through genetic engineering, mass exterminations etc).

       Things never remain the same.  Times won't be good forever and they won't be bad forever.  When people turn to God in bad times and things get better, they give credit to God. But I have never seen anyone start believing in God when things are good and blame God when they go to shit.

       We believe in energy right? Something that can't be created or destroyed but used in very many ways. Seems a lot like the essence of a so called creator. It's what connects us all.

       Edit: look deep within yourself. As painful as it is we are the cause of our suffering. You have a great ability to overcome your nature so that you'll meet and become the real you.

       The simple answer is yes - there is a God, he loves you, and the questions you are asking yourself are an indication of you becoming aware of the facts of your existence, good and evil, and light and darkness. You should be very happy - your consciousness is awakening - congratulations!
