       That's a pretty incredible coincidence. Not saying there is anything to it, but it is odd to say the least.

       Seeing as how the plane departed Paris, how long until ISIS claims responsibility and France locks down the country even more so than it already is?

       There really isn't anything to it, people have drawn some freaky numerical relations to almost every major event in modern history. If you look for these kinds of patterns, sometimes you're going to find them and the vast majority of the time the patterns will be meaningless.

       I'm inclined to agree. I mean if there's a cryptic meaning to the 804 in flight M804, then what does the 370 in MH370 represent? Or any otherdowned planes' flight number? One coincidence does not a code make.

       We know "gravity" exists because we can produce experiments that are predictable and repeatable, 100% of the time.

       Gravity can be tested. It follows set patterns and does not deviate. You can reproduce the same test and get the same results over and over again. That's how we know gravity is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not knowing "what causes it", does not mean we don't know what 'it' is. 'It' is gravity.

       It's true.  The powers that be are, in fact, stealing airplanes and, like terrible super villains, are leaving incredibly obscure clues as to what they are doing so we can slowly unravel their perfectly laid plans.  I saw it in a movie once, so it's probably true.  Well done team.

       Huh, fun.  I don't want to waste a lot of your or my time so I'll try to keep this short.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only delve deep into things when there is a reasonable reason to think there is something behind the facts I'm examining.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's is no logical reason for this connection.  If there were a conspiracy, why in the world would the perpetrators of that conspiracy take the time to create such an odd clue?  If it's a cover up, you would do everything you can to cover it up, rather than going out of your way to manufacturer obscure clues.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind the more interesting facts to explore are inconsistencies.  Take TWA800 for example, where there are considerably inconsistencies between the varying groups involved in the investigation (to such an extent that several members of the NTSB actually filed complaints during the investigation, and then filed for the investigation to be reopened several years after the fact.)  Those inconsistencies are worth investigating, because they sometimes can point to a power broker manufacturer a cover up.  And if you can find that cover up...we can finally start asking about motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I applaud peoples desires to questions everything, I honestly do.  But I would highly encourage you to questions facts where there is a clear reason to question them.  There are so many truths to uncover, why waste your time and energy on faulty clues that aren't going to reveal much of anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I suppose I could have been politer in making my initial point.  Every now and then I get a little irritated when I see people misallocating energy to wild goose chases and my sarcasm get's the best of me...

       You have solid points. But attempting to apply your morality and logic to people in significantly different stations of power from yourself will find you asking questions you already know the answer to.

      <p>
       Considering the way human's process and think about the world is largely predicated on basic biological imperatives (food, protection, shelter, territorialness, etc), I'm going to have to disagree with your basic premise that power brokers systems of logic or morality are impossible for me to understand.  But I admit that is, at it's heart, merely my opinion (though there are a lot of very interesting double blind studies that back up my position.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, something like this would take a fair amount of organization if it were, in fact, being handed down from a power broker.  So it's not really about understanding
       <em>
        individual
       </em>
       psychology so much as it is about understanding
       <em>
        organizational
       </em>
       psychology and
       <em>
        organizational
       </em>
       theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short: The existence of a long standing, far reaching power organization would necessitate incredibly proficient internal structure and organization to remain both secret and influential.  That, almost of necessity, precludes the idea that they would leave obvious loose ends lying around (like the one in question regarding MH370 and MS804).  Any organization of this type that insists on remaining hidden will not risk their entire veil of secrecy just to tease us, especially in this modern day and age when information flows freely all over the internet.  It's just too big of a risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that being said, and as I stated before, a secret organization would mostly deal in cover ups and, it's worth pointing out, would only deal in cover ups when their initial plans to stay completely under the radar fail.  That's why factual inconsistencies between various power structures (NTSB, CIA, FBI, etc...as in TWA800) intrigue me so much.  It makes it look like somebody really screwed up and they are, almost accidentally, being caught by another major power broker.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may see this in this particular scenario, some time in the near future even (who knows?)  And, as I said, I would highly encourage you to continue to push for the facts as best you can.  Just try not to get distracted by dead ends.

       But why are they so concentrated here? Why hasn't there been a strong backlash against it here? It isn't just that it appears here. It's that you allow it to remain here. Homophobic posts appear on
       <a href="/r/Christianity">
        /r/Christianity

       all the time but they rarely get off the ground. Why is there enough here to create an entire sub tracking it? Why haven't the non-racists stood up and said "we won't abide by that here?"

       "Safe spaces" are a construct of people who have never faced actual opression and just crave attention; they are the dumbest far-left trend to date.

       Again, when you assume a person is bent on destroying society just because they hail from Tel-Aviv, you're being racist. The same way you would be racist if you assumed a black man would suck dick for watermelon and some KFC.

       Absolutely not!  You are welcome to say whatever you want, but you have to accept the consequences.  If you talk like a racist, you're going to be called a racist.  You can't have it both ways.

       OK.

       If you actively look for connections because you want, nay, NEED to find them, you will find them, as stupid, nonsensical or irrelevant as they might be.

       If a terror attack somewhere in the world happened exactly 911 days before or after the attacks of September 11, would you say these attacks are corelated? Or would you brush it off as coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your response is the latter, good, you would be right; otherwise, there is no hope for the "free society" you guys pretend to fight for with your internet posts and your Facebook shares.

       You act like anyone presented you evidence of anything.  People are presenting concepts but you take them as supposed evidence.  That says more about you and your world view than it does about us.

       Is this drivel really what you came here to contribute?  There are plenty of places on the internet where you can go and make jabs at people who research conspiracies.  This sub isn't one of them.  Consider this a friendly warning.

       Uhhh, am I not allowed to comment on what kind of evidence I think is worth investigating in a conspiracy on this board?  If this isn't a sub that involves any sort of critical thought, then I suppose you're right and this isn't the place for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do research a lot of things that would be considered conspiratorial by the main stream, though adittedly I do my best to be academic about it, find verifiable evidence, draw logical conclusions, etc.  And I'm not afraid to encourage other people to spend their energy the same way.  I feel there is a lot of value in trying to look deeply into things, I just wish people would do it a bit more efficiently.  It's a bit of a waste of energy otherwise.

       , I thought your comment was on a different thread I have going in here, pardon me.  I think you misunderstand the direction of my insult (which is my own fault for poorly communicating.)  All I was trying to point out was that DrDougExeter's statement didn't really make sense.  I feel many (probably most) people here are doing their best to deal with the evidence as they see it.  Describing their statements as "concepts" without evidence felt demeaning.  That's really what I was after, apologies for the way it was presented.

       1) Who was on the plane?
2) What were they going to do that was an imminent threat to the establishment?

       Rather than threats to the establishment they could easily be establishment agents. Land the plane somewhere, tell everyone it went missing, and all those people can assume new identities to further whatever agenda they're part of.

       Everyone, who keep get confused that it's 803 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would be correct, if you are counting down to something (ie: 803 days to birthday, or 803 days to the next Star Wars movie coming out when that final day comes you don't include it. You don't say 1 more day until I see Star Wars movie, you say TODAY I will see Star Wars movie, right?! 1 more day makes it tomorrow, in my books.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in this scenario, you got to measure the TOTAL days between the start date and the end date, so you will need to also include the END date. March 8, 2014, everyday in between, until and INCLUDING May-19-2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, YES, it will actually be 804 days, not 803.

You say it that way because you put the MONTH first, the rest of the world puts the Day first - still not sure what you are trying to argue or prove. Or just proving you say it that way?

       What I posted. This is what Carl Jung called 'synchronicity' it is MORE than coincidence! I highly think it's a message by something... What something is? Who knows for sure?  Could be God (But I myself not a really religious person; Einstein believes in a 'pantheistic' God ) it could also be aliens, or planned by some other human, entirely possible.

       The odds of this happening naturally? Id imagine its somewhere well into the billions, if not trillions. Its a confirmed connection to MH370 for me.

       because of the number of days matching the call number. How many flights have there been? How many of them have vanished from radar? That is an insanely small percentage. Now add in the call number matching the number of days between the first incident, and the second incident. Incredible odds.

       given the odds, to me, it indicates it is far less likely to be a coincidence. But that doesnt mean its impossible. Would be a crazy coincidence though.

       If you look for coincidence you will find it.  It could be number of passengers, departure time, model of the plane, some aspect of the route, whatever.  Also, "in the billions" is a ridiculous estimate.  Don't all flights have 2-3 digit call numbers?  So in a span of about 3 years you've got about a 1 in 1,000 that a second missing plane's call number would match an arbitrarily selected relationship to
       <em>
        a
       </em>
       previous (not the most recent) one.  Add to that that there have been other disappearances without this "shocking" relationship and the fact that you could just as well have said 370 days if that had been the case and it's probably only in the low hundreds at most.  More important, since this was a criteria decided
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the fact (no one said anything about the relationship between flight number and number of days before this plane went missing), it is one of many possible coincidences that could be chosen after matching up every possible set of characteristics of the two flights and discarding those with no relationship.  This is a completely meaningless relationship based solely on cherry picking random data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still more important, what would it mean if it meant anything anyway?  I can't imagine a rational answer to that.

       I agree with your first part. Im not sure with your 1 in 1,000 number though. Like at all. There have been 2 instances like this in recent history. Given the striking similarities between the two, that ties them together even further. This one had to happen TODAY, on THIS particular flight for it to match. Its not just a matter of the numbers matching up. Its the specific date that escalates the crap out of the odds. Im not sure I follow your logic in eliminating so many outcomes, either. And your calculation for the odds themselves are way off, imo. You have to account for all dates, all flights, and add in the odds that a flight disappears from radar (at the very least, this last one, which is substantially less than your incredibly simple 1 in 1000 calculation)
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, I probably overestimated by a lot and you probably underestimated by a lot
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as what it would mean....sometimes (most times) the people that carry these things out have giant egos and are grandiose as hell. Sometimes they like their dates to mean something. They want it to be "significant" rather than throwing a dart at a dart at a calander. (see: 9/11).

       OK, assume that these were consecutive disappearances.  That's an arbitrary definition as many flights have disappeared and been found wrecked or been small enough not to make major news.  It's too soon to expect that the debris from 804 will not be verifiably identified soon and there have been confirmed wrecks of similarly sized planes between the two.  But we'll go with them being consecutive.  There are then 989 flight numbers between 10 and 999.  That means that if you assume a duration of less than 1,000 days between the two disappearances, the likelihood that the number of days will match the flight number of the plane is 1 in 1,000.  When you consider that one could just have easily have chosen the flight number of the first plane, that drops to 1 in 500.  Given the number of equally "relevant" numerical comparisons that could be made (dates formatted however you want, miles in the trip, passengers aboard, whatever) this is not really significant as it is reduced to probably less than 1 in 2 if you are willing to make enough arbitrary comparisons.

       That isn't even close to true.  What if it had happened on 8/04?  What if it had had 370 passengers aboard.  What if it had been an 804 mile trip?  What if it had had the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       flight number.  Only the last even constitutes coincidence and all are just as meaningful as the "relationship" you describe.  This is called cherry picking data.  You ignore all the things that don't match and focus on the one that does.  Meaningless.

       I've given the logic more clearly here.  If you don't understand that logic then your understanding of probability is way off.  If someone had
       <em>
        predicted
       </em>
       after MH370 that 804 days later a plane with the flight number 804 would disappear (it's too early to call it that anyway) then yes, the odds of that prediction being correct by coincidence would likely be 1 in a billion or more.  Seeing that it happened and then looking through a list of characteristics of the two flights to find one arbitrary match reduces the odds of finding an equally "meaningful" match to well under the 1 in 500 that I cited above.

      <p>
       They want
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       to be significant?  I don't particularly buy into the 9/11 numerology, though there are some things with planned events occurring on occult-significant dates that I find more compelling.  But this?  This is just run of the mill stuff and I have seen mediocre at best evidence that MH370 involved a conspiracy and none regarding MS804.
      </p>
      <p>
       This a wild goose chase without some kind of evidence linking the two in terms of motive for their having been disappeared and will always be a wild goose chase regarding this arbitrary comparison of unrelated numbers no matter how definitive a link between the two flights could be proven if there were one (and I doubt there is).

       Cool, I'm a big fan of his and haven't seen it.  I'm always drawn back to the constantly recycled claim that the latitude of the center of Kufu's pyramid is exactly the same as the speed of light in meters per second.  First of all, it's a pretty close approximation but not perfect.  More important, continental drift would've changed that figure over 4,000 years.  Even more important is that meters, seconds and longitude and latitude were introduced millennia after the pyramids were built and all were altered after their inception.  And a lot of people try to stand by that "proof" of super advanced pyramid builders even when confronted with those facts.

       The theory is that the Great Pyramid is much older than Egyptologists claim. Since we don't know how this more ancient civilization managed to build Giza, it is possible they had knowledge about the planet which was not passed on to whoever replaced them. After all, a metre is not random, but chosen because it represents 1/10,000,000 of the distance between the Equator and the North Pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the synchronicity of the latitude of Great Pyramid with the speed of light could be a little Easter egg left for us to find by the hyper-intelligent civilization which created the simulated universe in which we reside. After all, the Great Pyramid's external dimensions also contain the formula for the speed of light.

       The decimal place synchronization goes pretty far.  It would require only a very small shift.  Also, it's not spot on anyway.  This is hardly the most compelling point for why that comparison is baloney though.

       Is that the geographical North Pole or the magnetic North Pole? The latter shifts over time too.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, so an ancient civilization, or aliens used base 10, not evidenced anywhere in the world until around 3,000BC.  They knew the distance to the north pole.  They fucked up the building location of the pyramids so that the similarity fails after maybe 7 decimal places (I forget).  Then they built a mammoth but ultimately relatively simple structure in the formation that would allow them the greatest height with durability using their incredibly basic, unprocessed stone building materials.  No steel, concrete or polymers for this super-advanced civilization!  Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this of course addresses the use of seconds.  Those appeared in the first recognizable incarnation in the 1500's and have been altered multiple times since.  They were using seconds not decided on until the 1960's
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       ?  The supposedly derivable relationship to meters per second means nothing if there is no link to seconds.

       No, they don't.  The sides aren't even close to perfectly regular lengths and I know of no definitive measurements though they are all in rough agreement.  Besides, is this one also in meters per second?  Miles per hour?  Cubits per sunup to midday?

       You are making "confident assertions of fact" which are simply guesses. I know that because they are incorrect. If you want to argue this issue compellingly, you should familiarise yourself with some of the data. And obviously we are talking about the geographic North Pole, not magnetic north!

        Firstly, the dimensions of the Great Pyramid do contain the speed of light. Secondly, the latidunal line demarcated by 29.9792458° does definitely pass through the Pyramid of Cheops.
       </a>
      </p>

       In addition there is also a "speed of light synchronicity" between the distance (in metres) from the Prime Meridian and the Giza Plateau.

       I didn't say that that latitudinal line didn't pass through the pyramid, only that most people put it passing through the exact peak which is does not.  Such sloppiness for a civilization so advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to address the arbitrary mathematics chosen to get an approximation of the speed of light, nor the fact that, as I  said the lengths of the sides of the pyramid are inexact or that there are many definitions of cubit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will however again ask, why on earth would they be calculating this using a unit of time invented 3,300 years late, or much longer after their construction than that by you hypothesis?  Your line of reasoning is useless without an explanation of why they would be building with a then non-existent unit of time in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's some pretty nifty prophesizing on their part.  You'd think they might have also come up with like materials more suited to building large structures that raw stone or any number of other things that would obviously come before knowing that light even has a speed.  But I guess for many people it's just way less cool to accept that the pyramids were built by corvee labor using basic tools about 3,800 years ago even if that's what all the evidence points to.

       As I explained, the speed of light encoded in the Great Pyramid is premised on a ratio of two external dimensions (corners/sides), so whatever units are used to measure the difference, the ratio is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I acknowledge, there is no compelling explanation for how the Pyramid constructors used the same arbitrary time measurement we do. But the premise is nevertheless that the ancient Egyptians didn't build the Great Pyramid, because they didn't have the technology - they inherited it from a more ancient civilization.

       The article about it linked to in that post
       <em>
        does not
       </em>
       us the ratio.  It uses the outer circumference minus the inner circumference.  The ratio is less than 1.5:1.  There's no way to get 299.79 in ratio  form from  (2:99.97, 29:99.7 etc.) two circumferences with that difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also two other glaring problems in addition to the asymmetry of the pyramid's base.  The shocking similarity requires assuming the length of a long Egyptian cubit (which shows up only in questionable religious posts, not academically accepted accounts) shows it to be 52.3 centimeters.  There is the unwarranted leap that it must be based on pi/6 (no evidence of an accurate value for pi until over a millennium later) and the assumption is then that it is 0.5235987755983 m.  Obviously this is still wholly reliant on meters and thus seconds.  And why this arbitrary interposition of cubits in the equation?  It begins to look a whole lot like randomly plucking numbers out of the air to invent a result as I described in my original posts on the plane crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it were ratio-based, it would still yield a number.  If you are implying that that correlates to a speed, then you need both a unit of distance and a unit of time.  There is no way to express speed without those and everything thus far just uses meters, seconds and cubits thrown in out of necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to propose this as an even slightly credible hypothesis then you need at least a slightly credible suggestion for why it is using a unit of measurement from 3,300 years (or by your vague statements much more)
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it was built.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I get tired of addressing this kind of fallacy.  The "logic" behind it is always so flawed and fuzzy and it's painfully obvious that people have (whether they admitted it to themselves or not) simply started with the assumption that (in this case) the pyramids are magical, or evidence of even older civilizations, or aliens.  Then they gather up a huge trove of numbers from all categories, fudge the math and the logic, introduce arbitrary equations and say "See, it's proven!"
