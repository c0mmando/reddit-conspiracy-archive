       I hate to admit it because I'm usually optimistic. But self posters get down voted like crazy to stay at zero and then political posts from shills get posted to slide real posts. I've messaged five of the moderators about this issue and not a single response. My post will stay at zero as well I can almost guarantee it. It was fun while it lasted.

       Agreed. Something has changed in the last week that is breaking character even for the decline that has been happening the last few years. It feels like it died. It feels filled with garbage, and the comments are mostly the same. I feel like everyone has abandoned it, at least until the election is over.

       There are a lot more Trump and Hillary supporters everywhere here as well lately. And a ton of post mocking Bernie supporters for supporting him. They reminded me of the same people who attacked obama on digg in 2008; mainly because how heavy handed they are in some threads (page is filled with like minded post. Everything else is down voted unnecessarily)

       I'm afraid Hillary is going to win.  If these nsa / fbi people don't have a spine by now, they won't ever have one.  There are stories about nsa / fbi wanting to prosecute her but it's either political theater or obama is blocking them or both.  They've done nothing about 9/11 or the joke of isis, or the violations of their own laws.  THey are cowards and they are going to keep cowarding until Hillary is in office.  Keep in mind, Obama is helping her win this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case there is some kind of magical, unlikely coup within our intelligence community that literally betrays potus, then it will be Bernie or Trump--a lot of these people think Trump will be a dangerous question mark and they will be a lot more willing to put a person with decades of experience within the system in charge of nuclear codes than some brassy, bullying businessperson, even if they don't like a few aspects of their politics

       Heh, I disagree. I think unless you really are a shill,  there's really no reason to get upset.  Usually those who get upset about be called a shill are in a likelihood a shill.  Why not just let the community decide if they agree or not with the accusation?  The people here are typically pretty good at sniffing out the shills, and should be allowed to call it like they see it IMO.

       That is a good point.  It's hard to decouple a shill from someone with a strong opinion on something.  For example, I must be an astroturfer for bernie because I'm a 'berniebot', always supporting him--lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       My acid test for shillhood is different from that.
       <em>
        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/42ug1e/a_litmus_test_for_debunking_the_pseudoskeptical/?ref=search_posts">
         The test is whether or not a person consistently 'justifies the system'.
        </a>
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if you are
       <em>
        here
       </em>
       then you
       <em>
        already have a belief that the system is corrupt
       </em>
       .  Therefore, if someone consistently denies conspiracies, or defends Obama, or defends the NSA, or defends congress, or defends the status quo, or defends monsanto or defends GMOs; or defends Israel or anti-intellectualism/Nazism/nationalism/militarism (fascism / cryptofascism), then you are a shill for certain; because the facts of their wronghood have been exposed and are now
       <strong>
        <em>
         irrefutable
        </em>
       </strong>
       , so
       <em>
        taking an opinion that willfully ignores reality which also serves to justify the oppressors
       </em>
       is the hallmark of a
       <em>
        shill
       </em>
       .

       Guess I'm a shill then, because almost all my posts here are "denialist". Except, no, I'm not -  that's actually because I'm not going to argue with posts discussing the conspiracies which I accept e.g. MKULTRA or HAARP.  I read 'em, upvote and move on to taking down another Sandy Hoaxer or whatever. [I also have a particular user for this sub, due to the stalkerish tendencies of some here]

       Except a lot of these, again, apply to proponents of conspiracies equally as well "Double standards in the application of criticism", for example, we see all time. MSM? Lies! Russia Today or FARS? Unvarnished truth! And I trust I need not point at "Use of ridicule or ad hominem attacks in lieu of arguments" or "Presenting insufficient evidence or proof"?

       To me, I don't really care about a person's motives. You can very rarely tell these with any degree of accuracy in an online forum, and in the long run, it doesn't matter. Facts are facts, and that's what both proponents and critics should be arguing about.

       'Shill' has become a loaded word, especially here. It's lost most of its meaning, which was vague in the first place.

       There's paid and unpaid shills. I prefer to call the people you describe 'authoritarians' rather than 'shills' because it's less confusing, less emotionally charged and doesn't suggest that you have unshared evidence of malfeasance.

       You'll pardon me if I don't take an article with the headline, "Academia’s biotech prostitutes exposed" as an unbiased report on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       That aside, I've no doubt Monsanto do have their PR staff working forums - but there are plenty of non-employees who genuinely and consistently do support GMO's. I'm neutral, personally, but I'd say that to dismiss opponents, regardless of the topic, as "shills" seems basically to admit you've lost the argument before it begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm perpetually amused by things like "The Gentleperson's Guide to Forum Spies", because I see most of the tactics it describes being used by conspiracy advocates, every bit as much. It's not a guide to spies, it's a guidebook to virtually any online discussion.

        which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food. Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while

       You've completely failed to show that Folta's opinions or research were in any way the result of the money. And it's not as if, say, the organic industry funds scientists. Oh, hang on. They do. And, worse, just last month it was revealed the resulting studies miraculously

       Maybe not a shill, but a good old fashioned counter-revolutionary of the sort that the Stasi and the Khmer Rouge identified and eliminated so effectively. Pol Pot's brilliant insight that counter-revolutionaries can be identified not only by their dissenting opinions, but by the fact that many wear glasses, could be put to good use here if we could get some pictures of commenters.

       Again,  these are really just words, nothing more.  How you react to words is totally dependent on you and nobody else.  I personally don't think that having people tell others to ignore me,  or personally attack me would phase me in the slightest.

       Heh, perhaps.  It's never happened to me,  so I can only theorize what my reaction would be.  I know for sure though,  because it has happened before,  that I would not be bothered in the slightest if someone called me a shill.

       I don't know this user's history, but its unclear to me that this comment was a Rule 10 violation.  The rule prohibits attacks on "this sub, users or mods thereof", but the "sea of stupidity" reference appears to me to refer not to the users but to the comments suggesting that the sub is overrun with shills who can be identified by the opinions they express alone. I'm not terribly impressed with this idea myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suggesting that other commenters' ideas are stupid or naive isn't good manners, but it is pretty commonplace on this sub.  If you are going to ban people for that, I can put together an excel spreadsheet of another 40 or 50 people to add to the ban list.

        I think unless you really are a shill, there's really no reason to get upset. Usually those who get upset about be called a shill are in a likelihood a shill.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       People of all stripes get upset when they're falsely accused of being something unflattering. It's ridiculous to think that that's somehow a confirmation of the unproven (and virtually unprovable) accusations.

       History shows the opposite. Look at totalitarian regimes that mass-murder whole villages of 'shills' because they are deemed a 'spade' for vague and malleable reasons. Abuse of power and corruption like that isn't tolerated among the mod team here. That's more akin to the thought-policemen who run places like
       <a href="/r/News">
        /r/News
       </a>
       who have massive lists of users to auto-censor with their bot.

       Well there is a reason for that.  I was called a shill before because I posted something that people didn't understand.  There is a regular here I think is a white power antisemite, and propagandizing for the same, but they aren't a shill.  I find them infuriating but I can tell you they have a right to their opinion so it's better to investigate and read their post history before jumping the gun.

         Some of the articles and research written and published just few years ago, after

          Mr. Snowden
         </a>
         made his startling revelations about the US Intelligence Community blatantly illegally spying on all US citizens and the methods they use, has either gone completely missing or has been buried under mountains of government/corporate friendly data and lies. The search algorithms, offered to costumers by certain private companies, has been modified to "disappear" the "controversial" data.

          </em>
         </strong>
         If you search the internet for 9-11 related material, you are much more likely to find scientifically inaccurate material, deliberate misleading material or material planted by the US Intelligence Community, than you are finding useful material for further study. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the subject at hand, you most likely end up with a "The Arabs did it in corporation with Evil Alien Reptilians" style material, which of cause will scare away any sane person. Sometimes you can observe how the Reddit moderator team blatantly censor new 9-11 articles by rigging the votes, only to allow a wave of misleading articles and posts to flood the r/conspiracy forum.

         If you post anything on Reddit about the crushing economic inequality, corporate crimes, financial crimes, financial rigging (LIBOR, FOREX, gold, silver, interest rates) your comments section will be crushed by waves of paid government Sh!lls &amp; Pund!ts (or smart computer algorithms). If your post made it to the front page, they will immediately remove it. Most "controversial" posts will die a silent death due to rigging of the voting mechanics (their favorite method).

       Independent journalism, good news sources and unbiased data is hard to come by...virtually impossible! I use a broad specter of news channels, sources and expert opinion.

       You make a lot of sense but I cannot agree 100% on the limits you are placing, unless these are your own ideals. For example if there were a certain group of evil gazillionairs who were using Biblical scriptures as a road map to domination, then knowledge of Biblical texts would be crucial to defending against this attack. Science is a tool created by humans to allow us to understand the world around us and beyond but science tends to ignore what it cannot measure. Religion/spirituality is basically a stop gap so we do not lose the knowledge of good and evil, our moral compass if you will. Just mho.

         Using the bible or any other text from an earl era, especially if you are literal and uneducated, is extremely problematic. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism all have their share of bat shit crazy followers, who all tend to drag everyone around them down with them.

         Strong moral values, not bigotry, is very important. Good moral values doesn't necessarily stem from religion. Good moral values can originate from many different sources, but at their core they have a fundamental respect for human life and our somewhat limited ability to navigate and understand the world around us :-)

       Philosophy, if not a higher power is a good answer was the only valid source I could think of. There has to be some answers in the collective knowledge of human experience. Religion, imo, is just another control mechanism.

       Religion is good for control, no doubt about that. TV is good for controlling people too. The internet is good for controlling too, if you can control the flow of information too. Ill give them an A for effort.

       I can't even watch a movie anymore without dissecting the social engineering and TV, pointless. Seems to me as if reality has been inverted. The sad thing is that with our level of technology, the elimination of poverty and hunger globally are within reach but we are denied technology which makes us independent from a centralized control mechanism and we are only allowed to have tech that makes us MORE dependent on the same :(

       Here.  You just have to find the posts by users who care to do good conspiracy research and are willing to engage in criticisms and counter-research.  The ISIS proxy army threads are what I'm thinking of at this moment.  Corbett report is often cited because he does good research also.  An oldie but goodie is the mae brussell archive on youtube.  Her work is incredible.  There's a lot of goofy people in the conspiracy space but Brussell is a rational, pragmatic breath of fresh air.

       Yes I have seen this trend, even on YouTube. Many videos that I have watched about conspiracy have been removed just in the past year I believe you when you say it's a wide spread problem. In the information age it seems like they are catching up with the times.

       Yrp.  I noticed this also.  It seems there is an effort to use SEO and SERP abusively by populating the web with a bunch of crap such that it will 'float up' to the top of Google.  Now this isn't
       <em>
        simply
       </em>
       subverting google, they are too smart for that (I used to code for an SEO company)... so I firmly believe google is participating actively in the gaming of the system to promote content about pop celebrity garbage while demoting content related to 9/11 truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to get infuriated with google's abject inability to give me contextually accurate stuff anymore, but then i realized, "no, google doesn't suck now...they are gaming, they are gaslighting, they are confabulating the public"...They've gone to the dark side (well, they were
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       the dark side)...it's very obvious now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use Duckduckgo but it's not much better.   Startpage gets their results from google.  It seems reddit search of very specific things, plus your memory plus bookmarking is the only way to remember / recall stuff now.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are actively destroying the internet culture and ruining people's relationship with information---on purpose.

       I prefer to see the sub as it would be  "in the wild" no matter how that "wild" may appear. If we can't confront and effectively oppose the paid sector here on our own turf without using the crutch of  censorship,  we are a doomed class anyway. I see us as a  slowly rising force even with the help of our detractors.

       The problem with that is that the sub is always under attack from hostile sub sets of people on Reddit. We're here getting rid of trolls that make new accounts almost daily. Other than that not much else ever gets removed. The mod team truly doesn't feel the need to remove stuff here like other subs I know of.

       Consider the signal to noise ratio. The more noise the less likely people will be to sift through it. I am not advocating anything, simply pointing out that there is essentially no way to deal with an overabundance of shitposting.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this is an effect from more people 'waking up' and flooding the sub PLUS the increased shills that would go along with making sure those minds go right back to sleep.

       Wow, I did not know this. Two years ago I was doing BTR shows every Wednesday night on Conspiracy Theory/fact and interviewing folks like Heather Gass on the Delphi Technique, Mike Hansen on Bohemian Grove, victims of electronic harassment, etc, etc. Even had folks calling in giving live reports at events but I quit because I thought it was all going mainstream lol. Thanks for the info. I guess maybe I should get back in the game.

       Compare that to the front page now, it makes me sad. Same thing that happened to digg though, that's just the lifecycle of social media sites like these. They always sell out to corporations and governments.

       Yes, it is funny though that even Trump supporters use this safe space tactic now. Americans as a whole, left or right or neither, are losing their ability to tolerate conflicting opinions, probably because everyone's emotions are high-strung because the economy has been very bad since 2008 and I think a lot of people are in a mild state of panic, and thus avoid anything that emotionally perturbs them as much as they can. We're all making our own echo chambers so we don't have to feel uncomfortable, imo. Fear of others is taking over our culture, which I think is because success is harder and harder to come by.

       Political conspiracies are always a hot topic at this point in the "election" cycle. They'll pretty much disappear again after the "election". Then, in 4 years, it'll happen again.

       I agree with this, great point. I've been frustrated by all the political content lately, too, but now that you put it this way I'm realizing that a bunch of subs are dealing with this. I saw a mod post on ELI5 the other day saying no more political posts--I don't think it was anything underhanded; I just think the sub got sick and tired of all the political posturing. That's just one example of a sub I've seen that's facing this same issue and is arguably even a less appropriate place for political posts than r/conspiracy. Additionally, the higher level of general political/current events awareness is also probably focusing more outside attention on this sub, making it more vulnerable to manipulation and paid shitposts. But that's another thing that should decline after the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's time to lose hope yet. I've seen this sub go through a lot, and while I'm not going to say it's just as good as it was when I joined--I'd really have to reflect on that--I still think it's worthwhile. There is a ton on here that I vehemently disagree with, don't get me wrong. But it is a place where skepticism is considered a virtue, and that's a rare and precious quality.

       also doesn't tolerate politcs of any kind any more.  I tried to post a thing about the role of the media in politics (it wasn't partisan or relevant to hillary/trump/bernia, it was about the media) and I had to remove it because it said no politics. I believe this is a relatively new thing.  You have to post to

       They did that during the fatpeoplehate fracas because they wanted to ban/censor any videos dealing with 'SJWs' or cry-bullies. They use the broadest definition for "politics" possible, except when they agree with the sentiment of the video, then it's totally not "politics".

       From what i have experienced in the past two years being a lurker here is that the mods of r/conspiracy are pretty damn liberal with what they allow here. I've seen some shady shit here and there, and i think that fundamentaly comes from well worded butthurt posters who actually violated a rule and are upset their post was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might be some legitimate manipulation going on here in this sub, but i think the discredit that comes from outside sources should warrant worry then the people who moderate this sub. As misconstrued as it may seem, this is truly the last bastion of free speech that can actually reach a wider audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have our differences, but every moderator of r/conspiracy seems pike a guy i could sit down and have a beer with. Remeber one thing about your online experiece, we are all real people as easy as it is to differentiate  a user name from a living breathing person. We seek the truth, and this is the last forum the will actually be heard. These guys are badasses, and sometimes they have to make choices based on the rules set that not everyone will agree with. Take a logical stand point man, we need r/conspiracy.

       You can reach a larger audience in the default subs too, it just has to be carefully crafted. Completely unhampered speech that is controversial - mods are gonna crack down on that. Know thy game, win thy game.

       OP isn't concerned with karma or internet points. OP's point is about the apparent censoring of posts that might expose a real conspiracy. Considering that is literally the name of the sub, I don't know why anyone would be surprised that this sub would be a HUGE target.

       I don't believe I suggested anything. Just commented on the trend I have seen and others have commented on as well. My messages to the moderators were information and opinion seeking in nature as well. I demand nothing, I only seek clarification. I don't frequent this sub for Trump vs Hillary. I frequent this sub for truth and knowledge.

       Likewise, but there's so much fuckery involved in politics, and so much wasted energy expended following the divide and conquer programming that politics promotes that it's hardly surprising it takes over a bit in election season. You're free to scroll past the political stuff still. Maybe try sorting by controversial for the posts buried by the bread and circuses.

       My point I was trying to make is that open discussion on theories remain at zero votes. There are obviously bots controlling the votes. I am not the only one that has pointed this issue out. Ergo, they gain no traction. I have tested this myself by up voting a post, instantly it gets voted back to zero. I take away my vote (post is -1) instantly voted up to zero. Wash, rinse, repeat.

       I suspect this is happening to you more than other people, my posts vary from doing badly to doing ok depending on whether they resonate with enough people or appeal to a broad section of users from both sides of the political divide.
       <br/>
       It's possible you do have a downvote bot following you around as self posts seem to get traction if they appeal to enough people but they're usually well formatted and quite comprehensive in nature.

       I don't doubt it for a second, it's confirming it on a specific case that's a bit tricky. Ultimately this is a marketing platform nowadays and I'd be surprised if it wasn't happening. Ask yourself why none of the sites selling reddit upvotes are blacklisted by reddit and it becomes obvious enough.

       Ah sorry, then I don't know what to suggest, reddit's vote fuzzing makes it incredibly difficult to tell if there's any vote manipulation happening. Possibly by design as they took away the comment upvote/downvote scores that showed this in action.

       I'm fairly certain that what you're talking about (votes not seeming to count) is a reddit-wide "glitch" and it happens in all subs. Log out and look at the numbers of any thread, they'll be different. It's just reddit's weird code.

       But that's not what he's saying. And I've noticed it as well. In the new queue, if a post is about a particular issue, it will attract enough bots to counter the upvotes and keep the post at zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments however get bot swarms that lump on 30 downvotes in 10 mins if it's about the wrong (right) issue so they become practically invisible too.

       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">

       Well, I care.  Even though you and I don't agree on a lot of things, jacks.  I value that you are allowed to have an ungamed opinion here.  I don't like 'the will of the people' being mutated by people who have the money and time to invest in shaping public opinion unfairly through a battery of paid people or through software.  It breaks democracy in the same way as the electoral college does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if your comment gets immediately downvoted to 1 (or 0) then your being deprived of a voice and of agency because other people will not get to see it.  If it's a legit 1, that's fine, but it's very statistically unlikely that you;re comments are 1 every time--that's a hallmark of being controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I can't personally downvote you fast enough jacks lol so having a 1 is true evidence your'e being controlled :)  I kid

       Hah.  It would be cool if you allowed everything but made people tag stuff like they do in other subs.  That way you could filter them out.   Something like 'nopolitics' tag, or let people use multiple tags   (NSA + Whistleblowing)

       The mods don't censor (well; sometimes they do) but it's not necessary to have friendly mods in order to get your view censored. People with money hire PR firms with lots of users who can get anything done online.

       It seems to me that the main problem with this sub is very low-credibility "conspiracy theories" - UFOs, Illuminati, "no planes on 9/11" etc. In some cases, it does appear to be professional shills, in other cases, just bored trolls, and in many cases just superstitious people obsessed with getting internet points.

       Here we see 911bodysnatchers322 using the typical tactics: trying to associate 9/11 truth and evidence of criminal conspiracies with UFOs, Illuminati, "no planes on 9/11" and "space beams" type disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when this is pointed out, 911bodysnatchers322 makes accusations of shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, he's doing exactly what he is accusing me of doing. The 911debunkers site has never engaged in any low-credibility non-conspiracy theories about UFOs, Illuminati, or "no planes."
      </p>

       No, OP's post will be allowed a small number of upvotes by the ones pulling the strings of Reddit, only to make OP's prediction wrong and serve to discredit. I know that sounds far fetched, but I made a post a few months back and said almost the same thing, and my post ended up with around the same score. High enough to blend in, low enough to stay FAR away from the juicy front page.

       Exactly right. People seem to forget that everything is cause and effect. If you call out a manipulating subreddit and say something like "My post will stay at 0" then those manipulating will sub will upvote your post to try to humiliate you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the OP said nothing, it would have been downvoted to 0. Again, a move designed to humiliate him.

       Just saying that the success of this thread essentially moots your point and proves that the types of thoughts you described AREN'T entirely suppressed. Of course half the reason I think it did so well is because people upvoted to make it a hypocrisy for the sake of humor.

       I will slightly disagree. The presidential election is a big political event which shows up many of the conspiracies that we deal with on a regular basis here. Lack of political representation, foreign policy, ballot box stuffing, racism, classism, media control, etc.

       Hey, thanks for standing up for the self-posters OP.   I personally appreciate it since I've noticed this phenomenon and it pisses me off.  I'll spend literally half a day researching stuff and constructing a narrative to prove what I'm seeing as a conspiracy to share with you and it will get like 10-25 upvotes.  Don't get me wrong, I believe there is MUCH more support for this kind of stuff--based primarily on the overwhelmingly positive feedback I get in the comments--leading me to believe there is a sockpuppet army or software that is controlling my posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you mentioned, someone will repost some 9/11 evidence from 2006, or some kind of imgur meme, or even 'the history of your enslavement' which is an old and not entirely correct cartoon I've seen here not less than 20 times in a decade, and it will get upvoted like to 300.  No
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regular would post that.  Meanwhile a truther regular like molybdenum will post some new or obscure 9/11 thing and it will be stuck around 20-30 if it makes it that far.  I know there's a
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       sub, but it was being gamed so much also (by the same chicanery we're seeing here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ), that I know many of us left and hangout here primarily now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish there were a more sub-specific karmic means to self-regulate this sub.  I don't like inhibiting newcomers but it would be nice to be able to autokill already debunked stuff even I'm guilty of posting (simpsons predictive programming comes to mind--my bad) and also kind of 'slowing down' its upward ascent while promoting specific posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be nice if reddit allowed you to sacrifice some of your karma to promote things you think are important.  Like, I lose 20 karma to give 3-5 karma to a specific post.

       Hey no problem I've seen this happening and wanted to point it out. I saw it happen with your post about the chocolate as well. I tried to up vote your post but it instantly got down voted. Intellidino said that they (mods) no longer can view important metrics. Seems like reddit is centralizing control over the system. Too bad because there really is no motivation or financial gain that I can imagine by doing this. On the flip side there could be incentives from outside sources. That is the only thing I can think of. I really do enjoy this sub and the people that frequent it, I just don't want to feel like I have to fight to get to the good/interesting stuff. The community votes should make that happen.

       Heh, I disagree. I think unless you really are a shill,  there's really no reason to get upset.  Usually those who get upset about be called a shill are in a likelihood a shill.  Why not just let the community decide if they agree or not with the accusation?  The people here are typically pretty good at sniffing out the shills, and should be allowed to call it like they see it IMO.

       Here we see 911bodysnatchers322 using the typical tactics: trying to associate 9/11 truth and evidence of criminal conspiracies with UFOs, Illuminati, "no planes on 9/11" and "space beams" type disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when this is pointed out, 911bodysnatchers322 makes accusations of shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, he's doing exactly what he is accusing me of doing. The 911debunkers site has never engaged in any low-credibility non-conspiracy theories about UFOs, Illuminati, or "no planes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, the JREF promote associating the actual 9/11 truth movement with such things.
