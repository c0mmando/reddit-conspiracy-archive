       Shouldn't a Revolution be talking about auditing the DoD and the Federal Reserve?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about prosecuting the extensive list of U.S. war criminals?
(Kissinger, GHW Bush, the Clintons, GW Bush, Obama, Cheney, George Tenet, John Brennan, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       What about putting Wall Street executives on trial for their financial crimes?  Citigroup alone has been allowed to pay over 80 settlements since 2000
      </p>

       Courts arent going to do shit for a 'revolution'. You can't use the system of the people that need to be taken down to take them down.
Revolutions have only ever worked when violence was used as a tool. Our forefathers would be shooting by now.

       Benjamin Fulford contends that the ones in power are being closed in upon on the highest levels. Black Hat vs. White Hat. One would think this is the only way things could play out in favor of humanity. The revolution will be in the form of our personal awakening to the matrix.

       this is why nothing gets done, because nobody really knows

        who

       they need to take out
      </p>

       this is cos they don't understand that there aren't individuals 'conspiring' against them that they need to take out, it's a
       <em>
        machine

       ; a machine may have it's organs, but unless the whole machine is taken down it will just develop new organs.

       This is why communities like this have plopped up upon people's radars. Although it may be a machine, and an individual or group may be uncertain as to who to take out, we are still here spreading these ideas, truths, and news. Eventually, it will rock the machine like pouring sand into a gear box, or pouring CNC oil into an old and broken machine. Eventually, problems will be found and perfected. And the parts that are broken will be evident.

       You may not agree with me, but no matter what you have to say, if you express it with the grammar of a special 6th grader, it automatically undermines the value of what you're saying. What you said makes sense, but there's a part of me that goes 'should I really give any value to what he has to say? This seems like it may have been written by a monkey with a typewriter...'
      </p>
      <p>
       Made worse by the fact that you're actually trying to sound smart (kinda got that vibe from this comment, but your other comments definitely confirmed it'. In this case, your grammar just makes it seem like you think you're way smarter than you really are.

       And now, finally; what the holy shit are you on about. Ok, I may have ignored some obvious grammatical features, but fuck me sideways, it is completely coherent. Also this is reddit not a fucking whatever spelling olympics

       Hmm referring back to my 'filter' pitch, I think it works because
       <em>
        why the fuck would I want to have an 'intellectual' discussion with somebody who is making a dumb fuck assumption based on grammar
       </em>
       . On top of that, your assumption is an ASSumption, it is weak as ass;
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You don't know me, you don't know my agendas, you don't know what I think 'Smart' even means in the first place, so you have no merit to ASSume that I'm even striving to acquire a quality
         <em>
          that you
         </em>
         have determined yourself.

       <li>
        <p>
         Pretty dumb and hypocritical (and ironic too lol), that
         <em>
          you
         </em>
         dare lecture me about grammar and 'trying to sound smart'. Of course,
         <em>
          you
         </em>
         , with your prophetic wisdom are able to determine 'what undermines the value' of a comment; a fucking know-it-all tells me I got an egoist arrogance problem.

        <p>
         I really don't care anyway; my philosophical perspective on the matter is akin to Socrates &amp; the Oracle of Delphi

      </ol>
      <p>
       <em>
        The only reason you identify me with egoism and arrogance is because you have those qualities and you labelled me with them. Because you're aware that people take issue with you for those qualities, you're quick to judge others on it, after all, you have plenty of experience. You know how those condemnations are expressed so you can spit them out as fast as lighting
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this not because I know 'people like you' or anything, but simply because that is the only reason why people take issue with anything -
       <em>
        Because it is one of their problems that they are trying to fix so they sub-concious has zero tolerance for 'broken' qualities it is trying to fix

       a revolution? you mean the one that was supposed to happen several years ago? can we put it on hold another few more years? i think im getting my compensation for gang stalking soon and would rather enjoy my millions than risk my life helping you idiots who were too stupid to realize the revolution should've happened years ago.

       Even if there were an "audit", it would end up being a
       <em>
        9/11 or Warren Commission
       </em>
       style fraud, an exercise in futility, imo.  I am very cynical of
       <em>
        fixing
       </em>
       things from within our current system.  The real levers of change have been removed.  I believe what JFK said: "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA was impossible to destroy back in his day (JFK), and they've had all this time to fortify and strengthen.  Bush even added Homeland Security, which is a massive program that benefits the state apparatus, and I do not believe makes us any more "safe."  People are under almost complete control but don't even notice.  Most are just fine with the NSA spying, and that whole pesky Snowden thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose my point is, if we really want our country back, it won't happen by electing even a Bernie Sanders or Trump.  They are almost entirely just figureheads.  (But most people right now, are under the impression that it will result in real change, which is a fantasy in my opinion.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, a revolution will be bloody, and probably make the civil war look like a walk in the park.  That is what will be necessary for things to really change.  Any half-measures will result in the same corrupt system in only a short matter of time.  Unlimited money will corrupt almost anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pelosi and Obama allowed the shrub to get off scott free.  Holder yawned at the calls for bankers to be imprisoned, and in fact he went immediately back to the lucrative banking industry, without most people batting an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will need to either be without food for a while or something major before waking up.  Even when millions of people lost their homes around 2008, nothing happened.  People are easily pacified and manipulated.  The average american is a dumbass, I'm sorry to say, but it's the truth.  Hunger, or some equally motivating factor will have to get people up off their couches.  Even in the information age, the average american is completely in the dark as to how fucked everything is.

       I wonder who they would appoint to this commission style audit? Maybe Kissinger again? Lmao! It's not even the people who run the game anymore that we have to replace, it's the game itself. Fuck the state, humanity must be liberated from the bonds of tyranny. We must be free to self-govern, and until we are then everything else is just a band-aid. =/

       Using the term "revolution" to describe
       <em>
        just another General Election
       </em>
       is hyperbole. The 'regular people' on both sides have been openly told by their party leaders that

       will choose the candidates.
