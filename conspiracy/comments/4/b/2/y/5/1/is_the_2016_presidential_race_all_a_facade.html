       Trump attracts the older generation and views, on the other hand Sanders attracts the younger generation...is all this unrest just a big show while something is going on in the back? Maybe, it's meant to divide us, to keep our eyes off the real enemy...

       Spot on and I find trump to also be the Simon Cowell of politics, the uber asshole who tells it like it is but is still just another judge on some stupid reality show. It's a natural progression, I think. The Internet has exposed the common man to true violence and how horrible people can be so we get a leader who can match that. I fear this will now be the standard format in politics. just like every reality talent show has the asshole judge, we're going to get the asshole politician. But it doesn't change things because it's still some stupid reality show.

       Your comment reminds me of Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood. These two brilliant teens grow up watching the most horrendous shit imaginable on the internet, and grow up to be scientists working on advanced genetics and shit. Together with some girl they met through rape videos (I think) conspire to end civilization and mankind. Replacing man with a new genetically engineered race.

       Well looking at some stuff on YouTube and Facebook I am not so sure I want true real democracy. I really think many people should not be allowed to vote. We already stop inmates why not some sort of requirements, like owning a dog or driving a car, you must prove some level of competency.

       As far as I am concerned only about 100 oligarch are allowed to vote in the US presidential election. After they have selected their two puppet candidates you get the privileged of choose which color of necktie you prefer. It is a suckers game.

       Trump is being demonized by the corporate owned mass media, don't get me wrong I don't like him or support his policies, but he is the only Republican that can make Hillary look like an acceptable presidential candidate. Good cop bad cop routine, it isn't really a choice.

       I actually think Mr. Sanders makes the most sense. Mrs. Hillary is so corrupt and filthy it could make a Sicilian mafia boss blush with shame. Mr. Trump is a buffoon, a spoiled rich kid, who doesn't understand the world around him. Mr. Trump is properly still a better candidate than Mrs. Hillary, because he isn't corrupt or a certified mass murderer. They are the best choices the USA 2-party could produce...

       No matter what comment I would have said about Bernie, somebody is gonna step up to defend him. This is reddit. But there's no denying that in the eyes of the average American (minimally informed), his ideas are a pretty big step from the status quo. That makes him radical.

       Not really against the status quo, every other major country grants universal healthcare. A lot have free public college. But yeah, to someone who isn't informed that does seem a bit radical I guess.

       Yes, Bernie is too radical, his ideas have been mostly discredited, and the establishment is hardly "right-wing."

       Your boy Bernie Sanders has much of the same platform as the corporate establishment: mass immigration, amnesty, multi-culturalism, globalism, support for Israel, etc. etc.

      <p>
       Of course they don't. Big oil and pharma companies promote "diversity," affirmative action, open borders, globalism, free trade (remember, the modern era of free trade was started by Al Gore and NAFTA) and you even have corporations like Google promoting gay marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those ideas are "right wing." Also, "liberal" has always been for free markets and capitalism, that is how the term originated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amusing that the progressive left and the global corporate elite agree on so very many things. Far from "fighting the man" the progressive leftists are the shock troops of globalism.

These corporations pay for all the republicans to be their bitches.

       Oh god, it was Progressive Barack Obama who received the most money from Wall Street. Now, Wall Street is solidly behind Clinton. It was Al Gore, considered quite liberal and a hero to the progressive left, that introduced the major free trade bills. It is the Democrats who support open borders, mass immigration, diversity, and all the rest of the policies that the corporate elite want.

       Corporations would love universal health care because then they wouldn't even need to pay for their employee's health insurance.

       Oy, vey. The Nordic countries are capitalist - in fact, they are some of the most advanced economies on earth. Yes, they most assuredly do have a very strong welfare state. But that's not "socialism" democratic or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie Sanders is a decades long Washington insider with a conventional voting record. It is just because you're young. You just haven't had enough time to realize what Sanders is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in my day there was a guy named Dennis Kucinich, he was the Bernie Sanders of his time. Just like Bernie, he talked a good game - his voting record told a different story though - and he eventually dropped out and endorsed the Democratic nominee - just like Bernie will.

       As a British person viewing this circus from the outside, I get the feeling that Trump probably doesn't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be President because it would interfere with his grandstanding and business activities.  Would he really want to live in the White House and deal with foreign heads of state, handle delicate matters of federal law, deal with Congress, deal with the CIA and the Pentagon etc.?  Would any of his ludicrous and deleterious "policies" even pass first base?

       Or would he rather just go back to his vulgar Trump Tower penthouse and carry on wheeling and dealing property?

       His campaign seems to be a publicity stunt and self-aggrandisement opportunity designed to upset the apple cart and let him be the centre of attention for a while.  Unfortunately, this has got
       <em>

       out of hand and he's picked up too much support so he has no choice but to continue and see it through.

       I see Trump and Clinton winning their nominations, with Clinton to win outright.

       Trump's been musing a presidential run since the 90's. It's really not a stunt. In fact, he's lost key business partnerships because of what he has said.

       I know I'm beating a dead horses here, but there are a lot of signs pointing to August of this year. The date on the guidestones, Dr. Sal's warning, Edgar Cayce's predictions of a geomagnetic shift (which coincide with Dr. Sal's), the claims made by the Inuit tribe in Arctic Alaska, I could go on. Third eagle prophecy (er whatever) posted a video or two in which he showed the prevalence of the number 816 in predictive programming.. I could go on, it seems like every year there are a ton of new reasons to think it may be our last.

       No. Its real. Its a way for the oligarchy to pit their most loyal puppets against each other and see who comes out on top. Buying the media or rigging a ridings vote isn't like hacking the game, its more like picking up a blue turtle shell.

       Saying Trump is attracting the older generation while Sanders is attracting the younger is false. There are a lot of either in both camps.

       The difference is, the younger generation in Trump's camp are sick of cultural decay and career politicians while the younger people in Sanders camp have been deceived by cultural Marxism and are the faithful followers of the new, modern religion.

       All Candidates who are in the running for the Presidency have been pre selected, because they have fickle morals and can be corrupted by $$$. If someone wants to take away power from the big corporations, and hand it back to the people, do you really think they'd be allowed to run for President? Not a chance.

       I have plenty of black and Hispanic friends who support Trump. I think 90% is an accurate figure.

       Maybe I'm just being ignorant, but I think you're being a little too cynical. we'll see how it all pans out though.
