        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">90</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-03-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/daddie_o.html">daddie_o</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>[Note: see Edit 9 at bottom for links to some decisive youtube clips.]</p>

<p>I have begun to notice some inconsistencies in the reporting on the Belgium bombing attacks. [The biggest inconsistencies are between the eyewitness reports that tend to be in agreement and the photographic evidence that has emerged.] I encourage others to post similar inconsistencies and other evidence (like crisis actors, etc.) here as it emerges. </p>

<p>First is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/22/story-behind-brussels-photo-you-saw-everywhere-not-able-help-them/82134802/">this report in USA today</a> about the photographer who took the picture of two wounded women (see link for pic). I&#39;m going to pull out different bits from that article and another one and then discuss all the inconsistencies. In the USA Today article it says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ketevan Kardava [a Georgian photo-journalist] ... was in the departure hall of the Brussels Airport in Belgium ... when the first explosion went off a meter and a half from where she was standing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A meter and a half is just under 5 feet. Keep that in mind.</p>

<p>The article also quotes her as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Her first reaction was to take out her camera as glass, debris and smoke swirled in the air around her. &quot;I was in shock. It was instinct...Everyone was covered in blood. They lost their legs. All of them,” she said. &quot;I kept looking to see my legs. With my hands, I wanted to feel them.&quot;</p>

<p>Kardava says as soon as she realized she was alive, she screamed for help....&quot;I was shouting “Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! And no one was there.” When no one came, she took her camera back out and snapped the photo of the &quot;woman in the yellow jacket.&quot;  </p>

<p>She kept taking photos and screaming for help until armed soldiers came and told everyone who was able to, to run as fast as they could.</p>

<p>&quot;The people I photographed were not able to run and I wasn’t able to help them. It was very, very difficult for me to leave them. I was the only person on my feet. I wanted to help all of them but I couldn&#39;t. I left them. I had to — we expected a third explosion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don’t know how I did it. I don’t know how I took that photo. As a journalist, it was my instinct. I posted it on Facebook and wrote &#39;Explosion … Help us.’&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there&#39;s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3505022/Hero-airport-worker-pulled-seven-wounded-victims-safety-Brussels-terror-blasts-eye-witnesses-apocalyptic-horror-inside-terminal.html">this report in the Daily Mail</a> from the heroic baggage handler (the Carlos Arredondo of this affair): </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I heard a man shout some Arabic words then an explosion.. then a second explosion, a massive explosion, much bigger....&#39;It was a horror. I saw at least seven people dead. There was blood. People had lost legs. You could see their bodies but no legs,&#39; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More details on blood and dismemberment: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Terrified passengers at Brussels Airport have told how there was &#39;just blood&#39; everywhere after this morning&#39;s bomb blast and likened the horrific aftermath to &#39;the apocalypse&#39;....Blood-soaked passengers sprinted for their lives as smoke filled the area near the check in desks.&quot;</p>

<p>One witness struggled to hold back tears as he described victims who had lost their legs lying in pools of blood in the airport&#39;s main hall. Others described seeing &#39;dismembered bodies everywhere&#39; and the ceiling collapsing after two blasts rocked the building... Samir Derrouich, who works at a restaurant in the airport, said: &#39;The two explosions were almost simultaneous. They were both at check in desk. One was close to the Starbucks. It was awful. There was just blood. It was like the apocalypse.&#39;</p>

<p>He said: &#39;There was a first blast and then ten seconds later a second explosion. It was a big big blast, the ceiling went down. It was just 30 metres from where I was. I saw people down on the ground and I just went running. </p>

<p>Mr Valaert, who was flying to a business meeting in Berlin, said he believed the bombs were hidden in suitcases that had just been checked in. He said: &#39;The explosions were just behind the service desks, they were blown towards us. To me it is the most realistic possibility. I don&#39;t think it was someone with a suicide vest.&#39; He said he did not hear anyone shout anything before the blasts.</p>

<p>Martin Buxant tweeted how a witness had told him: &#39;We saw bodies go up in the air and then falling down heavily.&#39;</p>

<p>There were reports that shouts in Arabic were heard before the explosions and shots fired in the aftermath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, a timeline: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>8am: Shots heard at Zaventem international airport before someone shouted in Arabic and two explosions rocked the departure hall</p>

<p>8am onwards: Terrified passengers seen streaming out of the terminal while flights are diverted</p>

<p>8.30am: Witnesses describe blasts so powerful victims were thrown in to the air, Airport is closed </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>OK, so here&#39;s my analysis:</strong></p>

<p>Regarding the journalist who allegedly took these pictures:</p>

<p>She was standing 5 feet away from a bomb that went off that was so powerful that &#39;victims were thrown into the air.&#39; It was so powerful that many people had their limbs blown off and the terminal windows were blown out. It may have even been packed with nails. But she&#39;s fine. Just shakes it off and starts snapping pics. According to her everyone around her is &quot;covered in blood. They lost their legs. All of them.&quot; But she&#39;s fine. I dare say she&#39;s luckier than Larry Silverstein. </p>

<p>[EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/23tdM_H7UGw?t=516">here is a video</a> where she is has a still picture of a CCTV camera supposedly from 7:58 AM and shows where she was standing in relation to the bomb. It corroborates her earlier testimony, although it also begs the question of why we have not seen the footage of the bombing yet, since we know they have it, and also why in the pictures are those areas relatively undamaged (except the ceiling tiles and windows). Also note how crowded the area is, but in the pictures we don&#39;t see all those people laying around in pools of blood with their legs and arms blown off.] </p>

<p>Also notice that nobody in any of her pics has lost any legs or other appendages. They apparently have some blood on them, but they&#39;re not covered in it by any stretch. What about the women she photographed? Were they closer to the bomb when it went off? Is that why they were injured? </p>

<p>Also, her testimony contradicts itself. At first she says her immediate instinct was to take out her camera and start taking pictures. But then later she says she called for a doctor first, then had a realization and started taking pictures. If she started taking pictures immediately, how likely is it that the woman in the first picture she took is sitting looking rather composed talking on her cell phone already? (Holding the pristine case with a hand made to look like it is covered in blood that has amazingly managed to dry so quickly.) She says that nobody was able to walk except for her. That woman talking on the phone sure looks like she could get up and walk. We see other people in her pictures walking. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s talk about the pictures. According to her, everybody there has lost legs and is covered in blood. Look at her pictures in the article. Look at the pictures she posted on Facebook that she took (apparently can&#39;t link to facebook here so fill-in-the-blanks-dotcom/ketevan.kardava/photos?source_ref=pb_friends_tl). Do you see anybody without their limbs? Compare those pictures to other descriptions. Do we see &quot;victims who had lost their legs lying in pools of blood in the airport&#39;s main hall&quot; or &quot;dismembered bodies everywhere&quot;? No. Not even close. The pictures don&#39;t match the description. And remember, these are pics she posted to facebook, not censored news. She was free to post any pictures she wanted, no matter how gruesome. And, if she took all the pictures she possibly could, why do we only see 4 or 5 from inside? And why do none of them really match her verbal description of the scene? </p>

<p>Also consider this picture from another source of the ceiling tiles that collapsed in this crowded area: <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/rG8NP">http://imgur.com/gallery/rG8NP</a></p>

<p>Here is another angle: <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/yFyUXq3">http://imgur.com/gallery/yFyUXq3</a></p>

<p>And yet another few angles: <a href="https://twitter.com/FDuboccage/status/712200705625473025">https://twitter.com/FDuboccage/status/712200705625473025</a></p>

<p>This is all from the second blast near starbucks (you can make out the logo in the second picture from twitter in the background). Where are all the pools of blood...blood just everywhere...dismembered bodies...body parts everywhere. Those tiles look like they came down <em>after</em> people had been evacuated from that area. Certainly no evidence they hit or injured anyone. [But see edit 5 below]</p>

<p>[If you want to see real mayhem from real bombings, here are some NSFL links (scroll down for some of them): <a href="http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/19/173219-004-6F98D4AB.jpg">Here</a> and <a href="http://izrael.org.il/kunena.html?view=topic&amp;catid=4&amp;id=102841%20(scroll%20down">here</a> and <a href="https://bugiedallegambelunghe.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/651/%20(scroll%20down">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-israeli-forensics-expert-searches-for-evidence-under-a-news-photo/57348518">here</a>.] [See edit 5 below for even gorier pictures.]</p>

<p>And since we&#39;re talking about Facebook, you can look at her first post about the topic (fill_in_the_blanks_dotcom/ketevan.kardava/posts/10208876053449174?pnref=story). It was posted <strong>8:11</strong> am local time, and the details on the pictures indicate that they were mobile uploads. According to the official timeline, the explosions went off at <strong>8 am</strong>. </p>

<p>Remember now, the story is that &quot;Her first reaction was to take out her camera.&quot; (Later in the article, it actually says she &quot;took her camera <em>back</em> out&quot; and snapped the picture of the woman in a yellow jacket, which was the first picture she took.) The point is: she very clearly used her camera, not her phone, which makes sense given that she&#39;s a photojournalist.</p>

<p>What <em>doesn&#39;t</em> make sense is that between taking all the pictures she could and then being chased out of the terminal by soldiers, she still managed, <em>somehow</em>, to transfer those pictures to her mobile device and then upload them to Facebook before nearly 10 minutes had passed. I admit it&#39;s possible. Assuming the picture taking and evacuation took, say, 6-8 minutes. If she had a wireless SD card she could do have done it once she got outside. She could have had a ton of pictures sent to her phone or icloud, gone through them and selected a few, then uploaded them to her facebook and posted a status update. It&#39;s possible. I just think it would demand such a presence of mind that it&#39;s doubtful. We also don&#39;t know if she had such a wifi card. </p>

<p>And her post does not say &quot;Explosion...help us.&quot; It says (according to google translate), something like: &quot;Explosionnnn at Brussels airport. This was a disasterrrrrrr. Full panicccccc at the airport.&quot;</p>

<p>OK, on to some other inconsistencies.</p>

<p>We are now told that the airport bombs were suicide attacks, and initial reporting indicates that the attackers fired shots and shouted in Arabic before detonating the bombs. But then we have witnesses saying that one or both of the explosions came from luggage behind the check-in desk. So, if the explosives were not planted on the terrorists&#39; bodies but rather in their luggage, then why do they need to commit suicide? Did they have a short range on the detonators? And why did two people need to be there to detonate? Couldn&#39;t one person detonate both bombs? And if they&#39;re there trying to blow people up, why do they need to start shooting (according to some reports)? The whole Kalashnikov angle just seems totally unnecessary and only more likely to expose them before detonating their the vests, since they&#39;d have to reach into their suitcases to pull out their weapons. It also ruins the element of surprise, allowing more people to run away and escape injury. And in the pictures we see of these men, do they look like they&#39;re wearing explosive belts? Something here just doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>Also, in the first picture from the Daily Mail article, the child he is carrying sure seems like a dummy. If the child is unconscious, his body would be limp. If not, well...it just seems awkward. Also, where is he going there? It seems like he&#39;s walking towards or into the wall there. At first I thought maybe he&#39;s going to prop him up against the wall, but the caption says he is being carried out to safety. And what about the poor person laying on the ground behind him? That airline worker is just kind of walking past him... is that what you would do? Or would you stop to try to help?</p>

<p>And speaking of fake children, here is another weird video that someone already posted of someone running with a baby doll carrying it like a real one: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bjwj4/brussels_attacks_crisis_actor_caught_carrying/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bjwj4/brussels_attacks_crisis_actor_caught_carrying/</a></p>

<p>The full &#39;chilling footage taken seconds after Brussels airport blasts&#39; can be seen <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1276272/Chilling-footage-taken-seconds-Brussels-Airport-blasts.html">here.</a> Can anybody see any damage in that footage or anyone injured, let alone dismembered? Any blood? No, all we see is a man picking up a baby doll and running away, followed by his wife/girlfriend. If that doll belonged to their child, they seem to have left her behind. (But not before setting the overturned baby carriage upright.)</p>

<p>For those of you who will say that they were far away from the center of the blast, all you need to do is <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/22/13/3273DC3700000578-3503928-A_police_officer_directs_passengers_in_a_smoke_filled_terminal_a-m-123_1458652018180.jpg">see the still frame from towards the end of the video</a> where a police woman is moving them away. You&#39;ll notice the check-in for &#39;Jet Airways&#39; in the background. A little hunt on the <a href="http://www.jetairways.com/EN/NL/travelinformation/airport-information.aspx">Jet Airways website</a> shows that their check-in and ticketing counter at Brussels airport is check-in row 8 (choose Brussels airport on drop-down menu in link). Then meander over to <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/22/14/32748AC600000578-3504028-image-a-34_1458657296519.jpg">this infographic</a>, which shows that the epicenter of one of the bombs was allegedly between rows 8 and 9, with the other coming from the Starbucks. In other words: this video is coming from the epicenter of the explosions.</p>

<p>Now can we locate more precisely where the photographer is located? If we assume that the people we see walking and running to escape are moving towards the front exit (which is to the photographer&#39;s left), then we can conclude that this person has their back up against the check-in counters of row 9 at the upper end of the check-in counters as displayed in the infographics. </p>

<p>Note that in a second infographic, posted right below the other one in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3504148/79-minutes-terror-two-explosions-airport-one-packed-metro-train-left-34-dead-rush-hour-Brussels.html">this article</a>, shows the epicenter <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/23/02/3279FFFD00000578-3504148-image-m-3_1458701882130.jpg">coming from one aisle over.</a> This is a sign of inconsistency to be sure, but even if the second infographic is correct, the person filming is still very close to the epicenter. Accounts say it detonated near the American Airlines check-in, which is row 8. I see no damage caused by these so-called nail bombs, one of which was allegedly strong enough to throw people into the air. And I don&#39;t see anybody even slightly injured, either. Certainly no blood. </p>

<p>[Edit: See second video in edit 9 for a link to a more recent analysis of bombing locations, which have changed since these early reports. He also pinpoints the location of the fake baby video -- he actually had his back up against counter 8, not at the far end but closer to the blast and the front entrance of the arrivals hall.]</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go back to the now-famous picture of those two women. The women in yellow has now been identified as Nidhi Chaphekar, a stewardess for Jet Airways. According to her facebook page, she <em>worked</em> for Jet Airways. As in, past tense. I thought people usually write <em>works</em> for when they still work someplace. On top of that, you will notice that she is supposed to be wearing a <a href="https://www.google.co.il/search?q=jet+airways+uniform&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWua7ritfLAhXEfiwKHVWEAOcQsAQIGg&amp;biw=960&amp;bih=482#imgrc=_">Jet Airways uniform.</a> It&#39;s basically a long yellow Nehru jacket over a black shirt and black pants. The jackets have a series of buttons that hold them closed. Are we supposed to believe that the blast, which did not injure the photographer, managed to opened up all of those buttons (you can see the loops where the buttons attach in the picture -- it looks like fringe and it&#39;s still intact indicating the jacket was not torn open). Also note that she is not wearing a black shirt underneath, or any shirt for that matter, (presumably against protocol on a conservative airline), and the length of the jacket appears to be much shorter than the standard jacket (though it maybe be occluded behind her). She is also not wearing pantyhose or socks, which appears to be part of the uniform. In short, although they got the jacket color right, everything else seems to be off. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time to dig into the metro blast, but I invite you to look through the pictures <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3504028/At-ten-dead-Brussels-Metro-blast-Horrific-scenes-second-terror-attack-hits-packed-station-400m-EU-headquarters.html">from this article.</a> Lots of pics of non-official rescue personnel wearing yellow vests helping out. Where do those vests suddenly materialize from?  One guy even has a vest strung up around his guitar strapped to his back. And then there&#39;s the couple kissing while some guy is laying on the ground, apparently bloodied, with his hand outstretched and nobody helping him. I admit these pictures, though still absurd in many ways, seem more genuine than the airport ones, and it&#39;s possible that some people were actually injured. Even the stewardess at the airport. But none of this matches the descriptions of the events. We&#39;re supposed to believe that over 200 people were injured, while at most we&#39;re shown maybe a dozen. According to the article I just linked to, the metro blast was so fierce that people were burnt on the street. Doesn&#39;t look that way to me. </p>

<p>And then of course there&#39;s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bl7kw/cbsn_reporting_one_of_the_three_mormons_injured/">that Mormon missionary</a> who was allegedly injured who was also present at the Boston and Paris terror attacks. I guess this is his version of a grand slam? </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bjqtm/cnn_airs_cctv_footage_from_2011_claiming_it_was/">CNN and other news outlets</a> running footage from 2011 and stating it was from the latest Brussels attacks. SMH.</p>

<p>Got anything else? Post in comments and keep em coming...</p>

<p>[EDIT: Apparently not allowed to post to facebook here. Well you can find her profile and find the status update where she posted the pics. Her name is Ketevan Kardava. Also I read somewhere else that the security forces were slow to arrive and it took 10 minutes before they started clearing people out, which would make her Facebook status update even more miraculous. Although the video I linked to indicates that they appear to have started clearing people out rather quickly...]</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Ooh, here&#39;s a really good one: According to <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/brussels-attack-family-nidhi-chaphekar-woman-iconic-airport-image-reacts-1551227">news reports</a>, the flight attendant with the yellow jacket was due to board a flight to Mumbai, but according to the <a href="http://www.jetairways.com/EN/NL/PlanYourTravel/flight-schedules-result.aspx?txtOrigin=BRU&amp;txtDestination=BOM&amp;txtDepartureDate=29-Mar-2016&amp;txtReturnDate=&amp;rdoReturnTrip=False&amp;UserControlClassName=Schedules">Jet Airways flight schedule</a>, there was no flight to Mumbai scheduled for the 22nd. The only flights scheduled out of Brussels were to Toronto at 10:15, to Newark at 10:15 and Delhi (not via Mumbai) at 10:20.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.india.com/news/india/brussels-attack-jet-airways-crew-members-nidhi-chaphekar-amit-motwani-among-injured-1052940/">this story</a> is just ridiculous. If she was supposed to be working that flight to Mumbai (that didn&#39;t exist), she would have already been on the flight with the passengers, not out by the check-in gates. The things they expect us to believe. </p>

<p>Edit 3: Incorrect claim about Jet Airways flight schedule corrected.</p>

<p>Edit 4: I should also point out, in case it isn&#39;t obvious, that apart from the ceiling tiles and windows blown out, there is no sign of physical damage from the alleged nail bombs. One or both of the bombs at the airport were said to be nail bombs, exploding with enough force to lift people off the ground and dismember them left and right. But not only have we seen nothing resembling <em>that,</em> we don&#39;t see any damage from the shrapnel: the walls, signs, monitors, self-check-in kiosks, etc., etc. are in perfect condition. Look at the hall where the ceiling tile came down. Other than the tiles, it&#39;s in pristine condition.</p>

<p>Edit 5: Lest I be accused of failing to consider contradictory evidence, someone <a href="http://www.akhbarona.com/thumbnail.php?file=belg5_462746993.jpg&amp;size=article_large">posted this link in the comments</a>. Here we see our first evidence of both physical damage (other than the ceiling tiles and windows in other pics), in this case damage to the TV screens with flight information and what appear to be people actually injured by the blast or the falling debris. But still, even in this pic, the big signs in the background are untouched, along with the entire rear wall. There is tile hanging down from the ceiling, but tell me how a blast from a nail bomb is supposed to dislodge the ceiling tile without riddling it with holes? If you look both in this picture and in the other pictures of this scene that I linked to from imgur and twitter, the ceiling tile that is hanging or still intact does not appear damaged from shrapnel <em>at all</em>. The plastic signs indicating the number of aisle are also unharmed. In fact, it looks as if the only damage that was caused was due to the falling ceiling tiles, which I suspect were likely rigged and may very well have landed on and actually hurt people. It may have even killed some. But it&#39;s not the story we&#39;re being sold.  </p>

<p>That comment also included a picture we have all seen of the subway car that was allegedly bombed, with pixelated dead bodies removed so we can see the full image. I don&#39;t see anything that looks gory or like dead/burned bodies in the original image, so I don&#39;t consider it to be contradictory evidence. </p>

<p>Compare all the pics we have of Brussels to these others of bomb blasts that really harm real people, including dismemberment and disfigurement and pools of blood (not the same I linked to earlier): NSFL!  <a href="http://www.documentingreality.com/forum/f10/tamil-suicide-bomber-21278/">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.documentingreality.com/forum/f10/suicide-bombers-betcha-ya-cant-do-again-42226/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.documentingreality.com/forum/f10/suicide-bomb-blast-killed-25-injured-32-a-156890/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.documentingreality.com/forum/f10/suicide-blast-sri-lankan-train-station-26057/">here</a> and <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/29/article-1223469-06FD3875000005DC-104_634x430.jpg">here</a> and <a href="http://justgettingyourattention.blogspot.co.il/2009/11/terror.html">here</a> and <a href="http://goldentz.blogspot.co.il/2014/12/jihad-imeuwa-zaidi-ya-watu-5000-mwezi.html">here</a> and <a href="https://gobbledegooked.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/kabul-suicide-attack.jpg">here</a>. Of course I don&#39;t really <em>know</em> if any of those were <em>really</em> real, but they look a hell of a lot more convincing than the &#39;shocking&#39; photos taken by our intrepid, quick-thinking photojournalist with nerves of steel and ice water running through her veins. </p>

<p>Edit 9: Youtuber Changing Reason has a great new channel with high quality stuff. </p>

<p>Here is a video showing clear evidence that one of Kardava&#39;s pictures was Photoshopped:</p>

<p>Here is another video showing all the various locations of the bombings and pictures, also showing glaring impossibilities and inconsistencies in witness testimony. This video also shows that I was wrong about the location of the video with the guy running away with baby doll. I was correct about the aisle, but he was on the end closest to the bombing and the front entrance to the arrivals hall, rather than towards the back:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more i see these things happen the more it makes me ask this question:  Are TPTB deliberately releasing shaky accounts, bad photos, accidentally show a video from a russian bombing just to fuel conspiracy theories?  </p>

<p>Everytime I see this stuff I wonder.  This is a brilliant post, and is pretty objective.  With the information provided this event looks very shady.  But think about how they can control the internet.  They can block whatever they want.  Facebook could be blocking the real photos... the OTHER photos on the journalists camera.  That way they can show the questionable ones and get everyone riled up. </p>

<p>In a world where every media outlet is owned, you have to question everything you see.  Remember divide and conquer.  How many relationships have been ruined just because of an argument about 911 or SH or whatever... </p>

Didn&#39;t really make sense to me so it just sat in my head collecting cognitive dissonance for a while until I came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2939ap/its_been_more_than_a_year_since_edward_snowden/cih651z?context=3">this post</a> and the series of posts linked from the original post, which more or less spells out this exact thing. Guy basically has a whole coherent explanation for where all this craziness is going and it only helps put it into perspective better when you see he&#39;s been saying the same stuff for years. It gets pretty wild if you read it but definitely worth thinking about if you have the same suspicion I do about the discrepancies being planted on purpose.</p>

<p>So your saying that we should believe any evidence we see?  I was stating that critical thinking relies on objective observation.  Keep believing everything you read on the internet its working out great for you.</p>

<p>-You are lying here, that is not what you said. Your three examples:</p>

<p>Im not lying go re-read my fucking post.  Maybe i need to work on my typing skills.  I know that the video of the russian bombing wasnt a true accident.  I should have put &quot;accident&quot; in quotes to imply my sarcasm.  </p>

Belgium is de facto already locked down, so there&#39;s no way of telling if this is even real or just a staged psyop. I want a list of the people who were killed, that would bring me back into he camp of this being an actual event. The whole video of the airport thing, the fact that it came from Russia in 2011, is particularly damning evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>I thought I heard on the world news this morning that Nidhi Chaphekar was also present during the Boston bombing. I was walking through the living room when heard that, stopped and looked at the TV and there was a picture of the woman in a yellow top that was unbuttoned. I never saw the picture of the Mormon guy. I&#39;m going to assume the reporter on GMA made the mistake because I know what I saw and heard because I thought it was odd and made a note in my phone so I could look into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with Miles Mathis or Harald Kautz-Vella but I&#39;m curious so I&#39;m going to read their work.  Something I just noticed that concerns me about Miles Mathis is that his paper &#39;Proof from NASA that pie is 4&#39; is written under the assumption that there are satellites and the first successful orbit was in 1958.   There are no satellites as there is no &#39;space&#39; and thus nothing in orbit.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s exciting what you&#39;re about to uncover, it will make everything else seem small in comparison.</p>

<p>From here you&#39;re things are really going to branch out because there&#39;s so much to learn about, how gravity/relativity are a hoax, Stephen Hawking is a hoax, etc etc  It&#39;s all connected with Masons and the drive to replace &quot;Science&quot; with God/religion, to make us feel insignificant, and to make us question our senses from day 1.  </p>

<p>I recommend John Le Bon&#39;s YT channel, he&#39;s a good moderator for the shows he does too, all very informative (The&#39;Ball Earth Skeptic Roundtable&#39; is 12 episodes and is great listening topic, there&#39;s also 5 or so impromptu chats.

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, thank you!!  </p>

<p>Miles has two main lines of work, conspiracy-related and science-related, though the two sometimes blend. He&#39;s not a flat earther, but would definitely agree with the replacement of science with some kind of mysticism. See for example: <a href="http://milesmathis.com/20c.pdf">http://milesmathis.com/20c.pdf</a> and this <a href="http://milesmathis.com/quant.html">http://milesmathis.com/quant.html</a></p>

<p>The link to all his conspiracy work is <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html">http://mileswmathis.com/updates.html</a></p>

<p>I recommend starting from his earliest forays into conspiracy writing and work forwards from there, since he is discovering a lot of stuff along the way, and he builds on and refers to that stuff later on. You could probably start from his paper from 10/18/13 on Theosophy and the Beat Generation and work your way up. </p>

<p>For Harald Kautz-Vella, I recommend this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQeEnBZiFo&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLt3d0sqKNUuvkpA8IGzLDRc2Ud3aBHe5j">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHQeEnBZiFo&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;list=PLt3d0sqKNUuvkpA8IGzLDRc2Ud3aBHe5j</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I will check it all out.   There is a lot of controlled opposition out there so I can&#39;t help but wonder when I notice when certain people won&#39;t go all the way with the truth.  Sure it&#39;s possible some don&#39;t know.   Check out Eric&#39;s shill wall of fame for info on how he and other members rationalize these kind of things.</p>

<p>BTW, massive mistake in my last post I must have been tired.  It&#39;s the other way around, the masonic psyop of NASA is to replace the One/Creator/God with &quot;science&quot;.</p>

<p>Where are the pictures of dismembered people and pools of blood?</p>

<p>Is it a case where the media is not willing to present those (for fear of being perceived as exploitative, or willing to be seen as respectful)?</p>

<p>All the videos and pictures I have seen are of people crouching in a foggy/dusty hall and no sigh of explosion or a big torn up wall with lots of debris and no corpse/bodies/hurt people.</p>

<p>But maybe better evidence is there and I have not seen it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate all the hard work you put into this post and I think it&#39;s important that we analyze these events in forums such as this.   </p>

<p>However, some of your arguments are based off the incompetent work done by others. Things like &quot;she works for&quot; and she &quot;worked for&quot; comes down to semantics.  News outlets these days are so desperate to be ahead of the curve, competing to have the story first that they rush these things out without ever checking anything. Hence you get shit grammar and bad information because any delay in reporting will be seen as indifference to the story. We saw it after Boston when random peoples pics were being posted saying they were involved. We saw it this morning when they said they had captured the guy in Belgium when they hadn&#39;t. This lack of vetting their information will always exist while news outlets compete with social media for breaking news.<br/>
The other example in your story is your claim on the caption of a Daily Mail photo showing a man walking towards the wall which you assumed he was going to use to prop up a victim but the caption said he was being carried out to safety. I can&#39;t imagine how low on the totem pole at the Daily Mail the guy who makes the captions for pictures is, but I&#39;d assume he has absolutely nothing to do with the reporting of the story and is basically told to come up with captions that represent the picture. He&#39;s probably sitting in an office thousands of miles away and see&#39;s this picture and puts the most obvious assumption up there, that basically this guy is  being carried out for safety .<br/>
You should also take into consideration that the photojournalist was just next to a massive explosion (taking the story as fact for this) and her recounting of the events is bound to be all over the place. Have you ever gotten in a fight and then tried to look back on it. Just a big blur of emotions and adrenaline, it&#39;s hard to keep your composure during stressful events and I can only imagine being next to two bombs going off is going to multiply this effect.   </p>

<p>I agree with the idea of scrutinizing the evidence as it becomes available and looking for inconsistencies but the evidence in question here is shaky at best and using this as a evidence of something sinister only blurs the lines of truth in the days to come. Not everything is a conspiracy. There are bad people who do bad things and this may be one of those times. </p>

<p>To reiterate my initial point, you did a good job gathering your sources and documenting them and I appreciated the read. </p>

<p>That actually only supports my arguments about this woman&#39;s amazing ability to upload those pics and post a status update so quickly. Which, again, is one of my weakest arguments and I admit it in my post.  </p>

<p>How do you explain the lack of damage from shrapnel from these two (or is it only one?) powerful nail bombs that were strong enough to dismember people and lift them into the air, cause the ceiling tiles to collapse and some windows to blow out, yet none of the signs, walls, monitors, self-check-in kiosks -- nothing else seems damaged in the slightest. It&#39;s all in pristine condition. Not to mention the lack of gore as described by all the eyewitness reports. Quite miraculous I&#39;d say. </p>

<p>How do you plausibly explain the couple running away with a baby doll, apparently leaving their own child behind in the stroller that she had the presence of mind to set upright?</p>

<p>How do you plausibly explain the stewardess supposedly working a flight to Mumbai that doesn&#39;t exist, and a news outlet reporting on the hardship that all the passengers on that non-existent flight had to endure?</p>

<p>To reiterate my point, your attempt at debunking was <em>weak</em> in the extreme, but I appreciated it and enjoyed the read. Thanks for playing. </p>

<p>What evidence? 
Your argument is conjecture, based on the shitty reporting done by others.   </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You do know what the word pristine means right? Because if <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/rG8NP">this</a> looks like nothing is damaged in the slightest to you then you must be one filthy slob of a human being.<br/>
Does the picture of the damage accuratley match the description some lady gave, no it doesn&#39;t but if that&#39;s what you expect a pristine airport to look like you have insanely low standards.   </p>

<p>The &quot;doll&quot; looks like a baby to me, you can actually see it&#39;s arm moving. I don&#39;t see any real child being left behind in the stroller, just her moving the thing out of the way to get out of there.   </p>

<p>As I said before there is a lot of shit reporting coming out immediately after this event so as for the what flight that lady was going to be on I&#39;d probably put that in the &quot;shit reporting&quot; category.  </p>

<p>Let me just leave you with this. </p>

<p>I gave you props for the research, I tried to engage you in a conversation and the best you can come up with is to call me a debunker and claim that it was &quot;weak in the extreme&quot;. </p>

<p>You may think that you are on to something, but what you&#39;re doing is trying to get ahead of the rest of the conspiracy theories that will arise from this situation. This sub is supposed to be a place that we can come and have this conversation in a rational way while being objective. You don&#39;t have an open mind for any opinion that isn&#39;t your own and that doesn&#39;t leave room for growth on any level. Just because I took a few of your points and gave my opinion doesn&#39;t mean I think you&#39;re wrong about everything, it was supposed to make you think but clearly that&#39;s a problem for you.

<p>That was from your previous comment. It wasn&#39;t reporting. It was from her Facebook profile. And I agree it could just be a mistake. </p>

<p>As for pristine, you once again cherry picked from my comments. I said <em>besides</em> the ceiling tiles and blown out windows. The picture you chose is a perfect example. Look at the walls in the background, the posters, the self-check-in kiosks, the signs with numbers indicating the aisle numbers, the sign in the foreground with &#39;departures&#39; written on it. Nothing has any sign of damage from shrapnel, or really anything else. It&#39;s undamaged. All the other pictures, except for one, show the same thing. </p>

<p>I agree that some of it is just due to shitty reporting. But when so many people are saying the same thing and it contrasts so widely with the photographic evidence we have, then I think that&#39;s telling. As for the baby doll, well, I think you need your eyes checked. </p>

You say you don&#39;t think I&#39;m wrong about everything, but you haven&#39;t said what you think I might be right about. As far as I can tell, you chalk it all up to problems with &#39;early reporting.&#39; But the reporting hasn&#39;t changed on the key events of what happened there, and the photographic evidence still contradicts the reporting. I am open to revising my opinion if more evidence emerges, but I doubt it will. You even disagree that anything is fishy about the video of the man obviously carrying away a baby doll. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t agree with me at all, and that&#39;s fine. But it won&#39;t do to affect a pose of being the voice of cautious reason, because there is nothing reasonable about your position. You have offered nothing to explain all the huge discrepancies. You want us to accept the official story and ignore the evidence that anyone with half a brain and a pulse can see with their own eyes. That&#39;s not reasonable. Sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me the biggest thing is actually the lack of evidence. The &#39;eyewitness&#39; accounts say one thing, and they&#39;re very very clear about it, while the photographic evidence is very much at odds with that. Also the stewardess who is supposed to work a flight that doesn&#39;t exist. And the photojournalist standing 5 feet away from the bomb without a scratch. I mean, do they really expect us to believe this crap? (Sadly, the answer is yes and most people do.)</p>

<p>edit: just look at the pictures of the airport. Besides the ceiling tiles and glass blown out, there is no sign of damage from shrapnel or shock waves anywhere. Signs, walls, monitors, self-check-in kiosks, everything looks to be in pristine condition. And the couple running away with a doll! WTF? She took the trouble to set the baby carriage upright, but forgot the real baby!</p>

<p>Eye witness accounts are EXPECTED to conflict with each other, especially in traumatic situations.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I&#39;m responding to this.  I just googled to try and get some info on this situation and somehow this post came up.</p>

<p>But anyways...  You&#39;re jumping to a TONNNN of conclusions all based on inconsistencies in eye witness reports.  HOLY SHIT!  Do you not realize that inconsistencies in eye witness reports ALWAYS happen?  That they&#39;re so common it&#39;s assumed there will be inconsistencies?</p>

<p>People claim they heard shots because they were panicking and don&#39;t know what gunshots actually sound like.</p>

<p>A photojournalist being able to upload pictures within 10 minutes seems odd to you?  That&#39;s LITERALLY her job.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just so strange that you start with the assumption that eye witnesses are accurate and not shaken at all by the bombs they just experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem is not with eye witness accounts conflicting with each other. My problem is with eye witness accounts being in total agreement with each other about the strength of the explosions and the level of carnage, which is completely at odds with virtually all the <em>photographic</em> evidence we have seen. Photographic evidence is not the same as eyewitness accounts. Are you going to try to tell me that all these people are going to claim seeing dismembered bodies laying everywhere because they were confused? Fog of war? </p>

<p>How do you explain the lack of damage from shrapnel from these two powerful nail bombs that were reportedly strong enough to dismember people and lift them into the air, cause the ceiling tiles to collapse and some windows to blow out, yet virtually none of the signs, walls, monitors, self-check-in kiosks have so much as a scratch on them or even soot. It&#39;s all in pristine condition. Quite miraculous I&#39;d say. That has nothing to do with conflicting eyewitness testimony. </p>

<p>How do you plausibly explain the couple running away with a baby doll, apparently leaving their own child behind in the stroller that she had the presence of mind to set upright? That has nothing to do with conflicting eyewitness testimony.</p>

<p>How do you plausibly explain the stewardess supposedly working a flight to Mumbai that doesn&#39;t exist, and a news outlet reporting on the hardship that all the passengers on that non-existent flight had to endure? That has nothing to do with conflicting eyewitness testimony.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh please. It&#39;s honestly not worth going on line and taking 5 minutes to show how wrong you are about posting of mutilated corpses in the first world, but to take a recent example -- what about the pictures of all the &quot;mutilated&quot; (allegedly) dead bodies they posted from the Bataclan? And you&#39;re saying she had the presence of mind to consider possible litigation in the ten minutes after surviving a huge explosion and witnessing this horrific blood bath? This woman has really got to have nerves of steel and a heart of ice. And why would posting pictures of mutilated bodies be more likely to garner litigation than the pictures she did post who were (allegedly) wounded and bloodied, laying on the ground, with clear pictures of their faces? She didn&#39;t post mutilated, unrecognizable bodies out of respect but didn&#39;t care to respect the privacy of the people who were merely injured? </p>

<p>Yes, I agree the journalist could be lying. In fact that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying. And if she could be lying about being 5 feet away from the blast (without any news outlet stopping to question such an absurd claim), then she could be lying about any and all of it (without any news outlet stopping to question all the absurd claims). At least we&#39;re in agreement that she&#39;s willing to lie to advance her career.   </p>

<p>Also, the article you linked doesn&#39;t say anything about the stewardess working a flight to Delhi. It says &quot;She was due to leave Brussels for Mumbai, where she is based, when the attacks hit.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe the only times you have flown your Mommy and Daddie_O took care of buying the tickets, but often when you fly somewhere, <em>especially</em> on international flights, you can&#39;t get a direct flight to your destination, but actually have to change planes at an airport.</p>

<p>I never said she was working a flight to Delhi. I said she was working a flight to Mumbai. And the flight schedules clearly mark whenever a flight has any stopovers.

<p>Are you? Is anyone? Are there any? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying everyone should get the same damage, though I do expect someone standing 5 feet away from a powerful nail bomb to have been injured. I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s so hard for you to swallow? </p>

<p>There is clear lack of evidence with respect to the claims made repeatedly by different witnesses regarding dimembered bodies, pools of blood, etc. etc. There is also virtually no sign that these nail bombs did any physical damage to the airport except with regard to the ceiling tiles and windows. The signs, walls, monitors, self-check-in-kiosks etc. etc. are almost spotless. And whether I have experience is besides the point. I have a brain. Which is more than I can say for you. </p>

<p>Yes, many, many times. Probably more than you. I&#39;ve never had a flight crew follow me to a plane change. When I change planes to a new destination, the new plane has a <em>different</em> flight crew. The original flight crew stays with the original plane. If they switch planes, it usually takes awhile, if they even do. On a long flight, say from Europe to India, they will deboard after the passengers and go to their hotel or home to sleep. </p>

<p>On a stopover, where the plane stops at an airport, drops some passengers off and takes on new passengers, the flight crew usually remains the same. But in those cases the flight tells you the final destination, and if you look at the flight schedule I linked to, it also lists stopovers. There were no flights from Brussels that day that were scheduled to land or stop in Mumbai. </p>

<p>Why is this so hard for you to understand? Are you being deliberately dense? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, exactly. And that&#39;s great evidence. And so far, there is a HUGE disconnect between eyewitness accounts and photographic evidence that can&#39;t just be explained away by asserting (with no proof at all) that hundreds of Belgian police are working on this investigation. </p>

<p>The article said &quot;She was due to leave Brussels for Mumbai, where she is based, when the attacks hit.&quot; You misrepresented that when you changed it to &quot;flight attendant with the yellow jacket was due to board a flight to Mumbai&quot;.

<p>If I were to apply <em>your</em> standards to <em>your statements</em> then I would assume that your contradictions were evidence that you are deliberately lying and part of some conspiracy. But I don&#39;t actually believe that. I think that you just misread what was said in the article and now, instead of just admitting you were wrong on one small point, you just decide to bring up absurd arguments.</p>

<p>Are you being serious? There are 9,000 federal police officers in Belgium. Do you think that less than 2% of them are assigned to this?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see what disconnect you&#39;re talking about. I see that the photographs don&#39;t match your intuition about what you think you should see, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Well if we can&#39;t see them in the pictures, then the eyewitnesses couldn&#39;t have seen them either. But we are able to see the pictures taken by the photojournalist, and they do not square with her testimony at all. She should release all her pics if she&#39;s holding back. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t know for certain. It was twice stated, including by her, that she reached for her camera, not her phone. I suppose it&#39;s possible. But given that she&#39;s a photojournalist, she would want to take the highest quality pics with the best equipment she had in order to capture this event. It&#39;s her profession, remember. Also, if you&#39;ve ever been around professional photographers or even amateur enthusiasts, they can&#39;t stand to take pictures on a camera phone. My brother-in-law <em>needs</em> a view finder to take pictures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand these conspiracy theories of the psyops tragedies.  You&#39;re looking at scenes less than 24 hours old and expecting people to behave in a calm, consistent way.  Also, you expect the evidence you&#39;re shown on CNN to be as real and perfect as the evidence collected by the police and counterterrorism units.  NOBODY knows the truth yet, and you&#39;re already yammering about this not being real.  </p>

<p>Things like &quot;she works for&quot; and she &quot;worked for&quot; comes down to semantics. News outlets these days are so desperate to be ahead of the curve, competing to have the story first that they rush these things out without ever checking anything. Hence you get shit grammar and bad information because any delay in reporting will be seen as indifference to the story.</p>

<p>That was from your previous comment. It wasn&#39;t reporting. It was from her Facebook profile. And I agree it could just be a mistake. </p>

<p>As for pristine, you once again cherry picked from my comments. I said <em>besides</em> the ceiling tiles and blown out windows. The picture you chose is a perfect example. Look at the walls in the background, the posters, the self-check-in kiosks, the signs with numbers indicating the aisle numbers, the sign in the foreground with &#39;departures&#39; written on it. Nothing has any sign of damage from shrapnel, or really anything else. It&#39;s undamaged. All the other pictures, except for one, show the same thing. </p>

<p>I agree that some of it is just due to shitty reporting. But when so many people are saying the same thing and it contrasts so widely with the photographic evidence we have, then I think that&#39;s telling. As for the baby doll, well, I think you need your eyes checked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for the record my attitude towards you has nothing to do with my fragile ego. I have no problem admitting when I&#39;m wrong. Hell my wife makes me admit I&#39;m wrong twice a day. </p>

<p>My problem is with your transparent phoniness. You claim to be the voice of reason and to be &#39;engaging me in conversation&#39; but it&#39;s just a pose. You say you don&#39;t think I&#39;m wrong about everything, but you haven&#39;t said what you think I might be right about. As far as I can tell, you chalk it all up to problems with &#39;early reporting.&#39; But the reporting hasn&#39;t changed on the key events of what happened there, and the photographic evidence still contradicts the reporting. I am open to revising my opinion if more evidence emerges, but I doubt it will. You even disagree that anything is fishy about the video of the man obviously carrying away a baby doll. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t agree with me at all, and that&#39;s fine. But it won&#39;t do to affect a pose of being the voice of cautious reason, because there is nothing reasonable about your position. You have offered nothing to explain all the huge discrepancies. You want us to accept the official story and ignore the evidence that anyone with half a brain and a pulse can see with their own eyes. That&#39;s not reasonable. Sorry. </p>
