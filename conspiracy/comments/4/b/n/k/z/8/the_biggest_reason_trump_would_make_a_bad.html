        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>DSM-5 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder include these features:</p>

<pre><code>Having an exaggerated sense of self-importance
Expecting to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it
Exaggerating your achievements and talents
Being preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate
Believing that you are superior and can only be understood by or associate with equally special people
Requiring constant admiration
Having a sense of entitlement
Expecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectations
Taking advantage of others to get what you want
Having an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others
Being envious of others and believing others envy you
Behaving in an arrogant or haughty manner
</code></pre>

<p>Although some features of narcissistic personality disorder may seem like having confidence, it&#39;s not the same. Narcissistic personality disorder crosses the border of healthy confidence into thinking so highly of yourself that you put yourself on a pedestal and value yourself more than you value others.</p>

<p>The biggest problem will be: &quot;Expecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectations&quot;.  A President will not have unquestioning compliance because he still has to work with the Congress and Judiciary, as well as his job requirement being to represent ALL Americans, and not just himself, and a President should NOT expect special favors.  Pete&#39;s sake - look at what happened when a President just wanted a little extra-marital hank-panky.  America lost 1998.  How much time are we going to waste while Trump tries to amend the First Amendment, or whatever else he comes up with?  Too much is happening.  We can&#39;t waste time on personality disorder shenanigans in a President right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still a fan of Obama, but the rest of them, I happen to agree.  When he took over, the world was in a tail spin.  Economies collapsing, terrorism rising, income inequality bursting.  So, Obama, while being hampered by Congress AT EVERY TURN regardless of the reason, has stopped our meltdown.  There has not been a successful terrorist attack in the USA under his watch, so I didn&#39;t die, I got healthcare, so I got my hysterectomy and the drugs I need, my water is still drinkable, and my air is still breathable.  He&#39;s a GOOD president, and I am better off than I was under the Republicans and Cheney and baby Bush.<br/>
I&#39;m not giving anyone a pass.  I&#39;m saying Trump might not be the best choice because he will use the presidency to further his own goals, not take care of the country.</p>

<p>i agree that Trump appears to have more than a few, just by how he talks &amp; acts. i always feel like he often acts like a spoiled brat; it&#39;s his way or the highway &amp; how angry he gets if someone questions him or disagrees with him (that in itself is kinda scary). </p>

<p>Trump Clearly demonstrates the awareness of his business self and political self. He has stated that he got along with everyone, including Hillary because it benefited him financially. Now that its politically motivated, he is no longer going to play nice. What you are describing as Narcissistic personality is actually an astute understanding of how to navigate social situations. </p>

<p>He&#39;s uneducated about the office, the job, and world affairs. He&#39;s nowhere near as intelligent as he&#39;d like you to think or, importantly, as <strong>he</strong> thinks. He&#39;s at best a reality show star leveraging that in the nation&#39;s recurring 4-year popularity contest.</p>

<p>Me, I want someone in the office of the President who is smarter than I am. There are probably two candidates in the race who are that. Trump, for all his wealth and bluster, isn&#39;t one of them.</p>

<p>But more importantly than that, I want a President who understands his or her own strengths and weaknesses and gathers a team of smart people who he or she trusts that can shore up those weaknesses. Trump doesn&#39;t seem to believe he has any weaknesses. That&#39;s fucking frightening, and I&#39;m typically not afraid of anything.</p>

<p>The absolute best case if Trump does wind up winning is that the conspiracy theories about the President being an impotent figurehead, the &quot;elite&quot; actually calling the shots, are true, so that our worst case scenario is another 4 years of slow steady decline toward fascism - &quot;boiling the frog&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch the news. I don&#39;t read the papers. I have watched the debates, which show the candidates unfiltered. I will occasionally watch candidates speak on video, but I only take to heart obviously unedited video which, again, shows me the candidates unfiltered.</p>

<p>Finally, I can read the candidates&#39; own web sites, some of which offer fairly specific solutions to problems... but Trump&#39;s, not so much.</p>

<p>My problem with him is that in the end he will still fall in behind Israel and he will waste literally trillions of the global warming fraud, and if he is elected, the entire machinery of govt will fight him tooth and nail on everything. Unless the senate and congress follows suit and elects a majority of like minded individuals, he will be entirely ineffective. But Trump will face a similar problem should he win the WH.</p>

Remember this?:  &quot;In 2011, Republicans in Congress used the debt ceiling as leverage for deficit reduction because of the lack of Congressional normal order for fiscal year budget votes on the chamber floors and subsequent conference reconciliations between the House and the Senate for final budgets. The credit downgrade and debt ceiling debacle contributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 2,000 points in late July and August. Following the downgrade itself, the DJIA had one of its worst days in history and fell 635 points on August 8.[15] The GAO estimated that the delay in raising the debt ceiling raised borrowing costs for the government by $1.3 billion in 2011 and noted that the delay would also raise costs in later years. The Bipartisan Policy Center extended the GAO&#39;s estimates and found that the delay raised borrowing costs by $18.9 billion over ten years&quot;  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_United_States_debt_ceiling#2013_debt_ceiling_crisis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_United_States_debt_ceiling#2013_debt_ceiling_crisis</a>)  Despite the Republicans wanting to crash our credit rating, Obama managed to keep us from turning into another Greece.  #3 check.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay one problem he created. Hmm... let me think.....</p>

<p>Iraq. Libya. Benghazi. Syria. Afghanistan, both the war and the current heroin epidemic.</p>

<p>His energy policies in the first couple of years of his first term  caused gasoline prices to go from around a buck a gallon to nearly 5 bucks a gallon. That immediately caused huge inflation and badly hurt businesses, in turn causing massive numbers of layoffs, which then caused huge numbers of mortgage and loan defaults which led to the financial industry collapse and massive multi-trillion dollar bailouts of both the auto and the banking industries. The little guy had to eat the pain and bail out the big huge massive guys. And the banks today are still doing exactly what they did before the bailout. Nothing has changed for them. Except they are much richer for it all.</p>

<p>He created a health care system based on the health care insurance industries vision of what a health care system ought to be. Health care providers and health care users and taxpayers got screwed. No one is happy with the health care system in the US. Except maybe you apparently, as you claim.</p>

<p>He has badly politicized the EPA, NASA and NOAA. When the Republicans gut the EPA, you can blame Obama. </p>

<p>He is trying to throw away half a billion dollars, giving it to the United Nations, on the absurd and ridiculous premise that third world United Nations politicians can somehow control the worlds climate and limit the globes average temperature. LOL.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, US citizens standards of living have plummeted to almost third world levels.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m done wasting my time with delusional nutbags like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Middle east - that&#39;s been burnin since the world&#39;s been turnin.  Current heroin crisis, you might be right.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I remember clearly the financial collapse happening during the campaign season, because McCain looked like such an ass.  The financial collapse happened SQUARELY under Bush.  True, it was under Clinton that they repealed the bucket law.  But Bush did the bailout.  &#39;&quot;By coming together on this legislation, we have acted boldly to prevent the crisis on Wall Street from becoming a crisis in communities across our country,&quot; Bush said less than an hour after the House voted 263 to 171 to pass the bill.  The House vote followed a strong lobbying push by the White House and other supporters of the bill.&quot;  (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/03/news/economy/house_friday_bailout/">http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/03/news/economy/house_friday_bailout/</a>)  BTW, Sanders voted against, Clinton for, and Clinton collected THE MOST lobby money for it, followed by Coleman (R), Dodd (D), Lieberman (who tf knows), McConnell (R), and Schumer (D).  You got to hand it to her - Clinton does not sell out cheap.  (<a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/110-hr-1424/352600/contributions-by-vote">http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/110-hr-1424/352600/contributions-by-vote</a>)  I agree that reform is in trouble.  Organizations are still working to comply with Dodd-Frank, and Congress is still trying to futz with it, for example, take the Volker thing.  But, under Obama, Warren got consumer protection, which is a good step even if people are trying to defund her.</p>

<p>I agree with you about the role of insurance in Obamacare.  I&#39;m pretty sure the industry would have pulled a Kennedy-style solution to a one-payer system.  Still, he did something, and I did get a surgery I needed.</p>

<p>Oh yeah - OBAMA has politicized these things.  Puhleeze.  &quot; “It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone – Commerce, Education and the um, what’s the third one there? Let’s see. Oh five – Commerce, Education and the um, um,” Perry said.  Mitt Romney, standing two podiums to Perry’s right, offered the Environmental Protection Agency as a suggestion. “EPA, there you go,” Perry said.&quot; (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/rick-perrys-debate-lapse-oops-cant-remember-department-of-energy/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/rick-perrys-debate-lapse-oops-cant-remember-department-of-energy/</a>)<br/>
You think Obama is MAKING the Republicans do what they do?  Aww - the poor helpless Republicans.</p>

<p>I figure, as the Third world improves, and becomes the location of manufacturing at least, they will have a greater part in increasing global warming.  They can&#39;t control the world&#39;s climate, but it is nice to be proactive for once instead of waiting for the problem to be in full progress before we do something about it.  </p>

<p>Our standards of living are third world?  Oh yeah - I live in a hut without plumbing or electricity, and any moment now a religious fanatic is going to break in and rape me before cutting off my hands with a machete.  You&#39;re giving in to fear rather than reality.   Unemployment is down, and consumer confidence is back to about 2008 levels (look at the 10 year chart  <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence</a>).</p>
