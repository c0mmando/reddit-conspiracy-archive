    <div class="md"><p>No offense I thought that was fairly plainly worded, but essentially franklin realized the key to sovereignty was printing our own money, just like with world banks today, the bank of(of meaning without) england wouldnt have it. They wanted the colonies in perpetual debt slavery. Do you really think american colonists risked their lives over a marginal increase on tea prices over some ambiguous moral point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is Ben Franklin on the topic: When he arrived, he was surprised to find rampant unemployment and poverty among the British working classes… Franklin was then asked how the American colonies managed to collect enough money to support their poor houses. He reportedly replied:</p>

<p>“We have no poor houses in the Colonies; and if we had some, there would be nobody to put in them, since there is, in the Colonies, not a single unemployed person, neither beggars nor tramps.”</p>

<p>In 1764, the Bank of England used its influence on Parliament to get a Currency Act passed that made it illegal for any of the colonies to print their own money. The colonists were forced to pay all future taxes to Britain in silver or gold. Anyone lacking in those precious metals had to borrow them at interest from the banks.</p>

<p>Only a year later, Franklin said, the streets of the colonies were filled with unemployed beggars, just as they were in England. The money supply had suddenly been reduced by half, leaving insufficient funds to pay for the goods and services these workers could have provided. He maintained that it was “the poverty caused by the bad influence of the English bankers on the Parliament which has caused in the colonies hatred of the English and . . . the Revolutionary War.” This, he said, was the real reason for the Revolution: “the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been that England took away from the colonies their money, which created unemployment and dissatisfaction.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes a lot happened in the decade prior to the war, but this was an inciting incident.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have used the word &quot;the&quot; in the post but rather &quot;an (inciting incident)&quot;  I meant to say &#39;fuel to the fire&#39; which it most certainly <em>was</em>, despite how others attempt to downplay this.

    <div class="md"><p>I do understand but the taxation thing is way overblown, the colonies were taxed at a fraction of what british nationals paid and the stamp act was repealed in 1766...10 years before the war started because the colonies bitched and it wasnt lucrative enough for england to care. The revolution was about the same thing all wars since have been about, paper money.</p>

<p>To be clear, in no way am I atracking your post, what you say is true, I just want people to know what our war of independance was really about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deeply in debt from its war with France, the British government attempts to have the Thirteen Colonies cover part of the cost of their own defence. A series of acts imposes taxes on colonists but, in fact, they are considerably lower than the taxes levied on the people of Britain.</p>

<p>Due to opposition to the various taxes, they are repealed. In 1766, the Stamp Act was repealed. In 1779 the British government repealed the Townshend Acts and all duties on imports into the Thirteen Colonies with the exception of tea. In 1773, the British Parliament eliminated all British taxes on tea being imported into the Thirteen Colonies with the exception of a small levy in the Colonies themselves. Other than this, by 1773 there was no taxation of the Thirteen Colonies at all by Britain, making the revolutionary propaganda slogan “no taxation without representation” something of a mystery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More quotes from Franklin: The refusal of King George III to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of money manipulators was probably the prime cause of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton(sec of treasury)Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first treasury secretary, said that paper moneyhad composed three-fourths of the total money supply before the American Revolution. When the colonists could not issue their own currency, the money supply had suddenly shrunk, leaving widespread unemployment, hunger and poverty in its wake. Unlike the Great Depression of the 1930s, people in the 1770s were keenly aware of who was responsible for their distress.</p>

<p>[T]he creation and circulation of bills of credit by revolutionary assemblies…coming as they did upon the heels of the strenuous efforts made by the Crown to suppress paper money in America [were] acts of defiance so contemptuous and insulting to the Crown that forgiveness was thereafter impossible . . . [T]here was but one course for the crown to pursue and that was to suppress and punish these acts of rebellion…Thus the Bills of Credit of this era, which ignorance and prejudice have attempted to belittle into the mere instruments of a reckless financial policy were really the standards of the Revolution. they were more than this: they were the Revolution itself!</p>

<p>British Historian John Twells: The British Parliament took away from America its representative money, forbade any further issue of bills of credit, these bills ceasing to be legal tender, and ordered that all taxes should be paid in coins … Ruin took place in these once flourishing Colonies . . . discontent became desperation, and reached a point . . . when human nature rises up and asserts itself.</p>
