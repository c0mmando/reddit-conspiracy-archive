<p>Last week the brazilian Federal Police had access to an huge batch of documents from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odebrecht">Odebrecht</a>, one of the biggest construction company in the country with had and specific departament just to pay bribes to politicians.</p>

<p>The documents found at Odebrecht is been called an Political Atomic Bomb in Brazil because it proves that even the politicians and parties who are opposition to the actual ruling party also received brides from the company and because of that all the information regarding this investigation have been hided from the public by the Judge. </p>

<p>Anonymous have been able to copy all the information online before the documents have been taken down by the judge (about 500 mb) and despise many newspapers having access to those documents they only release the information targeted to shutdown the government. </p>

<p>In r/Brasil some users have been trying to post the links for the whole documents and are being banned by the mods so please, help spread this information around. </p>

<p>All the documents are avaliable at:</p>

<p>What is happening in Brazil is the result of declining economic situation and basically the current commodity rout.</p>

<p>Unemployment and inflation rising, government budget declining. Obviously social tension rises, and with a divided population (poor supporting the government, while middle/high classes opposing) there is a lot of pressure.</p>

<p>Argentina just succumbed and installed a pro-globalist government, after a decade of failed and corrupt pro-nationalist government (incompetence which led to Argentina to completely miss the commodity supercycle). Next up is Venezuela (another example of populist government under pressure from declining commodities).</p>

<p>I agree about the long game and even that some &quot;foreign elements&quot; might&#39;ve involved in the recent disarray, but truly to be blamed is the current government. SHTF only because of the economic downturn, if not they could&#39;ve continued.</p>

<p>And those are the ones trying to depose the current government accusing them of being corrupts, and most the the big media companies (about 5 families who owns nearly 90% of all TVs, Radios and Newspapers in the country) keep helping them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Context:
Argentina had debt problems. Because of the debt problems the countries bonds value plummeted and the cost of more loans sky rocketed. This left the government with two options, default on the bonds or force/ negotiate with lenders(bond holders) for a debt write down (get them to agree to accept a percentage of the total owed). It is basically standard procedure these days when things get bad enough like Greece. BUT when the value of the bonds fell an American firm bought up a large chunk of debt at pennies on the dollar. They then refused to take a write down and took Argentina to court in the US because that is where the bonds were issued. A judge ruled that Even if the majority of bond holders agreed to the write down, you still couldn&#39;t force the deal on the rest and you can&#39;t payout the people who have agreed to take a haircut, unless you pay everyone. But in this case not everyone wants to take the lower value and Argentina refuses to pay the hold outs full value. So no one could get paid. This meant Argentina was basically denied access to global credit because they had these outstanding debts and no one would accept new promises (loan to them again) with this whole mess still looming. This meant for years nothing happened. It is pretty much universally agreed that the American hold outs are acting in bad faith, even in the financial world. Ever since this happened basically all new government bonds around the world are created with a clause saying that you can&#39;t do what was pulled here. </p>

<p>Just recently a new government was elected with the explicit platform of fuck it pay them out. And they did. Even though most economists agree they should not have had to and that the judge was wrong in his ruling. This will allow them back in the global market again. ie Pro-Globalist Government. I&#39;m guessing they are also free traders.</p>

<p>I should also note that this whole thing cause a rescission in the country and YEARS of unnecessary suffering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great analysis. I&#39;m Argentinean, and I can add to this that this new government is reducing public spending by cutting subsidies, firing government employees, etc. They also cut taxes to the agrarian sector, which is one of the wealthiest industries in this country. They&#39;ve also cut taxes to the mining industry.  It is too soon to say wheter this will cause a huge impact in the economy due to paying them out.</p>

<p>But for this to happen, there was a continuous media campaign led by Clarín, that is similar to Fox News in USA. It is a huge corporation that installed the idea that we had to pay them, and every news they gave was grim, and negative. According to them we were always doing worse and worse, with crime on the roof, corruption, recession. And the worst of all, they put people against each other. Just for profit. Nowadays, with the new government, everything is going better, and the amount of negative news is going down. They made articles advising people to use fans instead of A/C, that renting really small apartments was a nice option, that it is better to share rides with other people to travel, just to give some examples. They are giving tips to enjoy poverty. It is surreal, and I can safely bet that the same is happening now in Brasil. </p>

<p>If this is not conspiracy material I don&#39;t know what it is. Watch out because they are likely to do the same later in the States, if they aren&#39;t doing that already.
Sorry for the long rant.</p>

<p>firing government employees</p>

<p>I may be misremembering but didn&#39;t the previous government hire an unusually large amount of new employees during the last year? Not saying that what they are doing right now is right necessarily, but making a ton of new hires in an already fragile economy when you&#39;re on your way out seems pretty sketchy to me.</p>

<p>My understanding may be incorrect but I thought they didn&#39;t really have much choice since the US Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina’s appeal, their reserves are basically non existent, government expending was pretty high and they had a huge inflation problem?</p>

<p>Yes, it ticks all the boxes of another colour revolution. The actual government of Brazil expressed many times their opposition to many political interests of the US government (for example, Brazil recently won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil%E2%80%93United_States_cotton_dispute">huge WTO litigation against the USA</a> and the actual president of Brazil was the first government to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/brazil-president-un-speech-nsa-surveillance">protest in the UN about the illegal wiretapping from NSA</a>).</p>

<p>The opposition parties in Brazil are a lot more &quot;US friendly&quot; than the current left government of Brazil.</p>

<p>In November 2015, two branches of George Soros&#39; charity network, the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation, were banned under the law in Russia. The infractions were not listed, but the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation released a statement stating that &quot;the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state&quot;. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_undesirable_organizations_law#Targeted_NGOs">link</a></strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s not that interesting, if you think about it for a moment. Shadowbans are site-wide bans performed by the Reddit admins. The shadowbanned people here may or may not have been banned for legitimate reasons, probably not, but there&#39;s nothing surprising about them not showing up in this sub which is still a part of reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a sub gets above a certain number of users, mods should be elected regularly in a time period. What happens today is that companies, parties and individuals are storming moderation of subs to control content on those subs. It might even involve financial reasons, people selling mod positions. A while ago someone posted a chart where it shown that most subs were being moderated by the few groups, this can&#39;t be a coincidence or just people with free time, there&#39;s gotta be a financial reason behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey mod from <a href="/r/brasil">/r/brasil</a> here. Just to clarify moderation has been really hard the past couple of weeks because of all the political turmoil. All in all being accused of being too supportive of the right and left sometimes within the same hour shows us that we have been able to keep a nice balance.</p>

<p>In the case of the Oderbretch files, we allowed various news articles about the leak, they even made the subs frontpage. However we are concerned about doxxing since the documents contain personal information and generally speaking we don&#39;t allow that kind of info to be posted. Plus since the documents are classified posting them is illegal and we have a blanket policy of not allowing content that is illegal under Brazilian law in the sub.</p>

<p>We are always open to suggestions, and we consider and sometimes do revert decisions after having a discussion between ourselves. This is often the result of a user getting in contact and giving us a different perspective on a subject,  so naturally if the user who made this post is concerned the best thing to do is to get in touch. Thanks guys and I hope this post is ok.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> thank you to everyone who commented and would like to add that I&#39;m a she.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its up to the brazilians themselves to not do it on other subs. But in a brazilian sub were the majority of the people are brazilian and the mods are probably brazilian, it makes more than enough sense. Stop imagining that the US is the worst place on earth.

The mods could easily end up in jail if they pick up the position you want, depending on the country (and there is certainly a shitload of corruption and shady shit going on in brazil).</p>

As it stands the files are classified and their distribution is illegal. Personally I think it&#39;s great that there are people that are distributing them, but like I said previously the subreddit has a blanket policy of not allowing content which is illegal under Brazilian law so posts that <em>distribute</em> the files will be removed (You are however free to post content that discuses the leak itself).</p>

<p>We are not sabotaging anything, we have taken the decision that the sub is not a platform for this type of content. If we wanted to sabotage anything that would involve actively trying to attack people who are distributing or making these files available in the first place i.e. anonymous and we are not going to that.</p>

Great, just as expected from a very &quot;concerned&quot; mod who never worried about the account time for other inflammatory comments when it suits them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because many of the politicians who are trying to rise to power after the deposition of the elected president (primarily PSDB and PMDB, two of the biggest parties in the country) and replace the current corrupt government with other corrupt politicians who are also linked to the same company, so spreading this kind of information during could hurt the interests of those corrupt politicians and help other politicians unwilling to promote the agenda those parties have (for example, like Marina Silva who are not linked to those corruption cases and have a huge chance of defeating PSDB, today the biggest opposition party in the country). </p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s spitting on Brazil.  Nobody thinks corruption reflects the worth of a country.

<p>I would say the the people who are trying to depose the current elected president of Brazil are the ones trying to kill the BRICS, they believe that Brazil had to have an automatic alignment pact with the US, just like what happen during the military dictatorship a few years ago. For example, the actual Brazil government is opposed to the TTIP, the people who are trying to depose the actual government in other hand is 110% in favor of TTIP.</p>
