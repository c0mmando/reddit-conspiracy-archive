    <div class="md"><p><em>If I were the president, I could stop terrorist attacks against the United States in a few days. Permanently. I would first apologize -- very publicly and very sincerely -- to all the widows and the orphans, the impoverished and the tortured, and all the many millions of other victims of American imperialism. I would then announce that America&#39;s global interventions -- including the awful bombings -- have come to an end. And I would inform Israel that it is no longer the 51st state of the union but – oddly enough – a foreign country. I would then reduce the military budget by at least 90% and use the savings to pay reparations to the victims and repair the damage from the many American bombings and invasions. There would be more than enough money. Do you know what one year of the US military budget is equal to? One year. It&#39;s equal to more than $20,000 per hour for every hour since Jesus Christ was born. That&#39;s what I&#39;d do on my first three days in the White House. On the fourth day, I&#39;d be assassinated.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Education.&#39; Not a student. I won&#39;t be more specific.</p>

<p>Well this route starts solving your own problems first. If you feel inclined to help someone else out too then great. If their needs are met, people are apt to help each other.</p>

<p>If you have your own food water, power, shelter, the world can go to hell in a lot of ways and you&#39;ll be better of with the knowledge, experience, and maybe even a little head start.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very much aware of global economics and politics. If you feel inclined towards focusing on the economy than so be it. We need a multi pronged approach. But know that focusing only on economics and negative interest rates has a lot of imaginary and highly sensitive superficial, and even completely artificial and corrupted aspects to it.</p>

<p>In no way am I saying we limit ourselves to this very short list. It&#39;s just a basic survival unit, especially in the case of severe economic depression. For some reason having these things in your life seems naive to you, I can accept that, we live in a very strange world.</p>

<p>Also not having a go at you. As far as I can tell you don&#39;t offer solutions only questions and complaints, but I don&#39;t really have a problem with that. It&#39;s healthy behavior. On this basis I could charge you of being superficial too though.</p>

<p>So, how are you going to solve the problems of negative interests rates?</p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming far too much about me, and about what I&#39;ve written.</p>

<p>In no way have I claimed to have all the answers. I&#39;ve simply explained a scalable method for solving a few basic issues.</p>

<p>I post mostly in here but I have posts all over reddit. People can think what they want, doesn&#39;t change the facts.</p>

<p>With all your experience what would you like to add? Surely you have some advice.</p>

<p>How do you get internet off the grid? Please. Satellite internet is still best in the most remote areas. If you plan ahead there&#39;s a good chance some cell provider has coverage. There are satellite phones with data connections now too.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re still after internet off the grid, in my opinion you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only out of sheer boredom I&#39;m continuing this. Also at this point we&#39;ll probably be the only ones to read this far.</p>

<p>I would really like to get back to civil discourse between the two of us. We might as well try to get something out of this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel comfortable answering some of your questions in a public setting because they provide more information about my self then I care to give out. As a practitioner of psychology surely you can understand this.</p>

<p>You asked what I did. I said education. You asked what I proposed. I gave you and an answer. You asked what I&#39;m doing. I told you. You asked me about privatization of water and banning of solar panels. I answered you.</p>

<p>You just didn&#39;t like any of my answers. Look back at our convo.</p>

<p>I asked you one direct question: &quot;So, how are you going to solve the problems of negative interests rates?&quot; You have yet to answer that one question. </p>

<p>Instead, since I asked you that question, you&#39;ve been resorting to all manner of disrespect, personal attacks, and baseless assumptions. Seemingly to attempt to avoid answering that one question. For what it&#39;s worth, according to the votes, the community seems to disagree with your actions.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know just say you don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know how I could do anything about interest rates. If you do know, I sincerely and eagerly await your response.</p>

<p>Just to put you at ease. I remember the world very well before the internet.</p>

<p>How about &quot;you first&quot;</p>

<p>You <em>did not answer</em> ONE of my questions and now you&#39;re asking Me!? wtf?</p>

<p>I asked you one direct question: &quot;So, how are you going to solve the problems of negative interests rates?&quot; You have yet to answer that one question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, you asked <em>nothing of the sort</em> -- you didn&#39;t even know what &#39;negative interest rates&#39; <em>are</em>, so how the fuck am I going to explain to you <em>anything</em> about something <em>you know nothing about</em> -- I may as well try teaching a preschooler organic chemistry</p>

<p>Next, and more importantly, in answer to this question;</p>

<p>&quot;A fool can ask more questions in a minute than a wise man can answer in a lifetime&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m self righteous?  I admittedly wrote that short sentence in such a way to express my opinions/feelings.</p>

<p>Why are you pointing out the obvious?  Have I pulled on your strings?  So easily?  (It&#39;s your insults that are what&#39;s &quot;putrid&quot; and a waste of all of our collective time.) </p>

<p>My point was it seems you are just trying to damage rather than build.  If you supposedly have such knowledge why not just transfer it in a humane way (you are not making a good case for your humanity, &quot;good sir&quot;)</p>

<p>I also get a sense that you really aren&#39;t 50 for some strange reason.  You simply don&#39;t speak like one.  Or maybe that&#39;s just me reading your mental age, and not your physical age.  Just my 24 year old intuition though.</p>

<p>But then again, harping on school (with me and the OP) and it&#39;s importance does make me believe your are an old school fellow; one who thinks the system&#39;s diplomas has some bearing on intellect, societal importance and that it removes ignorance (rather than injects it.)  That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t have a college engineering degree with grad school research in computational fluid dynamics, but it&#39;s not going to help me get to where I want to be.</p>

<p>Get off other people&#39;s lawn you prick.  That was my point.  Thanks for helping me remember the trite saying.</p>

<p>P.S: Physical age isn&#39;t <em>necessarily</em> wisdom or permission to treat others like you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guuh, had a huge post for you and lost it. 1st world problems.</p>

<p>Search growing plants in 5 gallon buckets. Corn beans and squash are a solid combo. Learn about that combo of plants lots of good material.</p>

<p>This is cheap and there is plenty of opportunity to retry if you fail because seeds are pretty cheap. So is dirt, can obviously be free too, but be careful, it&#39;s best to use organic soil. Buckets are nearly free if you just look around.</p>

<p>Get all the water you drink or cook with from those water specialty stores, organic markets have the water machines fairly commonly too. Store it in glass jugs. Make a solar distiller if you want to go hardcore. Google that it&#39;s real cool.</p>

<p>Get solar panels, plenty of cheap options. If you have the space and money get a small wind turbine. The more elaborate you get, the longer the learning curve.</p>
