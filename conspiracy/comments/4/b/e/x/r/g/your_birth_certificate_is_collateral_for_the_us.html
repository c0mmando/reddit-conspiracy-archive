<p>I was at a party last night and of course it had that one guy sharing conspiracy theories with everyone. One he had was how our birth certificates are actually collateral for debt, and there&#39;s an account with millions of dollars using their info from that and the social security number. </p>

<p>He had a folder full of government forms that he said he&#39;s using to get his &quot;straw man&quot; back, and that the names on our certificate are actually the names of corporations created on us. He&#39;s saying that we can take control of that and use it to pay off bills, debt, etc. It wasn&#39;t making any sense at all to me but I promised him I&#39;d do some research on it.</p>

<p>Now all I&#39;ve found googling this stuff are some blogs of people that seem a bit out there. I&#39;m not going to pretend I understand half of what the guy was rambling to me last night, but I guess all I&#39;m asking is to anyone with some knowledge in it, does he have any merit at all to what he saying or is it just sovereign state bologna?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a quote from that video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From every birth certificate a legal personality, or legal fiction, is created with the same name</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no source or legal document to back up this statement.</p>

<p>BTW I&#39;m not saying any of this is wrong. I&#39;ve seen enough evidence to think there&#39;s <em>something</em> to all of this.</p>

<p>But the one thing that has never been proven is the birth certificate actually invoking a legal strawman. Where is the law, statute, or clause which invokes this into reality? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to have one person explain, legally, how this happens. And I&#39;m still waiting.</p>

<p>From what I understand, it happened under the creation of the FED (1913, unconstitutional and illegal entity) and social security, along with income tax. I&#39;m not a lawyer and have not gone far down this rabbit hole, but as you&#39;ve said, I too think there is something to it. I&#39;m still learning though, and there are experts looking into it.

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to ask a question about the whole sovereign citizen thing I only know from what I read from this post and know very little about how law works in courts. So did David&#39;s Hall defense or arguement in court not work because it does&#39;nt apply to him in a post 1913 court and only work in a pre 1913 court before the creation of the FED or did it not work because he already appeared in court and in doing so he is representing both himself and the name in his birth certificate? Do I have to be a lawyer to truly understand how this works? Is it even something you can do in court or just something that definentely not even considered a legal arguement if that is the right term. I&#39;m totally confused on it but wondering if there is any truth to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those downvoting, let me add: it&#39;s total gibberish. It&#39;s hogwash. It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how many YouTube videos and blog posts there are that repeat this nonsense. There is no correspondence between the reality of the law and what these people are saying.</p>

<p>If you try these arguments in a court of law, <a href="http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/3/338.full.pdf">the judge may order a psychiatric examination (PDF)</a> to find out if you&#39;re competent to stand trial or to act as your own attorney. Many of these arguments sound like the ramblings of schizophrenics. The judges in Marion County, Indiana were unprepared for dealing with these arguments, since you don&#39;t learn about them in law school. The arguments are not taught in law school <em>because they&#39;re imaginary</em>.</p>

<p>Then the judge can hold you in <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-26/news/chi-sovereign-citizen-gets-180-days-in-jail-for-contempt-of-court-20131126_1_sovereign-citizen-court-orders-federal-court">contempt of court and put you in jail</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He told the judge that his understanding of the legal system was based on “common law,” which he said superseded the local court authority. But his legal reasoning failed to move Gunnarsson. The judge told Sperlazzo that the court system’s rules differ from “the courtroom in your head.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fun fact: after you have served your sentence, if you persist in trying to ignore the law, they can hold you in contempt <em>again</em>.</p>

<p>If you try these arguments with the IRS, they can fine you for making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frivolous_litigation#Court_treatment_of_frivolous_arguments">frivolous legal arguments</a>. This is on top of any other penalties.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/The-Truth-About-Frivolous-Tax-Arguments-Section-I-D-to-E#anch_83">Here&#39;s a section on the IRS web site</a> that deals with &quot;straw men&quot; and &quot;redeeming&quot; birth certificates. Note that people have been convicted and locked in prison for trying this.</p>

<p>You may as well wave a wand and yell <em>expecto patronum</em>. That works just as well.</p>

<p>They first off state in court that they are representing the persona &quot;in trust&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>The guy at the party was a so-called Sovereign Citizen. There is actually a subreddit dedicated to it (from a critical perspective:) r/amibeingdetained</p>

<p>As far as I can tell it&#39;s 99.9% complete BS. Sov Cit gurus go around the country getting paid to give seminars to teach people how to do this. It&#39;s a racket. The problem is that so many people believe them and buy into it, because they make it sound so convincing. One of the things they do is to quote something from an old law way out of context and then twist it into some warped interpretation of the law that is not recognized anywhere by anyone, least of all the courts. </p>

<p>They cause a lot of problems, though, because as soon as the law starts messing with them, they file a bunch of liens and lawsuits, which although having no basis in reality still have to be dealt with. And they&#39;re getting violent. </p>

<p>There was a Canadian judge who took the trouble to go through and <em>completely eviscerate</em> many of the legal arguments of a sovereign citizen who appeared in his court. If you look through r/amibeingdetained subreddit you should be able to find it. Or a google search. It&#39;s not just that their legal interpretations aren&#39;t accepted by current jurisprudence -- it just doesn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever. Like the idea that they can be forced or tricked into a contract or that they can force other people into a contract. Contracts don&#39;t work like that. They never have and they never will. </p>

<p>PLEASE do not listen to this nonsense. And you know what? Let&#39;s say they&#39;re right. Well, go look at the videos on that subreddit to see how they are treated by everyone else who thinks they&#39;re wrong. There really is no point to trying to live your life like that. </p>

<p>You know, it can be said that people who haven&#39;t &#39;woken up&#39; and are still living in the &#39;matrix&#39; have their heads shoved up their asses. But, after removing one&#39;s head from one&#39;s anus and standing up to see the light, it&#39;s a little too easy to bend around in the other direction and shove your own head back up your ass. Be careful out there!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people do you actually know that are sovereign citizens? </p>

<p>There is something to this system, and as you go into the origins, etymology and how these laws are applied there is something to it.  I know a few people who are doing some interesting things and have gotten some interesting results.  One thing I have seen firsthand is a canadian government issued cheque for 35 million tax credits.  How this is even used I have no idea - but the person who did it has been trying to crack the case for many years.  He has made some progress as have a few members of his &quot;group&quot; who all share their findings with each other.  </p>

<p>Now, that being said, I will be the first to admit that I don&#39;t know how or what they are doing specifically other then first notarizing there birth certificates (long and short form) and reclaiming that they are the trustees or guarantors (I&#39;m not sure which) of this &quot;property&quot;.  </p>

<p>The have gone into the back channels of the Canadian Revenue Service and other government departments and had some very interesting things happen, such as attorney generals showing up when one of them killed their sin (SSI) number.  If I had some money and a film crew I would love to really dig into what these people are doing.</p>

<p>I will add this.  All these people have experienced EXTREME difficulty and this process is convoluted, labyrinthine and uncharted.  However I do believe that we volunteer into this system, or are in essence coerced to do so via our parents at our time of birth.</p>

<p>It is a fascinating topic, and I could talk about it all day.  However I don;t have the time or resources to delve to deep other then watch a few vids and read the odd blurb here and there.  The guy I talked to BTW is a business man who runs a 5 mil a year company, so he isn&#39;t a dummy.  Other members in his group are also respected professionals.</p>

<p>No, you saw firsthand what someone <em>told you</em> was a gov&#39;t issued cheque for 35 million tax credits. And frankly, if that were possible, then why wouldn&#39;t you drop everything and go get yourself that 35 million tax credit? Frankly I don&#39;t think you should believe anything anyone tells you, especially someone telling you that you can &#39;get rich quick&#39; by following certain steps. I am not surprised that the guy you talked to is pulling in 5 million/year -- just look at what he&#39;s able to convince people of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummm. No.</p>

<p>I SAW THE CHECK.  Man, seriously dude.  I saw the cheque, printed on what every cheque I have ever recieved looked like.  Here is an example of what it looks like.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/dead-soldier-gets-1-cent-cheque-from-federal-government-1.2559809">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/dead-soldier-gets-1-cent-cheque-from-federal-government-1.2559809</a></p>

<p>And second, you have ZERO idea who this person is, you are the one making assumptions.  Your opinion here is more a reflection of your view of the world other than any actual fact.  Honestly, I am posting this because I have SEEN the check.  I too doubted, and am always needing proof before I change my belief.  When I saw the check, I was like WTF???  </p>

<p>Whether people want to believe me or not, that&#39;s fine.  The thing is, it was not a check he can cash... he has  not figured out how to change credits into cash.  All I am saying is that the government issued this check, which means he did something that forced the government to respond by issuing it.</p>

<p>Please daddie_o, be wary of how you present data.  I can get mad and just call you a troll here, but I am going to tell you straight up that I have seen this.  I have no reason to lie, and neither does this person (who is dedicated to the betterment of the world).</p>

<p>This is a Canadian guy, but it&#39;s the same system everywhere.  </p>

<p>I know some people that have taken this very, very far.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll add this one last thing.  The more you are responsible for yourself, and understanding who you are (infinite consciousness) the more power you will have.  The system is therefore a creation of consciousness - it&#39;s ALL VOLUNTARY.  </p>

<p>You know how you will just accept installing an app on your phone or signing something without reading it... you are VOLUNTEERING without being responsible.  Anyways I could easily go into a huge rant, but I&#39;ll end with this, when you realize that you are connected to the creation of this system, you can also realize you are part of creating the next algorithm.  Put your energy into yourself.  Shut off the TV and go do something else.. this system doesn&#39;t exist when you are deep nature or meditation.   </p>
