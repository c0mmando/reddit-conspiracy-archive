       <strong>
        EDIT 2
       </strong>
       : downvote all you want, I. DON'T. CARE.
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . So the FDA has just launched a massive regulatory assault against CBDs by invoking the most insane logic you've ever heard. Here's how it goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) CBDs work so well that drug companies are now investigating them to be approved by the FDA as medicines.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Because CBDs are being investigated by drug companies, the FDA has granted CBDs status as being "investigated as a new drug." In the FDA's own language from their website, "FDA considers a substance to be 'authorized for investigation as a new drug' if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect."
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <em>
        Because CBDs work so well
       </em>
       and have been authorized for drug investigations, the FDA now OUTLAWS them being sold as dietary supplements. Per the FDA's own website:
       <em>
        "FDA has concluded that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement
       </em>
       definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&amp;C Act. Under that provision, if a substance (such as cannabidiol) has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement."
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Now the FDA has begun sending warning letters to CBD makers, claiming they are in violation of FDA regulations because they are selling "adulterated products." Adulterated with what, exactly? CBDs, of course! "The debate over hemp CBD’s legal status continues after FDA sent eight warning letters to manufacturers of CBD dietary supplement and food products earlier this month," reports Nutritional Outlook. "The warning letters cite impermissible health claims used to market the products, as well as CBD’s invalid status as a dietary ingredient due to its presence in two drug applications currently under consideration."
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the FDA just handed Big Pharma an absolute monopoly over CBDs (hemp oil extract) by ridiculously claiming such natural products are "adulterated" with molecules (CBDs) that the FDA says might one day become a drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Drugs," according to the FDA, are substances that are proven to treat, prevent or cure a disease, and thus the FDA's own logic admits that CBDs must be able to treat, prevent or cure diseases, otherwise they would be useless as "drugs".
      </p>
      <p>
       But when a dietary supplement company makes the same claim, they are hit with aggressive warning letters from the FDA, threatening to shut them down, confiscate their products and seek criminal prosecution of the company executives.

       Relax people the state's which have legalized medical MJ are not about to start listening to the FDA, or Big Pharma now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the FDA possessed any authority, or power over the state's they would not have legalized med MJ, because the FDA currently has MJ classed as a Class 1 Scheduled Drug. By definition, a Schedule 1 Drugs are illegal everywhere period. They are not legally sold anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the state's have already said phooey to the FDA, I don't see them suddenly going along with this tyranny. We're gonna get through this latest outrage without any damage.

       Let's be serious here -- CBD is a cannabanoid. It is a drug. You really can't dispute this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a dietary supplement. CBD is a very well defined single molecule which acts as a drug in the human body.

       The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that before any substance can be marketed as a treatment for any disease or condition, it must undergo clinical trials that are adequately powered to evaluate its efficacy and safety, and the claims on the drug label must be evaluated and approved by the FDA.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mid-1990s Congress passed legislation for dietary supplements that allows certain naturally occurring materials to be marketed with very general health claims likes "improves immune function", so long as specific claims are not made for the treatment of any disease. Such claims require only very minimal levels of supporting evidence, and indeed the burden is on the FDA to prove them false if they want to stop manufacturers from making such claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the point behind the prohibition of selling a product as a supplement if it is in development as a drug is to provide incentive to do the clinical trials and actually prove that drugs work.  No one is going to spend that kind of money if they are going to be competing with generics from the first day they get their drug approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, no one is out there selling cannabis as some sort of general tonic.  Very explicit health claims for the treatment of specific diseases are being made based on minimal evidence and without FDA approval.  This is what is known as "off-label marketing".  Several years ago FDA fined Pfizer $3B for making unproven claims for its drug gabapentin that are very similar to the unproven claims now being made for cannabis.  So the FDA has actually been cutting the cannabis sellers quite a bit of slack relative to what they have done with other drugs historically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to Big Pharma in the title is a great way to invoke a popular villian for emotional impact, but most of the cannabis based drugs in development are from small biotechs.

        The off-label allegations are among many leveled against not only Pfizer, but almost every Big Pharma company. In addition to Pfizer's DoJ settlement involving Neurontin, the company agreed to pay $2.3 billion
        <strong>
         to resolve Justice Department allegations that it sold a variety of drugs for off-label uses

       You're rignt it was $2.3B not $3B.  It was GSK that paid $3B.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I'm not clear on what you are so upset about.  Is the fact that the FDA has been ignoring off-label cannabis marketing any less remarkable if Pfizer's off-label marketing fines were for multiple drugs and not just gabapentin?

       it's splitting hairs, as other people have pointed out, it's just not legal to call it a dietary supplement, you can still call it other things,
       <em>
        plus
       </em>
       you can get around 'CBD' specific lawas by
       <em>
        blending
       </em>
       it with tiny amounts of other cannabiniods and now it's no longer the restricted compound
      </p>
      <p>
       this is how the synthetic cannabinoids like the HU and AM series, 'bath salts/research compounds' market bypassed the legislation with minor tweaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, it wasn't $2.3B (give me a source like i gave you) And GSK lied about SSRI's not being 'habit forming'
IF you get that wrong who's to say the rest of your information isn't correct?
      </p>

       Anyway, it's an attempt by the Federal govt to get

       You are absolutely right, the 2.3 billion was (mostly) for off label marketing of Bextra. It is my understanding however that most of the GSK fine was for off label marketing.

       No offense taken. Its actually kind of refreshing to encounter someone who cares about getting the facts right. Thats not real common here

       GSK market paroxetine aka Paxil and part of their getting it passed by the FDA was to say it was "non habit forming" ... well, FF a few years after Paxil hits the market and a bunch of folks start getting 'sick' when they
       <em>

       to stop and blame GSK for lying, court case ensues,

       their drug
       <em>

       'habit forming', it's

        not

       "addictive" (lol) Nooo, these people are simply experiencing (get this) "

       LOL ... they had their lawyers argue hard for the use of that term
       <em>
        instead
       </em>
       os "withdrawal" (which they argues
       <em>

       the same thing!) pffft!

       I guess the judge didn't buy it!

       Just as bad, GS&amp;K had &gt;$10BIL stashed for "contingencies"
       <em>
        just like

       this. Have you ever seen Fight Club where Norton is talking about car flaws and  insurance? Where it's cheaper to just pay the people who's cars FU rather than do a recall?

       I thought I'd pull you up on that to see your response, which showed me it was an honest mistake and so I won't include you with the numptys who as you say, are prevalent in this sub

       although the airforce wankers shills who work at Elgin airbase spamming subs like this are common, I don't think (hope) you're not of them ;D
