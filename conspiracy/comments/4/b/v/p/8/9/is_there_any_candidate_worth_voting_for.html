       I've been down the rabbit hole for a few years now, and I pretty much over-analyze everything I read and have a lot of trouble believing anything I read in news/politics anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to believe Trump was change, but now I am 50/50 on him; I am half for him, because on the surface he is saying everything that I want to hear and he seems to be the only rational person in the race.
The other half believes he is being granted permission to say these things, to promise us things that the people in power would never want to happen (9/11 papers, federal reserve audit) so the crowd that has been debunking every hoax they've come up with for the past few decades will vote for him under the premise that Trump is actually almost 'one of us'; But then when/if he gets elected, it turns out he is merely a player on the same team as the rest of them.
I just don't even really know what to think anymore. 
At this point, the only candidate I see worth voting for is Trump because I mean at least it's a 50/50 shot at him being true to us as opposed to absolutely getting fucked if Hillary or Bernie gets in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Guys I know our vote is worthless, I just like to believe there is that super slim chance that it &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; this time. Between Electoral College, Super Delegates, lack of 40(b) , I mean there isn't much chance in hell that our votes will mean shit. Hell, every state that Hillary won has reported voter fraud and not a damn thing is being done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Not sure why thread became a massive argument. Reddit is as bad as Tumblr I see. Nvm, I'll go to a more mature community.

       You can vote for him, and I could see why. But we all must ask our selves, does voting matter? I think not. Methinks we should protest the system. Self rule is the only way. We need to restore our roots... Don't vote, or vote no confidence. May get heat, but this is the only way (I see).

       They see no one voting and do whatever the hell they want - no one votes now, and they do whatever the hell they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Gary Johnson or Jill Stein or someone suddenly won the popular vote, they'd be forced to give lip service to stopping their own corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is, no one gives a fuck about their corruption, so they don't give lip service to it, and we get people like Hillary Clinton in charge and an administration that's got the smallest number of government corruption cases (despite the rampant corruption) in 30 years...

       I think Bernie is the best candidate by a mile. He may not be perfect, but he is far better than the other corrupt or incompetent fools paraded before us. I take issue with some of Bernie's policies, but Trump is a non-starter candidate. Build a wall and Mexico pay for it? Seriously?

       Based on? This is one of the rare times a legit outsider could hold power. Like I said, he isn't perfect by any means. However, he is the best we have this election cycle. Both Trump and Bernie buck the traditional trends, but Bernie makes far more sense.

       Illegals in this country cost us 100 billion per year. The Wall
       <strong>

       cost only 10 billion, but even in your delusional fantasy land deporting them would cover the costs, AND THAT’S EVEN WITHOUT HAVING MEXICO PAY A TIN SHILLING, which they will.

       You guys in the US are pretty much fucked either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd vote Sanders probably just because I dig our health care up here and if you guys had it, you'd probably really like it. Rich people probably wouldn't like it but fuck those guys.

      <p>
       Cruz, not even an option. The guys a retard.

       Clinton, not a chance. She's so in bed with big money her ass is green.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump. This guy goes to show just how much of a sham the US political system is. The guy's a pandering asshole, representative of the upper class, and a raging xenophobic shit disturber. All the shit he says is absolutely psychotic even worse than Bush jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think the entire thing is rigged. On one side, you have billionaires like the Koch bros manipulating the right. On the other side, you have guys like Soros manipulating the left. Both sides have been doing this shit for years to subversively take over lower &amp; middle class activists on both sides of your system.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no middle ground. Because of the influence of corporate backed partisan spinners, it's created a massive wedge between US voters that really only benefits the upper class because everyone else is too busy fighting over stupid shit.

       That's not how that works. We actually spend less on healthcare per capita than the US because our costs are lowered. You sound like a conservative so I'm sure you can understand fiscal economics and the need to keep prices low.

       I'm not really big on multiculturalism but I do like the diversity somewhat. I know some really nice Muslims and they aren't all scary and shit. Once you get past all that crap and just accept that people have different beliefs you can put all that shit aside and work towards better goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more a fan of integration or assimilation. If someone moves here, I expect them to put their old world bullshit behind them and just be Canadians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I live, there's lot of white people, black people, brown people, you name it. One thing I really hate though is that our immigration policies lately tend to push against integration. Someone new comes here, and the immigration office hooks them up with someone from their cultural background so they wind up moving closer to people who share their same old world culture. That sucks to me because that's when people get isolated and don't really try to become Canadians. It's not really a big problem but it does have that potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, people are fairly chill though and most of the hostility comes from people who jump on that anti immigrant bandwagon.
