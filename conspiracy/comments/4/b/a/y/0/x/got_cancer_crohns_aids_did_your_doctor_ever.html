<p>I found that Selenium is a godsend for cancer.  So I have to wonder why people don&#39;t know this?  For people not in clinical trials, they should be getting recommendations to take selenium in addition to their treatment. To my knowledge (father is an oncologist) they are not. Selenium taken as stated on the bottle can in no way hurt them.  It could however potentially greatly reverse the disease, according to NIH:</p>

</ul>

<p>It&#39;s possible that selenium has such an effect on cancer because of it&#39;s role in the body&#39;s production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase">glutathione peroxidase</a>, which is a powerful antioxidant selenoenzyme with a specific role in the immune system.  It&#39;s reasonable to postulate that increasing this necessary mineral then boosts the immune system.  This boost in turn enables the immune system to better fight cancer.  Since that is what it does (we get cancer randomly all the time but the body eliminates it).</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>AIDS</strong></p>

<p>I found out about the role of Selenium from a friend who has AIDS who told me about a &quot;Glutathione Peroxidase Stack&quot; consisting of <strong>selenium, glutamine, cysteine and tryptophan</strong> in 2007.  I later read that this stack reversed <em>AIDS</em> in <em>99%</em> of patients in an african study published on NIH. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050105">[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050105]</a>.  The study states, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Any treatment for HIV/AIDS must, therefore, include normalization of body levels of <strong><em>glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, selenium, cysteine, glutamine, and tryptophan</em></strong>. Although various clinical trials have improved the health of AIDS patients by correcting one or more of these nutritional deficiencies, they have not, until the present, been addressed together. Physicians involved in a selenium and amino-acid field trial in Botswana, however, are reporting that this nutritional protocol reverses AIDS in 99% of patients receiving it, usually within three weeks.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s without question that this stack is helpful for the immune system generally, so anyone with an illness other than an autoimmune disease would benefit from it, especially cancer--one of the many diseases that progresses with AIDS patients (caposi sarcoma)</p>

<p><strong>Crohn&#39;s</strong></p>

<p>Now I found some other things out about Selenium.  That is has a role to play in Crohn&#39;s and IBD also.  Rather, a lack of selenium leads to Crohns, or there&#39;s a genetic problem with making glutathione peroxidase, but there&#39;s not enough evidence here to suggest that if you reverse the deficiency you would reverse Crohns, although that&#39;s somewhat implied from what I can tell (see &#39;comprehensive nutritional status...&#39;)</p>

<p><strong>This is not medical advice, this is nutritional advice</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s illegal for me, a non-physician to give medical advice, so I&#39;m not.  However I can say that if I had Cancer or AIDS or Crohn&#39;s it would not even be a question that I&#39;d be running to the Whole Foods and getting all 3 forms of selenium and those amino acids and taking a 100 dollar gamble on the possibility that my maladies are the product of <em>a nutritional deficiency.</em></p>

<p>So.  Yeah.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Speculations</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the way we grow food now causes a depletion or absence of natural selenium in our food.  After all, if we till the soil and reuse it again and again and don&#39;t put that selenium back into the soil, it&#39;s eventually going to be packed up and shipped out (in the first couple of years&#39; carrots for example).  Our fertilizers are usually just 3 chemicals, but some sensible farmers also throw minerals back into the soil but it&#39;s usually rock phosphate and rock dust.  If the rock dust is sourced in a selenium-scarce quarry, well there won&#39;t be any selenium put back into the soil.</p>

<p>Over time, it&#39;s depleted of selenium.  Selenium is probably a minor mineral to the plant, or its needed in small quanitites but uptaken in larger quanities and bioaccumulated without harm to the plant itself.  Or it could be the fact that selenium is actually toxic at high amounts and can be very dangerous to humans that it&#39;s specifically omitted from remineralization soil amendments for fear of &#39;dumb farmers&#39; using too much and creating toxified, dangerous food.  It&#39;s unclear.</p>

<p>But I posit that we should look at our produce and if we want to get to the bottom of this biz, we&#39;ll start assaying grocery store vegetables for selenium and I believe we will find they have been wholly depleted of selenium.  Which means you&#39;re just going to have to include brazil nuts into your diet at some point, or sesame seeds.  Or take a supplement.</p>

<p>Executive Intelligence Review (EIR), Larouche publishing, knew about this selenium AIDS connection back in 1995.  Damn.  I need to read more intelligent things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome.  Yes it&#39;s important to note that Selenium is a godsend but also toxic.  It&#39;s dose dependent, any more than 600ug / day is harmful.  Like dejenerate said, you can&#39;t be eating lots of brazil nuts or you can bioaccumulate too much selenium to toxic levels.  Brazil nuts are a food that is the highest in selenium to our knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  But you know what happens when I post in other subs?</p>

<p>Downvoted immediately to 0.  People would rather die of cancer getting &#39;official&#39; authoritative advice than taking charge of their own health by taking responsibility for what they know and believe.</p>

<p>Two accounts ago, I was actually was banned from <a href="/r/hivaids">/r/hivaids</a> by the mods from posting this information there.  The reason was they perceived it as giving medical advice.  I&#39;m sure a lot of people with AIDS died because of their censorship.</p>

<p>I can tell you I know people with AIDS and they are a group of people who have a very distinct commonality: they distrust the medical community and are willing to experiment on themselves.  That&#39;s why you see things like DMSO, electromedicine, laetril/b17/amygdalin/apricot kernels and such crop up in that community more than any other place. It&#39;s full of doubters.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason for that.</p>

<p>First of all, there&#39;s a new medicine that comes out in 2002, and they tell you it should keep you alive and healthy for 40 yrs.  How do they know that?  No one has been alive for 40 yrs that has taken a new medicine that came out in 2002.  They respond, &quot;well duh, those are mathematical projections&quot;.  Yes, like how 20 yr warranties always work, or projected lifespans of products always pan out in the real world...haha.</p>

<p>My point is this: they are lyin&#39; to ya.  All the time.  They understate the &#39;problems&#39; with the medicine itself.  Those medicines can cause cardio / cerebrovascular problems in and of themselves as well as autoimmune disesase (yes, people with hiv can have autoimmune disease also--arthritis, gastro problems and fibromyalgia is nearly universal among hiv patients taking HAART therapy).   A most-often prescribed drug cocktail pill (3 in one) called &#39;Atripla&#39; contains sustiva which a low-grade psychedelic dissociative deppressant, that&#39;s why it&#39;s stolen off the back of trucks in southern africa, crushed and mixed with marijuana and god-knows-what from CVS and freebased in the drug &#39;whoonga&#39;.  You can get high on this aids drug, but I hear it&#39;s awful (see the VICE episode on it).  People who take atripla at night with fatty foods turn into mental zombies and then they have extremely vivid and sometimes terrifying dreams that are much like an amanita muscaria trip, which exploit unconscious fears at the core of ones being.  Over time, they may develop stroke or seizure, which they blame on hiv infection itself, even though those on haart have the undetectable viral load (ie: virus is under controll by drugs/immune system). There&#39;s at least 3 studies that confirm the adverse effects of haart, and here is one:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3610259/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3610259/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs (DAD) Study found a significantly elevated risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, beyond what was anticipated for the increasing age of their cohort  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cART may increase the risk for stroke and heart disease [d’Arminio et al. 2004; Worm et al. 2010; Rasmussen et al. 2011]. It is likely that the risk of stroke is also influenced by the stage of disease at which cART is initiated [Subsai et al. 2006], treatment duration [d’Arminio et al. 2004; Worm et al. 2012] and other factors. Cardiovascular disease in HIV+ has been associated with a low nadir (lowest ever) CD4+ count [Ho et al. 2012], but no studies have examined the relationship of nadir CD4+ to stroke. Hypothetically, a successful cART regimen that lowers viral load and increases CD4+ should reduce the likelihood of stroke associated with opportunistic infections. Conversely, a cART regimen that significantly increases lifespan may increase the risk for stroke because of prolonged exposure to HIV-1, cART-related, and age-related risk factors. Bozzette and colleagues reported that cART reduced overall mortality from all causes, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [Bozzette et al. 2003]. However, his cohort was treated for a mean duration of less than 2 years [Bozzette et al. 2003]. Corral and colleagues reported that a shorter duration of cART was associated with more vascular complications [Corral et al. 2009]. In contrast, the DAD: study reported that prolonged use (6 years) of cART was associated with more cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease than would be expected by aging alone [d’Arminio et al. 2004].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to take the [5] out of your long list, as it says the opposite of what you claim.</p>

<p><em>To date, there is no convincing evidence that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in men, women or children.</em></p>

<p>Same with [6]. It only says Se may be helpful in preventing cancer BEFORE you get it. Nothing about using it as a treatment after you have cancer.</p>

<p>Edit: As I read further, almost all your scientific links say Se can lower your cancer risk. They don&#39;t say it helps when you already have cancer. Your headline is misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s actually good you said that.  It means that people with crohns aren&#39;t absorbing selenium and that&#39;s why they are deficient.  It means there&#39;s been severely altered with their gut flora or their metabolism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People with Crohn&#39;s have difficulty with vitamin and mineral absorption in general, due to the inflammatory changes in their GI system. If the <a href="http://nutrihanna.blogspot.com/2011/05/how-does-selenium-digestabsorb-and.html">areas of the body</a> where selenium is absorbed are damaged or removed (particularly the ileum, which is the most common site for Crohn&#39;s disease), the patient will naturally be deficient in it and increasing the amount of oral supplementation will not necessarily help. A correlation between being deficient in B12, D, iron have also been found with Crohn&#39;s for the same reason but to say that it is causative is a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good point. One that my dad pointed out to me also.  They&#39;d have to have IV of selenium, but here&#39;s the the thing: those bags that are hooked up to my friends arm (severe crohns -- hospitable) are basically sugar water with a multivitamin in it and this may contain only miniscule amounts of selenium.  I&#39;m judging that based on the flintstones, regular centrum and old people centrum multivitamin which doesn&#39;t contain anything near the recommended DV of 200mcg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not entirely understanidng why you&#39;re equating a Flintstones vitamin to a hospital IV.</p>

<p>Also selenium supposedly boosts the immune system. Since Crohn&#39;s is currently classified as auto-immune, wouldn&#39;t immune boosting be counter-intuitive? It&#39;s why the immune suppressing medications Crohn&#39;s sufferers take work to quell symptoms.</p>

<p>And anecdotally, I used to take daily selenium pills (and vitamin E) for years after I read Dr. Weil recommended them. This was prior to my own Crohn&#39;s diagnosis -- how come the selenium pills didn&#39;t save me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because you&#39;re not absorbing the selenium for some reason.  Whether you take it or not.  It&#39;s a deficiency not caused by not taking but by not absorbing it.  It&#39;s possible there&#39;s something wrong with the gut flora if that is what causes absorption of selenium or theres some other metabolic anomaly that inhibits your absorption of selenium.</p>

<p>The studies show that people with crohn&#39;s have selenium deficiencies, but one can assume that they ate normally like evyerone else so shouldn&#39;t have deficiencies.  </p>

<p>The epistemological imaginings were more of a shower thought...why people would start getting crohns and cancer in droves compared to the 60s when they didn&#39;t.  If it&#39;s not a nutrition problem, then maybe its a gmo / glyphosate problem altering gut flora to the extent it causes malabsorption of necessary minerals.</p>

<p>I would start researching in that area...crohns related to gmos</p>

<p>OH this is important.  I told my friend this but it was a no go for some reason.  They are starting to treat crohns with fecal transplants for exactly this reason--to restore normal gut flora.  You just have to be mature about it and man up, otherwise you may die, like my friend most certainly will because he and his family are too cowardly to try more extreme ideas even after 2 years of failure from traditional allopaths and many hospitalizations...that are sending the family to the poor house.  Sorry if that&#39;s rude, but their extreme authoritarianism and cowardice is going to kill my friend.  Oh well.  Don&#39;t be a fool.  If something&#39;s not working, try something different.  It&#39;s how you get through a zelda game, it&#39;s how you get through life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome.  Yes it&#39;s important to note that Selenium is a godsend but also toxic.  It&#39;s dose dependent, any more than 600ug / day is harmful.  Like dejenerate said, you can&#39;t be eating lots of brazil nuts or you can bioaccumulate too much selenium to toxic levels.  Brazil nuts are a food that is the highest in selenium to our knowledge.</p>
