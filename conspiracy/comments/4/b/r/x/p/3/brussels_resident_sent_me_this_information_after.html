<p>&quot;To start with  no media so far  has been allowed to go in at the airport or at the metro station.  The excuse being « afraid to contaminate the sites before they gather all infos »
Every medias even the Belgian  are not allow to go near the sites. They are kept far away from the places where it happen.   They are kept away  by the police and the military.   So I have been wandering where they get they footage and pictures ?  I noticed right from the start that it was a fake video, i know very well the airport and the  Maelbeek metro station.  And it didn’t look like the palaces I knew..
 Also my question was « why the Kamikaze blew himself after the European Parliment » according to what they said that the metro was heading towards Arts-Loi so the line must have passed the parliment station which is named Schuman. He will have made more casulaties blowing there  but  he waited for the Maelbeek station ?( Maelbeek station is after schuman station).
They also said stuff that contradict each other when they  interviewed  the person arranging the rescue. He  made few mistakes and rambled. He even said «  it all happen like in the rehearsal » I couldn’t believe hearing it.
 I watched yesterday a broadcasting made just after they capture Salah, the so call nr 1 criminal. The politics in charge were saying that they were expecting attacks and were comparing it already  to the before and after 9/11 and all this before it happen&quot;</p>

<p>Anything to do with ISIS will be a false flag event because they have been created and supported by the US Military Industrial Complex / The Greater Israel Project / World Bankers.</p>

<p>There is no way ISIS members have the money, supplies and technical intelligence to pull off these European attacks on their own completely undetected.</p>

<p>I mean really, you can replace ISIS with ISIL or al-Qaeda or Taliban or ... etc... and apply the same logic. They have ALL been armed and funded by outside sources for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this before. It&#39;s a very interesting subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In various entries in his unpublished diaries, British Mesopotamian officer Harry St. John Philby, on special mission to central Arabia during 1917-1918, recorded the minutes of his many private “interviews” with Ibn Saud. He concluded that the newly re-emerging Wahhabi movement under Ibn Saud would, with British political and military support, effectively serve British military and political objectives in the Arabian Peninsula and beyond during the ongoing war and in its aftermath. Three decades later, with British power receding and the United States ascendant in the Middle East, a new patron-client relationship was forged between the West and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. “Our faith and your iron” was how Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, described in 1946 the new post-WWII American-Saudi client relationship in a conversation with Colonel William A. Eddy, the first US Minister to the Kingdom. This relationship remains intact — despite, or perhaps because of, the rise of Salafist militancy that US and Saudi policies purposefully and unwittingly nurtured.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you have to ask yourself, do you prefer the comforting lie that there are really horrible terrorists who would murder 30+ innocent people for no reason whatsoever or would you prefer to believe that the world is awakening in consciousness and the only true evil is the greedy assholes who want to sell weapons and control us and take away our rights so they can stay in power.

    <div class="md"><p>See, I would prefer to believe that some random extremists would attack and kill 30+ people. Why? Well first off, if you want to cause a serious death toll, there are many better ways to do it. So these guys are stupid. Plus, the ones who blow themselves up are now dead, so we don&#39;t have to fear them anymore.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s not a terribly threatening scenario. But the elites want to minimize EVERYBODY&#39;S rights, and not just harm 25 people here, 75 people there, 150 over there every couple of years. That, to me, is a lot more scary, and is the main reason it took me as long as it did to acknowledge the contemporary harsh realities. So many people accuse me of preferring to believe in conspiracy, but why would I?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem I have with the theory that this isn&#39;t done by muslims...is that muslims have tried to overrun Europe for the past 1000 years or so, plus it is islam&#39;s goal to make the whole world islamic. 
So have muslims suddenly turned all hippy and have given up with those plans?
They may have some &#39;help&#39; from &#39;someone else&#39; but I am confident that deep down they are doing what they believe is the right thing [going by the koran].</p>
